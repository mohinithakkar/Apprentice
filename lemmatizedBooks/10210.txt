before the governor wolf of the sea chapter i send into servitude know this to be a narrative of unusual adventure and one which may never even be read until long after i have depart from this world when it will be difficult to convince reader that such time as be herein depict could ever have be reality i shall endeavor to narrate each incident in the simplest manner possible my only purpose be truth and my only witness history yet even now lately as this all happen it be more like the recollection of a dream dimly remember at awakening and perchance might remain so but for the scar upon my body and the constant memory of a woman 's face these alone combine to bring back in vividness those day that be -- day of youth and daring of desperate lawless war of wide ocean peril and the outstretched hand of love so that here where i be write it all down here amid quietness and peace and forgetful of the past i wander again along a desert shore and sail among those isle of a southern sea the home for many a century of crime and unspeakable cruelty i will recall the truth and can do no more i can recall that far-away dawn now as the opening portal of a beautiful morning although at the time my thought be so closely center upon other thing the deep blue of the sky and the glimmer gold of the sun scarcely leave a impression on my mind it be still early morning when we be bring out under heavy guard and march somberly forth through the open gate of the gaol there have be rain during the night and the cobble-stone of the village street be dark with moisture slip under we hob-nailed shoe as we stumble along down the sharp incline lead to the wharf ahead we could perceive a forest of mast and what seem like a vast crowd of wait people only the murmur of voice greet we as we emerge tell that this gathering be not a hostile one and this truth be emphasize to we mind by the effort of the guard to hasten we passage that we have be sentence to exile to prolonged servitude in some foreign land be all that any of we know -- to what special section of the world fate have allot we remain unknown in spite of curse and a occasional blow we advance slowly march four abreast with foot drag heavily the chain bind we together clank dismally with each step and a armed guard between each file experience have be many since then yet i recall as though it be but yesterday the face of those who walk in line with I i be at the right end of my file and at my shoulder be a boy from morrownest a slim white-faced lad he weak chin tremble from fear and he eye stare about so pleadingly i speak a word of courage to he whisper in he ear lest the guard behind might strike he glance aside at I but with no response in the depths of he eye in which i could perceive only a dumb anguish of despair beyond he march grover one time butcher at harwich a stocky big-fisted fellow with a ghastly sword wound yet red and unheal on he face extend from hair to chin he little pig eye glint ugly and he lip cursing the man beyond be a soldier a straight athletic fellow with crinkly black beard who keep he eye front pay no heed to the cry the guard press the people back as we shuffle along but there be no way of keep they still i hear cry of encouragement shout of recognition sob of pity and occasionally a roar of anger as we pass good lad god be with yer thet one thar be sore hurt -- it be a damn shame thar 's teddy -- poor laddie luck go with yer teddy ter hell with black jeffry say i hush mon er ye 'll be next ter go -- no i do not know who sed it see thet little chap joe lot ther lad bed ter do with the war they all look mighty peaked -- poor devil four month in gaol stand back there now stand back the guard prod they savagely with the butt of they musketoon thus make scant room for we to shuffle through out upon the far end of the wharf where we be finally halt abreast of a lump brig apparently nearly ready for sea there be more than forty of we as i count the fellow and we be round up at the extremity of the wharf in the full blaze of the sun with a line of guard stretch across to hold back the crowd until preparation have be complete to admit we aboard as those in front fling themselves down on the plank i get view of the brig 's gangway along which man be still busily haul belated box and barrel and beyond these gain glimpse of the hooker 's name -- romp betsy of plymouth a moment later a sailor pass along the edge of the dock drag a coil of rope after he and must have answer some hail on he way for instantly a whisper pass swiftly from man to man it be virginia mate we be bind fer virginia the ugly little pig eye of the butcher meet mine virginium hey he grunt ye be a sailorman be not ye mate well then whar be this yere virginium the boy be look at I also questioningly the terror in he face by no means lessen at the sound of this strange word yes sir please where be it sir i pat he on the shoulder as other near by lean forward to catch my answer that be all right mate i return cheerfully it be across the blue water of course but better than the indy we 'll fall into the hand of englishman out there and they 'll be decent to we but whar be the bloomin ' hole in america that be where all the tobacco come from likely that will be we job -- raise tobacco have ever yer bin thar ay twice -- and to a land beyond they call maryland ti a country not so unlike england good luck that then tell we about it matie i endeavor to do so dwelling upon what i remember of the settlement and the habit of the people but say little of the great wilderness of the interior or how i have see slave toiling in the field the group of man within range of my voice lean forward in breathless attention one now and then ask a question they chain rattle with each movement of a body the deep interest show in they face cause I unconsciously to elevate my voice and i have speak but a moment or two before a hard hand grip my shoulder yer better stow that my man growl someone above I and i look up into the stern eye of the captain of the guard or it may be the ` cat ' for ye yer hear the order yes sir i be only answer question question what the hell difference do it make to this scum whar they go do yer talkin ' aboard not here so ye have be ter the virginia plantation hev ye twice sir as a sailor in command of vessel he eye soften

fer ye now fall in there -- all of yer step along yer damn rebel scum we pass aboard over the narrow gang-plank four abreast drag we foot and be halt on the forward deck while artificer remove we chain as these be knock off the release prisoner disappear one by one down the forward hatch into the space between the deck which have be roughly fit up for they confinement during the long voyage as my position be in one of the last file i have ample time in which to gaze about and take note of my surroundings except for the presence of the prisoner the deck present no unusual scene the _ romp betsy _ be a large full-rigged brig not overly clean and have evidently be in commission for some time not heavily loaded she ride high and be a broad-nosed vessel with comfortable beam i know she at once as a slow sailor and bind to develop a decidedly disagreeable roll in any considerable sea she be heavily spar and to my eye she canvas appear unduly weather-beaten and rotten indeed there be unnecessary clutter aloft and a amount of litter about the deck which evidence lack of seamanship nor do the general appearance of such stray member of the crew as meet my notice add appreciably to my confidence in the voyage i stare aft at the poop deck seek to gain glimpse of the skipper but be unable to determine he presence among the other there be a number of person gather along the low rail attract by the unusual spectacle and curiously watch we be herd aboard and dispatch below but to judge from they appearance these be probably all passenger -- some of they adventurer seek the new land on they first voyage although among they i see other easily recognize as virginian on they way home among these i pick out a planter or two prosperous and noisy man who have just dispose of they tobacco crop well satisfy with the return some artisan sailing on contract and a naval officer in uniform then my eye encounter a strange group foregather beside the lee rail there be four in the little party but one of these be a negress red-turbaned and black as the ace of spade a servant evidently stand in silence behind the other another be clearly enough a colonial proprietor a heavily build man of middle age purple face and wear the broad hat with uplifted brim characteristic of virginian i pass these by with a glance my attention concentrate upon the other two -- a middle-aged young man and a young woman standing side by side the former be a dash look blade of not more than forty attire in blue slash coat ornament with gilt button and bedeck at collar and cuff with a profusion of lace a saffron color waist-coat fail to conceal he richly beruffled shirt and the hilt of a rapier be rather prominently display such dandy be frequently enough see but it be this man 's face which make marked contrast with he gay attire he be dark and hook-nosed apparently of foreign birth with black moustache tightly clip so as to reveal the thin firmness of he lip and even at that distance i could perceive the line of a scar across he chin altogether there be a audacity to he face a daring convincing I he be no mere lady 's knight but one to whom fight be a trade he be point we out to he companion apparently joke over we appearance in a endeavor to amuse seemingly she give small heed to he word for although she eye follow where he point they never once light with a smile nor do i see she answer he sally she be scarcely more than a girl dress very simply in some clinging dark stuff with a loose gray cloak drape she shoulder and a small neat bonnet of straw perch upon a mass of coiled hair the face beneath be sweetly piquant with dark eye and round cheek flush with health she stand both hand clasp the rail watch we intently i somehow feel as though she eye be upon I and within they depths even at that distance i seem to read a message of sympathy and kindness the one lasting impression she face leave on my memory be that of innocent girlhood dignified by a womanly tenderness what be those two to each other i could not guess for they seem from two utterly different world not brother and sister surely and not lover the last be unthinkable perhaps mere chance acquaintance who have drift together since come aboard it seem strange that at such a moment my attention should have thus center on these two yet i think now that either one would have awaken my interest wherever we have meet instinctively i dislike the man aware of a instant antagonism realize that he be evil while he companion come to I as revealment of all that be true and worthy in a degree i have never know before i could not banish either from my mind for month i have be in prison expect a death sentence much of the time pass in solitary confinement and now with that cloud lift i have come forth into a fresh existence only to be confront by this man and woman represent exact opposite they peculiarity take immediate possession of a mind entirely unoccupied nor do i make any effort to banish they from my think from the instant i look upon these two i feel convinced that through some strange vagary of fate we be destine to know more of each other that we life line be ordain to touch and become entangled somewhere in that mystery of the western world to which i have be condemn i can not analyze this conception but merely record its presence the thought take firm possession of I under the circumstance i be too far away to overhear conversation the shuffling of foot the rattle of chain the harsh voice of the guard make it impossible to distinguish any word pass between the two i could only watch they quickly assure that i have likewise attract the girl 's attention and that she gaze occasionally seek mine then the guard come to I and with my limb free of fetter i be pass down the steep ladder into the semi-darkness between deck where we be to be confine the haunting memory of she face accompany I below already so clearly define as to be unforgettable it prove a dismal crowded hole in which we be quarter like so many cattle it be merely a small space forward hastily box off by rough lumber the side and end build up into tier of bunk the only ventilation and light furnished by the open hatch above the place be clean enough be newly fit for the purpose but be totally devoid of furnishings the only concession to comfort visible be a handful of fresh straw in each bunk the man herd and drive down the ladder be crowd into the central space the majority still on they foot but a few squat dejectedly on the deck in the dim twilight of that bare interior they face scarcely appear natural and they converse in undertone most of the fellow be sober and silent not a bad lot to my judgment with only here and there a countenance exhibit viciousness or a tongue give to ribaldry i could remember see but few of they before yet as i observe they more closely now realize that these be not criminal be punish for crime but man catch as i have be and condemn without fair trial through the lie of pay informer i could even read in they action and word the simple story of they former life -- the farm laborer the sailor the store-keeper now all on one common level of misfortune and misery -- condemn alike to exile to servitude in a strange land beyond sea the ticket give I call by number for a certain berth and i seek until i find this throw within the small bundle i bear and then find a chance to sit down on the deck beneath the last of the bunch of prisoner dribble down the ladder each in turn noisily greet by those already huddle below i begin to recognize the increase foulness of air and to distinguish word of conversation from the group about I there be but little profanity but some rough horse-play and a marked effort to pretend indifference i could make out gray-beard and mere boy mingle together and occasionally a man in some semblance of uniform a few bear wound and the clothes of several be in rag all alike exhibit mark of suffering and hardship the butcher from harwich and the white-faced lad who have march beside I down the wharf be not to be see from where i sit although beyond doubt they be somewhere in the crowd the hatch be not lower and gaze up through the square opening i obtain glimpse of two soldier on guard the sunlight glint on they gun almost immediately there be the sound of tramp foot on the deck above and the creaking of block then a sudden movement of the hull tell all we be under way this be recognize by a roar of voice chapter ii the prison ship the greater portion of that voyage i would blot entirely from memory if possible i can not hope to describe it in any detail -- the foul smell the discomfort the ceaseless horror of food the close companionship of man turn into mere animal by suffer and distress the wearisome day the black sleepless night the poisonous air and the brutality of guard i can never forget these thing for they have scar my soul yet surely i need not dwell upon they now except as they may bear some direct reference to this tale i seek to tell as such those week can not be wholly ignore for they form a part of the event to follow -- event which might not be clearly understand without they proper picture we be fifty-three day at sea drive once so far to the southward by a severe storm which strike we the second day out as to sight the north coast of africa before we be able to resume we westward course to those of we who be tightly shut into those miserable quarter below these fact come only as float rumor yet the intense suffering involve be all real enough for forty-two hour we be batten down in darkness fling desperately about by every mad plunge of the vessel stifle by poison air and noxious odor and all that time without a particle of food if i suffer less than some other it be simply because i be more accustomed to the sea i be not nauseate by the motion nor unduly frighten by the wild pitching of the brig lie quietly in my berth brace to prevent be throw out amid a darkness so intense as to seem a weight every sound from the deck above every lift of the vessel bring to my mind a sea message convincing I of two thing -- that the _ romp betsy _ be a staunch craft and well handle terrific as the gale become i only grow more confident that she would safely weather it yet god know it be horrible enough even to lie there and listen to feel the hurl plunge downward the dizzy upsweeping of the hull to hear the cry groan and prayer of frightened man unseen and helpless in the darkness the creaking timber the resounding blow of the wave against the side the horrid retching of the sick the snarl angry voice as the struggle mass be fling back and forth the curse hurl madly into the darkness they be no longer man but infuriate brute so steep in agony and fear as to have lose all human instinct they snarl and snap like so many beast they voice unrecognizable the stronger tread the weaker to the deck i could not see i could only hear yet i lay there stare blindly about conscious of every horror and so weak and unnerved as to tremble like a child yet the complete knowledge of what have actually occur in that frightful hole be only reveal when the violence of the storm finally cease and the guard above again lift the hatch the gray light of dawn faintly illumine the inferno below and the sweet breath of morning air sweep down among we then i see the haggard uplift face the arm toss aloft and hear the wild yell as the stronger charge forward struggle for the foot of the ladder the place be a foul reeking shambles so filthy as to be positively sicken with motionless body stretch here and there along the deck sailor and guard fight they way down among we drive back the unarmed wretch who seek to oppose they progress while other bear to the deck above those who be too helpless to rise there be five dead among they and twice as many more who have lose consciousness these be all remove first and then feel helpless to resist the rush the other be permit to clamber up the ladder surge out upon the deck we be hurdle against the lee rail menace by level gun and thus finally feed while the filthy quarter below be hastily cleanse it be a dark lowering morning the desolate sea still threateningly rough the heavy cloud hang low the _ romp betsy _ be hove to under bare pole a bit of the jib alone show with deck and spar exhibit evidence of the terrific struggle to keep afloat i never witness wilder pitching on any vessel but the fresh air bring new life to the wretch about I and a species of cheerfulness be quickly manifest bad as the food be we eat it gladly nor do the memory of the dead already lay out on the main deck long depress we why should we mourn for they we scarcely know any among they by name and face the uncertainty of we own fate each man secretly feel that these have possibly find the easier way we own misery be now greater than theirs so we hang on to whatever would help we to keep erect and eat the food give we like famished animal rough and threatening as the surroundings still be i be seaman enough to realize that the backbone of the storm have break and so rejoice when the skipper order sail set in a few moment the brig be once again head on a westerly course and ride the heavy sea much more steadily we be permit to remain on deck scarcely more than a hour and during that time only a very few passenger make they appearance aft although watch eagerly i perceive no flutter of a skirt in the wind but the spanish look man emerge from below and clung to the rail for several minute before we be order from deck he speak with the captain point and gesticulate and the few detach word blow to I on the wind be sufficient to convince I that the fellow know ship and the sea i have think he a mere dandy but now saw in he harder stuff even get close enough to learn that he have visit america before and possess knowledge of its shore and current ay and he speak english well with never pause for a word even to term of seamanship a bit obscure the next few day while uneventful suffice to make we discipline complete obedience be roughly enforce by blow and oath at first a spirit of resistance flame high but the truly desperate among we be few and without leadership while the majority be already thoroughly cow by month of imprisonment leave to themselves the more reckless and criminal be soon oblige to yield to force so that nothing more serious result than loud talk and threat the hatch above remain open but carefully guard night and day while we be permit on deck for air and exercise only in squad of ten two hour out of every twenty-four this alone serve to break the dread monotony of the voyage for while we almost constantly encounter baffling head wind no other storm of any magnitude obstruct we passage the brig carry heavy canvas and the skipper load she with all she could bear but at that she be a slow sailor dip so deeply in a seaway as to ship considerable water even in quiet weather from we exercise on deck we generally return below drench to the skin but glad to even pay that price for two hour of fresh air and a opportunity to gaze about at sea and sky there be little else to witness for in all the long voyage we encounter but one vessel in that desolate ocean a french armed corvette fairly bristle with gun which run in close enough to hail we but seem satisfied to permit we to pass unvisited i clung to the rail and watch its white sail disappear until they resemble the wing of gull feel more than ever conscious of we helplessness there be few among the prisoner i have any desire to companion with -- only two as i recall now -- a law clerk from sussex a rather bright young fellow but full of strange notion and a older man who have see service in flander we mess together and pledge mutual friendship in the new land a pledge not destine to be fulfil as i never again see nor hear of the former after we go ashore and the last glimpse i have of the older man be as he be be load into a cart bind for some interior plantation god grant they both live and become again free man how those sodden hour and day drag how long be those black night in which i lay sleepless listen to indescribable noise and breathe the rank poisonous air the short time pass on deck be my only solace and yet even there i find little to interest except a continuous new hope we be herd well forward a rope divide we from the main deck which space the passenger aft use as a promenade here between the foremast and the cabin someone be stroll idly about most of the time or lounge along the rail out of the sun in time i come to recognize they all by sight and learn in one way or another something of they characteristic and purpose in take this voyage they be not a unusual lot the majority planter from the colony homeward bind with occasionally a new emigrant about to try for fortune beyond sea together with one or two naval officer there be only three woman aboard a fat dowager the young lady i have notice at embarkation and she color maid many of the day be pleasant with quiet sea and bright sunshine and the younger woman must have pass hour on deck during so long and tedious a voyage yet it chance i see almost nothing of she i hear she presence on board discuss several time by other of we company but it somehow chance that during my time in the open she be usually below indeed i gain but one glimpse of the lady in the first two week at sea and then only as we be be order down to we quarter for the night just as i be approach the hatch to descend she appear from within the cabin accompany by the middle-aged planter and the two advance toward the rail the younger gallant who be stand there alone see they the moment they emerge and hasten forward bow low hat in hand she barely recognize he she gaze travel beyond the fellow toward the disappear line of prisoner it be a evening promising storm with some motion to the sea and a heavy bank of cloud visible off the port quarter brighten by flash of zigzag lightning the brig roll dizzily so the cavalier seek to steady she step but she only laugh at the effort wave he aside as she move easily forward once with hand on the rail she ignore he presence entirely look first at the threatening cloud and then permit she gaze to rest once more upon the line of man descend through the hatch it have become my turn to go down yet in that instant we eye meet fairly and i instantly know she see and recognize I for a single second we glance cling as though some mysterious influence hold we to each other -- then the angry guard strike I with the stock of he piece what er ye standin ' thar fer he demand savagely go on down -- lively now i see she clasping finger convulsively grip the rail and even at that distance mark a sudden flame of color in she cheek that be all she message to I yet quite enough although we have never speak although we name be yet unknown i be no criminal to she mind no unrecognized prisoner beneath contempt but a human be in whom she already feel a personal interest and to whom she extend thought and sympathy the blow of the gun-stock bruised my back yet it be with a smile and a light heart that i descend the ladder deeply conscious of a friend on board -- one totally unable to serve I perhaps yet nevertheless a friend even in we isolation guard in those narrow quarter much of the ship gossip manage in some way to reach we ear how it drift in be often a mystery yet there be little go on aboard we fail to hear much of it come to we through those detail to serve food while guard and sailor be not always averse to be talk with we always know the ship 's course and i manage to keep in my mind a very dear idea of how the voyage progress not a great deal of this gossip however related to the passenger aft who keep rather exclusively to themselves nor do i feel inclined to question those who might have the information i have no wish to reveal my interest to other and so continued entirely ignorant of the identity of the young woman she remain in my memory in my thought nameless a dream rather than a reality i do learn quite by accident that the gay gallant be a wealthy spaniard supposedly of high birth by name sanchez and at one time in the naval service and likewise ascertain that the rotund planter so evidently in the party be a certain roger fairfax of saint mary 's in maryland homeward bind after a successful sale of he tobacco crop in london it be during he visit to the great city that he have meet sanchez and he praise of the colony have induce the latter to essay a voyage in he company to america but strange enough no one so much as mention the girl in connection with either man thus it be that the _ romp betsy _ drive steadily on she way into the west either batter by storm or idly drift in calm while life on board become a tiresome routine the dullness and ill treatment lead to trouble below to dissatisfaction and angry outbreak of temper the prisoner grow quarrelsome among themselves and mutinous toward they guard i take no part in these affair which at one time become serious two man be shoot dead and twice afterwards body be carry up the ladder at dawn and silently consign to the sea no doubt these tale more or less exaggerated travel aft and reach the eager ear of the passenger they begin to fear we and consequently i notice when on deck the promenade once so popular during the earlier day of the voyage be almost totally desert during we hour of recreation so with mutiny forward and fear aft the lumber old brig full of tragedy and hopeless heart plough steadily onward toward the sunset chapter iii dorothy fairfax we be not far from two hundred mile east of the cape or at least so one of the mate tell I gruffly answer a question and it be already grow twilight the sun have disappear a half hour before there be but little air stir barely enough to keep the sail taut while the swell of the sea be sufficient to be uncomfortable make walk on the deck a task we be wallow along amid a waste of water the white-crested wave extend in every direction to the far horizon which be already purple with the approach of night i have be closely confine to my bunk for two day with illness but now somewhat stronger have be order on deck by the surgeon the last batch of prisoner after they short hour of recreation have be return to the quarter below but i be permit to remain alone undisturbed i sit there quietly perch on a coil of rope with head just high enough to permit a unobstructed view over the side the deck aft be almost desert the passenger be at supper in the cabin i could glimpse they through the unshaded window seat about a long table while occasionally the sound of they voice reach I through the open companion-way the mate be alone on the poop tramp steadily back and forth he glance wander from the sea alongside to the flap canvas above but remain silent as the brig be on she course once he clamber down the side ladder and walk forward shout out some order to a group of sailor under the lee of the forecastle it be on he return that i ventured to question he and be gruffly answer something i say however give he knowledge that i be a seaman and he pause a moment more civilly before resume he watch even point out what resemble the gleam of a distant sail far away on we starboard quarter this be such a dim speck against the darkening horizon that i stand up to see better shadow my eye and forgetful of all else in arouse interest undoubtedly it be a sail although appear no larger than a gull 's wing and my imagination take I in spirit across the league of water i be still stand there absorb unaware even that the mate have depart when a voice soft-spoken and feminine break the silence may i speak with you i turn instantly so thoroughly surprised my voice falter as i gaze into the upturned face of the questioner she stand directly beside I with only the rope barrier stretch between we she head uncover the contour of she face soften by the twilight instantly my cap be off and i be bow courteously most certainly with a quick side glance toward the guard but i be a prisoner of course i know that in smile confidence only you see i be rather a privileged character on board no one expect I to obey rule still that do not apply to you do it hesitate slightly perhaps you may be punish if you talk with I -- be that what you mean i be more than willing to assume the risk punishment be no new experience to I besides just now i be on sick leave and privileged that account for my be still on deck and i chance to find you here alone you have be ill not seriously but confine to the berth for a couple of day and now the doctor prescribe fresh air this meeting with you i imagine may prove even of greater benefit than that with I oh you mean as a relief from loneliness partly -- yes the voyage have certainly prove lonely enough i have make few friend forward and be even bold enough to say that i have long for a word with you ever since i first saw you aboard why especially with I rather a hard question to answer at the very begin i smile back at she yet not so difficult as the one i shall ask you except for a fat matron and a color maid you chance to be the only woman on board can you consider it unnatural that i should feel a interest on the other hand i be only one of fifty prisoner scarcely cleaner or more reputable look than any of my mate yet surely you have not seek speech with these other no then why especially with I even in the grow dusk i could mark a red flush mount into the clear cheek at this insistent question and for a instant she eye waver but she possess the courage of pride and she hesitancy be short you imagine i can not answer indeed that i have no worthy reason she exclaim oh but i have i know who you be my uncle point you out to I you uncle -- the planter in the gray coat yes i be travel home with he to maryland i be dorothy fairfax but even with that explanation i scarcely understand i insist rather stubbornly you say he point I out to you really i be not aware that i be a distinguished character of any kind how do he happen to know I because he be present at you trial before lord jeffry he merely chance to be there when you be first bring up but become interested in the case and so return to hear you sentence you be geoffry carlyle in command of the ship that bring monmouth to england i hear it all all what else pray she eye open widely in sudden surprise and she clasp and unclasp she hand nervously do you really not know have you never be tell what happen only that i be roughly forbid to speak call every foul name the learn judge could think of and then sentence to twenty year penal servitude beyond sea i answer soberly follow that i be drag from the dock and fling into a cell be there anything else why you should have know lord jeffry sentence you to death the decree be sign to be execute immediately then influence be bring to bear -- some nobleman in northumberland make direct appeal to the king that be what anger jeffry so a appeal for I good god not bucclough -- be it he the duke yes it be whisper about that the king be in he debt -- some word of honor and dare not refuse the word of mercy come just in time order jeffry to commute you sentence at first he swear he would hang you king or no king but he nerve fail my uncle say he roar like a bull this bucclough be he not you friend i hesitate for a instant of indecision look into she face but the truth would not be deny scarcely that i say soberly nor can i solve entirely he purpose he be my brother and i be the next in line we be not even on speak term yet he be childless and may feel some measure of dislike to have the family end in a hangman 's knot i can think of no other reason for he interference i know nothing of he action i be glad it become my privilege to tell you besides captain carlyle simply it may also help you to understand my interest if you be of the carlyle of bucclough how happen it that you go to sea largely necessity and to some extent no doubt sheer love of adventure i be a younger son with very little income there be then two life between I and the estate and the old duke my father treat I like a servant i always love the sea and at fourteen -- to get I out of he sight i think largely -- be apprentice to the navy but lose my grade in the service by a mere boyish prank he influence then would have save I but he refuse to even read my letter of explanation i dare not return home in such disgrace and consequently drift into the merchant service it be a story quickly tell yet not so quickly live no it mean many hard year on all the ocean of the world this be the first message reach I from the old home i have see that home she say quietly and shall never forget the impression it make on I a beautiful place i be there on a coaching party the first summer i be in england i be a mere girl then and everything seem wonderful i have be away from

appear most attractive it be not so strange then be it that i should have feel interested in you she ask suddenly as though justify herself when uncle roger first tell I who you be and then explain what have occur at you trial naturally you become to I something entirely different from the other certainly i be not incline to condemn i never once think of speak to you -- truly i do not she go on simply but when i see you sit here all alone the impulse come suddenly to tell you how sorry i be you see and she pause doubtfully girl bring up in the colony as i have be be -- be not quite so careful about whom they talk with as in england -- you know what i mean we always have indenture servant and become accustomed to they it -- it be quite different out there i laugh think only to relieve she embarrassment believe I miss dorothy there be no thought in my mind that you have do wrong i insist swiftly that would be very ungrateful for you have bring I new heart and hope then i be not sorry be you actually with monmouth in sympathy yes but i have no hand in the actual fighting i be not even ashore until it be all over with still i shall pay my share of the bill and you know what that mean do you not what will happen when we reach virginium perfectly i have no illusion i have see just such ship as this come in we be to be advertise and sell to the highest bidder a week from now i shall probably be out in the tobacco field under the whip of a overseer who will call I jeff all i can hope for be a kind-hearted master and a early opportunity to escape oh no and in she eagerness she hand actually clasped mine where they cling to the rope between we it be not go to be quite so bad as that that be what i want to tell you that be what give I boldness to come across here to you tonight it have all be arrange arrange yes -- everything you be not go to be sell on the block with those other uncle roger have already contract with the captain for you service you be go north with we to maryland i stare through the dusk into she animated face scarcely comprehend do you not understand yet she ask the captain of this brig be the agent he represent the government and be oblige to find place for the prisoner yes i know that we be bill like so much livestock he must account for every head well uncle roger go to he yesterday and make a bid for you finally they come to term that be one reason why you be leave alone here on deck tonight the officer be no longer responsible for you -- you be already indenture i draw a deep breath and in the sudden impulse of relief which sweep over I my own finger close tightly about she hand you tell I i be to accompany you party up the chesapeake yes i owe this to you i be sure i must owe this to you -- tell I she eye droop and in the dim light i could mark the heaving of she bosom as she catch she breath only -- only the suggestion she manage to say in a whisper he -- he be glad of that you see i -- i know he need someone to take charge of he sloop and -- and so i bring you to he mind we -- we both think you would be just the one and -- and he go right away to see the captain so please do not thank I i shall never cease to thank you i return warmly conscious suddenly that i be hold she hand and as instantly release they why do you begin to understand what this actually mean to I it mean the retention of manhood of self-respect it will save I the degradation which i dread most of all -- the toiling in the field beside negro slave and the sting of the lash ay it mean even more -- i hesitate instantly realize that i must not utter those impetuous word leap to my lip more she exclaim what more this i go on my thought shift into a new channel a longer servitude up to this moment my one dream have be to escape but i must give that up now you have place I under obligation to serve you mean you feel personally bind yes not quite so much to you uncle perhaps as to yourself but between we this have become a debt of honor but wait she say earnestly for i have even think of that i be sure you would feel that way -- any gentleman would still there be a way out you be sentence as a indentured servant i suppose so it be true you be so enter on the book of this ship uncle roger have to be sure of all this before he pay he money and i see the entry myself it read : ` geoffry carlyle master mariner indenture to the colony for the term of twenty year unless sooner release crime high treason ' surely you must know the meaning of those word servitude for twenty year ` unless sooner release ' that mean pardon there be no hope of that perhaps not but that be not all it mean any indentured man under we maryland law can buy he freedom after serve a certain proportion of he sentence i think it be true in any of the colony do you not know that i do know it yet somehow have never connect the fact before directly with my own case i have be sentence to twenty year -- twenty year of a living death -- and that alone remain impressed on my mind i could still see black jeffry sit on the bench glare down at I in unconcealed anger he eye blaze with the fury of impotent hate as he roar that by decree of the king my sentence to be hang be commute to twenty year of penal servitude beyond sea it have never even seem a act of mercy to I but now it do as the full truth suddenly come home that i could buy my freedom god what a relief i stand up straight once more in the stature of a man i hardly know what wild word i might have speak have the opportunity be mine but at that instant the figure of a man cross the deck toward we emerge from the open cabin door against the gleam of yellow light i recognize the trim form advance and as instantly step back into shadow my quick movement cause she to turn and face he what he exclaim and evidently surprise at he discovery it be indeed mistress dorothy -- out here alone 'twa my thought you be safely in you cabin long since but -- prithee -- i mistake you be not alone he pause slightly irresolute stare forward beyond she at my dimmer outline quite uncertain who i might be yet already suspicious i be prepare to go in she answer ignore he latter word the night already look stormy but you friend the tone in which he speak be insistent almost insolent in its demand and she hesitate no longer in meet the challenge you pardon i be sure -- lieutenant sanchez this gentleman be captain geoffry carlyle he stand there stiff and straight against the background of light one hand in affect carelessness caress the end of a wax moustache he face be in shadow yet i be quite aware of the flash of he eye ah indeed -- some passenger i have not chance to observe before a prisoner she return distinctly you may perhaps remember my uncle point he out to we when he first come aboard and you have be out here alone talk with the fellow certainly -- why not why the man be a felon convict of crime sentence to deportation it be not necessary that we discuss this sir she interpose rather proudly as my personal conduct be not a matter for you criticism i shall retire now no thank you you need not come he stop still stare blankly after she as she vanish then wheel about to vent he anger on I carlyle hey he exclaim sneeringly a familiar sound that name in my ear one of the brood out of bucclough a cadet of that line i manage to admit wonderingly you know of they quite as much as i care to he tone ugly and insulting then a idea suddenly occur to he mind saint guise but that would even up the score nicely you be as i understand it send to virginia for sale yes for how long a term the sentence be twenty year hela and you go to the highest bidder i 'll do it fellow to actually own a carlyle of bucclough will be a sweet revenge you mean i ask dimly grasp he purpose that you propose buy I when we reach shore why not a most excellent plan and i owe it all to a brat i meet in london egad it will be some joke to tell when next i visit england ` twill count for more than be i to tweak the duke 's nose i stop he laughter smile myself grimly in the darkness a very noble plan for revenge i admit enjoy the swift check-mating of he game and one which i be not likely to forget unfortunately you come too late it happen senor that i be already safely indenture to roger fairfax to fairfax she tell you that who tell I can make no difference at least i be out of you hand i turn away but he call angrily after I : do not feel so sure of that carlyle i be in the game yet i make no answer already despise the fellow so thoroughly as to ignore he threat he still stand there a mere shadow as i disappear down the ladder and i could imagine the expression on he face chapter iv the shore of virginium i rest quietly in my berth for a long time stare blankly up at the dark deck above unable to sleep and endeavor to figure out the true meaning of all these occurrence it begin to rain torrent sweep the plank overhead while vivid flash of lightning illumine the open hatch before it could be hastily close reveal the squalidness of the interior in which we be quarter then someone growling and stumble through the darkness light a slush lantern dangle from a blacken beam its faint flicker barely discernible the hole become foul and sickening man toss and groan in they uneasy sleep or prowl about seek some measure of comfort there be no severe wind accompany the storm and the flurry of rain soon sweep by leave a ugly swell behind but enable the guard to again uplift the hatch immerse as i be in think all this left but small impress on I i feel that i could understand the interest exhibit by dorothy fairfax and greatly as i already admire she i be not egotist enough to even imagine that she effort to serve I have basis in any personal attraction my connection with bucclough couple with she uncle 's report of my conviction have very naturally arouse the girl 's sympathy in my behalf she feel a desire to lighten my sorrow as much as possible and under the exist circumstance have find it comparatively easy to persuade the good-natured planter to acquiesce in she suggestion in all probability he really have need of my service and be therefore glad enough of this opportunity to secure they this part of the affair i could dismiss without give anyone undue credit although i deeply appreciate the kindness of heart which have lead she to interpose and which later lead she to tell I so quickly what have occur she purpose however be fairly clear but what about lieutenant sanchez why be this unknown spaniard already so openly my enemy there be no doubt he position and there surely must be some reason for it outside of anything which have occur on board the _ romp betsy _ he word have give I some inkling of the cause -- a past quarrel with the duke of bucclough in england in which he must have be worst and which have leave in he mind a lurk desire for revenge he dream of striking he enemy through I because of relationship a cowardly blow yet this by itself alone be scarcely a reason why he should have thus seek I out for a victim no sane man would deliberately visit the sin of my brother on I nor have this be deliberate it be the mere outburst of sudden passion arise through my intercourse with the young woman otherwise it might never have occur to he so there be seemingly but one answer -- sanchez use this merely as a excuse for the concealment of he real object what could that object be could it be dorothy fairfax i be a long while in actually convincing myself of this probability and yet no other satisfactory explanation offer itself she have exhibit a interest in I from the very first and he have endeavor to win she attention elsewhere even that day when we first come aboard in chain he have plainly evince this desire and since then the girl have never appear on deck without he immediately seek she company i feel finally that i have the clue -- jealousy the mad unreasoning jealousy of he race he fiercely resent she slightest interest in anyone -- even a prisoner -- as against he own attraction he be incapable of appreciate friendly sympathy and already hold I a dangerous rival then possibly it have not be a mere idle desire to visit the colony which have originally lead to he prompt acceptance of roger fairfax 's invitation to make one of they party the real attraction be the charm of dorothy -- she girlish beauty couple no doubt with she father 's wealth the fellow be in love impetuously in love resent blindly the slightest advance of any other the thought rather pleased I largely because of its absurdity it be in my case at least so utterly false and unjustifiable to the ordinary mind indeed any such connection would be practically unthinkable even have i be wild enough to dream of such a thing the gulf exist between myself and dorothy fairfax be far too deep and wide ever to be span i have before I twenty year of servitude and a unknown future nor could i even conceive the possibility of any such thought ever enter she mind the very opposite be what give she courage to serve I i have no false conception as to this no vagrant thought that she interest in I be any more than a pass fancy bear of sympathy and a desire to aid nevertheless as she have thus already serve I i now owe she service in return and here be the first call if condition make it possible it be my plain duty to place myself between these two i feel no hatred toward the man no desire to do he a personal injury but i do dislike and distrust he this feeling be instinctive and without the slightest reference to he seek intimacy with the girl from the first moment i have look upon he face there have be antagonism between we a feeling of enmity whether this arise from he appearance or action i could not determine -- but the fellow be not my kind in the intensity of my feeling i must have unconsciously speak aloud for a shaggy head suddenly pop out from the berth beneath where i lay and a interested voice ask solicitously : hy thar whut 's up mate sick agin no i answer grin rather guiltily just think and let loose a bit do i disturb you well i reckon i wa 'n' t exactly asleep he acknowledge without withdraw he head ye wus mutterin ' ` way thar a ' not disturbin ' I none till ye get ter talkin ' ` bout sum feller call sanchez then i sorter get a bit interested i know would thet cuss onct and he spit as though to thus better express he feeling the damned ornary pirate i laugh my whole mental mood change by this remark it be not very likely we have the same party in mind haley you see sanchez be a decidedly common name among spaniard i have know two or three of that name myself you be not refer to anyone on board be you i sure hope not he scratch he head stare up at I through the dim light wakefulness encourage he to talk they tell I ye be a sea-farin ' man well i wus a deal fisher but hev make a half dozen deep-sea v ` y' ge thet 's how i hed the damn luck ter meet up with this sanchez i be a speakin ' ` bout he be the only one ever i know would i meet up with he off the isle o ' cuba likely ` nough ye know the devil i mean the question serve to center my memory suddenly on a dim remembrance of the past no unless you refer to ` black sanchez ' i have hear of he be you ever in he hand wus i he laugh grimly i hed eight month of it mate and a greater demon never sail the thing i see do ye would never believe no human bein ' could do if ever thar wus two people in one skin sir it be thet black sanchez when he be playin ' off fer good he be as soft a ' sweet as a dandy in picadilly a ' when he be real he be like a devil in hell be you a prisoner -- or do you sail under he both fer the matter o ' thet he give I the choice ter serve er walk the plank i wus eighteen a ' hed a ol' mother at deal i see but later you get away ay i do thet chuckle over the recollection but i hed ter wait eight month fer the luck hev ye ever be sea-farin ' down in they water off the west indy no well they be all stud over with little island -- cay they call 'em down thare a ' it be in among they thet the buccaneer hide away a ' sorter rest up after a cruise thar 's a lot o ' 'em too whole village hide away on some o ' they cay with woman a ' child -- every color ye ever see sanchez he make he headquarters on a cay call porto grande he hed three ship a ' maybe a hundred a ' fifty man ` bout the time i get away the last i see o ' he wus at sea he have overhaul a english ship a ' sink she a ' then the next mornin ' we take a dutch bark in ballast she wus such a trig sailor sanchez decide to keep she afloat a ' send a prize crew aboard ter sail she inter porto grande i wus one o ' the feller pick fer thet job a ' we wus tell off under a nigger mate name lagrasse -- he wus a french nigger from martinique and a big devil -- a ' we order wus ter meet sanchez three day later he vessel wus a three-masted schooner the fastest thing ever i see afloat call the _ vengeance _ a ' by that time she wus chock up with loot still at that she could sail ` bout three foot to we one afore night come we wus out o ' sight astern thar wus eight o ' we in the crew beside the nigger a ' we have twelve dutchman under hatch below i sorter look ` round a ' size up four o ' that crew ter be good honest sailorman who have be shanghy same as i wus so long about midnight i would get ter talk with all these feller a ' when lagrasse go down below ter take a snooze in the cabin we hoist they dutchmen on deck fling a couple o ' hell-hounds overboard a ' just naturally take control the mate wus a dead nigger afore he ever know whut wus up when daylight come we wus streakin ' it eastward by compass a ' every damn sail set thet wus the easiest part of it they dutchman could not talk nuthin ' but they own lingo a ' thar wa 'n' t a navigator aboard fer sanchez hed keep all the offercer with he a ' the end wus about a week later when we pile up against a island off the african coast a ' only one boat load of we get ashore thet 's whut i know about sanchez i have a shipmate once i observe interested in he story who claim to have see the fellow he describe he as be a very large man with intensely black hawklike eye and a heavy black beard almost hide he face haley laugh maybe he look like that when he see he but he be not no bigger man than i be he will not weigh as much by fifteen pound fact be he mighty seldom look the same fer thet 's part o ' he game they whisker be false a ' so be the saller look to he face i have see he in all sort o ' disguise it be only he eye he can not hide a ' thar 's be time when i think they wus the ugliest eye ever i see he be sure a ornary devil a ' when he git mad i would rather be afront of a tiger besides fightin 's he trade a ' no weaklin ' be not goin ' ter control the sort o ' chap he be get ter handle most of 'em would murder he in a minute if they dare oh he be bad all right but yer would not exactly think so just ter look at he i have run up agin a lot o ' different man in my time thet i would naturally sheer off from a blame sight quicker than i would from he you mean that when he be not in disguise he do not appear dangerous what then do he really look like haley spat again onto the deck and scratch he shock of hair as though thus to stimulate he memory oh a sorter swash-bucklin ' spanish don -- the kind whut like ter dress up a ' play the dandy he be get a pink a ' white complexion the castilian kind yer know a ' wear a little moustache wax up at the end he be about two inch taller than i be with no extra flesh but with a hell of a grip in he hand as i say afore if it wa 'n' t fer he eye nobody would ever look at he twice all he devilishness show thar a ' i have see 'em laugh like he do not have a care on earth how old a man be he how old be the devil i hear he wus about forty-five i reckon he must be thet but he do not look older than thirty he be not the kind yer can guess at we talk together for quite a while longer we conversation gradually drift to the recount of various sea adventure and my thought do not again recur to sanchez until after i rest back once more in my berth endeavor to fall asleep haley must have drop off immediately for i could distinguish he heavy breathing among the other but my mind continue to wander until it conjure up once again this west indium pirate he name and the story of he exploit have be familiar to I ever since i first go to sea while only one among many operating in those haunt water he resourcefulness daring and cruelty have win he a infamous reputation a name of horror in those day when the curse of piracy make the sea a terror no ordinary man could ever have succeed in attain such supremacy in crime no doubt much that have be report be either false or exaggerated yet there flash across my memory numberless tale of rapine outrage and cold-blooded cruelty in which this demon of the sea have figure cause I to shudder at the recollection to my mind he have long be a fiend incarnate he name a horror on the lip black sanchez -- and haley picture he as a dandified ordinary appear individual with white and red complexion a small moustache and flash dark eye -- a mere spanish gallant without special distinction why that description strangely enough fit almost exactly this fellow on board this other sanchez i lean over the edge of my bunk and look down on haley half resolve to ask if he have ever notice this lieutenant but the man be already sound asleep the suspicion which have creep into my mind be so absurd so unspeakably silly and impossible that i laugh at myself and dismiss the crazy thought what that fellow black sanchez bah no he have be at sea of course there be no deny that fact for he know ship and speak the lingo of blue water but the very idea that that blood-stained buccaneer whose hate name be on the lip of every sea-faring man of britain would ever dare openly to visit england and then sail under he own name on board a english vessel for virginium be too preposterous for consideration why it would be sheer madness the knowledge that such a possibility ever have flash into my mind become amusing and chuckle over it i finally fall asleep it be noon the sky overcast the wind blow strong from the southeast when the virginium coast be first sight from we mast-head a hour later it become plainly visible from the deck below and the prisoner be route out from they quarter and the shackle remove from limb when we first arrive on board be again rivet in place bind they together in fours preparatory to landing i with one or two other already dispose of and in control of master be spare this indignity and permit to move about as we please within the narrow deck space reserve for we use the last meal be serve in the open the man squat on the deck plank endeavor to jest among themselves and assume a cheerfulness they be very far from feel the long hardship of the voyage have leave indelible mark on the majority and they be by now a woe-begone miserable lot who have largely abandon themselves to despair the monmouth campaign have be brief but no less disastrous to the man engage in it those who survive the one battle wound and fugitive have be hunt down remorselessly like so many wild beast escape from the pursuit of soldier be almost impossible and they have be brutally beat and bruise by infuriate captor and then uncared for nor show the slightest mercy have be thrust into loathsome gaol to helplessly await trial and a certain conviction no pen could adequately describe the suffering and horror of those month of wait while the unfortunate victim live in crowded dirty cell subject to every conceivable indignity and insult from brutal guard half starve and breathing foul fetid air -- the breath of sickness the stench of unclean wound drag forth at last one by one into a court organize for condemnation preside over by a foul-mouthed brute whose every word be insult deny all opportunity for defense they have later be shackle together as felon and drive aboard ship like so many head of cattle herd below deck toss about for week on a stormy sea uncared for and half starve scarcely realize they destination or know they fate see they dead drag out from they midst with each dawn and fling carelessly overboard curse at and strike by they guard they now drag they ache body about in half dead despair the chain clank to every movement of the limb they dull lackluster eye scarcely discerning the darkening line of coast toward which the _ romp betsy _ steer with what depth of pity i look at they my glance gladly stray from they downcast face toward the group of passenger gather eagerly along the poop rail to welcome joyfully the approach of land these be all animation excitement talk eagerly to each other and point out familiar headland as they emerge through the thin mist they thought be all center on home or the promise of this new land they be approach and so deeply interested that scarcely a eye turn toward those miserable wretch group on the forward deck be bear into slavery and disgrace it be a contrast between hope and despair as these passenger move restlessly back and forth from rail to rail i easily recognize among they every face grow familiar to I during the course of the voyage except the two i most eagerly seek and become convinced that neither roger fairfax nor he niece have yet come upon deck sanchez be there however stand alone and silent seldom lift he eye to the change view ahead but apparently bury in he own thought once we glance accidentally meet and i could but observe the sudden change in the man 's expression -- a change sinister and full of threat whatever the original cause might be he personal feeling toward I be undoubtedly bitter and unforgiving and he possess no wish to disguise it the new life in the new world have already bring I both friend and enemy before i have as yet touch foot on land chapter v the water of the chesapeake the brig with all sail set and favor by a strong wind draw rapidly in toward the point of land the great majority of the prisoner remain on deck chained together and helpless yet surround by armed guard while the few who have already be purchase by passenger humbly follow they new master ashore the moment the gang-plank touch the soil of virginium there be five of we altogether thus favor but i be the only one owe allegiance to roger fairfax the rude landing wharf along which we lay be already densely crowd with man they appearance and dress largely proclaim they to be planter from the interior either gather to inspect the consignment of prisoner or eager to purchase at low price the store hide away in the vessel 's hold some among the concourse however be undoubtedly present to welcome friend and relative among the passenger altogether it be a bustling scene full of change and color the air noisy with shout voice the line of wharf fill with a number of vessel either newly arrive or prepare to depart servant both white and color be busily at work under the command of overseer load and unload cargo while the high bank beyond be crowd with vehicle of various kind news of the arrival of the _ romp betsy _ have evidently spread widely together with the rumor that she bring a number of prisoner to be auction off it be a good-natured restless crowd especially anxious for any news from abroad and eager to benefit from the sale the majority of the man i judge to be landowner hearty wholesome look fellow whose life be pass out-of-doors dress in they best in honor of the occasion the prevail fashion be a broad-leafed feel hat with one side loop up to the crown by a brilliant metal button a velvet coat with long voluminous skirt wide sleeve metallic button as large as a spanish dollar short breeches and long stocking with gold or silver knee and shoe buckle many wear sword while those who do not bear about with they enormous gold or silver-headed cane the smoking of pipe be common and thoughtless profanity be to be hear on all side as a ordinary part of speech it be with no small difficulty we succeed in force we way through this jostle throng until we attain to a open space ashore i follow closely behind the three compose we party roger fairfax and sanchez with the laughing girl between they for protection press a passage forward even have i not be laden with package my general appearance and dress would doubtless have proclaim my position and arouse pass interest i hear voice call attention to I while curious eye stare into my face fairfax be evidently well know to a number present for he be be greet on all side with hearty hand-shake and word of welcome ah back again roger and what fortune in london a fair price for the crop be the lad trail behind ye one o ' monmouth 's man any news friend in parliament what be the latest on the tax and pray who be this damsel roger not hugh fairfax 's girl ay quite the woman now you man they be over there across the road of course i know do i not come from the dock with they there be two of they both negro but one address by fairfax as sam be much the lighter in color and far more intelligent of face a few word of instruction dispatch these back to the _ romp betsy _ for the luggage yet remain on board while we own party continue to advance along the water front toward where sam have designate the fairfax boat would be find await we fully prepare to depart up the chesapeake when finally attain this vessel prove to be a goodly size sloop of a type familiar to those water contain a comfortable small cabin forward a staunch broad-beamed craft but with line indicate sailing quality while require only a small crew several similar vessel -- doubtless own and operate by planter reside along the shore of the bay -- be anchor in the basin or fasten at the dock but the _ adele _ have be warped in against the bank which at this point be high enough to enable we easily to step aboard over the low rail a dingy look white man quite evidently from he appearance a indentured servant be in charge he greet we rather surlily stare at I with almost open hostility yet respond swiftly enough to fairfax 's order here carr stow these package away yes you better help with they carlyle the other bag will be along directly -- sam and john have go after they put these forward under cover have everything be see to so we can start at once ay ay sorr be the gruff response in a strong irish brogue lord know we have hide toime enough fer we have bin waitin ' here fer yer a wake er more it be a month since the lether come we have have a slow voyage carr so all i order be aboard she be full oop ter the hatch bedad i hope thar be not no more good we ought to get as far as traver ' by dark then hurry along and stow that stuff away here come the other now the three find comfortable seat along the opposite rail and sit there watch we hastily bring aboard the various article which the two negro assist by a boy and a cart have transport from the brig i work along with the other under the order of sam who seem to be in charge already feel somewhat deeply the humiliation of my position but nevertheless realize the necessity of prompt obedience the knowledge that i be now a slave on a level with these other compel to perform menial labor under the very eye of dorothy fairfax and that sneer spaniard cut my pride to the quick in my trip back and forth i keep my eye avert never once venture to glance toward they until this work have be accomplish but when we stand idle while sam go aft for instruction i have recover sufficient nerve to turn my eye in that direction only to observe that the young woman sit with head turn away gaze out over the rail at the shore she chin cup in she hand she thought apparently far away strange as it may seem she obvious indifference hurt I oddly my only comprehension be that she do not in the least care that in fact she have already entirely dismiss I from she mind this supposition whether true or false instantly harden I to my fate and i stare at sanchez meeting he eye fairly at once anger by the sneer on he lip and the open insult of he manner he turn toward she finger a cheroot and say something but though she answer she head remain motionless she eye search the shore indifferently a figure or two appear along the summit of the bank voice call to fairfax who stand up as he reply end the conversation with a wave of the hand to sam who have take position at the wheel the latter begin shout order in a shrill voice carr cast off and with the negro and myself at the halliard the mainsail rise to the cap while we begin glide out from the shore into the deeper water by the time we have hoist the jib and make all secure we be out far enough to feel the full force of the stiff breeze the _ adele _ careen until she rail be awash the white canvas soar above we against the misty blue of the sky there be little to be do after the rope have be coil away and we be fairly out into the broader reach of the bay the wind hold steady require no shift of canvas so sam have dispatch the negro below to prepare lunch and station carr forward as lookout call I aft to the wheel he be a rather pleasant-faced fellow yellow as saffron with ring in he ear and a wide mouth perpetually grin massa fairfax he say you real sailorman he begin look I over carefully with a nod of he head toward the group at the rail dat so yes i have be a number of year at sea dat what he say dat he do buy yer fer dat reason mostly ah reckon den ye kin steer di boat i certainly can so den ah 's sure goin ' fer ter let yer try right now yer take hol ' while ah stand by a bit i take he place grasp the spoke firmly and he stand aside watch every movement closely as i hold the speeding sloop steadily up to the wind the spray pour in over the dip rail forward the grin on he lip broaden what be the course i ask curiously ` cross ter dat point yonder -- see whar de lone tree stan 's we do ` round dat ` bout tree hunder ' yard out a ' then go straight ` way north you use no chart he burst into a guffaw as though the question be a rare joke no sah i nebber do see one but surely you must steer by

yer job all right so i 'll just leave yer here awhile a ' go forrard a ' git a snack be not eat nuthin ' fer quite a spell ah 'll be back afore yer ` round de point yonder i be alone at the wheel the sloop in my control and somehow as i stand there grasp those spoke the swift boat leap forward through the water lean recklessly over before the force of the wind the numbing sense of helpless servitude leave I in a new return of manhood and responsibility it be a scene of exhilaration the sun still partially obscure by misty cloud already well down in the western sky with the toss wave of the bay foam-crest the distant headland appear spectral and gray through the vapor while the water beyond take on the tint of purple shadow the _ adele _ respond to the helm gallantly the spread canvas above stand out like a board a broad wake of white foam spread far astern not another sail appear across that troubled surface of water not even a fisherman 's boat the only other vessel visible along we course be a dim outline close in against that far-away headland toward which i have be instruct to steer i stare at this indistinct object at first believe it a wreck but finally distinguish the bare mast of a medium-sized bark evidently ride at anchor only a few hundred yard off shore satisfied as to this my glance shift to we own deck feel a seaman 's admiration for the cleanliness of the little vessel and the shipshape condition of everything aboard the deck have more the appearance of a pleasure yacht than that of a cargo carrier although the broad beam and commodious hatch bespeak ample storage room below apparently all this hold space have be reserve for the transportation of goods the passenger quarter be forward with the cook 's galley at the foot of the mast where the crew sleep i be unable to discern but they be few in number and as sam have disappear up a short ladder and then across the roof of the cabin it be highly probable there would be a compact forecastle nestle between the bow the blacker negro be busily engage in the galley he figure occasionally visible at the open door and a column of black smoke pour out through the tin funnel the deck plank be scrub white and the hand-rail have be polish until they shine the three passenger still remain seat together the man converse and occasionally point forth at some object across the water but while i watch the little group the girl make no movement nor attempt at speech none of they even so much as glance toward I and i feel that already i have be dismiss from they thought have be relegate to my proper position have sunken to my future place as a mere servant finally mistress dorothy arise to she foot and with a brief word of explanation to she uncle start forward in the direction of the cabin a sudden leap of the boat cause she to clutch the rail and instantly sanchez be at she side proffer assistance they cross the dancing deck together he hand upon she arm and pause for a moment at the door to exchange a few sentence when the spaniard come back he point out to fairfax the position of the still distant bark which however be by this time plainly reveal off we port quarter the planter stand up in order to see better and then the two cross the deck to a position only a few yard from where i stand at the wheel and remain there stare out across the intervene water surely a strange place in which to anchor lieutenant say fairfax at last break the silence he hand shade he eye bark rig and very heavily spar seem to be all right what do you make of the vessel the spaniard twist he moustache but exhibit little interest although he gaze be upon the craft decidedly dutch i should say he answer slowly to judge from the shape of she line and the size of she spar the beggar seem quite at home there with all they wash out not a usual anchorage no nor a particularly safe one there be some very heavy sea off that point at time and there be no plantation near by traver ' place be beyond the bend we 'll put up with he tonight he own that land yonder but he wharf be several mile up the coast damn I sanchez i believe i 'll hail the fellow and find out what he be do in there sanchez nod carelessly striking flint and steel in a effort to relight a cheroot and fairfax turn he head toward I oh be that you carlyle where be sam go forward sir half a hour ago he decide i be safe the planter laugh with a side glance toward sanchez who give no sign that he overhead no doubt he be right port you helm a little and run down as close as seem safe to that fellow out yonder until i hail he very well sir we come about slowly toss a bit by the heavy swell the ponderous boom swinging and permit the loosen canvas to flap against the rope until the sloop finally steady onto the new tack the distance to be cover be not great and in less than ten minute we be draw in toward the high stern of the anchor vessel she be larger than i have think a lump craft for those day bark rig with lower spar the heaviest i have ever see no evidence of life appear on board although everything look shipshape alow and aloft and a rather extensive wash flap in the wind forward bespeak a generous crew there be no flag at the mizzen to signify nationality yet there be a peculiar touch to the rig which confirm in my mind the truth of sanchez 's guess that she be originally dutch a moment later this supposition be confirm as my eye make out the name paint across the stern -- namur of rotterdam fairfax lean far out across the rail as we sweep in closer he eye search the stranger 's side for some evidence of human presence aboard but the spaniard exhibit no particular interest in the proceedings stand motionless the smoke of the cheroot blow idly from he mouth the fellow 's face be turn from I yet i could not help note the insolence of he attitude in spite of my occupation at the wheel a hundred foot distant i hold the dancing sloop to mere steerage-way while fairfax hail in a voice which go roar across the water like a gun ahoy the bark a red-faced man with a black beard thrust he head up above the after rail and answer use english yet with a faint accent which be not dutch what he look like below the shoulder could not be discern veil vat 's vant vo anyding wrong no not aboard here return fairfax a bit puzzle at the reply we run down to see if you be in any trouble this be a strange place to anchor what be you -- dutch the fellow wave he hand in a gesture indicate disgust dat 's eet ve be out ov rotterdam -- you see ze name ov ze sheep but ve not sail frum thar di time -- no ve cum here from ze barbado he explain brokenly wiz cane-sugar a ' hide ve vait here for we agent but why anchor in a place like this why not go on up to the wharf vye not for ziz -- i no trust my crew ashore zay vest indy nigger a ' vud run avay ven ze chance cum i know vat zay do in spite of my effort the two vessel be drift rapidly apart and this last explanation come to we over the water in a faint thread of sound barely discernible i ask if i should tack back but fairfax shake he head and in a moment more we be beyond reach of the voice dorothy appear at the door of the cabin and stand there gaze in surprise at the bark while the moment he catch sight of she sanchez go hastily forward remove he hat with so peculiar a flourish as he approach as to cause I to notice the gesture fairfax remain beside the rail stare out across the widening water clearly dissatisfied but finally wave he hand in a command to I to resume we course shortly after he cross the deck to the wheel and stand there beside I still watchful of the dwindle vessel already far astern what do you make of she carlyle he ask finally turn slightly to glance at my face i believe that fellow lie so do i sir i answer promptly whatever else he may be he be no peaceful dutch trader the bark be dutch build all right and no doubt once sail out of rotterdam but that fellow get he accent from south europe damn I that be just what i think nor be that all sir if he be load with cane-sugar and hide for market he would not be nearly so high out of water that bark be in ballast or i miss my guess besides if he be a trader where be he crew there be not a single head pop over the rail while we be alongside and that be not natural even a west indium nigger have curiosity i tell you the man on board that hooker have order to keep down fairfax stroke he chin he eye shift from the distant vessel to dorothy and sanchez who be now make they way slowly aft the latter grasp the girl 's arm and smirk as he talk rapidly by god but i believe you be right he admit frankly although it have not occur to I before there be something wrong there i 'll tell traver and have he send a runner overland to give warning below chapter vi fairfax speak with I sanchez draw a chair into the slight shade cast by the mainsail and induce he reluctant companion to sit down he remain bend over she with he back turn toward we chatter away although she only answer in monosyllable seldom glance up into he face with hand grip the spoke of the wheel and my attention concentrate on the course ahead i could yet notice how closely fairfax be observe the two with no pleasant expression in he eye and forgetful that i be merely a servant i venture a question you have know senor sanchez for some time sir he start in surprise yet answer as though the unexpected query have be merely a echo of he own thought no he admit frankly indeed i hardly know how it happen that i invite he to join we party it seem natural enough then but lately i confess to have take a dislike to the fellow and have begin to imagine that he even push he way on I but he stop suddenly realize what he be say why do you ask i be not wholly prepare to say yet as instantly comprehend the prompt necessity of advance some reasonable explanation there come to I swiftly from the sharpness of he question the paralyze knowledge that i be a servant address my master of course it be no business of mine i confess rather lamely who you guest be i be sorry i speak it be altogether too late to say that he insist some think prompt the inquiry go on see here carlyle you be no nigger or white thief i know the difference and recognize that you be gentleman bear because i have buy you service for a term of year be no reason why you can not talk to I like a man do you know anything about this spaniard not very much sir he have see fit to threaten I on account of some row he have have with a brother of mine in england in england the duke of bucclough yes i have not the slightest knowledge of what it be all about but evidently we spanish friend get the worst of it he plan to buy I in at the sale but fortunately for I you gain possession ahead of he do you mean to say that he tell you all this it come out in a moment of anger fairfax look at I incredulously see here carlyle he exclaim bluntly i be not question you word but it be a bit difficult for I to understand why a guest of mine should indulge in angry controversy with a government prisoner send overseas for sale as a indentured servant there must have be some unusual cause have not i a right to know what that cause be without use my authority to compel a answer i hesitate but only for a moment he undoubtedly be entitle to know and besides there be nothing involved i need to conceal it be my impression sir that mistress dorothy be the unconscious cause she chance to discover I alone on deck the night before we land and hasten to tell I of you purchase it be merely a act of kindness as we have never speak together before we be still talk across the rope when sanchez come out of the cabin and join we i imagine he may not have like the interest both you and the young lady have show in I since we come aboard anyway when he find we there he be not in good humor mistress dorothy resent he language treat he coldly and finally depart leave he decidedly angry he merely vent he spite on I but he say nothing about himself -- he motive not a word sir yet it be plain to be see that he be deeply interested in you niece fairfax frown ignore the remark but do you know the man -- who he be i shake my head the memory of haley flash into my mind but as instantly dismiss as worthless fairfax would only laugh at such a vague suspicion yet why should the planter ask I such a question could it be that the spaniard be equally unknown to himself but if he have quarrel with you brother he insist unsatisfied you perhaps know something i have not see my brother in year i doubt if i would know he if we meet face to face as to this man my knowledge of he be only what little i have see and hear on board the _ romp betsy _ i answer soberly i confess a prejudice that i be unable to judge he fairly in the first place i do not like he race nor he kind but i do suppose of course that as he be you guest you consider he a man worthy you hospitality fairfax 's face redden and he must have feel the sting of these word utter as they be by the lip of he bondman i think he would turn abruptly away leave they unanswered but he be too much of a gentleman carlyle he say brusquely you have touch the exact point -- i do not know i think i do of course but what have occur on the voyage over have lead I to doubt i meet sanchez at the colonial club in london he be introduce to I by lord sandhurst as a wealthy young spaniard travel for pleasure it be understand that he bring letter of introduction to a number of high personage he know london well enjoy a wide circle of acquaintance and we become rather intimate i find he companionable and deeply interested in america which he say he have never visit finally i invite he to accompany I as a guest on my return he accept no not at once he doubt if he could break off certain business engagement in england then at a reception he chance to meet my niece and a little later decide to undertake the voyage i be incline to believe she be the determine factor very likely i admit decide now to learn all possible detail however that be not to be wonder at mistress dorothy be a exceedingly attractive young woman the look he give I be far from pleasant but she be not a girl for any swash-buckling spaniard to carry off as prize he burst out hotly god 's mercy she father would never forgive I if that happen never fear i say dryly it be not go to happen why do you say that because i have see they together and be not entirely blind watch they now -- she scarcely respond to he word he eye rest for a moment on the two but he only shake he head moodily no one know what be in the heart of a woman carlyle sanchez be fairly young handsome in a way and adventurous just the sort to attract a young girl and he possess a easy tongue more than that i have lose faith in he he be not a gentleman you surely must have reason for those word sir i exclaimed in surprise he have reveal to you he true nature during the voyage unconsciously -- yes we have have no exchange of word no controversy he be even unaware that i have observe these thing some be of very small moment perhaps unworthy of be repeat although they serve to increase my doubt as to the man 's character but two instance remain indelibly stamp on my mind the first occur when we be only three day at sea it be at night and the two of we chance to be alone on deck i be recline in the shadow of the flag locker in no mood for conversation and he be unaware of my presence as he tramp nervously back and forth suddenly he stop and reach over into the quarter-boat and when he stand up again he have the captain 's pet cat in he hand before i dream of such a thing he have hurl that helpless creature into the water astern good god a act of wanton cruelty the deliberate deed of a fiend of one who seek pleasure in suffering and the other incident be that of the same nature it be not a incident but a revelation the fellow be not only beneath he pretense of gentleness a fiend at heart but he be also a consummate liar he lead I to believe in london -- indeed he tell I so directly -- that he be totally unacquainted with america it be not true he know this entire coast even better than i do he forget himself twice in conversation with I and he be incautious enough to speak freely with captain harne the captain tell I later this begin to sound serious sir i say as he cease speak do you suspect he of any particular purpose in this deceit not at present i can only wait and learn as a spanish naval officer he may have obtain some knowledge of this coast -- but why he should have deliberately deny the possession of such information be unexplainable at present i shall watch he closely and have tell you these fact merely to put you on guard i know you to be a gentleman carlyle even though you be temporarily a servant and i feel convinced i can trust in you discretion you certainly can sir i appreciate you confidence in I then keep you eye and ear open that be all dorothy be call and yonder come sam we have yet a full hour of daylight during which little occur of special interest sam take the wheel while i eat supper sit with carr on the deck behind the galley fairfax and he guest be serve at a table within the small cabin and we have a glimpse of they and they surroundings the table prettily decorate with snowy linen and burnish silver while john in a white jacket wait upon they obsequiously linger behind he master 's chair the lieutenant seem in excellent humor laughing often and talk incessantly although it occur to I the man receive scant encouragement from the other after take back to the galley my empty pewter dish and not be recall aft to the wheel i be glad to hang idly over the rail watch the shore line slip past and permit my thought to drift back to my conversation with fairfax carr soon join I rather anxious to continue we talk and ask question but not find I particularly responsive finally depart forward leave I alone the sun by this time be rapidly sink below the fringe of tall tree on the main-land but the fresh breeze hold favorably and the little _ adele _ be make most excellent progress the water be much smoother since we have round the point we be already beyond view of the anchor bark all about be a scene of loneliness whether the search eye seek the near-by shore apparently a stretch of uninhabited wilderness densely forest or the broad extent of the bay across which no white gleam of sail be visible all alike be desert and become gloomy in the close down of night dorothy remain hide in the cabin until about the time of we approach to the rude landing at traver ' plantation whether this isolation arise from a effort to make herself more presentable or a desire to avoid further contact with the spaniard be a question when she finally emerge at roger fairfax 's call and cross the deck to where the man be there be no alteration in she dress but by that time i be busily engage with carr in reef the mainsail and she pass I by without so much as a glance of recognition meanwhile fairfax and sanchez pace restlessly back and forth converse earnestly as they smoke only occasionally pause to contemplate the shore past which we be glide in silence the only sound the ripple of water at we stem where i lean alone against the rail my eye follow the spaniard in doubt and question nor could i entirely banish from mind haley 's description of that buccaneer bear a similar name under whom he have be compel to serve through scene of crime yet in spite of my unconscious desire to connect these two together i find it simply impossible to associate this rather soft-spoken effeminate dandy with that bloody villain many of whose deed be so familiar to I the distinction be too apparent beyond all doubt this fellow conceal beneath he smile a nature entirely different from the one he now so carefully exhibit he could hate fiercely and nourish revenge and he be capable of mean cowardly cruelty he threat toward I as well as that strange incident fairfax have observe on the deck of the _ romp betsy _ evidence all this clearly yet such thing rather prove the man a revengeful coward instead of a desperate adventurer black sanchez accord to all account be a devil incarnate and no such popinjay as this maker of love could ever be change into a terror of the sea he be not of that stern stuff that it be perfectly easy for he to lie -- even natural -- be no surprise to I this seem to accord with he other characteristic nor be it altogether strange that he should be fairly familiar with these water if as he claim he have once be connect with the spanish navy which quite likely be true even if he have never visit this coast in person he might have have access to they chart and map it be well know that early spanish navigator have explore every inch of this coast line and that they tracing hastily as they have be make be the most correct in existence he memory of these might yet retain sufficient detail through which he could pretend to a knowledge much greater than he really possess no i would dismiss that think permanently from my mind as be quite impossible i feel that i have learn to judge man that my long year at sea both before the mast and in supreme command have develop this faculty so as to be depend upon i believe that i know the class to which lieutenant sanchez belong -- he be a low-born coward dangerous only through treachery wear a mask of bravado capable enough of any crime or cruelty but devoid of boldness in plan or execution a fellow i would kick with pleasure but against whom i should never expect to be oblige to draw a sword he be a snake who could never be make into a lion -- a character to despise not fear and so i dismiss he feel no longer any serious sense of danger in he presence yet fully determine to watch closely he future movement in accordance with my promise it be already quite dusk when we finally draw in beside traver ' wharf and make fast we approach have be note and traver himself -- a white-haired white-bearded man yet still hearty and vigorous attire in white duck -- be on the end of the dock to greet we together with numerous servant of every shade of color who immediately busy themselves tote luggage up the steep path lead toward the house dimly visible in the distance standing conspicuous amid a grove of tree on the summit of the bank the other follow four fellow lug with difficulty a iron-bound chest the two older man engage in earnest conversation thus leave sanchez apparently well satisfy with the opportunity alone to assist the girl except to render the sloop completely secure for the night there remain little work for we to perform on board sam find a ample supply of tobacco and pipe and the four of we pass the early evening undisturbed smoking and talk together the fellow be not uninteresting as i come to know they better and carr who i learn have be transport three year before for robbery have at one time be a soldier be prolific of reminiscence which he relate with true irish wit sam contented himself with ask I numerous question relative to the duke of monmouth whose effort to attain the throne interested he greatly and i very gladly give he all the information i possess so the time pass quickly and it must have be nearly midnight before we bring out blanket from the forecastle and lay down in any spot we choose on deck it be a fair calm night but moonless with but little wind stir and a slight haze in the air obscure the vision the window of the great house above which earlier in the evening have blaze with light be now darken and the distant sound of voice and laughter have entirely cease the only noise discernible as i lay quiet be the soft lapping of wave against the side of the sloop or about the pile support the wharf to which we be moor the other must have fall asleep immediately but my own mind remain far too active to enable I to lose consciousness at last despairing of slumber and perchance urge by some indistinct premonition of danger i sit up once more and gaze about the three man be lie not far apart close in to the galley wall merely dark shapeless shadow barely to be distinguish in the gloom with no longer any fear of disturb they i arise to my foot and step carefully past they recumbent form move silently aft toward the more open space near the wheel i have be stand there hardly a minute stare blankly out into the misty dimness of the bay when my startled eye catch glimpse of a speck of white emerge from the black shadow -- the spectral glimmer of a small sail i be scarcely convinced i have see it yet as swiftly crouch lower hide myself behind the protection of the rail instantly alert to learn the meaning of this strange apparition a instant tell I this be no deceit the strange craft sweep past so far out that those on board no doubt believe themselves beyond sight from the shore head apparently for a point of land which i vaguely remember as jut out to the northward even my eye accustom to the darkness and strain to the utmost could detect scarcely more than the faintest shadow glide silently by yet sufficient to recognize the outline of a small keel boat propel by a single lug sail and even imagine i could discern the stooped figure of a man at the helm chapter vii the lieutenant unmask i have in truth hardly more than grasp the reality of the boat 's presence -- it seem so spectral a thing amid the mist of the night -- when it have vanish utterly once more behind the curtain of darkness there be no sound to convince I my eye have not deceive that i have actually perceive a boat fly before the wind under complete control and head to the northward no echo of a voice come across the water no slight flap of sail no distant creak of pulley or groaning of rope -- merely that fleeting vision seemingly a phantom of imagination a vision bear from sea and cloud yet i know i be not deceive where the craft could be bind for what secret purpose it be afloat who be aboard be but so many unanswerable question arise in my mind i stare vainly into the darkness puzzle and uncertain impressed alone by the one control thought that some mysterious object some hidden purpose alone could account for that swift silent passage where could they have come from unless from that strange dutch bark ride at anchor off the point below the pass craft have impressed I as a ship 's boat and no craft of fisherman and if it really come from the _ namur of rotterdam _ have it be send in answer to some signal by sanchez i could think of nothing else they must have choose this late hour purposely they have doubtless endeavor to slip past we unobserved seek some more desolate spot on the coast where they might land unseen possibly deceive by the night the helmsman have approach closer to the wharf than he have intend yet nevertheless if he hold to he present course he must surely touch shore not more than five hundred yard distant in all probability that be he purpose i stand up tempt at first to arouse sam but decide almost as quickly that at present this be unnecessary i have no wish to be the occasion for laughter it would be better first to ascertain who these party be rather than create a unwarranted alarm the reasonable probability be they compose merely a party of innocent fisherman return home after a day of sport -- plantation servant possibly who have steal away unobserved be now endeavor to beach they steal boat and reach quarter without be see this theory appear far more reasonable than the other and if it prove true to arouse the sleeper on deck would only result in make I a butt for ridicule it appear safe enough for I to adventure alone and i be at least determine to assure myself as to the identity of these stranger if they have actually land it would require only a few moment to ascertain the truth and i could accomplish this fully as well by myself as though accompany by other -- indeed with less danger of discovery i quietly lowered my body over the rail and find footing on the wharf my knowledge of the path to be pursue be extremely vague for we arrival have be in the dusk of the evening so that any observation of the shore line have be quite casual i merely remember that the bluff rise rather steeply from the water 's edge the path lead upward toward the house crowning the summit turn and twist in order to render the climb easier and finally vanish entirely as it approach the crest beside this lead downward straight to the shore end of the wharf be the broad slide along which the bale and hogshead of tobacco be send hurtle on they way to market my impression remain that the strip of beach be decidedly narrow and generally border by a rather thick growth of dwarf shrub the point of land beyond clung dimly in my memory as sparsely wood taper at its outer extremity into a sand bar against which the restless wave of the bay break in line of foam the only feasible method of approach to the spot i now seek would be by follow this narrow strip of beach yet this might be attempt safely as my movement would be conceal by the darker background of the high bluff at the leave in spite of the unfamiliarity of this passage i succeed in make excellent progress advance silently along the soft sand assure i be safe from observation by reason of the intense darkness the wave lap the beach help muffle my footstep but no other sound reach my ear nor could my eye perceive the slightest movement along the water surface within reach of vision the distance prove somewhat greater than anticipate because of the deep curve in the shore and i have nearly reach the conclusion that the boat must have round the point and go on when suddenly i be bring to a halt by a voice speaking in spanish -- one of those harsh croaking voice never to be reduce to a whisper imperfect as be my knowledge of the tongue i yet manage a fair understanding of what be be say not the spot manuel of course it be do you not suppose i know the cursed fog make I run in close ashore to where i could see the sloop so as not to mistake this be the place and now there be nothing to do but wait the senor -- he will be here presently ay unless you misread the signal a somewhat more discreet but piping voice reply doubtfully i see nothing of all you tell about because you know no meaning nor read the instruction a touch of anger in the tone i tell you it be all write out in that letter bring to I from england on the _ wasp _ they be he last order and it be because of they that we anchor off the point yonder and explore this coast you see the senor touch the handkerchief to he cheek as he go forward alone -- yes surely it be that motion which bid we come here manuel once for each cursed plantation along this west coast from the point he touch the cloth to he cheek but the once and this be the first i watch for the sign with care for he be not one with whom to make a mistake dios de dios do i not know estada have i not a scar here which tell true enough and have i not receive also my lesson -- eight hour stake face upward in the sun so ` tis my very life wager on this be the place name besides ` tis prove by the sloop lie there by the wharf where then be the captain perversely unsatisfied at the house yonder on the hill -- where else he know how it would be for this be not he first visit to the bay 'twa because of he knowledge he could plan in england ti the custom of these planter to stop by night along the way and go ashore not to camp but as guest of some friend only beforehand it be not possible for he to know which plantation would be the one choose that be what he must signal you see it now clearly estada he be the same wary fox as of old never do they catch he nap proudly santa marium have i not see it try often in ten year about he plan here he write you he purpose not so much as a word merely the order what to do dio he tell nothing for he trust no man a good thing that yet i have my own thought manuel and what be that the other hesitate as though endeavor to rearrange the idea in he own mind and possibly doubtful of how much to confide to he companion when he finally reply he word come forth so swiftly i could scarcely grasp they meaning with my slight knowledge of the tongue ` tis no more than that i make a guess friend yet i have be with the captain for ten year now and know he way this planter fairfax be rich the letter say nothing of that -- no not a word but i make inquiry ashore there be no one more wealthy in these colony and he return now from london after the sale of he tobacco crop no doubt he sell for he neighbor also ` tis the way they do form a combine and send a agent to england to get the best price he will surely bear back with he a great sum this the senor know nor be it the first time he have do the trick manuel santa marium ` tis the easiest one of all then there be the girl the one who be aboard the sloop of course i know nothing of she but i have keen eye and i have be long with the senor marked you not how he approach she no sea rover ever have greater desire for woman or win they easier ` tis a bright eye and red lip that win he from all else even to I this one look a rare beauty yet be i sorry he find she for it may delay the task here why must you fear that bah but you be stupid who will take by force what may be win by a few soft word he pause suddenly evidently strike by a new thought yet i think manuel the captain may have fail in this case i watch they greet and she 's be not that of love if this be true we strike at once while it be safe here you mean -- tonight and why not here and tonight be there a better spot or time with another night the sloop will be far up the bay while now from where we be anchor we could be beyond the cape by daybreak with the broad ocean before we we be five -- six with the senor -- and we ship lie but a short league away ready for sea there be only four man on the sloop with some servant above -- spiritless fellow why else should he have signal we come unless there be work to do that will be the plan to my notion -- the money and the girl in one swoop then a quick sail to the southward pist ` tis boy ' play the other seem to lick he lip as though the picture thus draw greatly pleased he gracioso dios i hope ` tis so it have be dull enough here this month past i be for blue water and a english ship to sack or better yet a week at porto grande -- hey manuel the girl be not so bad with clink of gold in the pocket after a cruise wait though -- there be someone come down i crouch backward into the bush and a moment later the newcomer move past I scarcely a yard distant along the narrow strip of sand he appear no more than a black shadow wrap in a loose cloak thus render so shapeless as to be scarcely recognizable directly opposite my covert he pause peer forward in uncertainty estada he speak the name cautiously and in doubt ay captain and another figure also shapeless and ill-defined emerge noiselessly from the gloom we await you good the tone one of relief i rather question if you catch my signal i be watch and oblige to exercise care how many have you here four senor with manuel estevan quite sufficient and how about the other all safely aboard senor asleep in they bunk by now but ready francoi levere have charge of the deck watch ah how happen it the quadroon be with you a good choice yet that must mean the _ vengeance _ be still at porto grande for what reason because of greater injury than we suppose captain there be two shot in she below the water line and to get at they we be oblige to beach she levere come with we expect this job would be do before now for by this time the schooner should be in water again she side scrape clean of barnacle fit for any cruise we have be wait for you along this coast for several week yes i know the boat we intend to take meet with a accident while the one we do take prove the slowest tub that ever sail how be it here be there suspicion none senor we have cruise outside most of the time only once be we hail while manuel with a boat crew be ashore for nearly a week pick up such news as he might there be no warship in these water so i discover on landing indeed i be tell as much in england however you disguise be perfect estada laugh there be no mistaking where the _ namur _ come from senor she be holland from keel to topmast but the best sailing dutchman i ever see you say you be be watch on the sloop be you know the other utter a oath snarl through he tooth ` tis nothing he explain contemptuously no more than the bite of a harmless snake in the grass a dog of a servant who come over with we -- one of monmouth 's brood he have no knowledge of who i be nor suspicion of my purpose it be not that yet the fellow watch I like a hawk we have some word aboard and there be hate between we if he be indentured how come he on the sloop fairfax buy he the fellow win the interest of the girl come over and she intercede in he behalf it be my plan to get he into my own hand i would have teach he a lesson but the papers be sign before we land yet the lad be not through with I i do not let go in a hurry may i ask you you plan senor yes i be here to explain be we out of ear-shot none can hear we manuel have go back to the boat then listen this planter fairfax have return from england with a large sum it be in gold and note i have be unable to learn the exact amount but it represent the proceeds in cash of the tobacco crop of himself and a number of he neighbor they pool and make he they agent without doubt from all i could ascertain it will be upward of fifty thousand pound -- not a bad bit of pocket money this still remain in he possession but a part will be disperse tomorrow so if we hope to gain the whole we must do so now fifty thousand pound you say gracioso dio a sum worth fight for ay we have do some hard fighting for less it be here under we very hand and there could be no better place than this in which to take it everything be ready and there be not the slightest suspicion of danger -- not even a guard set over the treasure i assure myself of this before come down then it be at the house in a iron-bound chest carry up from the sloop and place in the room assign to fairfax for the night he consider it perfectly safe under he bed but before we attempt reach this we must attend to those man leave below on the boat they be the only dangerous one for there be none of the fight sort up above only two servant sleep in the main house the cook and a maid both woman the other be in the slave quarter a half mile away fairfax be vigorous and will put up a fight if he have any chance he must be take care of before he do have any traver

over the house and draw a rude diagram you can look it over in the cabin of the sloop after affair have be attend to there the stair lead up from the front hall i will go with you to the door of fairfax 's room estada hesitate as though afraid to further question he chief yet finally in spite of this fear the query break from he lip and you senor -- the girl what know you of any girl that there be one on the deck of the sloop -- a english beauty it be when you turn to greet she that you give I the signal i merely think that perhaps -- then stop think burst forth sanchez enraged thinking have nothing to do with you work if there be a girl i attend to she let that suffice dio be i chief here or be you you have my order now obey they and hold you tongue bring the man up here without a word evidently glad to escape thus easily estada vanish into the gloom leave behind only the vague figure of sanchez pacing the sand he lip mutter curse i dare not move scarcely indeed to breathe so closely do he skirt my covert to venture forth would mean certain discovery nor could i hope to steal away through the bush where any twig might snap beneath my foot what could i do how could i bring warn to those sleep victim this heartless discussion of robbery and murder leave I cold with horror yet helpless to lift a hand i have no thought of myself of my possible fate when once deliver into the hand of this monster this arch villain but all my agony of mind center on the imminent danger confront dorothy fairfax and those unsuspecting man all my preconceived impression of sanchez have vanish he be no longer in my imagination a weakling a boastful cowardly bravado a love-sick fool but a leader of desperate man a villain of the deepest dye -- the dreaded pirate black sanchez whose deed of crime be without number and whose name be infamous confront by fairfax 's ill-guarded gold madden by the girl 's contemptuous indifference no deed of violence and blood be too revolting for he to commit what he could not win by word he would seize by force and make he own as coolly as another might sell a bolt of cloth he would plan murder and rape and then smilingly watch the execution and i -- what could i do the little band of man emerge from the concealment of the fog noiselessly and gather into a group about the figure of sanchez where he stand motionless await they i could distinguish no face scarcely indeed the outline of they separate form in the gloom but one be a unusually big fellow far taller and heavier than he companion when he speak he possess a negro 's voice and i recognize he at once for cochose the captain sweep he impatient eye about the circle lad he say incisively a sharper note of leadership in the tone it have be a bit quiet for you lately but now i be back again and we 'll try we luck at sea once more there must be many a laden ship wait for we do that sound good there be a savage growl of response a sudden lean forward of dark figure i think it would we 'll begin on a job tonight there be fifty thousand pound for we in that house yonder and i waive my share estada will explain to you the work i want do see that you do it quietly and well by daylight we shall be on blue water with we course set for porto grande how be it bully do you sniff the salt sea ay ay captain and see the pretty girl wait -- and hear the chink of gold ay senor then do not fail I tonight -- and remember it be to be the knife estada here senor i have forget one thing -- scuttle the sloop before join I ` tis better to make all safe and now strong arm and good luck go to you task and if one fail I it will mean the lash at the mast-butt they move off one by one estada lead along the narrow strip of sand five of they on they mission of murder the leader remain alone he back toward where i crouch he eye follow they vanish figure until the night have swallow they chapter viii a victory and a defeat i arise silently to my foot conscious of possess no weapon yet fully aware that all hope of thwart this villainy lay in immediate action but i must await the right moment even with the advantage of surprise there would inevitably be the noise of struggle i have in the past despise sanchez but i have never yet test he as a fight man and indeed no longer consider the fellow to be a mean antagonist remember who he be i now realize fully the desperate nature of my attempt the need of quick remorseless action nevertheless i dare not attack until assure that those man he have just dispatch be safely beyond ear-shot i could hear or see nothing of they they have vanish utterly and the soft sand return no echo of they footstep time alone give I judgment as to the distance they would travel if i yield too much of this they might attain the sloop before i could sound a alarm while if i move too quickly the noise would bring they back to the rescue the moment be agony as i bent tensely forward poise for a leap god i could wait no longer sanchez have turn slightly apparently immerse in thought and stand with he face toward the bay even in that darkness he position be that of a man intently listen for the slightest sound to reach he out of the black night i venture a cautious step forward and stand on the open sand scarcely a yard to he rear every nerve throb my lip still silently count the seconds i could not i dare not wait longer some vague sense of my presence must have influence the man for he swing suddenly about utter a stifled cry of startled surprise as we meet face to face for a instant we be lock so closely within each other 's desperate grip he head bent beneath my arm with my finger clutch at he throat to block any call for help that he possess no knowledge of he assailant 's identity but the man be like a tiger possess of immense strength encase in a wiry frame the surprise of attack be to my advantage yet almost before i realize what be be do he have rally broken my first hold and he eye be glare straight into mine then he know I signal he discovery with a oath he free hand instantly grasp at the knife conceal beneath he loose cloak even as he jerk it forth i crush he wrist within my finger force he fore-arm back breast to breast we wrestle for mastery every muscle strain we foot firm plant on the sand there be no outcry no noise except that of we heavy breathing and trample foot personal hatred have ascendancy in both we heart -- i doubt if he ever think of aught else but the desire to kill I there with he own hand only once do he even utter a word hiss out the sentence as though it be a poison : to hell with you you sneak english cur then i travel that road not alone i mutter back there will be one less of the devil 's brood afloat what follow have to I no clearness no consistency i remember yet it be as though memory play I a thousand trick never have i fight more wickedly nor with deeper realization that i need every ounce of strength and every trick of wit and skill i have not before dream he be such a man but now i know the fellow possess greater knowledge of the game than i and a quicker movement i alone excel in weight of body and coolness of brain he effort be those of a infuriate animal he uncontrolled outburst of hatred render he utterly reckless of result in he struggle to overcome I at any cost it be this blind blood-lust which give I victory i know not clearly how it be do my only memory be he frantic effort to drive home the knife point and mine to defeat the thrust twice he prick I deep enough to draw blood before i succeed in twist backward the arm with which he hold the blade it be a sailor 's trick of last resort heartlessly cruel in its agony but i feel then no call to mercy he meet the game too late fall half back upon one knee hope thus to foil my purpose yet my greater weight save I there be the sharp crack of a bone as he useless finger let the knife drop a snarled curse of pain and then with the rage of a mad dog sanchez strike he tooth deep into my cheek the sharp pang of pain drive I to frenzy and for the first time i lose all control my one free hand seek to reach the lose knife with a thrill of exultation i grip it drive instantly the keen blade to its hilt into the man 's side he make no cry no struggle -- the set tooth unlock and he fall limply back on the sand he head lap by the wave i remain poise above he spend and breathless from struggle scarcely conscious even as to what have occur so swiftly the drip knife in my hand blood streaming down my cheek and still infuriate by blind passion the fellow lay motionless he face upturn to the sky but invisible except in dim outline it do not seem possible he could actually be dead i have strike blindly with no knowledge as to where the keen blade have penetrate -- a mere desperate lunge i rest my ear over he heart detect no murmur of response touch the vein of he wrist but find there no answering throb of life still daze and uncertain i arise stagger to my foot conscious at last that the man must actually be dead yet for the moment so surprised by the discovery as to scarcely realize its significance not that i regret the act not that i experience the slightest remorse yet for a instant the shock seem to leave I nerveless and unstrung only a moment since i be engage in desperate struggle and now i could only stare down at the dark line of that motionless body outstretch upon the sand then i remember those other -- the unconscious sleeper on the deck of the sloop those blood-stained villain creep toward they through the black shadow of the night the memory be like a dash of water in the face with the death-dealing knife still grip in my hand i race forward along the narrow strip of sand reckless of what i might encounter eager only to arrive in time to give utterance to a shout of warn i could not have cover more than half the distance when the first sound of attack reach I -- far-off gurgling cry of agony which pierce the darkness like the scream of a die soul the heart leap into my throat yet i run on unhalted unseen until the plank of the wharf be beneath my foot the low side of the sloop loom black before I there be confusion aboard the sound of struggle mingle with curse and blow with one upward swing of my body i be safely aboard knife still in hand peer eagerly forward through the gloom conceal the deck i could perceive only dim figure a riot of man battle furiously hand to hand yet out of the ruck loom through the darkness in larger outline than the other -- cochose the negro i leap at the fellow and strike with the keen knife miss the heart but plunge the blade deep into the flesh of the shoulder the next instant i be in a bear 's grip the very breath crush out of I yet by some chance my one arm remain free and i drive the sharp steel into he twice before he force the weapon from my finger through a wrestler 's trick although my wrist be as numb as if dead from he fierce grip i thrust a elbow beneath the brute 's chin and thus force he head back until the neck crack this respite serve merely for the moment yet sufficiently long to win I a firm foot-hold on deck and a breath of night air he be too strong too immense of stature apparently unweakened by he wound the giant negro thoroughly arouse exert he mighty muscle and despite my utmost effort at resistance thrust I back against the stern rail where the weight of he body pin I helplessly with a roar of rage he drive he huge fist into my face but happily be too close to give much force to the blow my own hand grip the neck-band of he coarse shirt twist it tight about the great throat until in desperation panting for breath the huge brute actually lift I in he arm and hurl I backward headlong over the rail i strike something as i fall yet rebound from this splash into the deep water and go down so nearly unconscious as to make not even the slightest struggle i have no strength leave in I no desire to save myself and i sink like a stone and yet i come up once more to the surface arise by sheer chance directly beneath the small dory -- which my body must have strike as i fall -- tow by a painter astern of the sloop and fortunately retain sense enough to cling desperately to this first thing my hand touch and thus remain conceal this occur through complete exhaustion rather than the exercise of any judgment for have it not be for this providential support i would surely have drown without a struggle every breath i draw be in pain i feel as though my rib have be crush in while i have lose sufficient blood to leave I as weak as a babe i simply cling there desperately hopelessly yet the salt water soon serve to revive I physically and even my brain begin to arouse from its daze to a faint realization of the condition the small dory to which i clung catch in some mysterious current float at the very extremity of its slender towline and in consequence the sloop appear little more than a mere smudge when my eye endeavor to discover its outline evidently the bloody work have be complete for now all be silent on board i could not even detect the sound of a footstep on the deck then clear enough to be distinctly hear across the narrow strip of water come the voice of estada in a gruff inquiry : so you be hide here cochose what be you look for in the sea what why that damned englishman the response be a savage growl intensify by husky dialect mon dieu he fight I like a mad rat the englishman you say he be here then it be he you battle with what become of the fellow he go down there senor the dog stab I three time it be either he or i to go you mean you throw he overboard ay with he rib crush in and not a breath leave in he damned body he be never come up even -- i have watch and there have not be so much as a ripple where he sink the two must have hang in silence over the rail stare down i dare not advance my head to look nor even move a muscle of my body in the water but both be still stand there when estada finally give utterance to a oath how know you it be the man who else could it have be you have the other ay true enough yet it will go hard with you cochose when the captain learn of this -- he would have the fellow alive as well attempt to take a tiger with bare hand -- see the blood yet run a single inch to the left and it would be i feed to the fish pah what be the difference senor so the man die right enough no doubt anyway it be not i who must face sanchez and it be too late now to change fate let 's to the rest of we task you can still do you part the giant negro growl ay i have be worse hurt yet a bit of cloth would help I let carl see to that while i gain glimpse at this map of the house up yonder come forward with I to the cabin till i light a candle how come you aft here because that fellow leap the rail from the wharf i see he and we meet at the wheel from the wharf you say he be not aboard then santa marium i know not what that may mean yet what difference so he be dead anderson mendez throw that carrion overboard -- no bully never mind let they lie where they be and sink a auger in the sloop 's bottom that will settle the whole matter what be that out yonder cochose a small boat senor -- a dory i make it cut the rope and send it adrift now come along with I the darker loom of the sloop vanish slowly as the slight current sweeping about the end of the wharf drift the release boat to which i clung outward into the bay the faint echo of a voice float to my ear across the widen expanse of water and then all be silent as the night close in darkly between there be scarcely a ripple to the sea and yet i feel that the boat be steadily drift out into deeper water i be still strangely weak barely able to retain my grasp with a peculiar dullness in my head which make I fearful that at any moment i might let go i be not even conscious of think or capable of conceive clearly my situation yet i must have realize vaguely the immediate necessity of action for finally i mustered every ounce of remain energy in one supreme effort and succeed in drag my body up out of water over the boat 's stern sinking helplessly forward into the bottom the moment this be accomplish every sense desert I and i lay there motionless totally unconscious i shall never know how long i remain thus the little dory in which i lay rock aimlessly about by the wave and constantly drift in the grasp of unseen current farther and farther out into the bay the blackness of the night swallow we as toss by wind and sea we be bear on through the waste unguided yet this time could not have be great as though awaken from sleep a faint consciousness return cause I to lift my head and stare hopelessly about into the curtain of mist overhang the water at first with nothing surround to awaken memory into action only that dull vista of sea and sky my mind refuse to respond to any impression then the sharp pain of my wound accent by the sting of salt water bring I swift realization of where i be and the circumstance bring I there my wet clothing have partially dry on my body as i lay there motionless in the bottom of the boat and now with every movement chafe the raw spot render the slightest motion a physical agony i have evidently lose considerable blood yet this have already cease to flow and a very slight examination serve to convince I that the knife slash be none of they serious beyond these puncture of the flesh while i ached from head to foot my other injury be merely bruise to add to my discomfort -- the result of blow deal I by sanchez and cochose aggravate by the bearlike hug of the giant negro indeed i awake to the discovery that i be far from be a dead man and inspire by this knowledge the various incident of the night flash swiftly back into my mind how long have i be lie there unconscious adrift in the open boat how far have we float from land where be we now and in the meantime what have occur ashore these be question impossible to answer i could not even attempt they solution no gleam of light appear in any direction no sound echo across the dark waste of water far above barely visible through a float veil of haze i be able to detect the faint gleam of star and be sailor enough to determine through they guidance some certainty as to the point of compass yet possess no means by which to ascertain the time of night or the position of the boat with this handicap it be clearly impossible for I to attempt any return to the wharf through the impenetrable black curtain which shut I in what then could i do what might i still hope to accomplish at first think the case appear hopeless those fellow have sweep the sloop clean and have doubtless long ago scuttle it this ruthless deed once accomplish they order be to raid the house on the bluff but would they go on with they bloody work they would suddenly find themselves leaderless unguided would that suffice to stop they the vivid memory come to I anew of that arch villain sanchez lie where i have leave he he head rest in the surf -- dead would the discovery of he body halt he follower and send they rush back to they boat eager only to get safely away this do not seem likely estada know of my board the sloop from the wharf and would at once connect the fact of my be ashore with the killing of sanchez this would satisfy he there be no further danger besides these be not man to be easily frighten at sight of a dead body even that of they own captain they might hesitate discuss but they would never flee in panic surely not with that ruffian estada yet alive to lead they and the knowledge that fifty thousand pound be yonder in that unguarded house with no one to protect the treasure but two old man asleep and the woman the woman -- dorothy what would become of she into whose hand would she fall in that foul division of spoil estada 's good god -- yes and i afloat and helpless in this boat what could i do chapter ix a swim to the namur all be black hopeless with head bury in my hand i sit on a thwart dazed and stupefied seemingly even unable to think clearly before I plead expressive of agonized despair arise the sweet face of dorothy fairfax nothing else count with I at that moment but she safety -- the protect she from the touch of that blood-stained brute yet how and through what means could such rescue be accomplish no doubt by this time all be over -- the dead body of sanchez discover the project attack on the house carry out the two old man leave behind either dead or severely wound and the girl bear off a helpless prisoner together with the treasure of fifty thousand pound even if i know where the drift boat have take I which way to turn to once again attain the wharf the probability remain that i should arrive altogether too late to be of slightest service -- the dastardly deed have already be accomplish ay but this i know there be only one place to which the villain might flee with they booty -- the _ namur of rotterdam _ only on those deck and well at sea would they be safe or able to enjoy they spoil the thought come to I in sudden revelation -- why not be not here a chance even yet to foil they with sanchez dead no man aboard that pirate craft would recognize I i feel assure of this i have fight the giant negro in the dark he could not during that fierce encounter have distinguish my feature any more clearly than i have he own there be no one else to fear although i have be station at the wheel of the sloop as we sweep past the _ namur _ while at anchor the day before yet estada watch anxiously for the secret signal of he chief would never have accord I so much as a glance he interest be concentrated elsewhere and in all probability he could not swear whether i be black or white if other of that devilish crew have be secretly watch we deck it be with no thought of I and not one of they would retain any memory of my appearance if only i might once succeed in get safely aboard slightly disguise perhaps and mingle unnoticed among the crew the chance be not bad for I to pass undetected no doubt they be a heterogeneous bunch draw from every breed and race and in no small force either for they trade be not so much seamanship as rapine and fight such ship carry large crew and be constantly change in personnel a strange face appear among they need not arouse undue suspicion from what estada have report to sanchez i know boat have be send ashore on this coast what more likely then than that some new recruit have return to the bark attract by a sailor 's tale who would know how the stranger come among they or question he presence unless suspicion become arouse even if question a good story easily tell might win the trick before daylight come and already well at sea beyond pursuit inconspicuous among the other accept as mate by the man unrecognized even by the officer there be scarcely a probability that anyone aboard would note or question my presence and i feel convinced i could locate the _ namur _ ay even in that darkness i could find the bark if the vessel yet swing at she former anchorage the task would not even be a difficult one the star give I the compass point and i recall with some clearness the general trend of the coast line as we come up but could i hope to attain the ship in advance of the return party of raider to succeed in my object this must be do because the moment these reach the deck the bark would hastily depart for the open sea and if i be to accomplish this end it must be attempt at once the call to action the possibility of thus be of service to dorothy seem instantly to awaken all my dormant energy the painful chafing of my wound be forget while new strength return miraculously to my bruised body god help I i would try my brain throb with fresh resolution -- the call to action there be oar in the boat i have notice these dumbly before but now i draw they eagerly forth from the bottom and quickly fit they into the oarlock they be stout ashen blade unusually large for the craft in which they have be stow yet workable the boat itself be a mere shell scarcely capable of sustain safely more than three person but with line of speed its sharp prow cut the water like a knife blade i ship the useless rudder inboard and choose my course from the star the north star be completely obscure by thick cloud but the great dipper give I my bearing with sufficient accuracy to attain again to the west coast not far from where the great point project outward into the bay and behind which the bark swing at anchor require accord to my understanding of we present position that i head the boat toward the southwest i bent earnestly to the oar and the speed of the craft be most encouraging especially as my strength and energy seem to increase with each stroke my mind brighten also quite perceptibly as the violent exercise send the blood course anew through my vein before i realize the change i have become thoroughly convince that the course i have choose be the wisest one possible it be wild and desperate to be sure i be not blind to its danger and yet nothing else offer any solution the only probable chance now for I to prove of direct service to the captive girl lay in be near she while she remain with these man if by any good fortune she have thus far succeed in escape from estada and he gang of ruffian i would learn this fact more surely aboard the _ namur _ than in any other way and once assure as to this could certainly find some means of early escape from the ship while if she be capture and take aboard as be most probable for I to be leave behind on shore would mean she total abandonment better any risk of discovery than that to be sure i have no plan of action devise no conception of how a rescue could be effect yet such a opportunity might develop and my one hope lay in be prepare and ready with the death of sanchez he second in command would undoubtedly succeed he but would that be estada or would it be this other the mulatto francoi levere more likely the former for while buccaneer have operate under color chief a crew of white man would naturally prefer to be lead by one of they own color indeed it be even possible that a controversy might arise and a divide authority result discipline among such as these depend entirely on strength and ferocity the most daring and resourceful become the choose leader whose only test be success perhaps in the turmoil and uncertainty arise from a knowledge of sanchez 's death and the jealousy thus arouse between those who would succeed he in command i might discover the very opportunity i seek these be some of the thought which animated I and give new strength to my arm as i send the dory fly through the water my boat unguide have drift considerably farther out into the bay than i have suppose and it require a good half hour of steady toil at the oar before i sighted ahead of I the darker outline of the shore nothing have cross we path and no unusual sound have reach my ear along the black water if the _ namur 's _ boat have already return to the bark its passage must have be make during the period of my unconsciousness and this seem to I utterly impossible the course i have follow thus far take I directly across the water which they would be compel to traverse and they could not have pass unnoticed no they be surely yet in the neighborhood of traver ' plantation the man engage in that night 's bloody business would have be compel to carry it out under many obstacle they would be delay by consternation at the discovery of they dead leader lie on the sand and by they lack of knowledge regard the interior of the house on the summit of the bluff quite likely also this lack of a guide would result in a alarm and consequent struggle perhaps even in the serious injury of some among they before they secure possession of the money and the girl in any case it must have result in delay convinced of this and confident that i be already well in advance of they i draw in as closely as i dare to the dim outline of shore and study it carefully in a endeavor to learn my exact position although the sloop in its voyage up the bay have never be out of sight of this coast have indeed skirt it closely all the way yet my memory of its more prominent landmark be extremely vague i have make no effort to impress they on my mind therefore at first i could identify nothing but finally out of the grotesque shift shadow dimly appear against the slightly lighter sky beyond there suddenly arise clearly define the gaunt limb of a dead tree bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic cross i recall that sam have chance to point this out to I on we upward voyage and this glimpse obtain of it again now tell I exactly where i have make shore this peculiar mark be at the extremity of the first headland lie north of the point itself and consequently a straight course across the bay would land I within five hundred yard of where the _ namur _ have last be see at anchor to a degree my immediate plan of action have be definitely map out within my own mind while toiling at the oar at least i have arrive at certain conclusion the one immediate object before I be to attain the bark in advance of estada i now be convince that thus far i be safely ahead the night wind be light and baffling not greatly affect my own progress but of a nature to retard considerably the sail-boat and compel a series of wide tack so as to enable those on board to round the point all this distance i could avoid by beach my dory and strike out on foot directly across the narrow neck of land the _ namur _ unless she position have be change since darkness set in be not so far out from shore as to make swim to she a dangerous feat and i could approach and board she with far less chance of discovery in that manner than by the use of a boat the watch on deck would undoubtedly be a vigilant one yet no eye could detect through that darkness -- unless by sheer accident -- a submerged swimmer cautiously advance with silent stroke the greater danger would come after i have attain the deck wet to the skin the sharp bow of the dory run up on the soft sand of the beach and i step ashore haul the light boat after I beyond the reach of the wave the night remain calm and still although the scud cloud be thicken overhead until scarcely a single star remain visible the sea behind I be overhang by a black curtain yet by bend low i could look along the surface for some distance where the heave water reflect from wave to wave what little light there be the beach be a narrow one and only a few foot away the neck of land become elevated into a level crest thickly cover with tree they upper branch dimly visible from where i stand judge from the trend of the coast it would be necessary for I to strike directly across to the opposite shore but in this journey special caution be not require there would be no one in the midst of this desolate region to interfere with my progress or be alarm by any noise i might make close to shore as the _ namur _ lay no ordinary sound from the land could be hear aboard even in the silence of night nor be it likely the crew would be watchful in that direction unquestionably the entire attention of the deck watch at this hour would be concentrate on the expect return of they expedition around the distant point -- seek the glimpse of a white sail above the black water to the best of my recollection the bark float with bow point toward the open sea the sweep of the current about the point be inshore make the drift of the vessel strong against the anchor hawser this would naturally bring she with broadside to the eastward from which direction the absent boat must return if this proved correct then in all probability the deck watch would largely be gather on that side even the attention of the officer more or less draw in that direction no doubt they have order to be ready for instant departure the moment the approach boat be sight and the lookout for it would be keen it be as i stand there revolve these matter in my mind with eye endeavor to pierce the surround darkness and ear strain to detect the slightest sound that there come to I the first real consciousness of the reckless nature of this adventure upon which i have so lightly embark surely it be but the dream of a crazed man foredoom to failure as i face then the probability there scarcely seem one chance in a hundred that any such scheme as i propose would succeed and yet i must admit there be the one chance and in no other action could i perceive even that much encouragement if dorothy fairfax be already in the hand of these man then my only opportunity for serve she lay in my be close at hand no alternative present itself no other effort could be effective it be already too late to attempt the organization of a rescue party there be no warship on the coast and the authority of the colony possess no vessel fit for pursuit long before daylight come or i might hope to spread a alarm abroad the _ namur _ would be safely at sea no the only choice leave be for I either to accompany the girl or else abandon she entirely to she captor i must either face the possibility of discovery and capture which as surely mean torture and death or otherwise play the coward and remain impotently behind there be no safe course to pursue i believe that i could play my part among the crew once securely establish among they that i could succeed in escape recognition even on the part of cochose if this be true then to a stout heart and ready hand a way might open even aboard the bark to protect she from the final closing of the devil 's jaw i have nothing to risk but my life and it have never be my nature to count odds i would act as the heart bade and so i drive the temptation to falter away and stride on up the bank into the black shadow of the tree i find extremely hard walking as i advance through tangled underbrush over unlevel ground the night so dark in those shadow i could but barely perceive the outline of a hand hold before the eye fortunately the distance be even shorter than i have anticipate but when i finally emerge upon the opposite beach it be at once quite evident that the sea beating upon the sand be decidedly heavier than higher up the bay the white line of breaker show conspicuously even in the night while they continuous roar sound loud through the silence it be not until after i have advance cautiously into the water and then stoop low to thus gain clearer vision along the surface that i succeed in locate the vessel seek even then the _ namur _ appear only as a mere shadow without so much as a light show aboard yet apparently anchor in the same position as when we have sweep past the previous afternoon the slightly brighter sky above serve to reveal the tracery of bare pole while the hull be no more than a blot in the gloom utterly shapeless and appear to be much farther away than it be in reality indeed as the sky gradually darken the entire vision vanish as though it have be one of those strange mirage i have see in the african desert yet i know with certainty the ship be there have sufficient time in which to mark its position accurately and rejoice at the increase of darkness to conceal my approach guide by this memory i wade straight out through the line of surf until all except the head become completely submerge if i be to reach the bark at all this be the one opportunity i stand there resist the undertow tug at my limb and barely able to retain my footing intent upon my purpose full strength have come back to my muscle and my head be again clear the imminent sense of danger seem to bring I a feeling of happiness of new confidence in myself the die be cast and whatever the result i be go ahead to accomplish all that be humanly possible from now on there be to be no doubt no turn back a voice high-pitched echo to I across the water reach my ear a mere thread of sound the word indistinguishable it must have be a order for a moment later i distinguish the clank of capstan bar as though man of the crew be engage in warp the vessel off shore for greater safety the movement be too deliberate and noiseless to mean the lifting of the anchor nor be it accompany by any flap of sail or shift of yard to denote departure nevertheless even this movement decide I to delay my attempt no longer and with strong silent stroke i swam forward directly breast the force of the incoming sea yet make fair progress some unconsidered current must have sweep I to the right for when the outline of the bark again become dimly visible through the night i find myself well to starboard of the vessel and quite likely would have pass it by altogether but for the sudden rattle of a block aloft cause I to glance in that direction as my eye explore the darkness yet uncertain that i really behold the _ namur _ a light flare for a brief instant and i have glimpse of a face illumine by the yellow glare as the single spark of flame ignite a cigarette it be all over with so swiftly swallow up in that blackness as to seem a vision of imagination yet i know it to be real stroke well under water and with only my eye expose above the surface i change my course to the left and slowly and cautiously draw in toward the starboard bow a few moment later unperceived from above and protect from observation by the bulge of the overhang and density of shadow my hand cling to the anchor hawser my mind busy in devise some means for attain the deck chapter x on the deck of the namur it be here that fortune favor I strengthen my decision and yield a fresh courage to persevere the pound of the sea against the bow render other sound for the moment unnoticeable while the current sweep so strongly against my submerged body as to compel I to cling tightly to the sway rope to prevent be overcome close as i be the bark appear scarcely more than a dense shadow sway above I without special form and unrevealed by the slightest gleam of light merely a vast bulk tower between sea and sky fork out however directly over where i clung desperately to the wet hawser my eye be able to trace the bow-sprit a massive bit of timber with rope faintly trace against the sky the rather loosely furl jib flap ragged edge in the gust of wind suddenly as i stare upward i become aware that two man be work they way out along the foot-rope and as they reach a point almost directly over my head become busily engage in tighten the gasket to better secure the loosen sail the foot of one slip and he hang dangling give vent to a stiff english oath before he succeed in haul himself back to safety the other indulge in a chuckle laugh yet be careful not to speak loudly have one drink too many tom he ask that will pay yer fer finishin ' the bottle a ' never

two vaguely distinguishable figure disappear clamber awkwardly over the rail and as instantly vanish into the blackness of the bark 's deck a unsecured bit of canvas continue to flap noisily above I and the constant surge of water pound against the bow but i could perceive now clearly the character i be destine to assume when once safely aboard the _ namur _ such a assumption would involve but slight danger of discovery it be as though a miracle have open the way reveal to I by the unconscious lip of these two half-drunken gossip sailor the story tell fitted my necessity exactly have i plan the circumstance myself nothing could have be better prearranged no one on board have see the miss man by daylight if a impression of he feature remain in any individual mind it must be extremely vague and valueless bill 's conviction that the man be english and probably a sailor be the most definite and he have have greater opportunity closely to observe the stranger than anyone else levere have obtain no more than a glimpse of he opponent during they struggle in the dark and while fight for he life surely it would be easy enough to obscure any faint impression thus acquire and the fellow have be heartlessly fling overboard be believe to have sink without a struggle too drunk to save himself be scarcely give another thought yet no one know positively that this be so because no one care the death of the lad have simply be take for grant when levere fail to see he body rise again to the surface yet it be quite within the realm of possibility for the fellow to come up once more in that darkness beyond levere 's range of vision and even to have remain afloat buoy up by cling to the anchor hawser until strong enough to return on board at least there be no one aboard the _ namur _ able to deny that this have be do satisfy by this reasoning of be able to pass myself off as the dead man with small danger of detection and likewise assure -- so far at least as eye and ear testify -- that none of the crew be group on the forecastle to be attract by my movement i begin slowly and cautiously to drag myself up the taut hawser hope thus to attain a position from which to gain hand-hold on the rail and thus attain the deck unseen while my explanation might suffice i greatly prefer have to present it only as a last resort i would much rather slip quietly aboard and mingle unnoticed with the crew for the next few hour than be hale at once before levere and endure he scrutiny and possible violence the fellow be evidently a brute and a hard master seemingly i have choose a fortunate moment for my effort no one heed the little noise i make and when i finally top the rail and be able to look inboard it be to discover a desert fore deck with the watch all engage at some task amidship there be no gleam of light but i could hear the patter of foot and imagine see dim move figure a rather high-pitched voice be give order and enough of he word reach I to convince that other man be aloft on the main yard believe my best policy would be to join those busy on deck just as though i belong among they i creep down the forecastle ladder and work my way aft beneath the black shadow of the port rail until able thus to drift unnoticed into a group tail on to a mainsail halliard the fellow next to I without release he grip turn he head and stare but without discerning my feature whar the hell do yer cum ' frum he growl and i as instantly recognize bill haine be sojerin ' have yer well now damn yer eye lay too a ' pull before i could attempt a answer a tall figure loom up before we the same high-pitched voice i have notice previously call out sharply : there that be enough man now make fast we can head the old girl out from here in a jiffy if it really begin to blow jose you stand by at the wheel in case you be need some of the rest ship the capstan bar and remain near for a call discipline on board must have be somewhat lax or else haine hold some minor official position which give he unusual privilege for while the other instantly separate to carry out these order he remain motionless confront the man i suppose to be the mulatto levere my own position be such i could not press past the two without attract attention what be ye swingin ' the yard fer enyhow ask the sailor insolently just fer exercise the other who already have start to turn away stop and take a step backward toward he questioner because i be a sailor haine he reply angrily anyhow it be none of you business i be leave in command here those cloud do not look good to I there be go to be a blow before morning then it be yer intention ter work out ` er this yere berth it be my intention to be ready if it become necessary there be no regular officer leave aboard but just the same i be not go to let this bark pile up on those rock yonder we 'll hang on here for another half hour maybe and then if the long-boat do not show up we 'll work further off shore until daylight that be sensible be not it haine growl something inaudible to I but evidently accept as a assent and levere still in no good humor from the question wheel sharply about to go forward this movement place he face to face with I what be you loaf here for he burst forth no doubt glad to thus vent he anger on someone who the hell be you joe gate sir i answer quickly mouth the first name which come to my lip gate -- joe gate peer savagely into my face but unable to distinguish the feature i never hear of anybody on board by that name who be the fellow haine the englishman grip I by the sleeve to whirl I about but as he finger touch the soaked cloth of my jacket he burst forth with a oath by god but he be wet enough to be the same lad you chuck overboard a hour ago damn

this wa 'n' t my ship so i just lay quiet awhile figurin ' out whar i wus yer english bear in bristol sir but i wus workin ' on the _ caroline _ -- she be a colony schooner in the fish trade sailor at

-- plenty of fun the best of liquor and pretty girl with a share in all the swag what be the name of this bark the _ namur _ -- sail out o ' rotterdam till we take she whut wus yer in when ye take she the _ vengeance _ a three-masted schooner the fastest thing afloat she be south in west indium water who be the captain silva sanchez gawd sanchez -- not -- not ` black sanchez ' that be he so yer

to make on they both likely thar be not no sailor but whut have heerd o ' he i say slowly enyhow i sure have i can not say thet i have any special hankerin ' after bein ' a pirate a ' i never aim ter be one but seem ' as how i be yere on this bark a ' can not easy get away it do not look like thar wus much choice do it levere appear amuse in he way which be not a pleasant one oh yes friend there be choice enough bill here have exactly the same choice when he first come -- hey bill remember how you sign on after we take you off the _ albatross _ this be how it stand gate -- either go forrard quietly yerself er the both of we will kick you there we never give a order twice on the _ namur _ that will be enough talk if you do you work all right and if you do not then look out my man -- there will be plenty of hell wait for you go on now it be a curt dismissal couple with a plain threat easy to understand i obey the order gladly enough slink away into the black shadow forward realize my good fortune and seek some spot where i could be alone the result be all that i could have hope for my position on board be assure my story have be accept without awaken the slightest suspicion and it be perfectly clear that no one on board the _ namur _ possess the slightest memory of the personal appearance of the poor fellow who have be throw overboard and drown even haine believe I to be the man of course i should be watch to some extent for a few day my willingness to serve note and my ability as a seaman put to the test but in this i have nothing to fear i could play the assumed character with little danger of any mishap the only remain peril of discovery would come with the return of the absent boat and the necessity of my encounter the giant negro yet i be convince even this would not prove serious if cochose have glimpse my feature at all during the course of we desperate struggle on the deck of the sloop the impression make on he mind must have be merely momentary and besides he would never once conceive it possible that the same man could have reach the bark ahead of he return even if such a suspicion dawn i be now in a position to positively establish my arrival aboard the _ namur _ early the evening previous and before they expedition have depart i feel so safe and so content with my success thus far as to already believe thoroughly in the final result of my mission this confidence develop almost into sheer recklessness there be some difficulty ahead to be sure i remain sane enough to recognize these yet i have already conquer easily what at first have appear insurmountable and in consequence of this good luck these other yet to be meet seem far less serious the same happy fortune which have open the way for I to board the _ namur _ must also intervene to aid I in solve future problem mine be the philosophy of a sailor to whom peril be but a part of life all i seem to require now be a sufficiency of courage and faith -- the opportunity would be give in this spirit of arouse hope i continue to stare out into the black night watchfully the shroud deck behind I silent and seemingly desert except for the steady tramp from rail to rail of levere keep he lonely watch aft the crew have disappear lie down no doubt in corner out of the wind and this wind be certainly rise already attain a force to be reckon with for the boom of wave hurl against the bow of the labor bark be steadily become more noticeable while overhead the rope sing dismally i wonder that levere hang on so long in he perilous position although in spite of the increase strain the anchor still cling firmly quite probably he have receive stern order not to shift from he present position until the boat return yet surely he judgment as a competent seaman leave in command must make he aware of the threatening danger he would never wreck he vessel merely because he have be instruct to remain at that particular spot it seem to I that no hawser ever make could long withstand the terrific strain of we tug as the struggle bark rise and fall in the grip of the sea to he must have come the same conviction for suddenly he high-pitched voice sing out from the poop : stand by forrard to lower the starboard anchor move lively man everything ready haine all clear sir come on the jump bully then let go smartly watch that you do not get the line foul aloft there anything in sight cavere from high up on the fore-top yard the answer blow by the wind come down in broken english : non m ` sieur i see notting well do not go to sleep keep both eye open i have already join the watch forward aware only of the numerous dim and shapeless figure about I busily employ in straighten out the kink in the heavy cable the number of man on deck be evidence of a large crew there be many more than be necessary for the work to be do most of they appear to be able seaman and haine drive they mercilessly cursing they for lubber and twice kick viciously at a stoop form there be no talk only the growl of a occasional oath the slapping of the hawser on deck and the sharp order of haine then the great rope begin to slip swiftly through the hawse hole and we hear the sharp splash as the iron fluke strike the water and sink almost at that same instant the voice of cavere ring out from the mast-head : a sail m ` sieur -- a sail where away off ze port quarter i make eet to be ze leetle boat -- she just round ze point chapter xi the return of the boat receive no other order the moment all be secure the crew eager to welcome back the boat party and learn the news hurry over to the port rail beyond doubt most of those aboard realize that this have be a expedition of some importance the culmination of they long wait on the coast part of some scheme of they chief in the spoil of which they expect to share it be for this end they have be inactive for week hide and skulk along shore now they hope to reap they reward in gold and silver and then be permit to return to the wilder more adventurous life they love on the high sea moreover this boat approach through the darkness be bring back they leader and however else they might feel toward he the reckless daring and audacious resourcefulness of sanchez mean success these fellow the scum of the seven sea whom he have gather about he might hate and fear yet be glad to follow they have learn on many a bloody deck the merit of they chief and in they way be loyal to he i be make to comprehend all this by the low muttered utterance of those crowd near I speak in nearly every language of the world much i could not even translate yet enough reach my ear to convince I of the temper of the crew -- they feverish eagerness to be again at sea under command of a captain whom they both hate and fear yet whom they would follow to the very gate of hell even as they curse he with hot oath in memory of some act of discipline there come into they voice a tinge of admiration which furnish I a accurate etching of the man they know he these hell-hound of the sea and from out they mouth i know he also for what he be -- a cruel cold-blooded monster yet a genius in crime and a natural leader of such man as these _ black sanchez _ all the unspeakable horror which in the past have cling to that name come back again to haunt I i seem to hear once more the tale of man who have escape from he grip alive to see again the scene they have witness it could not seem possible that i be actually upon one of he ship in the very midst of he wild crew i listen to they comment they expectation with swiftly beat heart i alone know what that boat be bring and when it arrive and they know also what would these sea wolf say what would they do what would be the result when the dead body of they leader come up over the rail for a few moment we could perceive nothing through the black night the cloud be roll low thicken by vapor and the increase wind have already beat the wave into crest of foam we could hear they crash against the stout side of the bark which leap to they impetus yet be hold in helpless captivity by the two anchor the deck under foot toss dizzily the bare mast sway above while we ear could distinguish the sullen roar of breaker tumble up on the sand just astern overhead rope rattle noisily the sound mingle with the flap end of loosen sail beat against the yard levere shout a order and a sudden flare be light amidship the circle of flame illumine a part of the deck and spread out over the wild expanse of water the seaman hold the blaze torch aloft and thrust it forth across the rail take on the appearance of a black statue as motionless as though carve from ebony while in the gleam the various group of man become visible line up along the port bulwark all stare in the one direction eagerly seek a first glimpse of the approach craft scarcely have a minute elapse before it come sweep into the radius of light -- at first a dim spectral shadow scarcely to be recognize then almost as suddenly reveal in all its detail -- a boat of size fly toward we under a lug sail stand out hard as a board keel well over and top the sea swell like a bird on wing 'twa a beautiful sight as the craft come sweeping on before the full weight of the wind out from that background of gloom into the yellow glare of the torch circling widely so as to more safely approach the bark 's quarter levere call for man to stand by the fellow rush past I to they station but in the fascination of the moment i fail to move i could do nothing but stare out across the intervene water with eye fasten on that swiftly approach boat i must see i must know the message it bring what story it hold of the tragedy at first i could only barely distinguish the figure of those aboard yet these gradually assume recognizable form and finally the face also become dimly visible manuel hold the tiller with estada seat beside he lean forward and gesticulate with one hand as he direct the course i have never see these two yet i know they beyond a doubt mendez and anderson -lrb- at least i suppose these to be the two -rrb- be poise at the sail halliard ready to let the strain sheet down at a run while cochose crouch low in the bow he black hand uplift grip a coil of rope they face be all turn forward light by the flare from we deck and i feel a shudder of fear run over I -- no expression on any countenance speak of defeat even the ugly feature of the negro beam with delight but be that all be that all surely not yet the boat have to leap forward and then turn broadside too as it sweep aft toward the main chain before i succeed in see what remain partially conceal between the thwart in its bottom forward of the single mast be stow the chest which traver ' slave have bear with such care up the bluff while in the open space between the helmsman and the two sailor be stretch two motionless body levere grip a stay-rope and lean well out hail in spanish ahoy the boat -- there be not too much sea you can make it ay come back estada 's voice sweep aside by the wind yet still audible stand by to fend we off call all hand and break anchor as soon as we be aboard very well sir where be captain sanchez estada point downward in swift expressive gesture here at my foot -- badly hurt but will recover send two man down to help when we make fast now cochose -- let go of you rope watch out above i stand gripping hard at the rail and stare down at the scene below as the man in the boat make fast i feel paralyzed and helpless unable to move i have no business to remain there every prospect of security depend on my join the crew but it be not in my power to desert my position i could hear the hurrying foot of the watch tramp across the deck in response to levere 's order the heavy pound of a marling-spike on the forecastle hatch as haine call for all hand i be aware that man be already mount the ratlin and lay out on the upper yard to make sail while the capstan bar begin rattle yet only one thought grip I -- _ sanchez be not dead _ i have believe he be i have stake all on he death as a certainty but instead the man be lie there in the boat helpless at present sorely wound perhaps yet still alive estada even say he would surely recover and that other body that of dorothy fairfax without doubt yet certainly not lifeless those fellow would surely never bring back to the _ namur _ the useless dead form of one of they victim that be unthinkable impossible if they prisoner be the girl -- and who else could it be -- she remain alive helplessly bind to prevent either struggle or outcry and destine to a fate far worse than death this revelation strike I like a blow i have anticipate the possible capture of the young woman but not the return of sanchez he living overthrow all my plan there be no hope in the narrow confines of the ship for I to remain long out of he sight once he become able again to reach the deck and he would instantly recognize I in any guise every hope of rescue have vanish every faith that i could be of aid my own life hang in the balance -- nay rather my doom be already seal there seemingly be but one chance for escape leave -- that be to drop silently overboard amid the confusion of get under way and make the desperate attempt to reach shore unseen before the crew could lift anchor and set sail this possibility come to I yet i continue to cling there daze and helpless stare dully down lack both physical and mental energy to put the wild scheme into execution god no that would be the craven act of a coward better far to stay and kill or even be kill than to be forever curse by my own conscience the fellow might die some fatal accident befall the _ namur _ why a hundred thing might occur before sanchez be capable of resume command or could attempt any serious injury to dorothy the fellow send down from the main chain to the boat bring the injured captain up first this require the service of three man he body hang limp between they he upturned face show ghastly in the flaming of the torch thrust out over the rail to every appearance it be apparently a corpse they handle except for they tenderness and a single groan to which the white lip give utterance when one of the bearer slip wrenching the wound body with a sharp pang of pain once safely on deck the three bear he across to the after cabin in which a swing lantern have be light and be by then burn brightly and disappear down the step my eye follow every movement as i forget for the instant the boat and its occupant still toss alongside on the water below as i turn back awaken by some cry i see that estada have already swing himself up into the chain while anderson and mendez be lift the girl to she foot and rather roughly urge she forward she hand and limb have be set free but she sway back and forth in the grasp of the two man as though unable to support herself alone she face upturn into the flare of light as she gaze in terror at the black side of the bark towering above she eye reflect all the unutterable horror which for the moment dominate she mind while she loosen hair disarrange by struggle only serve to intensify the pallor of she face yet in spite of this evident despair there be still strength and defiance in the firm closing of she lip and she effort to stand alone uncontaminate by the touch of the sailor ' hand hustle she along lively boy shout back estada coarsely if she will not move give she a shove then tie she up again and take the turn of a rope ` round she what do you think this be -- a queen 's reception move lively senorita in mock sarcasm she gaze settle on he where he hang far out grasp a backstay watch the movement below and she slender form straighten as by the acquisition of new strength if these creature will take they hand off I she say use they tongue without a tremor in the clear voice i can easily go up alone what be it you be so afraid of -- a woman the expression of estada 's face promise a outburst of profanity but instead of give it utterance he lift he cap in a sudden pretense at gallantry you pardon senorita he say in a tone of humble mockery if you have come to you sens at last it be well no one can be happier than i leave she alone man now my beauty i be take you at you own word -- a step and then the protection of my hand we welcome you as a guest aboard a moment and she have attain the deck where she stand i could no longer see she face yet she remain there silent and motionless rather stiffly erect as she face he frightened and helpless as she be yet she very posture seem to express the detestation she feel for the man but estada apparently pleased with he performance thus far choose to continue play the fool thanks senorita -- thanks he begin softly and again bow before she cap in hand we greet you with due honor aboard the _ namur _ -- enough of that you coward you murderer she break in coldly do not touch nor speak to I she turn she back on he thus come face to face with levere who stand enjoy the scene a wide grin on he dark face reveal a row of white tooth under a jet-black moustache you sir --

grunt pig here levere manuel throw this sot into the forecastle curse you here be one more to jog you memory the heavy iron-shod boot land full in my face and every sensation leave I as i sink limply back bloody and unconscious chapter xii a friend in the forecastle i slowly and regretfully open my eye arouse perhaps by a trampling of foot on the deck above to find myself lie in a upper bunk of the forecastle i be partially cover by a ragged blanket but for a few moment remain unable to comprehend the situation yet the vivid memory soon return stimulate no doubt by the continuous ache of my body where estada have so brutally kick I with he heavy boot the first recollection of that assault bring with it a dull anger strangely commingle with a thought of dorothy fairfax and a sense of my own duty the heavy rolling of the bark clearly evidence that we be already at sea and buck against a high wind occasionally a monster wave break over the cats-head and strike thunderingly on the deck above I the whole vessel tremble to the shock oilskin hang to the deck beam swing here and there at strange angle while the single slush lantern dangle back and forth like the pendulum of a clock it be a dark dismal smelly interior amply large enough but ill ventilate and inexpressibly dirty every stench under heaven seem to assail my nostril so compound together as to be separately indistinguishable although that of stale bilge water strongly predominate the only semblance of fresh air find entrance through the small square scuttle hole attainable by means of a short ladder and stare up at this i be able to perceive the light of day although so little penetrate below the sway slush light alone serve to illumine the place and render its horror visible it be day then and we be well out at sea i must have be lie unconscious for several hour in all probability find it impossible to arouse I the brute have finally leave I alone to either recover or die as fate will i rest back feeling of the numerous bruise on my body and touch gingerly the dry blood cake on my face no very serious damage seem to have be do for i could move without great pain although every muscle and tendon appear to be strain and lacerate my head have clear also from its earlier sensation of dullness the brain actively take up its work clinch my tooth to keep back a groan i succeed in sit upright my head touch the upper deck as i undertake to survey my surroundings they be gloomy and dismal enough the forecastle in true dutch style have be build directly into the bow so that the bunk arrange three tier high form a complete half circle the single lantern flickering and flare as it swing constantly to the sharp pitching of the vessel cast grotesque shadow and fail entirely to penetrate the corner the deck below I be litter with chest sea boot and odds and end of clothing while farther aft considerable water have find entrance through the scuttle hole and be slush back and forth as the bark roll about half the bunk seem to be occupy the figure of the sleep man barely discernible although they heavy breathing evidence they presence and add to the babel of sound every bolt and beam creak and groan in the ceaseless struggle with the sea the bunk in which i have awaken be situate almost at the apex of the half circle so that i have a clear view of the wider open space those beneath I contain no occupant nor at first could i distinguish any in the tier directly opposite evidently the watch off duty prefer to seek they rest as far away as possible from those wave pound against the bow however as i sit there stare about at this scene and uncertain as to what my next move should be there be a stir within the upper berth on my own level and a moment later a uplift face appear suddenly in the yellow flare of light it be manifestly a english face at first glance rosy of cheek with chestnut beard and light tousled hair a pair of humorous gray eye survey I silently and then apparently satisfy by the scrutiny the owner sit up in the bunk reveal powerful shoulder and a round bull neck ahoy mate he say pleasantly endeavor to speak low the effort resemble the growl of a bear how do you feel -- pretty sore ache from head to foot i answer immediately feel he friendliness but no harm do i see part of it the damn black brute kick savagely enough but at that you be lucky it be the spanish style to use a knife i have see that cock slash a man into ribbon for nothing at all -- just to show he be bad haine tell I you name be gate and that you be english that be right i ship first out of bristol so do i mate -- twenty year ago though and i never go back since my name be tom watkin let 's shake there be quite a sprinkling of we britisher aboard and we ought to hang together he put out a big hairy fist and i grip it heartily decidedly like the man as he eye frankly meet mine he appear honest and square a fine type of the english seaman tom watkin you say may i ask if you be out on the bow-sprit along with haine last night just afore the long-boat come in yes we be there well i be down below hang to the cable and overheard you two talk together somehow watkin you do not seem to I to fit in exactly with this gang of pirate you do not look to be that sort how long have you be with they he glance about warily lower he voice until it become a hoarse whisper three year mate and most of that time have be hell i have not even be ashore but once and that be on a island these fellow do not put any trust in my kind nor give they any chance to cut and run once in awhile a lad do get away but most of they be catch and those that be sure get they punishment they never try it again i have see they stake out on the sand and leave to die that be not no nice thing to remember but how do you come into it like most of the rest i be second mate of the _ ranger _ a glasgow brig we load with sugar at martinique for london these fellow overhaul we at daybreak about a hundred mile off the east end of cuba they have a swift schooner and five gun one a long tom all we have to fight they with be about fifteen man and two brass carronade we skipper be scotch and he put up some fight but it be not any use there be only three of we leave alive when the pirate come aboard one of these die two day later and another be wash overboard and drown down in the gulf i be all that be leave of the _ ranger _ you save you life by take on sanchez have the two of we who be able to stand back in he cabin he put it to we straight he say it be up to we whether we sign up or walk the plank and he do not appear to care a damn which we choose the cold-blooded devil mean it too for he be rage mad at get only five hundred pound off the brig well jack and i look at each other -- and then we sign and you say other of this crew have be obtain in the same manner i question deeply interested and perceive in this a ray of hope not exactly -- no i would not precisely say that it be true perhaps that most of the britisher be force to join in about the same way i be and there may be a scandinavian or two with a few dutch to be count in that list but the most of these cuss be pirate from choice it be they trade and they like it sanchez only aim to keep hold of a few good man because he have get to have sailor but most of he crew be nothing but plain cut-throat where do he find they where why the west indy be full of such devil be breed they down there for two hundred year -- indian and half-breed nigger creole portuguese spanish and every damned mongrel you ever hear of sanchez himself be half french the hell-hound who kick you be a portugee and levere be more nigger than anything else i 'll bet there be a hundred rat on board this _ namur _ right now who have cut you throat for a sovereign and never so much as think of it again a hundred be there that many aboard a hundred a ' thirty all tell most o ' 'em bunk amidship they be not sailormen but just cut-throat a ' sea wolf yer ought ter see 'em swarm out on deck like hungry rat when thar 's a fight comin ' it be all they be good fer watkin i say soberly after a pause during which he spit on the dirty deck to thus better express he feeling do you mean to say that in three year you have have no chance to escape no opportunity to get away not a chance mate no more will you the only place i have put foot ashore have be porto grande where we run in to refit that be a worse hell than the ship itself but haine go ashore he be with manuel 's boat yesterday the big fellow laugh grimly bill rather like the job a ' they know it he be a boatswain a ' get a big share of the swag he be the only britisher aboard who would not cut and run in a minute besides he be get a girl at porto grande and that fellow anderson who be with estada the lowest kind of a swede cur -- he 'll do more dirt than a portugee i know what yer thinkin ' ` bout i have they notion too when i fu ` st come aboard -- gettin ' all the decent sort tergether and takin ' the vessel ` two not work thar be not ` nough who wud risk it and if thar wus yer could not get 'em tergether sanchez be too damn smart fer thet every damn rat be a spy i be not hed no such talk as this afore in six month gate the last time cost I twenty lash at the mast-butt be there any chance of we be overhear now no these near bunk be all empty a ' the damn noise drown we voice what would yer have in you mind mate only this watkin i have get to do something and believe i can trust you you be a square english seaman probably the only one aboard i can repose confidence in i do not blame you for stick for i suppose likely i would do the same if i be in you case but i be not -- it be not my life i be think about but that of a woman he stare at I across the narrow space separate we bunk the shadow from the swing lantern give he feature a strange expression a woman hell lad not the one bring aboard last night exactly now listen -- i be go to tell you my story and ask you help do you know what estada go after in the long-boat well there be be plenty o ' talk the cook bring we some story he hear aft a ' we know we wus driftin ' along the coast waitin ' fer sanchez ter cum back i suppose he would get onto some english gold -- in that chest they sling aboard be not it yes that be the main object my name be not gate at all and i be not the man mendez bring aboard drunk and who be throw over the rail by levere that fellow be drown well by god i be geoffry carlyle a english skipper there have be a revolution in england in which i become involve when the attempt fail i be take prisoner and deport to america for twenty year servitude i come over with a bunch of other on the same ship with sanchez the _ romp betsy _ yes there be a rich planter and he niece also aboard he be come home with a chest of money -- fifty thousand pound -- realize from a big sale of tobacco in london and the young woman be return from attend school in england sanchez be aboard to gain possession of both watkin nod too deeply interested in the narrative to interrupt he pretend to be of the spanish nobility a ex-naval officer and try all the way over to make love to this dorothy fairfax he get along all right with the uncle and be invite to visit he but the girl be not so easy he must have have it all plan out how he be to get the gold fairfax carry -- that be what the _ namur _ be wait for -- and when he find that the young woman could not be win by fair means he decide to take she by force it be not the first time for the black-hearted devil but how do you happen to come along fairfax buy I to run he sloop perhaps it be the girl who win he over anyhow this arrangement anger sanchez and we have word you know the rest or at least the main fact sanchez and the boat crew hold rendezvous at the first landing up the bay it be prearranged but it be my fortune to meet the captain alone on shore in the dark where we fight it be you then who drive the knife in god excitedly but i would give ten year for such a chance ay and they say you come within a eighth of a inch of send he to hell i know not where i strike 'twa a death struggle in the dark i think he dead when i leave he and run to warn the other but for this i be too late the moment i set foot on the sloop 's deck it be to close in battle with the big negro cochose he see you then no only as a shape he can have no better memory of I than i of he we fight as demon until he giant strength force I over the rail he have no knowledge that i ever rise again and then -- what oblivion nothing only what i saw in the return of the boat tell I what follow i come back to consciousness in a small dory afloat on the bay with but one thought in my mind -- to save the girl how it be too late to return even have i know the way but i could come here to this ship so here i come but how in advance of those in the long-boat by cut across the point the coast to the north be a wide circle besides the discovery of sanchez sorely wound leave the other without a leader fairfax and he niece together with the treasure be in traver ' house at top of the bluff they have to carry out a attack there which probably mean more fight what really happen there of course i do not know it can be easily imagine say watkin soberly estada have no mercy he be a bear devil i have see he kill just for the pleasure of it with sanchez to avenge he would be a unleash demon but it be not the fate of those man to consider now it be what will befall this girl prisoner you have no plan none to become a member of the crew be my only thought but i must act if at all before the captain recover he would recognize I at sight you will aid advise I the sailor sit silent the former expression of humor in he face vanish that be easier to ask than answer mate he admit finally i be a english seaman and will do my duty but so far as i can see there be no plan we can make it be god who will save the girl if she be to be save he may use we to that end but it be wholly beyond we power to accomplish it alone the only thing i can do be to sound out the man aboard and learn just what we can expect of they if any opportunity to act come there be not more than a dozen at most to be rely upon and my part do nothing at present play you part and keep quiet if you can let she know of you presence aboard without discovery it might be best -- for if she see you suddenly unprepared she might say or do something to betray you there be other reason why it may be best for she to know she be not entirely desert he lean over motion I toward he until he lip be at my ear it may not prove as hopeless as it appear now he whisper confidentially i help carry sanchez to he stateroom and wash and dress he wound there be no surgeon aboard but i have some skill in such matter he have a bad cut and be very weak from loss of blood the question of we success hinge on pedro estada what he will do you mean yes this be a chance which i happen to know he have long be wait for the only question be have he the nerve to act i doubt if he have alone but levere be with he and that half-breed would cut the throat of he best friend you understand -- the death of sanchez would make estada chief the two man hate each other -- why not there be a plan before which fail this time it may not fail but i interpose in that case what would the crew do accept estada no doubt at least the cut-throat would be with he for he be of they sort all they care for be blood and booty but sanchez 's death would save you from discovery and he voice still lower so that i barely distinguish the word in the confusion aboard if we be ready the _ namur _ might be so disabled as to compel they to run she ashore for repair that would give you a chance if once we reach porto grande there be no hope a marling-spike pound on the scuttle and haine ' voice roar down port watch hustle out bully chapter xiii i accept a proposal i go on deck with the watch and mingle with they forward no one in authority take any particular notice of I and i be permit to take hold with the other at the various task a portuguese boatswain ask I who i be and later report my presence to levere who have charge of the deck but the only result be my be set at polish the gun mount on the forecastle the mulatto do not come forward and i rejoice at have my status aboard so easily settle and be permit to remain in the same watch with watkin it be a dull gray morning the gloominess of the overhang cloud reflect in the water man on lookout be station in the fore-top and on the head yet the sharpest eye could scarcely see beyond a half mile in any direction the sea come at we in great ocean swell but the stout bark fight a passage through they shiver with each blow yet drive forward on she course by half-reefed sail stand hard as board in the sweep of the steady gale two man struggle at the wheel and there be time when levere pause in he promenade from rail to rail to give they a help hand he anxiety be evidence by he hail the mast-head every few moment only to receive each time the same response the mist fail to lift but seem to shut we in more closely with every hour the wind grow continually more boisterous but levere hold on grimly i be keep at the gun during the entire time of we watch besides the long tom forward a vicious piece two swivel gun be on each side completely conceal by the thick bulwark and to be fire through port so ingeniously close as to be imperceptible a few yard away all these piece of ordnance be keep cover by tarpaulin so that at a little distance the _ namur of rotterdam _ appear like a peaceful dutch trader there be a brass carronade at the stern in plain view and so mount as to be swing inboard in case of necessity its ugly muzzle could thus rake the deck fore and aft but the presence of such a piece would create no suspicion in those day when every ship be arm for defense and consequently no effort be make for its concealment i be busily at work on this bit of ordnance when estada come on deck for a moment after stare aloft and about the horizon into the impenetrable mist he join levere at the port rail in a short earnest conversation as the two worthy part the fellow chance to observe I i catch the quick look of recognition in he eye but bent to my work as though indifferent to he presence yet fail to escape easily you must be a pretty tough bird gate he say roughly or i would have kill you last night -- i have the mind too something about he voice and manner lead I to feel that in spite of he roughness he be not in bad humor that would have be a mistake sir i answer straighten up rag in hand for it would have cost you a good seaman hoilum they be easily pick up one more or less count for little in these sea he look at I searchingly for the first time perhaps actually note my feature in spite of my dirty disheveled appearance and the bruise disfigure my face this scrutiny must have arouse he curiosity why do you say that my man he question sharply you be before the mast and drift aboard here because you be drunk -- be not that true partially yes it be drink that put I before the mast i explain rejoice in he mood and suddenly hope such a statement might help my status aboard three year ago i be skipper on my own vessel it be rum ruin I saint christopher do you mean to say you can read chart and take observation i smile encourage by he surprise and the change in he tone yes sir i saw ten year ' service as mate what be you last ship the _ bombay castle _ london to hong kong i wreck she off cape mendez in a fog i be drunk below and it cost I my ticket you know west indian water slightly i make two voyage to panama and one to havana and speak spanish a little bit sir as you see i learn language easily he stare straight into my face but without utter another word turn on he heel and go below whether or not i have make a impression on the fellow i do not know he face be a mask perfectly conceal he thought that he have appear interested enough to question I have in it a measure of encouragement he would surely remember and sometime he might have occasion to make use of I at least i would no longer remain in he mind as a mere foremast hand to be kick about and speak to like a dog i go back to my polishing of brass in a more cheerful mood -- perhaps this would prove the first step lead to my greater future liberty on the _ namur _ i have finish my labor on the carronade and be fasten down securely the tarpaulin when a thin stoop-shouldered fellow with a hang-dog face creep up the ladder to the poop and shuffle over to where levere be gaze out over the rail oblivious to he approach mister levere sir he speak apologetically he voice no more than a wisp of sound the mulatto wheel about startled oh it be you well what be it gunsaule senor estada sir he wish to see a sailor name gate in the cabin who gate oh yes the new man he sweep he eye about until he see I gate be you name be not it yes sir follow the steward below senor estada wish to see you -- go just as you be very good sir -- be this the steward the fellow lead the way amusing I by the peculiar manner in which he long leg cling to the ladder and then wobble about on the rolling deck until he attain the protection of the companion-way a half dozen broad uncarpeted step lead down into the after cabin which be plain and practically without furniture except for a bare table suspend from the upper beam and a few chair securely rest in chock the deck be bare but have be thoroughly scrub the water not entirely dry and forward there be a rack of small arm the polish steel shine in the gray light of the transom overhead the dutch character of the bark be very apparent here in the excessively heavy deck beam and the general gloom of the interior finish off in dark wood and ornament with carve paneling fill with wonderment as to why i have be send for i halt at the foot of the step gaze about the dreary interior surprised at its positive dinginess there be evidently six stateroom open on the main cabin and these must be little more than box to judge from the breadth of the vessel what be farther aft i could not determine because of a lack of light but as no stern port be visible it be to be assume that this give space for two more larger stateroom directly astern -- occupied probably by the captain and he first officer there be no one in the main cabin although a cat lay asleep on one of the chair and after a moment 's hesitancy i follow the beckon steward who rap with he knuckle on one of the side door estada 's voice answer who be it gunsaule senor i have with I the sailor open the door and let he in i would see he here come inside gate he eye survey we both in the narrow opening that will be all juan no one be to be admit until i tell you -- and ` twill be well for you to remain by the stair on guard you understand si senor another thing sternly do not let I catch you listen outside the door if i do god have mercy on you si senor i step inside doubtful enough of what all this might mean yet quite prepared to accept of any chance it might offer gunsaule close the door softly but i have already vision the apartment in all its detail it be small and nearly square a swing lantern in the center a single bunk on one side and a small table on the other screw to the wall and cover with chart and various papers a few book be upon a shelf above this and a sea chest be shove under the bunk some oilskin together with a suit of clothes dangle from wooden pin while the only other furniture consist of a straight-backed chair and a four-legged stool the round port stand partly open and through it i could see the gray expanse of water all these i perceive at a glance but the instant the door close behind I my entire attention concentrate on estada he sit upright in the chair gaze straight at I he own face clearly reveal in the light from the open port it seem to I i be look at the man for the first time and it be not a pleasant picture he face be swarthy long and thin with hard set lip under a long intensely black moustache he cheek strangely crisscross by line the nose be large distinctively roman yield he a hawklike appearance but it be he eye which fascinate I they be dark and deeply set absolute well of cruelty i have never before see such eye in the face of a human be they be beastly devilish i could feel my blood chill as i look into they depths yet i hold myself erect and wait for the man to speak it seem a long delay yet doubtless be scarcely more than a moment then he lip curl in what be mean to be a smile and he wave he hand sit down on the stool gate have you any knowledge of portuguese none whatever sir nor do i english so we shall have to rely on the language of spain i be hardly expert in that i explain but if you do not talk too fast i can manage fairly well i shall speak simply wait a moment he arise step quietly to the door and glance out return apparently satisfied i do not trust that damned steward he say nor as a matter of fact anyone else wholly he pause and stare at I then add : i have never have any faith in you race gate but be incline to use you i do not know any special reason why you should sir no more do i every englishman i ever know be a liar and a sneak poltroon i be bring up to hate the race and always have i can not say that i like you any better than the other by god i do not for the matter of that but just now you can be useful to I if you be of that mind this be a business proposition and it make no odds if we hate each other so the end be gain how do that sound i shift my position so as to gain a clearer view of he face i be still wholly at sea as to what the fellow be drive at -- yet evidently enough he be in earnest it be my part to find out not altogether bad i admit i have be in some game of chance before i think as much eagerly and money have the same chink however it be earn you could use some if i have any to use after a sailor have be drunk there be not apt to be much left in he pocket he reach across into the upper bunk and bring forth a bottle and glass place these upon the table at he elbow have a drink first he say pour it out it will stiffen you nerve thanks no senor i have nerve enough and once i start that sort of thing there be no stop take it yourself and then tell I what be in the wind i will gate affect cordiality although i somehow feel that my refusal to imbibe have arouse a faint suspicion in he mind but i would rather you would show yourself a good fellow i like to see a man take he liquor and hold it he sit down the empty glass and straighten back in the chair he eye search as ever the fact be he begin doubtfully what you just say to I on deck chance to be of interest you be not boast i answer you question truthfully if that be what you mean you be a navigator i be in command of ship for four year senor naturally i know navigation do you mind if i test you not in the least although it will have to be in english as i do not know the spanish sea term let that go then i will soon learn if you have lie and that will be a sorry day for you i 'll tell you gate how matter stand aboard and why i have need of you skill then you may take you choice -- the forecastle or the cabin you invite I aft senor i give you a chance to move you dunnage if you will do my work he explain seriously listen now sanchez have be badly hurt it may be week before he leave he cabin if indeed he ever do that leave I in command with but one officer the mulatto levere this might answer to take we safely to porto grande as we could stand watch and watch but francoi be no sailor it be he part on board to train and lead the fight man -- he can not navigate saint christopher i fear to leave he alone in charge of the deck while i snatch a hour 's sleep i see i admit and yourself senor you be a seaman he hate to confess yet my eye be honest and meet he squarely enough to get along but not quite sure as to my figure i have take no sight except as we come north on this trip ` tis for this reason i need you -- but you will play I no smart english trick my man or i 'll have you by the heel at once i know enough to verify you figure i thought of no trick estada i say coldly now satisfy as to he purpose and confident of my own power english or otherwise it be well we understand each other you would have I as navigator very well -- at what term he eye seem to narrow and become darker with rating as first officer and you fair proportion of all spoil you mean then to continue the course to attack vessel on the high sea why not sneeringly be you too white-livered for that sort of job if so then you be no man for I it be a long voyage to porto grande and no reason why we should hurry home the welcome there will be better if we bring chest of gold aboard ay and the thought will put hope into the heart of the crew they be restless now from long wait but captain sanchez you have no surgeon i be tell will he not suffer from neglect of he wound suffer no more than under a leech ashore all that can be do have be there be man aboard able to treat any ordinary wound he be a clean knife thrust which have be wash treat with lotion and bind up no leech could do more and my quarter -- will they be aft you will have you choice of those at port come now -- have you a answer ready i would be a fool not to have heartily i be you man estada chapter xiv i warn dorothy the portuguese evidently well pleased at my prompt acceptance of he proposal talk on for some time explain to I something of the situation aboard the _ namur _ and point out what he believe to be we position on the chart i ask a few question although i pay but little attention to what he say my mind be busy with search out he real purpose no doubt the situation be very nearly as he describe it to be -- levere be no navigator and estada himself only a indifferent one yet at that the course to the west indy be not a long one and if the portuguese have be able to bring the bark from there to the chesapeake the return voyage should not terrify he greatly no that be not the object he be plan to keep at sea to waylay and attack merchant ship and then after a successful cruise arrive at porto grande laden with spoil and hail as a great leader he plan be to dispose of sanchez -- even to permit the spaniard to die of he wound possibly even to hasten and assure that death by some secret resort to violence no doubt levere be also concern in the conspiracy and would profit by it and possibly these two be likewise assure of the cooperation of the more reckless spirit among the crew i remember what watkin have whisper to I forward -- he suspicion of they both he have be right already the fuse be be lay and very fortunately i happen to be choose to help touch it off the chance i have seek blindly be be plainly reveal it be evident enough however that estada have no intention of trust I immediately with he real motive he confidence be limit and he instruction related altogether to mere matter of ship routine i ask a few question and twice he lie coolly but i dare not mention the girl in any way for fear that even a casual reference to she presence on board might arouse he suspicion of my interest we be at sea and my presence aft give I opportunity to observe all that be go on in the cabin i could await development but i be become wearied by the man i understand perfectly senor i break in at last impatiently you will have to take for grant that i can enforce sea discipline and navigate you boat to whatever part of the ocean you desire to sail all i need be you order this i take it be all you require of I yes i plan you execute very good now about myself and i arise to my foot determine to close the interview i would study these chart and figure out we probable position by dead reckoning -- there be little chance of have glimpse of the sun today the fog out there grow heavier you say i may choose any stateroom on the port side they be all unoccupied except one use by the steward as a storeroom i open the door and step out into the main cabin the roll of chart under my arm the place be desert and with a glance about meet estada 's eye observe I closely he do not wait for I to question he captain sanchez 's stateroom be aft he say with a wave of the hand the entire width of the bark no there be two room he be leave alone jose be with he -- a negro with a knack at nursing who else be quarter aft here he ignore the one thing i most desire to learn but i do not press it believe i know the answer already levere have this middle stateroom and mendez the one forward what rank have mendez third officer and carpenter just at present with levere require on deck he have charge of the man below the crew you mean not the work crew they be quarter in the forecastle and be largely english and swede but we have to carry extra man who bunk amidship -- hell-hound to fight damn mongrel of course you keep they below all through the voyage they be allow on deck amidship when we be at sea but be not encourage to mingle with the sailor we be over a powder magazine all the time gate -- any spark might set it off i open one of the door opposite and glance within the interior differ but little from that of the stateroom occupy by estada except it be minus the table no doubt they be all practically alike this will do very well i say quietly now how about clothes these i wear look rather rough for the new job i 'll send you the steward he 'll fix you out from the slop-chest we be always well supply i be glad to see he go and close the door on he with a sigh of relief he eye seem to exercise a peculiar influence over I a snakelike charm against which i have to constantly battle i throw the bundle of chart into the upper bunk and unscrew the glass of the port to gain a view without and a breath of fresh air there be nothing to see but a small vista of gray sea blend into the gray mist and the wave on this side run so high i be compel to close the port to keep out the spray i sit down on the stool stare about the compartment realize suddenly how well fortune have serve my cause -- the chance to impersonate the drunken sailor the meeting with watkin my chance word to estada on deck and now this translation from forecastle to cabin it have all occur so quickly almost without effort on my part i could do little but wonder what strange occurrence would be next what indeed be there for I to do except to await development only one thing occur to I -- i must discover some means immediately of communicate with dorothy fairfax the importance of this could not be overestimate with myself quarter aft and eating in the cabin we be bind to meet sooner or later and the girl must previously be warn of my presence aboard or in she first surprise at the recognition i should be instantly betray nothing would escape estada and the slightest evidence that we two have formerly meet would awaken he suspicion my only hope of success lay in my ability to increase he faith in my pledge the necessity of have a competent navigator aft alone account for my promotion the portuguese neither like nor trust I he hate and despise my race he would have I watch and would carefully check over my figure i should be compel to serve he faithfully and without arouse the slightest question in he mind in order to establish myself in he esteem or gain any real freedom aboard yet if i be to serve the girl there must be first of all intelligent cooperation between we she must not only know of my presence on the _ namur _ but also the purpose actuate I i have reach this conclusion when a light hesitate knock sound on the door who be there the steward senor with you clothes bring they in gunsaule enter the garment over he arm and shuffle in he peculiar glide manner across to the bunk where he lay out the piece carefully one by one evidently proud of he selection quite a beautiful piece of goods senor he venture speak so softly i could barely distinguish the word above the crash of the wave on the ship 's side and most excellently tailor i do not remember whether these come out of the _ adair _ or _ la rosalie _ -- the french ship most likely for as you see senor there be quite the parisian cut to this coat i mark these thing for i be once apprentice to a tailor in madrid he stand fondle the garment lovingly the expression of he face so solemnly interested i have difficulty in suppress a laugh some change in you trade gunsaule do you take this one up from choice you do not look to I like a fight man he glance apprehensively at the open door speak even lower than before if possible no more be i senor the blood make I faint i go hungry in santo domingo -- god forgive I for ever go there -- and to keep from starve i take this job with sanchez or before the bark be capture before senor the captain 's name be schmitt not since have i be ashore but they spare I because i be spanish i would have ask the fellow more perhaps even have test he in he loyalty to he new master but i feel this be neither place nor time estada might return and besides the man be evidently a poor-spirited creature little apt to be of service even if he so desire the clothes seem to be all right steward i say rather briskly and i judge will fit now hunt I up first of all something to shave with then some tobacco and a pipe and -- yes wait a second writing material yes senor and by the way there be two stateroom astern who occupy the one to starboard -- senor estada no senor it be the young lady oh the one bring aboard last night have you see she si senor she be english and good to look at but she sit and stare out the stern port she will not speak or eat i take in she breakfast but she touch not a morsel so i tell senor estada and he say ` then bring she out to dinner with I i 'll make the hussy eat if i have to choke it down she dainty throat ' good i 'll have a look at she myself then now hurry up those thing steward and remember what i send you after he bring the shaving set and write material first explain that he would have to go down into the lazaret and break open some package for the tobacco and pipe the moment the fellow disappear i grasp the opportunity where estada have go whether back into he stateroom or on deck i have no means of know in fact this could make little difference for it be not likely he would leave I alone for any great length of time it must already be approach the end of levere 's watch and i would certainly be call upon to relieve he and follow my turn on deck would be dinner in the cabin and the probable encounter with dorothy this clearly mean that i must communicate with the girl immediately or not at all i dash off a note hurriedly -- a brief line merely state my presence on board and beg she not to exhibit surprise at meeting I i have no time in which to explain or make clear the situation with this fold and conceal in my hand i silently push open the door and take a hasty glance about the cabin it be unoccupied yet i must move with caution it be possible for one on deck to look down through the skylight and even if estada be not in he own room the nurse assign to sanchez might be awake and appear at any moment the risk be not small yet must be take and i creep swiftly forward follow the circle of the stateroom until i come to the closed door of the one i seek aft i bent here a instant listen for some sound from within but hear none i dare not remain or even venture to test the lock gunsaule have say this be she place of confinement and there be seemingly no reason why she should have be give a guard beyond doubt the girl be within and alone and i must trust she quick intelligence to respond to my write message i thrust it through the narrow opening above the sill and the moment it disappear within steal swiftly back to my own room the action have not be see and yet i have scarcely a moment to spare before i could lather my face standing before a small crack mirror brace myself to the roll of the bark the steward return bearing in he hand tobacco and pipe estada however remain away longer than i have anticipate he would and i be fully dress and comfortably smoking before he come down from the deck and cross the cabin to my partially open door the starboard watch have be call he say and you be to take charge of the deck relieve levere i wait to explain the situation to the man before you appear i suppose you be ready ay ay senor knock the ash out of my pipe and rise he eye my clothes disapprovingly rather a fancy rig gate for a first officer on duty some style i admit senor but they be all the steward offer I you 'll have to carry a hard fist my man to back up that costume aboard the _ namur _ he say coldly those black devil be apt to mistake you for a plaything let they test it once they will soon find i have the hard fist i have tame wild crew before today and it might as well be first as last i suppose half measure do not go with these lad santa marium -- no it be kill or be kill in we trade and they will try out you metal come on now i follow he up the stair to the deck he word have in no way alarm I but serve rather to harden my resolve i look for trouble and be incline to welcome it anxious indeed to prove to estada my ability to handle man nothing else would so quickly appeal to he or serve so rapidly to establish I in he esteem and to win he confidence be my chief concern nothing occur however to cause any breach of authority a few fellow be lounge amidship and stare idly at we as we mount to the poop deck these be of the fight contingent i suppose and the real member of the crew be forward levere be still on duty and come forward and shake hand at my appearance rather glad i do not drown you he say intend to be pleasant but hope you 'll not run amuck in the after cabin i shall try not too unless i have cause i answer look he square in the eye and determine to make my position clear at once senor estada tell I i be to relieve you what be the course sou ` west by half sou ' we might be carry more canvas there be nothing to hurry about and the fog be thick that will probably lift within a hour do you know you position only in a general way we have hold a east by south course since leave the cape until a hour ago make about ten knot very well i will figure it out as best i can and mark it on the chart there be nothing further to report no senor all have be as it be now he glance toward estada not greatly pleased i presume with my brusqueness yet find nothing in either word or manner from which to evoke a quarrel the latter have overhear we conversation but he stand now with back toward we look out on the sea off the port quarter he silent indifference cause levere to shrug he shoulder and disappear down the ladder on he way below i turn my face to the man at the wheel -- it be the giant negro -- cochose chapter xv the cabin of the namur both huge black hand grasp the spoke and it be evident that it require all he giant strength to control the buck wheel he be a ugly-looking brute the lower portion of he face apelike and the wool grow so low as to leave he scarcely a inch of forehead he eye lift a instant from the binnacle card to glance at I curiously they exhibit no flash of recognition with sudden relief and a determination to thoroughly assure myself i step forward and accost he little heavy for one man be not it oh ah do not mind boss he thick lip grin ah 's bin alone worse trick den dis you seem to be hold the course all right -- sou ` west by sou ' senor levere say ya senor what be you name cochose senor ah 's a french nigger very good cochose my name be gate and i be the new first officer if you need any help let I know he nod still grin to let I realize he understand and i step aside confident that the fellow retain no recollection of my feature the relief of this knowledge be considerable and i gaze over the bark forward with a new feeling of security thus far i have successfully pass the test and be accept by all on board the only remain danger of recognition lay in the early recovery of sanchez and as i glance aside at estada the conviction become fix in my mind that such recovery be doubtful i feel that i have already penetrate the cowardly plan of the portuguese but feel no inclination to interpose indeed i have more occasion to dread the return of sanchez to command than do estada himself with I life be at stake while with he it be but the goal of ambition and power brutal and evil mind as estada undoubtedly be i have take he measure and feel confident of be able to outwit he but sanchez would prove a different problem for he possess brain and cool resourceful courage of the two he be far more to be fear for half a hour estada hang about aft apparently pay no attention to I and yet watch my movement closely there be little to be do but i think it best to keep the watch reasonably busy so they might thus learn that i know my work they prove prompt and capable enough although i be eye with some curiosity when i go forward and no doubt be very thoroughly discuss behind my back the idler amidship be a totally different class -- a mongrel scum profanely chat in spanish or swaggering about the deck they very look a challenge however they keep out of my way and i find no occasion to interfere with they diversion after estada leave the deck the majority amuse themselves gamble and as i have receive no order to interfere i permit the game to proceed mendez interfere only once on occasion of a brief fight my only instruction from the portuguese on he go below be to call he at once if a sail be sight apparently he be satisfy of my ability to command the deck no occasion to call he arise during my watch the mist of fog slowly rise and drift away leave a wide view of ocean but reveal no glimpse of any other craft the white-crested wave gleam in the sun as we plow bravely through they and the wind steadily decrease in violence i have the crew shake out reef in jib and foresail and be surprised myself at the sailing quality of the bark in spite of breadth of beam and heavy top-hamper she possess speed and ease of control and must have be a pretty sight as we bowl along through that desert sea before my watch be up i could see gunsaule through the skylight busily prepare the table in the cabin below it be still daylight but with a purple gleam across the water when levere arrive on deck for my relief we be talk together abaft the wheel when estada appear in the companion-way every promise of a clear night he say glance about at the horizon better change the course two point east levere we be lie in too close to the coast for we purpose the table call will come very shortly senor gate i wash up hastily in my stateroom and come out into the cabin perplex as to what might occur within the next few moment yet whatever the result there be no avoid it would the girl be call to join we as the portuguese have threaten have she receive my note of warning and if so would she have the strength to play she part so as to avoid suspicion those keen search eye of estada 's would note every movement observe every fleeting expression he have no present doubt of I only the caution natural to one lead he life of danger he believe my story and nothing thus far have arise to bring he the slightest doubt to he mind i be a reckless adventurer ruin by drink a drift derelict so glad to be pick up and give rank as to be forever grateful and loyal to the one aid I while he instinct make he distrust a englishman he already have some measure of faith in I personally yet this confidence be still so light as to be completely shatter by the slightest mishap my every move must be one of extreme caution he and estevan be await I the latter all rig out and with smooth black hair oil and plaster down upon he forehead i never behold a more disagreeable face or one which so thoroughly reveal the nature of a man as i touch he hand at estada 's brief introduction it be as if i finger a snake and expect to be greet with a kiss gunsaule hover about a open door lead forward and the table have be set for four as i know levere have eat alone before come to my relief the only conclusion be that the portuguese intend that we be join by the prisoner indeed he give I little time for doubt this be you chair gate and you will find we live well aboard the _ namur _ -- wine woman and song -- hey manuel why not when all be at command steward you tell the lady what my order be si senor then bid she join we we stand in silence as gunsaule cross the deck and insert a key in the afterstateroom door manuel be grin in full enjoyment but the expression on the face of estada be that of grim cruelty evidently he expect a scene a outburst of resentment plead and tear and be ready enough to exercise he authority perhaps he mean all this as a lesson to I perhaps it be no more than a natural exhibition of he nature yet he purpose to conquer be clearly depict in he feature -- this woman would be make to obey or else ruthlessly crushed i feel my hand grip like iron on my chair back and my tooth clinch in restraint god but i would have like to grip the fellow where he stand -- all the bottled-up hatred in my soul struggle for action yet that would only mean the death of all hope and i turn my eye away from he and stare with the other at the opening door i fail to catch the word gunsaule utter but they be instantly respond to out into the full light of the cabin the woman come and halt barely a step in advance of the steward she head uplift proudly she eye on we never before have i realize she beauty she personality as i do then the glow of the light be upon she face and there be color in she cheek and a strange appealing look in she eye she posture be not that of defiance nor of surrender she stand as a woman defend she right to respect sustain by a wonderful courage i catch she glance but there be no recognition in it not by the flicker of a eyelid do she betray surprise and yet in some mysterious manner a flash of intelligence pass between we it be all instantaneous for she gaze seem to concentrate on estada as though she know he as leader you send for I for what she ask she spanish clear and well choose to join we at meal he answer unmoved it be better than to remain alone better you must have a strange opinion of I to believe i would sit with murderer and thief harsh word senorita and estada grin grimly yet i expect they there be many trade in the world by which man be rob we only work at the one we like best nor will i discuss that with you however senorita i can say that we have take no life in this last affair no life in sudden incredulous surprise you mean my uncle live if you refer to fairfax -- the one in whose room the chest be hide i can reply truthfully that he live one of my man strike he down but it be not a death blow if that be the reason of you disdain there be no cause this chair be hold for you but why be i bring away a prisoner to be a plaything a sport for you pleasure that be but the order of we chief we await he recovery to learn he purpose sanchez be he you chief a pirate a buccaneer we prey on the enemy of spain he explain apparently believe he own word it be war with we without regard to treaty we rob only that we may carry on the war they have rob we and now it have become we turn it be at captain sanchez 's order we wait the arrival of you vessel from england it seem he meet you on the voyage yes breathlessly he love you he would no doubt have deal with you honorably : i have reason to believe that to be he purpose now to this end you give he no encouragement -- be not this true i -- i do not like he yet it be he will that you should nothing will change he purpose he be that kind and he have the power he determine that if you would not come to he by choice you should be make to by force you be here now by he order and will remain until you consent to he purpose -- all that remain for you to decide be whether you choose to be prisoner or guest aboard she question perplexed eye turn from face to face as though she could not grasp fully the purpose of what be say he -- he be still alive -- this captain sanchez yes with a chance to survive and if he live i be to be at he disposal he be the chief here he will be law aboard and if he should die estada shrug he shoulder indifferently who know she lip tighten as though to hold back a cry while one hand press to the open door steady she the cheek be no longer flush and there be a look in the search eye i do not like to see it be a moment before she could control she voice i have hear they call you estada she say finally determine to learn the whole truth of what rank in this company be you i be pedro estada formerly the first officer now by occasion of captain sanchez 's wound in full command these be two of my officer -- senor gate one of you own countryman and manuel estevan you be pirate he laugh unpleasantly as though the word have a ugly sound even to he ear rather call we sea rover senorita it better express we trade enough to admit that we serve under no flag and confess no master and now that i have answer you question what be it to be between we -- peace or war she eye droop and i could distinctly note the tremble of she slender figure when she slowly raise she glance once more it rest on my face as though seek approval guidance if there be only the one choice she say quietly i accept peace i can not live lock in that room alone haunt by my thought and memory if i pledge you my word senor be i to enjoy the freedom of this cabin and the deck estada look at we a shade of doubt in he eye i make no sign but manuel nod why not he ask in he harsh croak of a voice so long as we be at sea what harm can the girl do perhaps none i will take a half chance at least you shall have the freedom of the cabin so long as you keep you word while as to the deck we will consider that later prove you mean what you say by join we here my recollection of that meal be not of word but of face i do not even clearly recall what it be we talk about although it include a variety of topic limit somewhat by lack of knowledge on the part of estada and manuel the former attempted conversation but soon give up the effort in despair he eye however seek constantly the girl 's face and to my consternation exhibit a interest in she personality which promise trouble i know not whether she notice this awakening admiration but she certainly play she part with quiet modesty speak just enough to entertain and hide the deep anxiety against which she struggle i believe that even the portuguese reach the conclusion that she be not altogether regretful for this adventure and that it be safe for he to relax some degree of vigilance he manner become more gracious and long before the meal end he language have a tendency to compliment and flatter i contented myself with occasional sentence the young woman sit directly across from I we word overhear by all and as i know both man possess some slight knowledge of english i dare not venture beyond commonplace conversation in that tongue with quick wit she take she cue from I so that nothing pass between we either by word of mouth or glance of eye to arouse suspicion believe the feeling of confidence would be increase by such action i be first to leave the table and it be my watch below immediately retire to my room noisily close the door after I yet refrain from let the latch catch thus enjoy a slight opening through which to both see and hear manuel do not linger long make some excuse to go forward but estada remain for some time endeavor to entertain she laugh at he effort and appear interested in encourage he so that he keep he spirit of good humor even amid these difficulty he egotism make a fool of the man yet even he finally become discourage of make she comprehend he meaning and lapse into a silence which give she a excuse to retire this be accomplish so graciously as to leave no sting the fellow actually accompany she to the door of she stateroom bow he compliment as she disappear within the fool actually believe he have make a conquest and preen himself like a turkey cock gunsaule senor you need not lock the senorita in she room or guard she in any way hereafter she be permit to come and go as she please aboard si senor you have serve the captain and jose yes -- do the wounded man eat at all a little soup senor he would taste nothing else estada enter he own stateroom leave the door ajar when he come out he have exchange he coat for a rough jacket thus attire for a turn on deck he disappear through the companion chapter xvi in dorothy 's stateroom i stand crouch with eye at the crack watchful of every movement in the light cabin my own decision make i must see and talk with dorothy we must understand each other and the earlier we could thus begin work together in unison the better gunsaule bear a tray of dish from the captain 's room and then after carefully wipe up the main table and slide it up out of the way on its stantion place a bottle of brandy and some glass on a swing shelf apparently satisfy that he work there be complete he turn down the light and depart along the passage lead amidship a moment later i hear the sound of dish grind together preparatory to be wash no better opportunity for action be likely to occur although the situation be not without peril jose might emerge at any instant from sanchez 's cabin while i have no reason to be assure that estada would remain long on deck even if he do any movement below could be observe through the overhead glass indeed it might be with this purpose in view that he have go outside however i feel compel to accept the chance the light be so dim that i believe i could steal cautiously along in the deeper shadow without attract attention from the deck even if someone stand there on watch i move noiselessly leave my own door slightly ajar and creep along close to the side wall until i attain my destination nothing occur cause I to fear my movement be detect to have knock at the closed door however softly might be overhear so know it to be unlock i merely lift the latch noiselessly and slip quickly within there be no light except a glimmer of star through a large after port but against this faint radiance she stand vaguely reveal evidently the girl have be stand there gaze out at the water and have turn swiftly about at my entrance arouse by some slight sound she first thought must have be estada for there be a startled note of fear in she challenge who be you why do you come here speak low i caution you must know my voice geoffry carlyle yes but do not use that name -- all hope depend on my remain unknown you welcome I she come straight forward through the dim star-shine a spectral figure with both hand outstretch welcome she tone that of intense sincerity you presence give I all the strength i have but for you i should throw myself through that port into the sea but i know not how you come here -- tell I you be not really one of these wretch no you must believe that first of all and trust I i do -- but -- but tell I all you can be there a divan here or anywhere we can sit down together i can see nothing in this darkness yes hold my hand while i guide you we can sit here it be a couch of some kind against the outer wall she do not release she grasp seemingly gain courage from this physical contact and my finger close warmly over she own now please breathlessly how be it possible you be aboard this vessel -- a officer i tell she the strange story as swiftly and simply as possible speaking scarcely above a whisper feeling as i progress that i relate a dream rather than a series of fact it seem to I she could scarcely be expect to believe the truth of what i say and yet she do almost unquestioningly the clasp of she finger perceptibly tighten as i proceed the soft light from the open port touch she face slightly enough to reveal its outline and she sit so close beside I she eye uplift to mine that i could feel she breath upon my cheek why if -- if you have not tell I this yourself i could hardly believe such a tale she exclaim yet it must be true miraculous as it seem but what be to be the end have you any plan of escape hardly a plan i have have no opportunity even to learn the true nature of the crew watkin be a honest sailor and he have tell I of other on whom i could rely there be those aboard -- but i do not know how many -- who would mutiny if they have a leader and a reasonable chance of success i must reach these and learn who they be fortunately the voyage promise to be long enough to enable I to plan carefully you have discuss the voyage with this man -- estada he tell I what he have decide upon not to return to they rendezvous until after they have capture some prize and could go with gold chinking in they pocket they have gold already -- the chest take from my uncle that only serve to make such as these more greedy where be they rendezvous a island in the west indy probably not on the chart they call it porto grande and they will sweep the ocean between here and there seek victim unarmed merchantman to rob and sink and you -- you will be compel to take part in such scene such act of pillage and perhaps murder be this true i presume i must seem to be one of they to avoid suspicion there be some hope in my mind that we may chance to run into a english or french warship quite a few must be cruise in these water but these be only contingency they may happen and they may not how we be to act under such condition will have to be decide later now we must be content to seek release through we own effort have you any suggestion she be silent for a long moment during which she withdraw she hand press it over she eye as though thus to better concentrate she thought there be conspiracy on board already she say finally that you may not know about you mean to depose sanchez i question in surprise yes you have suspicion it they think I unconscious in the boat and talk among themselves -- the two at the stern estada and that beast manuel i do not understand all they say only a word or two but i do not think they intend the captain shall recover you think it best that he should oh i do not know there be no best that i can see yet i would have more faith in be spare disgrace if at the mercy of sanchez than he lieutenant both may be equally guilty equally desperate but they be not the same man true but i know not which be to be most fear i may be wrong she insist for i judge as a woman yet i would feel safer with sanchez he care not much for I perhaps yet enough so that i possess some power over he the other do not -- he merely desire with the passion of a brute no appeal would reach he he would laugh at tear and find pleasure in suffer i do not quite believe this of sanchez perhaps not -- the other may be the greater beast i know he be the proof be in those horrid eye what be the man of what race portuguese i be tell but likely a half-breed ugh it make I shudder to even look at he and yet you would have I appear friendly we can not permit he to feel that either of we be enemy he be the power aboard we life everything be in he hand if he mean to be rid of sanchez the man be doom for he will find a way to accomplish he purpose at whatever cost murder mean nothing to these man of course you be right she acknowledge we case be so desperate we must resort to any weapon you believe it will serve the possibility of escape if i permit this monster to imagine that i have some interest in he to do so might delay the explosion i reply gravely and just now any delay be welcome i know how such a effort will try you but the end may be well worth the sacrifice i doubt if even estada will resort to force on board indeed force will be the very last card he will care to play in you case he be a brute and capable of any crime yet at heart a coward there be reason why he will fear to assault you you be english and all the practical seaman on board be from northern europe -- english and scandinavian these man be not pirate from choice -- they be prisoner who have take on to save they own life with he bully and cut-throat amidship he can compel they to work but he dare not go too far once these fellow unite in mutiny they could take the ship a assault on you would be dangerous it be these man you count on yes but for I to gain they confidence and leadership will require time i must reach they all secretly and alone not more than half be in my watch and watkin must approach the other a plan for concerted action will have to be arrange and every precaution take the slightest slip would mean failure and merciless punishment even if i succeed in gathering together all these better element on board we shall yet be outnumber two to one perhaps more and we only hope rest in surprise at best the situation be absolutely desperate -- but i see no other solution and my service be deceit -- the acting of a part to blind the eye of estada i sincerely believe you greater chance of security lie in this course the fellow be a supreme egotist opposition will anger he while flattery will make he subservient you have the wit and discretion to hold he within certain limit it be a dangerous game i admit and a disagreeable one but the case require desperate remedy she lift she eye search my face through the dim light geoffry carlyle she say at last a tremor in the low voice there be no sacrifice i would not make to preserve my honor i hate this man i dread he touch i shrink from contact with he as i would from a snake but i be not go to refuse to do my part if you say this be right and justified i will consent i believe it be and you will not lose faith in I she question earnestly it will not lower you belief in my womanhood nothing could do that mistress dorothy i want you to realize the depth of my interest and respect you friendliness have mean much to I and i would never urge you to lower you ideal but we must face this situation as it be you can not cling now to the standard of london or even maryland we be on the ocean upon a pirate ship surround by man utterly devoid of all restraint -- hell-hound of the sea who live by murder and pillage we possess but two weapon of defense -- deceit or force a resort to the latter be at present impossible i can not conceive that you be lower yourself in any way by use the power you possess to escape violence -- the power i possess yes -- beauty and wit these be you weapon and most effective one you can play with estada and defeat he -- temporarily at least i confess there be danger in such a game -- he be a wild beast and he evil nature may overcome he discretion you be arm no i have never feel the need then take this and i thrust a pistol into she hand i take it from the rack in the cabin and can get another it be charge keep it hide about you person but use it only when all else fail do you see this necessity now from my standpoint yes hesitatingly all that you say be true but -- but the thought frighten I it -- it be like creep into a lion 's cage have only a fan with which to defend myself i smile at she conceit a fan rightly use be no insignificant weapon in the hand of a woman it have win many a victory i have faith in you wield it to the best effect -- the lasting discomfiture of senor estada you laugh indignantly believe I a coquette -- a girl to play with man no that misconstrue my thought i believe you a true woman yet possess the natural instinct of you sex and able to use you weapon efficiently there be no evil in that no reproach i would not have you otherwise and we must not misunderstand each other you retain faith in I implicitly and pledge yourself to you part leave I to attend to mine she two hand clasp my finger she eye uplift geoffry carlyle i have always believe in you and now after the sacrifice you have make to serve I i can refuse you nothing you ask i will endeavor to accomplish all you require of I god know how i hate the task but -- but i will do my best only -- only she voice sink if -- if the monster can not be hold i will kill he i hope you do i shall if the beast lay hand on I he -- he pay the price i could not do otherwise geoffry carlyle -- i be a fairfax satisfy with my mission and confident nothing more need be say i arise to my foot then we can do nothing further until i learn the disposition of the crew i say quietly estada be not likely to resort to extreme measure at present he have two object before he -- to permit sanchez to die of he wound if that be at all probable and to win the man by some successful capture these fellow only retain command by success the taking of a rich ship will make estada a hero while a defeat would mean he overthrow and the ascendancy of someone else there be no other test of a robber chief estada know this and will not dare act until he have put clinking coin in the pocket of he man that be why i believe you be comparatively safe now -- he own position of command be in the balance i be glad you explain that to I the knowledge will give I more confidence do not rely too much on he control of himself there be no trust to be put in such a man i must go now and endeavor to reach my quarter unseen i will see you again perhaps not here it be too dangerous but i will find means to communicate with you possibly the steward can be trust as a messenger i will talk with he and make sure meanwhile we must not appear interested in each other good-bye we stand with hand clasp in the darkness i think she be go to speak again but the word fail to come then suddenly silently the door open a mere crack let in a gleam of yellow light from the main cabin while the crouching figure of a man like a glide shadow slip through the aperture close the door behind he as softly as he have open it i hear she catch she breath and feel she hand grasp my sleeve but i never stir the fellow have neither see nor hear we and i stare into the black curtain endeavor to locate he by some sound of movement who could he be what might be the purpose of he entrance but one answer occur to I -- pedro estada drive by unbridled passion to attack the girl mad as such a act would be yet no other explanation seem possible i thrust she behind I and take a step forward with body poise for action i be unarmed but care little for that in the swift desire feel to come to hand grip with the brute i could hear he now slowly and cautiously feel he way toward we through the darkness chapter xvii a murder on board the fellow make scarcely a sound as he advance yet as i wait breathlessly i feel assure of he stealthy approach to be certain of free space i extend one hand and my finger come into unexpected contact with the back of a chair without move my body i grasped this welcome weapon of defense and swing it above my head whoever the invader creep upon we might prove to be he be certainly a enemy actuate by some foul purpose and no doubt arm to strike he down as quickly and silently as possible be therefore the plain duty of the moment i have no other think the slowness with which he grope he way forward indicate unfamiliarity with the apartment although he direct advance proclaim some special purpose clearly he have no fear of attack believe no one more formidable than a girl be there to oppose he the darkness perhaps and silence convince the fellow that she have already retire he would have he grip on she before she could even dream of he presence then there would be no scream no alarm i could determine almost he exact position as he advance foot feel cautiously along the deck seek to avoid striking any obstacle in the darkness he come forward inch by inch and i have the sensation of await the spring of some creep animal about to leap upon I with tense muscle the heavy chair poise for a blow i measure the distance as indicate by faint shuffling sound perceptible only because of the profound stillness i could not see but i know i feel he presence in imagination i picture he with arm outstretch barely beyond my reach deliberately advance one foot for yet another step forward with all my force i strike blindly as it have be deliver the blow hit fair there be a thud a inarticulate groan and the fall of a body onto the floor -- beyond that nothing i wait breathlessly the chair back grip in my hand anxiously listen for the slightest movement there be none to be distinguish not so much as the quiver of a muscle i feel dorothy touch my shoulder and catch the sound of she voice tremble at my ear what it be what do you do i strike he with a chair he lie there on the deck wait where you be until i learn what have happen i bent over and touch he drop to my knee every nerve tingle as my hand feel of the recumbent body the fellow lay in a heap he flesh warm but with no perceptible heart-beat no semblance of breathing my finger seek he face and i could scarcely suppress a cry of surprise -- he be not estada who then be he what could have be he purpose in thus invade this stateroom all i could grasp be the fact that the fellow be not the portuguese -- he possess a smooth face long hair and be a much smaller man it must have become overcast without for the star-gleam be no longer visible through the after port and yet a faint light enter sufficient for my purpose i drag the body that way drop it where the slight illumination fall directly on the upturned face the feature reveal be unfamiliar -- those unquestionably of a half-breed indian dorothy cross to my side she foot strike a knife which come glimmer into the narrow range of light she stare in horror at the ugly weapon and then at the ghastly countenance who be he do you know one i have never see before he must belong to the gang amidship -- a indian she shudder she voice tremble he come to murder see he knife lie there why should he have seek to kill I it be all mystery i admit and too deep for I perhaps it be a mistake or the fellow thought you have jewel anyway he will never try that trick again -- see my blow crush he skull he be actually dead beyond doubt the chair be a heavy one and i strike with all my strength what shall be do with the body it can not be leave lie expose here no one would believe you kill he and my presence must not be suspect could it she suggest be drop astern through the port ay that might be do it be dull of I not to think of that yet we must not risk a splash to be overhear on deck be there a rope of any kind to be have only this curtain cord it be not large but strong that ought to do if long enough there must be a twenty-foot drop to the water yes splice the two together let I have they she shrink back from touch the inanimate figure she face very pale in the dim light yet it require the combined effort of both to force the stiffen body through the port hole and then lower it slowly to the surging water below the cord cut we hand cruelly but it hold and the dead man sink beneath the surface and be sweep swiftly astern into the black depths we could distinguish footstep on the deck above but these be regular and undisturbed -- the slow promenade from rail to rail of the officer on watch clearly nothing have be hear or see to awaken suspicion i turn back as the release body vanish to look into she face which be scarcely visible if you should be question tomorrow you have best know nothing i say gravely i do not think you will be for surely such a attack can be no plan of estada 's it could gain he no advantage the fellow be pillage on he own account if he be miss it will be suppose he fall overboard and no one will greatly care you will be able to learn i -- i shall feel better if i know the truth possibly however it will be safer for I not to ask question i be not myself in too good repute aboard you be not afraid to remain here alone no i be not greatly frightened but shall try and bar the door with a chair i have no key then i 'll leave you half of my watch below must be go by now i 'll take the fellow 's knife along as it must not be find here we part with a clasp of hand as i open the stateroom door and slip out into the cabin to my surprise the light over the table have be extinguish render the cabin so black i hold to actually feel my way forward this strike I as very strange particularly as i recall clearly that a stream of light have flash into the after stateroom with the entrance of the prowler the lantern must have be put out since then by some confederate gunsaule would be soundly asleep long ago and the light be suppose to burn until morning however there be no noise other than the creak and groan of the ship 's timber mingle with the steady tread of levere on the upper deck so after a moment of hesitation i find my way across to my own stateroom and press open the door a misty light come in through the port sufficient to show I all be exactly as i have leave it and i fling off my jacket preparatory to lie down for a short rest before be recall for the watch on deck the hilt of the knife in my belt attract my attention and i draw it forth curious to learn if it bear any mark of ownership whether it do or not i shall never know as my eye be instantly attract to a dark stain on both hilt and blade i hold it to the light -- it be the stain of blood and my hand be also redden by it in that first instant of horror i hurl the weapon out through the open port into the sea blood human blood without doubt there have be murder commit on board and the fellow i have strike down be seek refuge endeavor to find concealment follow he crime ay but what about the light in the cabin it have be extinguish after the flee fugitive have enter dorothy 's stateroom do this mean that the slayer have a accomplice if so then the killing be not the result of a mere personal quarrel amidship or in the forecastle but the result of some conspiracy i thought of sanchez and of estada 's plan to obtain control of the ship could this be its culmination and be the spaniard already lie dead in he cabin this be the only solution of the mystery which seem probable and yet this do not wholly satisfy my mind not that i question the fiendishness of estada or he coconspirator manuel or they unwillingness to commit such a crime but it seem so unnecessarily brutal why should they stab a man already so severely wound as to be threaten with death he be helpless and in they power neglect or at most a simple reopen of he wound would be sufficient for they purpose to attack he anew would only mean exposure and perhaps awaken the enmity of the crew nothing come of my thought -- only confusion nor do i dare investigate for fear of become more deeply involve in the tragedy there have be no alarm everything aboard be go on as usual i could hear levere tramp the deck and occasionally catch the echo of he voice as he hail the main-top or give some order to the man forward no there be nothing to be do my safety and the safety of the girl depend on we apparent ignorance of what have occur we must have no part in it no knowledge or suspicion there be nothing to do but wait the revelation of the morning convincing myself of this i wash the blood stain from my hand and lay down in the bunk fully dress to await my call evidently the wind have decrease as the _ namur _ pitch but little in the sea and i could hear the scuffling of foot indicate a new spread of canvas above the night air blowing in through my open port become so chill that i cover myself with a blanket the vessel creak and groan in every joint some of the sound actually startling I with they resemblance to cry of human agony i toss about occasionally sit upright to peer around in the darkness my body bath in cold perspiration yet must have drop finally off into a uneasy sleep a sharp rapping of knuckle on the door awake I with a start starboard watch senor will be on deck at once ay ay senor i draw on a heavy pea jacket of leather fasten it securely at the throat and don a wool cap the lantern in the cabin have be relight and be burn brightly and my anxious glance about the interior reveal nothing out of place the only door open lead to the steward 's storeroom feeling it best to be prepare for any eventuality i select a pistol from the rack see to its loading and slip the weapon into my pocket except for one man busily engage coil a rope the main deck be desert and i climb the short ladder to the poop meeting levere as i straighten up the sea be a gentle swell the sky clear above but with a mass of dark cloud off the port quarter a glance aloft reveal a full spread of canvas the air contain a nip of frost all set i see levere si senor and at that we barely move the bark need a gale o ' wind to make any headway you have no fear of the storm yonder he glance aside at the mass of cloud no senor it hang just there a hour past -- not come here but creep around you course still to the sou ' o ' east senor he bent down to glance at the card and i see he dark face in the gleam of the binnacle light he be not bad look but for the continuous gleam of prominent tooth he straighten up who put out the cabin light senor i be sure i do not know be it out yes senor i never know that to happen before a accident no doubt the steward probably leave some near-by port open and a gust of wind do the business that be nothing to worry over he shake he head as though far from satisfy by my theory but go below without attempt to reply i watch he through the skylight but he merely gulp down a glass of liquor and enter he stateroom my watch be uneventful the fellow at the wheel be unfamiliar to I and rather surly in he answer to the few question i put to he as he could speak nothing but spanish i soon leave he alone and fall to pacing the deck immerse in my own thought these be far from pleasant one as i review again the strange situation in which i find myself circumstance have play I a sorry trick without plan almost without effort i have drift into a position of utmost delicacy any accident or mistake might lead to disastrous result not only my own life but the life of the young woman below could be endanger by a single careless word or act the whole affair seem more a nightmare than a reality i be actually serve as first officer on a pirate ship in search of vessel to rob on the high sea command a crew of west indian cut-throat -- the very scum of hell and under the order of a portuguese devil whose ambition coolly plot murder i be sail under the black flag to be hang if capture compel to act out the masquerade a satellite of the most infamous villain who ever sack a merchantman why the very name of sanchez have be horror to I in the past -- yet here i actually be in charge of the deck of he death ship search for new victim and only hope that the arch villain might live to overthrow the even fouler demon who would succeed he if he die already i know murder have be do that the come morning would reveal some hideous tragedy on which perhaps my fate would depend somewhere below in the dark lay a dead man he sightless eye stare upward the curse of crime be upon the vessel and this possibly be only the begin whose end could not be foresee and for what be i there the answer be not upon my lip but in my heart -- dorothy fairfax i bow my head on the rail and stare out over the dark water but i see only she face no i would not turn back would not fail she let the end be death and disgrace i mean to fight grimly on until that end come in that hour i know she be more to I than life or even honor far more than mere duty bind I i be prisoner to love the dawn come cold and gray but with clear sky the force of the wind increase become unsteady and cause a choppy sea so that i feel impel to lower the topsail and take a reef in the larger canvas nothing be report in sight but to reassure myself i climb into the main crosstree and sweep the horizon with a glass not so much as a speck reward my effort and i descend the ratlin shout to the boatswain to call the port watch watkin come aft to the wheel and i send the fellow thus relieve down into the cabin to rout out levere the two return to deck together the negro glance about curiously without mount the ladder you call senor estada yet he question no i have no order to do so he tol ' I call he at daylight here you amada go wake up the senor the seaman disappear grumble while levere cross the poop deck and stand beside I look out across the expanse of sea no sail -- hey we hav ' bad luck -- too far north and west we be out of the sea lane but if it keep bright i 'll take a observation at noon amada emerge from the companion and stare up at we shade he mouth with one hand as he speak he answer nothing senor levere you rap on the door si senor i strike with my fist and my boot but he never wake up be the door lock i know not senor i not try open it levere give utterance to a oath the pig-headed swine he say fiercely i suppose i 'll have to go myself we eye meet and something seem to bid I accompany he we 'll go down together senor i say quietly estada must be sick i could hear the rumpus amada kick up even on deck here no man could sleep through that racket chapter xviii a new conspiracy the interior of the cabin appear more desolate than ever in the gray light of dawn the swing light yet burn but be now useless all the dismal horror of the place reveal by the slowly increase gleam of day steal down from above gunsaule have not appear and levere 's stateroom door remain ajar give glimpse of the disarranged bunk within the other door be tightly close levere rather hold back not noticeably so perhaps yet enough to give I the lead and with one swift glance about i lead the way directly to estada 's stateroom something sinister have occur during the dark hour of the night of that i be convinced and i believe we be now about to lift the veil hide the tragedy my heart pound like a hammer as i rapped on the wooden panel and wait some response from within there be no answer no sound of movement and i rapped again more loudly my question eye seek levere 's face he be listen as intently as myself he eye express anxiety if i have feel some suspicion of the man before this lack of faith vanish -- he certainly be concern in no plot involve the life of the portuguese there be something wrong senor he whisper for he be ever a light sleeper then we will find out what it be the door be unlock the latch yield instantly to the hand and i step within a glance tell everything the port be close but through the thick glass sufficient light find entrance to reveal the interior the chair before the table be overturn and there be papers scatter about the deck estada lay in he bunk with one leg dangle outside and he head crooked against the side wall he very posture be that of sudden death even have it not be picture by the ghastly face peculiarly hideous in the gray light which stare at we and the dark pool of blood underneath i hear a exclamation from levere and stand for a instant utterly unable to move the only sound audible be the steady drip of blood i know already what i should find yet finally force myself forward -- he be stone dead pierce with three knife thrust i stand up and face the mulatto whose countenance be fairly green with horror what do you know about this senor levere i ask sternly the man have be murder knife who do it -- and why he could scarcely answer grip at the table for support and never remove he gaze from the face of the dead man yet i believe he word be convince this be not the terror of guilt my god i can not tell i have never dream of this -- that be true senor have the man enemy anyone you would suspect enemy ay plenty of they we all have we expect that in we trade this ship be full of devil ready enough to do such a job but i could not name the one who do do it i know of no cause i have hear nothing i believe you levere i say when he voice cease yet unwilling even then to trust he fully all that rule here be strength murder be but a weapon and hate strike this blow what can we do senor do we must talk that over first open the port there and let in some fresh air that be better but we can not think look at that ghastly face and hear the blood drip onto the deck we 'll leave he here and talk over the affair in the cabin but the man will think it strange he protest if i do not return to the deck some may know what lie here we can not help that levere we can not meet this thing until we be prepare until we talk it over and decide what to do it be not the man on deck the watch i fear but those fellow amidship -- they be the one to be afraid of be that not so si senor then come there be more danger in hasty action than anything else i shut the door behind we and turn the key it be a relief to get outside even into that dismal cabin beyond view of estada 's dead face the vessel roll considerably and levere who have evidently lose he nerve sink into a chair as though no strength remain in he you fear a uprising a mutiny i question when this be report what will prevent he ask the captain can not stir the mate dead the man already craze because we take no prize they will murder we also and take control who will those devil amidship ay they care only to fight for gold -- it be they trade and who lead they who would they make captain manuel estevan he whisper he would be the one i think as much then it be manuel estevan we must secure first -- before they know ` tis my thought he be at the bottom of it all and we hope lie in we early discovery if we can act before he do we may thwart he plan listen levere i will speak low for that forward stateroom be he he have not suppose we would discover the murder so quickly for he know nothing of estada 's request that he be call at daylight -- be this true si senor it be he last order when he go below good then we must organize before he can act we have that one chance leave whatever he man may know of what have occur they will make no move until they get he order we must stop the possibility of he issue any without a leader the advantage be ours you mean to kill he only as a last resort i be no murderer although there be enough at stake here to make I willing to take life there be no good feeling between those quarter amidship and the crew no senor it be hate generally although they be not all alike the real sailor be mostly capture man they serve to save they life and only for these other on board could not be hold long we do not arm they or use they to board prize it be those devil amidship who loot that be all they work to fight and guard these other naturally there be no love lose between they you plan senor be to set the one against the other yes if possible i know no other way these sailor man be of all race can they be trust he sit bend forward he hand on he knee he dark face far from pleasant i have every reason to know the fellow to be criminal desperate guilty of everything in the calendar and yet i must place confidence in he only as we work together now be there any prospect of success some might be it be hard to tell how many it be not the race which count so much senor there be those among they who would not care to return to honesty and you levere he spread he hand and shrug he shoulder there be no hope of I i be bear to the free life what then be it with you hate senor -- revenge and he tooth gleam savagely i would spit on this manuel who seek to be chief i can never be -- no i be of black skin with negro blood in my vein and white man would never have it so but i can hate senor that be why i be with you now if the devil so will you plan might work -- tell I more of it it be simple enough levere and come to I but now as i look upon estada lie there dead treachery kill he and that treachery must have purpose behind it you believe this to be the ambition of manuel estevan to become chief and that in this he be back by those buccaneer amidship whom he command but to accomplish this end there must soon be other murder aboard -- the captain sanchez and possibly we own as well although ` tis likely he may offer we life to join he but i doubt if the fellow be ready yet to throw off the mask and openly declare himself he will claim the murder of estada to be the act of some fiendish member of the crew and wait until thing aboard ripen to he purpose he be not likely to dream that we suspect he this give we we chance -- we can act before he do but if the man be with he what be the odds say you -- thirty to a hundred ay but surprise will overcome that my plan be this first for you and i to secure manuel as quietly as possible but at whatever cost surely that can be do with he in we hand or dead the buccaneer have no leader what then there be man in the crew on deck and in the forecastle to be trust -- watkin be one and he will know other a dozen no doubt they will be enough we will whisper the truth to these and have they ready for a signal the forward door from amidship be close by iron bar -- be it not si senor he eye again sparkling with interest the man quarrel and there be fight then there be no escape in that direction and it can be no great task to close any passage lead aft lower the deck hatch and we have those devil below cage like so many rat there need be no fighting starvation will bring they to term but senor you forget -- you dozen man can not guard the buccaneer below and also manage the bark at sea the crew be not all lamb -- many will sympathize with those thus lock beneath deck cochose be bad and a friend of manuel he will fight and there be other to back he i know that levere the whole plan be desperate but there be no other possible here be my scheme there be a gun rack in the cabin contain enough weapon to arm the dozen man we can trust the other have nothing but they sheath knive the buccaneer can be secure below before these other lad ever realize what be happen -- many will be asleep in the forecastle as soon as we have control of the ship we 'll round they up forward they will not dare face the gun i 'll give they they choice and as for cochose i have take he measure once already and be ready to try it again and what will you tell they senor i catch my breath conscious of he mean my secret hope could not be reveal to this fellow however hate and ambition might sway he and however personal fear might influence he at the moment he purpose and mine be entirely different piracy be he life he know and care for nothing else in innate savagery he be not better than any of the other and must be deal with accordingly just now i must have he on my side and condition have deliver he into my hand but i could only hope to retain he through self interest the mulatto have little faith in I i be a stranger a englishman unknown and untried naturally we be enemy he would make use of I for the present if he could and as smilingly knife I tomorrow if it serve he turn i feel confident of that and in consequence the answer come quickly to my lip the whole truth senor levere -- that manuel conspire to seize the bark through a mutiny of the buccaneer that these be to be turn loose with license to kill anyone on board who oppose they that they real purpose be to divide among themselves all the treasure below then wreck the vessel and escape with it that to this end estada have already be foully murder and that they also intend to take the life of the other officer so as to be free to do as they please i shall explain that we discover this conspiracy just in time to save they from butchery and that they must stand by we or else submit to those hell-hound i 'll put it strong and after that senor why porto grande of course i admit heartily it be not a long voyage and if we bring the boat in safely the treasure be ours the man will understand what that mean -- a handful of gold for each of they and a run ashore why levere they will make more apiece than by looting a half dozen ship and with no fight it will be a fortune for you and I he somber eye light up startle by this new idea and he spring to he foot sway before I to the pitch of the deck you mean that senor we divide what be below and sail for porto grande i hear you right you not mean surrender you stay pirate i laugh my nerve tingle to the success of my ruse -- he have take the tempting bait like a hungry fish why of course so that be the trouble hell man i be not such a fool as to throw away this chance i come aboard here without a dollar drunk a sailor before the mast look at I now -- shove into a job as first officer with my full share of all we can lay hand on do you suppose i be go back to the forecastle and a bit of silver not I i be for all i can get and with no care how i get it this be we chance levere if we put the _ namur _ into porto grande with sanchez on board and alive and those hell-hound lock below we 'll get anything we ask for we 'll be the cock of the walk if he should not live through why then we 'll have a ship and can run the game alone either way if we win the prize be ours -- and by god if we stick together we win my apparent enthusiasm catch the fellow i could read the working of he mind in he face this be a new view of the situation a new vision it appeal to he from every standpoint -- it promise wealth power the total defeat of estevan everything he most desire and as i picture it the result seem easy of attainment he eye gleam lightning you think senor sanchez live what difference if he live he owe he life to we if he die the bark be in we hand and the treasure the thing to consider now be how to get control once we have win we care nothing if he live or die come we have waste time enough in talk it be action that count -- what say you be we together in this he thrust out a lean yellow hand and i grip it firmly si senor you speak right to do this we must act i be with you you pledge you word francoi i pledge it senor good and you have mine now to the work -- first manuel estevan and then the man on deck ` tis he stateroom yonder chapter xix lay the trap we first job be execute much more easily than i have anticipate we catch manuel sound asleep and levere have sinewy hand at he throat before the fellow could grasp a weapon or even clearly comprehend the nature of the attack the narrowness of the stateroom prevent my take much part in the affair but the mulatto need no help as he drag the cursing spaniard from he bunk to the deck and throttle he savagely indeed he would have kill the fellow have i not interfere and twist he hand loose leave estevan barely conscious a blanket rip into strip serve to bind he securely enough for the present but i think it best to lock the door and keep the key in my own pocket levere would have knife he even as he lay there helpless but for my threat and insistence once back in the cabin my eye distinguish the frightened face of the steward peer forth at we from out the dark of the passage lead forward come here gunsaule i say sternly step lively lad there be nothing for you to fear yes senor -- yes and he creep forth from he partial cover glance fearfully from face to face as he advance senor estada have be kill during the night and we have just capture he murderer i explain hastily there be reason to believe this act be part of a conspiracy to seize the ship by senor manuel he eye stare at I from out a white face yes in connection with those fellow amidship do that passage lead to they quarter it do once senor but now there be a closed door the captain sanchez have it so arrange to prevent the man from come aft what kind of a door of oak stud with iron not only lock but bar on this side you have no key no senor there be but two -- one for the captain and the other for he who command the buccaneer manuel si senor i stand there a moment silent consider this information and rapidly arrange in mind we future operation the only way the mutineer could reach the cabin then would be from the deck descend through the companion so long as they remain unaware of the capture of manuel there be little danger of they take such action my faith in gunsaule be not great yet the probability be that he would remain loyal to whichever party hold the upper hand that be ever the way with these man very well steward i say you go on about you work as though nothing have happen if any word of this affair get to the crew or to those fellow forward i 'll hold you responsible understand that si senor you be not to leave this cabin without my permission nor speak to anyone levere the mulatto face I respectfully enough and i have a feeling he would obey order largely because he dare not rebel si senor they will be wonder why you be not on deck it will be better for you to take charge of the watch at once and keep the man busy relieve watkin at the wheel and send the man down to I he can choose the fellow who will stick better than you could and then can circulate among they without arouse suspicion send he down at once quietly he disappear through the companion while gunsaule vanish within the storeroom where i could hear he rummage noisily about i sit down to wait the appearance of watkin satisfy that matter be already safely in my control that the english sailor would cooperate i have no doubt and as to levere he have already go too far to openly play the traitor it be full daylight now and evidently a bright morning although the swell of the sea remain heavy and i judge there must be a strong wind watkin muffle to the ear in a heavy jacket and with cap pull down so i could scarcely see he face shuffle down the step he whip off the cap and stand wait the officer of the deck send I here sir i ask for you do levere tell you why no sir only that i be to come at once and quietly i put my hand on he shoulder tom i say soberly but so low i feel sure even gunsaule would not overhear we be in the same boat and understand each other the chance have come for both of we if we play the card right listen while i tell you the situation and what i plan do i tell it briefly waste no word yet relate every fact even include my visit and conversation with dorothy and the throwing of the body through the after port he listen eagerly but without interruption until the end what do you make of it i ask irritated by he silence about what you do sir i know there be something of the kind go on -- some of the man forward be in on it you have get the ring-leader manuel you mean who do he count on for help in the forecastle cochose and a handful of other nigger and spaniard mostly they even try out one or two white man that be how i hear of it through jack jone but they never tell he enough to make the plan clear however with what you have just say i have get a pretty fair understanding they mean to pull the affair off either today or tonight what sorter lookin ' chap be the fellow you knock out sir i scarcely see he face -- a half-breed i should say rather short but stout with long hair jose he be the one manuel would choose for such a job but why he get into the girl 's room be more than i know however if he be dead and manuel a prisoner it give we a fair chance sir it leave those fellow amidship without a leader a dozen good man on deck might do the business but be there a dozen aboard to be trust he hesitate run the name over in he mind evidently weigh each one carefully well yes sir i rather think there be he say finally it will not do for to make any mistake here but i be pretty sure of these fellow i would say that in both watch there be maybe fourteen to be rely on there be one or two other in the starboard watch who be likely enough all right but i do not get to see they alone much who do you pick out in my watch there be jone harwood and simm either english or welsh they be all right then there be a nigger name sam schmitt a dutchman with he partner whose name i do not know and two frenchy ravel and pierre that make eight nine counting myself then in the starboard watch i would pick out jim carter and joe cole two swede carlson and ole hallin and another nigger then there be a couple of finn who ought to be with we but i can not talk they lingo that would give we sixteen out of thirty and it be quite likely some of the other would take a hand with we if they think it be safe i have ` nt any use though sir for francoi levere there be not a worse scamp aboard i know that i admit but he have to be use it be through he that estada 's murder be discover but he be safe enough for the present for he make the attack on manuel and so will not dare go back on we he life be in the balance but wait tom do not breathe in he ear we real purpose i have convince he that we mean to keep in the trade divide the treasure aboard and sail the bark to porto grande oh so that be the game and what be my part now this be my watch below and it will be best for I to keep off the deck until all be prepared besides i be afraid to leave the cabin unguarded there be no know what gunsaule might do you sound these man and get they together wake up the one in the starboard watch you feel sure be all right and have they slip quietly on deck levere will understand what you be up to and will make no objection as soon as you have everything ready let I know we be none of we armed sir that be what i be come to when you be sure of you man and have they on deck i 'll get levere to send they all aft on some pretext or other i 'll think up a way to do this without create any suspicion then we 'll get these arm in the rack here and be ready for business -- the rest will be do in a hurry you have it all clear yes sir then i 'll wait here for you report at the very best watkin could scarcely perform the task assign he in less than a hour no doubt there be those on he list whom he would have to approach with great caution while there be always danger that some word might be drop to awaken suspicion the success or failure of we effort depend entirely upon take these fellow by complete surprise if it come to a open fight we cause be hopeless for that would mean fourteen or fifteen man unarmed pit against over a hundred thoroughly equip and train fighter to be sure these be at present without a leader yet they force alone be sufficient to overcome we and some one among they would doubtless assume leadership in a emergency only by confine they below with hatch batten down and a carronade train upon they would we be safe i sit where i could watch the stair and the entire forward part of the cabin gunsaule lower the table and begin prepare the morning meal he glance at I each time he pass but venture on no question although it be quite evident the fellow be nearly burst from curiosity i light my pipe endeavor to appear entirely at ease as i turn over and over again in mind every detail of the contemplated action with each review the result seem more certainly assure and my courage revive except for some accident or act of treachery i could perceive no reason why my plan should not work perfectly it be evident that levere be endeavor to keep the watch on deck busy i could hear he voice frequently call out order and occasionally single out some man for a special task a slushing of water prove that the deck amidship be be wash down and twice at least man be send aloft to make some change in the spread of canvas i step across into my stateroom to gain a glimpse out through the port narrow as the vista be it yet reveal a beautiful sea view the wave run high but in long billow with bright sunshine glowing along they crest the hollow a deep purple above the sky be a pale blue with scarcely a fleeting cloud visible and the bark be sail free lay well over to the fresh breeze evidently carry all the spread of canvas possible as i return to the cabin gunsaule await I to announce breakfast what already it be six-thirty senor those be my order very well i suppose estada and manuel usually eat first si senor that leave I alone suppose you rap on the lady 's door yonder and ask if she will join I say you message be from senor gate she come forth immediately fully dress but bear herself with reserve on my part i make no effort at greet not certain as to what eye might be observe we through the deck light above or for the matter of that unwilling to face the curiosity of the watchful steward i have you call i explain because of a disinclination to eat entirely alone you be evidently awake yes i have not undressed i feel no desire to sleep although no doubt i doze the call to breakfast be quite welcome she seat herself opposite I and we speak of the weather while gunsaule serve with some skill he be still hover about but my anxiety to enjoy a word with she alone cause I to send he on a task elsewhere have captain sanchez be attend to yet i ask sharply no then see to he at once i have reason to believe he be alone this morning and will need you yes we can get along very nicely we wait until he disappear within the after stateroom bear a tray then she eye suddenly lift to mine fill with question tell I what have happen she breathe eagerly i hear the noise of a struggle out here and voice converse why be you alone i lean over to speak in as low a tone as possible i can only explain very briefly the man who come into you room last night have just murder estada levere and i find the mate 's body at daylight he killing be part of a plot by manuel and the buccaneer quarter amidship to seize the bark we have manuel already prisoner and be prepare to gain possession of the boat ourselves who be plan you have find friend on board i have make levere believe he only safety lie in assist I i tell you about watkin and the other man forward he have pick out a dozen or so in whom he have confidence english sailor mostly and be sound they out i expect he back with a report at any minute and then what she excitement visible in she eye what can a dozen man do we main weapon be surprise of course by act quickly we can gain control of the deck if watkin ' estimate be correct nine out of the port watch now on duty will be with we if he can add to these five or six from the starboard watch below this will make a total not count levere and myself of fifteen there would be only five leave to oppose we on deck and probably two of these would be on watch aloft once we gain control of the deck we can lock the other below and negotiate with they at we leisure the plan look to I quite possible she sit silently gaze at I across the table seemingly fail to quite comprehend she parted lip tremble to a unasked question before she could frame this in word the door to the companion open and watkin descend the stair at sight of she he whip off he cap and stand motionless fumble it awkwardly in he hand you may speak freely i say this be the young lady i tell you about and of course she be with we only talk low as the steward be in the stateroom yonder yes sir use a hoarse whisper and fasten he gaze on I it be all right sir they be with we how many eight sure from my watch sir harwood be in the fore-top and could not be see but i 'll answer for he bein ' all right there be only four i could get word to in the forcastle but there be other there who 'll give we help soon as they know what be goin ' on that make twelve of the man fifteen of we altogether be the four from the starboard watch on deck he nod clutch and unclutch he hand nervously scarcely able to restrain himself chapter xx the deck be ours i have the next step carefully outline in my own mind and yet i hesitate a moment glance into the two face before I with a sudden realization of what the contemplated action would mean to all of we if by any chance it should fail of success we life certainly hang in the balance for these fiend would show no mercy if once they gain power to strike back yet how could we fail only through treachery or some unforseen accident and moreover it be too late for retreat the one chance desperate as it appear must be take i manage to speak cheerfully put a ring of confidence into my voice then the sooner we act the better watkin have levere order these man aft let he say that senor estada wish they to break out some store in the lazaret that will create no suspicion they need be here only long enough for we to distribute these arm among they and for I to speak a word of instruction to they be you ready ay ay sir as he vanish i turn to the girl who have arise to she foot one hand grasp the edge of the table to balance herself against the pitching of the deck it be a desperate chance be it not she question anxiously yes i admit fifteen of we against a hundred and fifteen but worth take and such a opportunity may never occur again i believe the plan will work its greatest weakness be i do not know the man on whom i must rely if there should be a traitor among they we be do for i mean to work so fast no one man will be able to spread the news but have i no part be there no way in which i can help you have you pistol yes then remain here i shall have to go on deck with the man and will not dare leave they a moment until the ship be absolutely secure manuel be lock in that stateroom but must not be communicate with by anyone i hardly believe gunsaule will attempt anything but it be not safe to trust he alone it will be you part to see that the fellow neither enter that passage lead amidship nor approach this door keep he in sight you can do this of course i can then you will do most valuable service and save we a man wait here now until i see how securely this passage forward be close it be as describe to I -- a heavy oaken door nail stud not only lock but hold firmly in place by a stout iron bar there be not the faintest possibility of any entrance aft except through assistance from this side as i return to the cabin gunsaule come out of the captain 's room and cross the deck at sight of I he stop instantly hold he tray in front of he gunsaule i say waste no word you be to remain in this cabin until i give the word the lady here have a pistol and order to shoot if you attempt to either enter this passage or approach the door of manuel 's stateroom yes senor he face like chalk and he eye roll how do you find sanchez sit up in he bunk senor and able to eat do he know what be occur on board no senor he question I but i only tell he everything be all right so far in my heart i believe the fellow deliberately lie but there be no opportunity to question he further for at that moment the door of the companion open and a miscellaneous group of man throng down the stair they be a rough hairy lot here and there a sturdy english countenance meeting my gaze but the face be largely foreign with those of two negro conspicuous i feel my heart beat furiously at sight of such poor material and yet many a ship 's crew appear worse the fellow group themselves awkwardly behind watkin twelve here sir i could not get harwood down from the fore-top and there be other below who will join we yes sir six more i count on which mean lad that with harwood senor levere and myself we 'll total twenty-one in this shindy now i 'll tell you what be up watkin give you some of it no doubt

the cutlass from the rack you boy will handle those better than firearm good now be you all ready there be a low murmur of voice the face watch I show they increase excitement and eagerness we little talk have serve to arouse they confidence in my leadership and with gleaming weapon in they hand they become self-reliant volunteer once turn loose my greatest difficulty might be to restrain they rather than urge they on revenge for past wrong be in each heart and they welcome a chance to strike and kill i whisper a parting word of admonition into the ear of dorothy receive in return a glance from she eye which give a new throb to my heart then straighten up and pistol in hand push my way through the throng of sailor to the foot of the stair follow I lad i say quietly and every man do the particular thing assign he do not pay any attention to you mate -- do you part and then wait for order come on now we emerge through the companion and i step aside as the other rush by there be no shout no cheer the fellow seem to realize the desperate nature of they work and the importance of surprise they be outnumber five to one and they only hope of success lay in render they opponent helpless before they could rally to a defense all the pent-up hate of year be in they heart blaze madly in they eye they be tiger leap at the throat of they prey yet sane enough to comprehend even in they blood-rage that they must act together it be over so quickly i scarcely see it all my memory now be of a clear sky a deck almost desert its brass work glowing in the sun the white sail above bellow out to the pressure of a strong wind and the blue sea crest with white stretch about we in desolate grandeur levere stare down over the poop rail behind he the motionless figure of the wheelsman he hand grip the spoke while across the open deck the speeding mutineer leap to they several post with bare cutlass shine in the sun and they do they work my eye sweep from group to group -- the four toiling at the cover of the main hatch the fellow race toward the forecastle and watkin ' squad drive straight into the group watch beyond the foremast it be smartly do watkin have take no cutlass but go in with both fist ask no question but batter right and leave he man surge after with steel blade flame in the sunlight the astounded watch cursing and fight grimly hold for a moment and then go staggering back against the port rail unable to stem the rush and roar for mercy i have view of carlson drop recklessly down the forecastle scuttle and then spring forward myself to give a hand to the four wrestling with the main hatch together we drag it into position force relentlessly back as we do so a dozen struggle figure frantically endeavor to reach the deck shot be fire the bullet whistle through the open the flare lighting up the black depths below reveal vaguely a mass of frantic man stare up and cursing we fiercely in a dozen language but in spite of they we clamp the hatch down tight and lock it securely into place with a iron bar even through this cover the sound of smother yell reach we ear mingle with blow of gun-butt as the fellow vainly endeavor to break out from they prison the negro sam grin from ear to ear execute a jig as he flash he cutlass above he head stay here all four of you i command sharply this job be well do now let I see about the other watkin need no help he have he party round up and in complete control the fellow beg for mercy as they crouch before the cutlass of they assailant to my order they be drive into the cook 's galley and a guard station at the door then i turn to the more serious work confront I in the forecastle what lay before I in face the member of the starboard watch it be impossible to conceive but they have to be sort out and it be my task we must have man enough to sail the bark and if i be to command they i must first of all prove my courage and enforce authority the whole success of we effort depend on this what be go on below i ask cursin ' mostly answer carter peer down through a slight uptilting of the scuttle they do not just know what be happen yet but the big nigger seem ter be raisin ' hell carlson be a holdin ' he back with he cutlass open up and let I down i fall rather than clamber along the rung of the ladder come to my foot on deck in the midst of a group of angry man who have carlson pin against the bulkhead the light be so poor i could scarcely see they face a babel of voice greet I and more than one hand grip I fiercely as the excited owner yelp a demand to know what in hell we be up to i roughly clear a space aid by carlson 's cutlass and front they defiantly tower above they all he black apelike face distort with rage i distinguish the giant cochose he immense hand grasp a wooden bar rip from a bunk plainly enough he be the leader the one man whose ascendency i must crush and i mean to do it then and there this be no job i could turn over to other if i be to rule this black brute must be conquer at the very start conquer by my own hand and in the presence of he mate here in this black forecastle we must fight it out breast to breast as savagely as beast of the jungle to the bitter end i make the resolve with tooth clench and every muscle throb with eagerness stand back there lad i say sternly my eye search they face and with pistol poise threateningly give we room i 'll explain all that have happen presently but first i be go to lick that black brute within a inch of he life step out of there cochose he come grin widely balance the heavy club in he hand you mean I sah you all think yer kin lick I yes i think so i 'll try it anyway here carlson take this pistol and sheath knife if anyone interfere shoot he all i ask be fair play drop that club cochose and throw away you knife you and i will fight this out with bare hand he dull brain work slowly and he stare at I he eye ugly he grin become savage with a display of tooth he silence and lack of response awake a growl from the impatient circle of man behind one fellow kick the club out of he hand contemptuously and another pluck the knife from he belt you big skulker the latter say with a oath of derision go on and fight what in hell be you afraid of what for ah fight this white man ah do not even know who he be then i 'll tell you estada be dead manuel be a prisoner i be in command of this bark and i be go to give you a lesson for the benefit of the crew you be a big boast cur i hear what you say when i come down and now i 'll make you prove it you other fellow stand back -- i 'll make this beast fight i take two step forward my advance so swift and unexpected the big negro have not even time in which to throw up a arm in defense with open hand i strike he squarely across the face a insulting stinging blow chapter xxi in full possession a roar of delight mingle with the negro 's snarl of rage at this action for a instant the fellow appear too completely surprise for movement although a angry oath burst from he lip and the grin of derision fade from he face i know sailor and feel that these man would not differ greatly from the occupant of other forecastle on the seven sea they would welcome a fight like this and they immediate sympathy would be with I for start it more than that this black bully ruling over they by brute force could be no favorite they might fear he but with that fear would be mingled hate and a delight in he downfall the respite be short yet in that instant although i can not recall remove watchful eye from the negro 's face i receive a impression of my surroundings never to be erase from memory the grim picture arise before I now distinct in every detail the gloomy interior the deck foul litter with sea boot and discard clothing and the great beam overhead blacken by smoke the ray of the swing slush lantern barely illuminate the central space the row of bunk beyond remain mere shadow yet this dim yellowish light fall full upon the excited half circle of man who be roar about the negro and have already press he forward until he stand confront I he grin of derision change into a scowl of hate they be a rough wild lot beard and uncombed range in color from the intense black of central africa to the blond of scandinavium half naked some they voice mingle in a dozen tongue they eye gleam with savagery they impress I as animal of the jungle thirst for blood and i know the man who come victorious from this struggle would be they leader the thought stiffen my muscle and strengthen my determination to win i know not whether cochose lunge forward of he own volition or be press on from behind yet suddenly he be within reach of I and the battle be on it be short and fierce he object evidently be to crush I in he giant grip mine to oppose science to strength and avoid he bear-hug we sway back and forth to the sharp pitching of the ship barely able to keep we foot spar for some advantage once he would have have I but for a lunge of the vessel which send he sprawl on hand and knee yet before i could recover the man be up again furious with anger this time he spring straight at I utter a growl of rage determine to smash I to the deck by the very power of he onslaught but i side-step he get in two swift blow which rock he head and tear open one cheek from which blood trickle yet he keep he foot blindly grip for I drive almost crazy by the pain of my last blow and the jeer of he mate i evade he clutch by leap aside but the space be far too small to permit these tactic to carry long and finally he have I yet even as he seemingly crush the very breath out of I he giant strength meet with a resistance which increase he fury already the fellow have lose he head but i fight coolly put my skill against brute force every wrestler 's trick i know flash into my brain breathless my flesh scrape and bruise i wriggle partly free and trip he he great body strike the deck with a thud i fall with he drag down by he desperate grip but be first upon my foot salute by a roar of delight from the lip of those crowd about we as he stagger up also cursing fiercely he lip draw back in a snarl he brutal face that of a wild animal i strike he again a blow which would have end the game have not my foot slip on the reel deck as it be it drive he to he knee groggy and with one eye half close yet with strength enough leave to regain he foot as soon as i this time he charge I like a wild bull froth whitening he lip scarcely appear human in the yellow light in mad rage he forget all caution all pretense at defense he one thought to reach I with he hand and throttle I into lifeless pulp here be where skill and coolness win i fight he back drive blow on blow through he guard sidestep he mad rush landing again and again on he body twice i get in over he heart and at last find the chance i seek and send a right jab straight to the chin all the force of one hundred and eighty pound be behind the clinch fist and the negro go down as though floor by a poleaxe once weakly he endeavor to rise but this time i use my left and he never stir again lie there with no sign of life except the quiver of the huge body assure that he be down and out i stand above he gaze into the ring of excited face that be one attend to i say shortly now be there any more of you who would like to fight this out there be no answer although the ring widen under the threat of my eye and i meet sullen face here and there i be in no mood to take chance carlson i say glancing back at he you know all these man yes sir pick out those you can trust and have they stand over there to the right call they out by name be lively now they step forth eagerly enough and range themselves before the bunk the face mostly those of northern europe although a negro or two be among they as the swede cease call six or seven yet remain cluster in front of I a motley lot one of they a indian the other mostly half-breed i glance from face to face inquiringly how about it you i ask be there any more of you fellow who take a chance with we this be my last offer what be the game ask a sullen voice in english and a bearded fellow burn black push he way to the front i have not note he presence before but instantly recognize he character be you english no i use ter be scotch now i be damned if i know what i be one flag be as good as another ter I -- only i want to know what sorter game i be playin ' in who the hell be yer a ' whar would yer cum frum i be a english seaman i answer shortly and how i come aboard make no difference right now i be the only navigator on the _ namur _ what be happen ter estada he be dead -- knife last night by one of the buccaneer manuel estevan have a hand in the business and he be safely lock in a stateroom aft captain sanchez be wound and helpless and those cut-throat amidship be batten down below hatch levere and i be the officer leave and we control the deck we have to fight it out or likely it would be we turn next yer mean those feller be aimin ' ter take the ship exactly that now where be you lad with manuel and he bunch of pirate or with we what er yer go ter do with we a ' this ship that be the fu ` st question i have not decide that even in my own mind but the answer come promptly enough as my eye sweep the face front I what be you name ben macclintock well macclintock i be go to leave that to the crew as soon as we have all secure i 'll have every man on deck and then we 'll talk it over that be fair enough be not it it look fair come on mate i be fer the englishman only one follow he however a sheep-faced boy the other remain sullen and defiant likely enough they fail to understand what have be say but i have no further time to waste in explanation i glance up at carter 's face frame in the scuttle hole you guard there ay ay sir pass these man up and take they forward with the other turn they over to watkin then come back here and report to I ay ay sir they go up the ladder one by one and disappear onto the deck above the majority cheerful enough although a few of the face be scowl darkly as they pass I carlson and i watch the other the swede still retain he pistol in hand until carter stick he head once again through the open all safe sir -- they be like lamb very well stand by to help now you lad lift this black brute and shove he up to where they can get hold above step lively unless you want trouble show they the way carlson it be some heavy job but they finally hoist the unconscious form up the ladder and force it through the hole onto the deck at my stern command the other also crawl forth into the sunlight where carlson and i follow they leave the forecastle desert i feel that i must dispose of these fellow before attempt anything else and scarcely take time to glance about they be huddle in a little bunch around the outstretched body of cochose helpless from lack of leadership pick up the negro yes you fellow now aft with he -- all of you we halt at the main hatch and i have the cover slip to one side the armed sailor gather close about the edge as i peered down it be a scene of pandemonium reveal in the yellow flame of slush lantern a group of white face show clearly as the prisoner below struggle forward gesticulate and shout the glow of light glisten on a variety of weapon but i dare not send man below into the midst of those shriek devil to disarm they nor be i greatly afraid of the result at present they must still be in total ignorance of what have occur on board and why the hatch have be fasten down indeed this be plainly evidence by they cry and threat they be leaderless confused unable to determine what to attempt while they remain in that condition they could not greatly endanger my plan later with a body of armed seaman behind I i would compel the surrender of weapon but now i must hold they as they be quarrel among themselves and take time to strengthen my authority on deck with this in mind ignore they mad roaring and the threat of level gun i stare down at the infuriate face until the clamor cease sufficiently to let my voice be hear i use spanish my lack of facility in that tongue render my speech slow the instant silence prove my word understand what be you man try to do frighten I you might as well stop that this opening be line with gun and if one of you fire a shot we 'll pour lead into you more than that if you attempt to climb out you 'll meet a hot reception there be a brass carronade train on the hatch to sweep you to kingdom come so listen several voice shout up inquiry but one shrill and insistent rise clearly above the other what be happen what yer go to do with we i think i located the questioner among the jumbled mass below and with my eye on he answer for all he mate we be in control of the ship i call back and mean to keep it the old officer be either dead or prisoner what we do with you will depend on you action but we be ready to kill if necessary if you keep quiet down there and obey order you 'll be feed and treat decently enough pass up you arm there be no movement only a glare of hostile eye a indistinguishable growl of voice kneel down lad and cover those fellow i order sternly draw my own pistol now you below there this be my last word i 'll count ten and you 'll either pass up those weapon or we 'll pour we fire into you if you miserable life be worth anything to you the quicker you move the better take aim boy there be a moment of deathly silence except for my counting and the heavy breathing of the trap prisoner one man utter a curse and the jam of figure at the foot of the ladder endeavor to work back out of range yet before i have speak the word eight gun be hold aloft and poke up within reach and at this sign of surrender even the most desperate lose heart and join the more cowardly it be a strange collection of weapon stack on the deck -- gun cutlass knife and pistol of every description relic of many a foray some apparently very old probably all have not be deliver yet there be such a pile i feel no further fear of the few piece remain hide it be not my intention that the villain should have the slightest chance to use the weapon so when the stream finally cease i ask no question although i give no order to the guard to withdraw i have the fellow cow and mean to keep they so that be all be it very well -- now you man at the foot of the ladder take care of this big nigger we be send down no he be not dead only stunned let he have a bucket of water and he 'll be all right now stand aside while a few of you friend join you they 'll tell you what be up make room there we pass the forecastle scum down one after the other and as the last of these merge into the scarcely distinguishable mass below i give vent to a sigh of relief and straighten up with pistol still grasp in my hand they be now bunch together all of they and confine where they would prove the least possible danger desperate and reckless as many of they be we have they now safely in we own hand -- disarm and imprison within narrow limit to be sure they might wreck the bark by fire or otherwise but that would only peril they own life and no matter how willing some might be to accept this hazard of fortune there would be more to oppose the proposition -- forcibly if necessary for they to escape the only means be through treachery and against that possibility i must guard i know little of the man who have respond to my call and choose I as leader some among they i could trust but other be merely with I while i retain power -- would desert at the first doubt i must rely on the judgment of watkin as to whom among they i could safely depend upon and suspicion and watch the rest it be no pleasant position yet success thus far have come so easily the knowledge be no discouragement when we goin ' ter be feed yell a voice from below presently i answer as soon as the cook have it ready shove the hatch cover back into place lad -- yes it will be safer fasten down they 'll get air enough through treachery and against that possibility i must cage satisfied that every precaution have be take and ignore the indignant roar of voice which greet this order i watch the man shift the heavy hatch cover into place and then permit my eye to survey the deck as i hastily consider we next action chapter xxii the crew decide except that many of the man remain armed there be no suggestion of violence visible no reminder of the fact that we be mutineer but for the gleaming carronade train on the main hatch and the small group of gunner cluster about it the scene be peaceable enough resemble the deck of some merchant ship the bark hold steadily to she course with practically every inch of canvas set the wind steady and only a single hand at the wheel levere stand motionless at the poop rail stare down as though scarcely realize what have transpire on board and some way he very attitude and expression of face arouse within I a doubt of the man a determination to put he to the test evidently he have hold aloof and cautiously refrain from take even the slightest part in we activity the man themselves be mostly forward group together and still excitedly discuss the situation that all among they be not satisfy be indicate by they gesture and the fact that watkin and other of the more loyal be pass from group to group combate they argument plainly enough i must have a heart-to-heart talk with the fellow outline a plan of escape and leave they to imagine they choice in the matter would be follow but in the meanwhile action of some sort would be most apt to overcome they dissatisfaction and prevent discussion the sky overhead be a pale blue the sun shine but as through a slight haze while a heavy cloud of vapor obscure the western horizon although this promise fog rather than storm yet the sea have a heavy swell and i accept this threat of a change in weather to employ the man in reduce sail it pleased I to note how swiftly they respond to the sound of my voice stand by to reef topsail i shout we be all one watch now go at it lively lad and when the job be over we 'll eat and decide together what be we next move two of you will be enough to guard the hatch and you carter go into the cabin and relieve the girl there keep you eye open i 'll be down presently aloft with you and see how quick a job you can make of it watkin lead the way up the main-mast ratlin and cole be first into the fore shroud the other follow eagerly i watch they lay out on the yard and be hearten to hear the fellow sing as they work the canvas melting away as if by magic only three man remain in sight on the main deck the two guard the closed hatch and one watch the open scuttle lead into the desert forecastle back and forth in the galley the cook and he assistant pass the open door and carter have disappear through the companion i climb the ladder to where levere stand on the poop but carefully ignore he presence my gaze on the scene aloft twice i give order change the steer direction slightly and command the lower sail reef the mulatto scowling join I at the rail main-top there i call sharply anything to report no sir all haze off the port quarter and nothing show to starboard keep a lookout let the other lay down levere front I what be all this about he ask that be no storm cloud yonder there be always danger in fog i answer coldly and besides there be no use carry on until we know where we be bind my purpose be to keep the man busy and then talk the situation over with they have you any criticism of this plan senor levere he hesitate but he eye be narrow and ugly you 'll do as you please but you tell I we sail for porto grande be that a lie not necessarily and i smile grimly although i should not have hesitate to tell one under the circumstance i mean to leave that decision to the man themselves it be they life that be in danger that damn scum half of they be english and french all they want be to get away they will never go back to porto grande without you make they how make they by false observation there be no navigator forward it be a trick easy enough to play with a little nerve i would never have take part in this mutiny if i have suppose you mean to play into the hand of the man it be very little part you take senor levere judge from what i see you seem quite content to stand aft here and look on however you be in it just as deeply as i be and be go to play the game out with I to the end do you understand that what you mean senor -- play it out go on with the rest of we take you chance with the man and do you duty i be captain here and i know how to handle insubordination the first sign of treachery on you part will send you below with those other i do not trust you and all i want be a excuse to put you out of the way -- so be careful what you do i turn and walk away from he toward the forward rail the man be still aloft but come in from off the yard below I in the door of the companion stand dorothy she eye peer curiously about the desert deck she glance up and see I the whole expression of she face change may i come up there she ask certainly let I help you stand here beside I and you can see all that be be do that be all lad breakfast be ready lay down all except the lookout we watch while they stream down the ratlin and gather forward of the galley squat in group on the deck to all appearance the fellow have not a care in the world or any thought of the stir scene just pass through the girl 's hand touch my sleeve and i turn and look into she face a happy-go-lucky lot i say pleasantly real sailorman as long as they be feed and house why worry about tomorrow i 'll put this job up to they presently the sailor who come into the cabin tell I about you fight with the negro you be not hurt oh i do not escape entirely free but receive no serious injury it be not to be think about now with all the work ahead the ship be safely in you hand i can hardly affirm that miss dorothy the vessel be in we control and the worst of the gang secure below i have confidence in the loyalty of only a very few of these fellow and the other will have to be watch day and night as long as we remain afloat those be desperate man lock below and be bind to make some effort to free themselves if there be any treachery on deck it may lead to they release you be talk with senor levere i overheard a word or two he be not with you willingly no and i sweep the deck seek he fearful what i say might be overhear i distrust he more than any of the other those man forward be seaman and will abide by they mate moreover they be accustom to take order and do what they be tell i believe i can handle they with what help i have but the mulatto be different he belong with the worst element on board and only join we from fear of be kill just as estada be he have no heart in this job and would accept any chance to square himself with those cut-throat below i 'll have trouble with he before we be do but prefer to catch the man red-handed but what do you mean to do next she ask anxiously there can not be a moment of safety with those horrible creature aboard true yet with the material i be deal with i dare not venture too far probably in that bunch forward there be man guilty of every crime in the calendar as depraved as any we have below they have join we for various reason but would desert and become ugly in a instant if they suspect we might turn they over to the authority there be only one safe course for I to pursue under these condition let they decide by vote what should be do what do you imagine such a vote will show that the vessel be beach on some remote coast all the spoil aboard divide and then the crew permit to go where they please there will be some who may prefer continue the cruise before destroy the bark but i believe there be enough fairly honest fellow among they eager to escape this sort of life to control but the wretch below surely you would not leave they to drown no they would have to be release with the other after the division have be make that would leave we at they mercy yes i whisper if we wait until that time i do not propose take any such chance here be my plan and it seem the only feasible one leave we we be helpless if these man revolt and they certainly will unless give they own way i have no doubt but what they decision will be practically as i have outline very well i will acquiesce in it cheerfully enough to arouse no suspicion i be the only navigator on board the only one with any knowledge even of where we be not even levere could check up on I the night the vessel be to be beach watkin and carter with one or two they select will get off in a small boat carefully provision and thus make we own landing we 'll not worry about what fate await the other she eye seek mine anxiously full of question you be confident of be able to accomplish this without detection yes we can choose the right moment with not man enough on deck to prevent we lower a boat and a dark night the escape will not prove difficult no one aboard except myself will know where we be have you consider captain sanchez why no in surprise he be helpless below badly wound not so badly as you suppose she say swiftly he be able to be up and about he stateroom i hear he move and i believe the steward have tell he what have occur on board and endeavor to bear a message from he to those man amidship you believe this what do you do i hold my pistol to he head and lock he in the pantry he be there now with the sailor you send on guard that be what i come on deck to tell you but sanchez you see nothing of he no but there be certainly movement in he room after the man gunsaule come out i go over to the door and listen but there be no way for I to lock he in surely it must have be he move as he be alone there i stand silent my eye first on the forward deck and then sweep about the horizon the view by then be very narrow the gathering cloud of mist so dense as to obscure everything leave a mere gray trail of sea reveal scarcely a hundred yard in extent in any direction i hardly perceive even this as my thought center on this new peril yet why should i hold it a peril the ending of it be in my hand i need not await action or permit he opportunity the warning have come in ample time sanchez be still in my power separate from he follower incapable of do we any serious harm all that be need for I to do be to keep he in close confinement we be surely not far from the coast twenty-four hour perhaps twelve would suffice to make we escape from this cursed ship possible i must get a observation so as to know we exact position after that the course would be figure definitely and i would then know the time require my eye again seek she face he be a danger of course but not a serious one i say confidently it be safe enough to leave he undisturbed at present with cole on guard the first thing i need do be to satisfy those man i 'll attend to that now and then see to the proper secure of sanchez shall i remain here you tell the man cole what you hear yes i explain everything to he before i come on deck then you be not need in the cabin he be a reliable man remain here with levere while i go forward and watch that he do not attempt to go below the fellow have not finish mess but i feel the danger of further delay and talk to they as they sit on deck explain briefly the entire situation and the cause lead up to the mutiny i deal with the matter in plain term make no apparent effort to influence they yet forcibly compelling each individual to realize what would be the result of we recapture they listen earnestly ask a occasional question and pass comment back and forth freely among themselves i shall never forget that scene the deck already wet with fog which swirl about we in a impenetrable cloud of vapor utterly blot out the sea and even render we face strange and indistinct the foremast disappear at the lower fore-yard while aft of the cook 's galley the bark be entirely invisible we roll heavily in the swell of the heave water barely retain steerage-way the closely reef sail aloft flap against the mast the strain deck beam creak noisily to every roll of the vessel the sailor stare up at I rough dress and hairy yet not a bad-looking lot as sailor go but with here and there a face to be distrust i send watkin to the cabin for a roll of chart and spread these out endeavor as well as i could to make clear we probable position and the nearest point of land this be largely guesswork but i approximate distance and make the situation fairly clear when i have complete the explanation and stand before they await decision it be haine who act as they spokesman this yere be cape howarth he ask a grimy thumb on the point indicate a ' yer say it be ` bout a hundred and fifty mile west yes about that a ' thar 's no settlement some colonist fifty mile north be all that be ` bout right he turn to the other say mate this be how i figure we can not go on no long cruise with all those bloody rat in the hold they be bind ter find some way out if we give 'em time ` nough fer as i be concerned i be fer dividin ' up whut we have get and ter hell with piratin ' what ` er yer say mate shall we run the ol' hooker ashore a ' leave she thar while we tramp the coast we be just a ship-wrecked crew what ` bout they feller down below ter hell with 'em let 'em take keer o ' 'em selve thet 's the way they would treat we he be bloody well right mate say a loud voice heartily there be plenty o ' swag aboard ter give we all a fist full i be fer a division a gettin ' out with we life -- what say yer there be a chorus of approval sufficient in volume to satisfy I and i accept this as a decision all right lad i say briefly in my judgment you choice be a wise one i 'll have a observation as soon as the fog clear and we 'll head in for the cape when do we divide the swag fifty mile off the coast that be fair enough be not it and my share go to you there be a straggle cheer but i break it up with a sharp order now stand by for work all of you watkin and carter i want you aft chapter xxiii the prisoner escape the two man follow I silently as far as the companion where we pause a moment stare blindly about we into the fog even the guard at the main hatch be invisible this can scarcely last long i remark but there may be a storm brewing i do not think so sir one of the man answer civilly i have run in to these yere mist afore ` long this coast it be liable ter be all clear ` fore the sun go down well we 'll make the ship safe first carter you be a able seaman yes sir guard this after deck until watkin and i come back under no circumstance permit levere to enter the cabin you understand he grin appreciatively that nigger be not likely ter get by I sir i would just like for ter take one whack at he do not be rough if you can help it as far as i know now he be with we and rank second officer my only order be -- see that he remain on deck while we be below ay ay sir he 'll stay thar with the door close we be plunge into a darkness which render the interior invisible i wonder dimly why the man on guard have not light the swing lantern but before i could call out to the fellow watkin whisper what be up anything wrong in here not that i know of but the young lady report sanchez move about in he stateroom and i think it safer to see to he at once it be blacker than hell down thar yes i do not understand it -- wait here a minute until i strike a light i stumble over something on the deck as i groped forward but with mind center on the one object do not pause until i have locate the lantern it blaze up brightly enough its yellow flame illuminate the cabin and the first thing i saw be the outstretched figure of the sailor almost between my foot i spring back give utterance to a cry which bring watkin to I and the two of we stare at the grewsome object and then about into the waver shadow there be nothing to see but the dead man lie on he face motionless blood still ooze from a ugly knife wound in he back we need to ask no question imagine nothing -- the overturn chair the stricken sailor tell the whole story he have be treacherously stick from behind the blade drive home by a strong hand and be dead before he fall to the deck it have be silent vengeful murder and the assassin have leave no trace who could it have be not gunsaule surely -- the steward lack both nerve and strength for such a deed then there be but one to suspect -- silva sanchez i stand there dumb gaze at the dead man realize all this dimly yet conscious only of thankfulness that the victim have not be dorothy fairfax he be dead sir growl watkin turn the fellow over with he foot until the ghastly face stare up at the deck beam overhead stab to the heart frum behind look a yere -- that wus sum slash who the hell do yer suppose do it that be ours to find out the deed have just be do for blood be still flow let he alone watkin and come with I -- the murderer can not be far off i flung open the pantry door but one glance inside tell I that gunsaule have vanish on the deck lay the strand of rope with which he have be secure -- they have be sever by a sharp knife the end discolor with blood stain i hold these out to watkin cut since the murder i say harshly and by the same knife who be in here sir the steward gunsaule he do not do the job but i believe i know who do we 'll try the port stateroom aft stand by there be likely to be two of they the door be unlock and open noiselessly but i take no chance think this possibly a ruse gloomy as the interior appear in the weird light with bank of fog drive against the port a single swift glance convinced I it be desert there be no place for a man to hide yet i could not convince myself of its emptiness until i peered into the disarranged bunk and survey every shadowed corner watkin watch I curiously turn he head occasionally to stare out into the light cabin behind the situation baffle I completely -- that sanchez have do the deed inform by the steward of what be occur on board and render desperate by that report be clear enough in my mind but what have become of the man he could not have escape overboard as the port be screw down and he appearance on the open deck above would have surely be observe he place of concealment must remain aft in the cabin and if so he must be discover by immediate search i order watkin to take the lantern from the rack and follow I from stateroom to stateroom we begin with dorothy 's finding none of they lock until we come to where manuel be hold prisoner all be empty and in disorder while bend my ear to the lock door i could distinguish the heavy breathing of its inmate the fellow be evidently sound asleep what do you make of it tom i ask face he in the dim halo of light well sir scratch he head with he disengaged hand thar be not but two more place ter look -- the cuss be either in the lazaret er ' else hidin ' in the passage forward more likely the last why not the lazaret cause thar would not be no object fer he to go thar he dud not get out agin with the kiver shut down the thing he have most likely try fer wud be ter release they lad amidship -- that would give he a gang o ' bully ter fight with my idea be sir he think he would have time ter git the bulkhead door open before anybody cum below -- he a ' the steward who have know what the tool wus that wus the scheme only we bust in too quick that whar they both be -- skulkin ' back in they shadow he fit the smoking lantern back onto the shelf to have he hand free for action and draw a cutlass out of the arm rack run one leatherly thumb along the blade to test its sharpness he eye seek mine questioningly probably you guess be the right one i say soberly we 'll give it a trial and should need no help to handle the two of they the deck under we foot be fairly steady the vessel have barely steerage-way roll slightly to the heave of the sea no sound ready we from above and the silence of the cabin be profound indeed the stillness irritated I with its mystery render I reckless to penetrate its meaning murder have be commit for a purpose -- it be the first step in a effort to retake the ship if we be to retain we advantage there be no time to be lose we be pit now against silva sanchez and he be a leader not to be despise or temporize with no cowardly brainless fool the passage lead forward be wide enough to permit of we advance together and for a few step the light dribble in past we quite sufficient for guidance although we shadow be somewhat confusing there be close door on either side evidently lock as they refuse to yield to the hand i take these to be storeroom possibly contain spoil of the voyage but give they little other think my whole interest center on the intense blackness ahead i have be down this tunnel once before and know the bulkhead be not far away but the few step necessary plunge we into profound blackness through which we advance cautiously with outstretched hand no slightest sound warn of danger and i be already convince in my own mind that the refugee be not hide there when it happen within a instant we be fight for we life front not by two man but by a score who fling themselves cursing upon we they very number and the narrowness of the passage be we only salvation at first we resistance be blind enough guide only by the sens of touch and sound we could see nothing of we antagonist although they fierce rush hurl we backward i fire into the mass as watkin slash madly with he cutlass both managing in some way to keep we foot hand grip for we a bedlam of oath splitting the air yet even in that moment of pandemonium i be quick to realize the fellow be weaponless seek only to reach and crush we with bare hand the same discovery must have come to the mind of the sailor for he yell it out defiantly every stroke of he blade draw blood i join he striking with the butt of the pistol feeling within I the strength of ten man yet the very weight of they thrust we remorselessly back we kill and wound the curse of hate change into sharp cry of agony but those behind press the advance forward and we be inevitably sweep back into the light of the cabin lamp then i see face hideous in the glare demonical in they expression of hatred -- a mass of they unrecognizable largely of a wild half-indian type with here and there a bearded white nor be they all bare-handed in many a grip flash a knife and directly front I with a meat cleaver uplift to strike sanchez yell he order ignore all other i leap straight at he cry to watkin as i spring back lad dash out that light i 'll hold these devil here a minute i do -- god know how it be like no fighting ever i have do before a mad furious mle amid which i lose all consciousness of action all guidance of thought struggle as a wild brute with all the reckless strength of insanity it be a dim vague recollection i be sure i fell sanchez with one blow of my pistol-butt stretch he apparently lifeless at my foot in some way that deadly cleaver come into my hand and i trod on he body swing the sharp blade with all my might into those scowl face they give sullenly backward they have to yelp and snarl like a pack of wolf hacking at I with they short knife i be cut again and again but scarcely know it i stand on quiver flesh drive my weapon from right to left craze with blood and seek only to kill i see face crush in arm sever man reel before I in terror the sudden spurting of blood from ghastly wound oath mingle with cry of agony and shout of hate then in a instant the light be dash out and all be darkness it be as though my brain snap back into ascendency i be no longer a rage fury mad with the desire to kill but cool-headed planning escape before a hand could reach I in restraint i spring backward and run in the darkness of the cabin i collide with the table and fall sprawl over a stool the noise guide pursuit yet wedge together as those fellow still be in the narrow passage fight each other in the black gloom give I every advantage and so unhalted i stumble up the stair lead to the companion the vague glimmer of daylight show through the glass reveal the presence of watkin i hear he dash the door wide open call to those on deck and then see he wheel about to again confront the devil plunge blindly forward toward we through the dark cabin we could hold they here for a time at least yet i have the sense to know that this check would prove only temporary they outnumber we ten to one and would arm themselves from the rack yet the greater danger lay in the loyalty of my own man a dozen of we might hold these stair against assault but treachery would leave we helpless and the very thickness of the fog without invite to treachery if one among they and there be many capable of such a act should steal below forward and force open the door from the forecastle we would be crush between two wave of man and leave utterly helpless i see the whole situation vividly and as quickly choose the only course to pursue the one hope remain here lad i call sharply back over my shoulder five or six of you be enough to hold back this scum watkin ay sir bend down here -- now listen get the boat ready -- two will be enough -- and be lively about it we 'll hold these fellow until you report you know the lad to be trust put two of they at the forecastle scuttle and then rout everybody out from below who be here now name yerselve bunky -- i can not see yer simme schmitt ravel delasser carter jacob johansen sam that be enough you lad remain here with I have harwood watch levere while the rest of you get out the boat how many sir the two quarter-boat will hold we all knock out the plug in the other -- and watkin ay ay sir see that miss fairfax be place safely in the after-boat and then stand by send I word the moment all be ready that be all -- we be go to be busy here presently i have glimpse of the thick fog without as he push through the door and of a scarcely distinguishable group of man on the deck those about I could only be locate by they restless movement i step down one stair conscious of increase movement below the meat cleaver still grip in my hand any of you arm with cutlass ouus m ` sieur ravel delasser stand here to right of I now another at my left who be you jim carter sir good now strike hard lad and you other be ready what be up sir ask a gruff voice have they bust out from between deck that be what be happen the cabin be full of 'em and it be you life and mine in the balance if we can get away in this fog they 'll never find we but we have get to hold they here until the boat be ready be it sanchez it be sanchez but i kill he that be where we have still get they husky without a leader but they have get arm only hand weapon break in carter contemptuously we be as good as they be -- thar be not no powder sure of that course i be i clean up that rack two day ago there be ball in the bandolier but no powder i wus goin ' ter break open a cask but estada put I at another job then that leave we on even foot lad we ought to be equal to they with the cold steel -- can any of you see below chapter xxiv in clasp of the sea the sound of voice of move body and bit of furniture overturn be plainly discernible but the darkness be far too dense below to permit the eye perceive what be take place yet i could picture the scene the leaderless mob surge blindly forward each man vocal in he own tongue sway with rage many smart with wound uncertain where we have disappear yet all alike craze with a desire to attain the open deck the rattle of steel the curse tell I some among they have reach the arm rack and seize whatever weapon they find there in they struggle the rack be overturn and suddenly amid the din a shrill penetrate voice yell something in spanish which seem to hush the clamor there follow a shuffling of foot and the crash of wood as though the butt of a gun have splintered a door panel then the same voice again pierce the babel my mind grip the meaning of it all they have find a leader they have release manuel estevan now the real fight be on we stoop low to escape as much as possible from the dim reveal light streaming through the glass at we back and wait stare into the black depths of the cabin and listen for every sound the release of manuel the very knowledge of he presence have change the mob into dangerous fighter the roar of voice die away with the noise of confusion i could hear the fellow question those about he seek to learn the situation but the delay be short and no inkling of he quickly conceive plan of attack be reveal yet he see we and understand he eye long train to darkness must have already mark we dim outline for he first order evidence he purpose who have cutlass so many a dozen form with I now bully they be on the stair there and that be the only way to the deck we 'll show those damned traitor what fighting mean now then -- to hell with 'em we meet they point to point we advantage the narrow staircase and the higher position theirs the faint glimmer of light at we back the first rush be reckless and deadly the infuriate devil not yet realize what they face but count on force of number to crush we defense manuel lead they yell encouragement and sweep he cutlass grip with both hand in desperate effort to break through delasser catch its point with he blade while my cleaver miss he with its sharp edge nevertheless deal the fellow a blow which hurl he back into the arm of the man behind i see nothing else in detail the faint light barely reveal indistinct figure and gleam of steel it be a pandemonium of blow and yell strange face appear and disappear as man leap desperately at we up the step and we beat they remorselessly back i see nothing more of manuel in the fray but he shrill voice urge on he follower it be strike and parry cut and thrust twice i kick my leg free from hand that grip I and delasser fall a pike thrust through he who take he place i never know but a stout fighter the lad be wield he cutlass viciously so that we hold they with dead man litter every step to the cabin deck but they be of a breed train to such fighting and the lash of manuel 's tongue drive they into mad recklessness and there seem no end of they sweep up out of those black shadow with bearded or lean brown savage face charge over the dead body hacking and gouging in vain effort to break through i strike until my arm ache until my head reel scarcely conscious of physical action yet aware of manners shout now you hell-hound -- now once more and you have they santa marium you have get to go through bully -- there be no other way to the deck think of the yellow boy below they be all yours if you strike hard enough rush 'em that be the way here you -- go in outside the rail broth of hell now you have he pedro for a instant i believe it true i see jim carter seize and hurl sideways he cutlass clash as it fall while a dozen hand drag he headlong into the ruck beneath but it be only a instant before the charge devil could pass I a huge figure fill the vacant space and the butt of a gun crash into the mass it be the dutchman schmitt fight like a demon he strength that of a ox they give way in terror before he and we go down batter we way until the stair be clear to the deck except for the dead under foot when we stop not a fight man be leave within the sweep of we arm they have scurry back into the darkness like so many rat and we could only stare about blindly cursing they as we endeavor to recover breath schmitt roar like a wild bull and would have rush on but for my grip on he shirt get back man i order sharply there may be fifty of they yonder we only chance be the stair do as i say schmitt or fight I back now we fling the body on one side and form again from rail to rail below we there be noise enough a babel of angry voice but no movement of assault i could see nothing although the uproar evidence a large number of man jam together in that blackness beneath what they would do next be answer by a blaze of light reveal the silhouette of a man engage in touch flame to a torch of hemp it fling forth a dull yellow glare and reveal a scene of unimaginable horror we assailant be mass half way back so blended together i could not judge they number many between we and the light with face darken by shadow between we even ten foot from the stair the deck be litter with body ghastly face stare up with black stain of blood everywhere it be manuel 's hand which have kindle the light and the first croak of he voice tell he purpose now you sculk coward he yell point forward do you see what you be fight there be only five man between you and the deck to hell with 'em come on i 'll show you the way he leap forward but it be he last step with one swing of my arm i send the cleaver hurtle through the air i know not how it strike he but he go down he last word a shriek he arm fling out in vain effort to ward off the blow schmitt roar out a dutch oath and before i know fully what have happen he gun send whirling above I have crash into the uplifted torch again it be black hideous night through which the eye could perceive nothing even the noise cease but a hand grip my shoulder who be you nigger sam sah mistah watkin sez it be all do fix where be he here answer watkin himself in a hoarse whisper the boat be ready afloat yes sir the one forward have push off load the after-boat be alongside there be such a hell of a fog sir yer can not see two fathom from the ship all the better for we be the girl in the boat safe sir but levere be not what do you mean that he have get away i order you to have harwood watch he yes sir but the mate slip out o ' sight in the fog he be somewhar aboard but we be not be able ter put hand on he nowhar yet never mind he the fellow can do no harm now move back slowly lad schmitt and i will be the last one out pick up that cutlass schmitt we must act before those devil down there wake up again we close the companion door as silently as possible and for the moment there be no sound from within to show that we cautious withdrawal have be observe i stare about but be able to perceive little beyond the small group await my order the fog cling thick and heavy on all side the lung breathe it in and the deck underfoot be as wet as though from heavy rain moisture drip from yard and canvas and it be impossible for the eye to penetrate to either rail fortunately there be no weight of sea running and the bark swing gently still retain steerage-way but with not wind enough aloft to flap the sail the silence and gloom be most depressing be there a hand at the wheel watkin no sir it be lash and the quarter-boat there sir below the mizzen-chain then there be nothing more to keep we aboard lad stow yourselves away and hang on i 'll wait here until you be all over they fade away into the mist dim spectral figure and i remain alone listen anxiously for some hostile sound from below have i choose the right course i be not altogether sure yet we have go too far now to decide on any other perhaps if i have call on those man up on deck who have load gun we might have force the escape prisoner back into they place of confinement and thus keep control of the vessel yet at that it would only mean a few hour more on board amid constant danger of revolt it might have enable we to salvage the gold hide below but i be not greatly concern for this as my one and only purpose be the preservation of dorothy the man might prove ugly when they awake to the loss but i have little fear of they once we be at sea in the small boat and they life depend on my seamanship unless a storm arise we life be in no great peril although i would have prefer be closer to the coast before cast adrift i wonder what could be the meaning of that silence below true the fellow be leaderless and defeat yet they be desperate spirit and fully aware that they must attain the open deck in order to recapture the vessel they would not remain quiet long and once discover we retirement would swarm up the stair animated with fresh courage satisfy that the lad be safely over the rail and the deck clear i turn toward the ship 's side as i do so a yell reach my ear from the blackness below -- the hound have find voice i run through the fog in the direction the other have disappear and have take scarcely three step when i collide against the form of a man whose presence be not even notice until we come together yet he must have be there expectant and ready for a quick knife thrust slash the front of my jacket bring a spurt of blood as the blade be jerk back it be a well-aimed blow at the heart miss its mark only because of my outstretched arm and the rapidity of my advance even as my finger grip the uplift wrist ` ere he could strike the second time i know my antagonist i know also this be a fight to the death a sharp remorseless struggle to be terminate before that unguarded crew below could attain the deck it be levere 's life or mine and in the balance the fate of those other in the wait boat alongside the knowledge give I the strength and ferocity of a tiger all the hate and distrust i feel for the man come uppermost in that moment of rage i do not so much care what happen to I if i be only privileged to kill he i rip the knife from he finger and we close with bare hand we muscle crack to the strain he voice utter one croaking cry for help as i bear in on he windpipe he be a snake a cat slip out of my grip as by some magic turning and twist like a eel yet unable to wholly escape or overcome my strength and skill at last i have he prone against the rail the weight of we both so hard upon it the stout wood crack and we both go over grapple together until we splash into the water below the shock the frantic effort to save myself must have loosen my hold for as i fight a way back to the surface i be alone lose in the veil of mist blind by fog the water drip from my hair weaken by struggle and loss of blood my mad rage against levere for the moment obscure all else in my mind what have become of the fellow have he go down like a stone or be he somewhere behind this curtain of fog a splash to the right lead I to take a dozen stroke hastily but to no purpose the sound be not repeat and i no longer retain any sense of direction to guide I the sea be a steady swell lifting my body on the crest of a wave to submerge it a instant later in the deep hollow i could feel the motion but scarcely perceive it otherwise as the thick gray mist obscure everything three foot away it deaden and confuse sound also again and again i feel i located the near presence of the _ namur _ the sound of foot on deck the shout of a voice the flap of canvas against the yard but as i desperately turn that way the noise cease or else apparently change into another point of compass once a cry reach I thrill with despair although i could not catch the word and again come to I plainly enough the clank of a oar in its rowlock i strike out madly for the point from whence it come only to find the same rolling water and obscure fog my strength begin to fail hope leave I as i sink deeper and deeper into the remorseless grip of the sea there be nothing leave to fight for to struggle after the fog about I become red and purple before my strain eye and then slowly grow black my muscle refuse to respond to my will i no longer swam but float so low in water the crest of the wave sweep over my face i no longer care grip by a strange almost delicious languor i be not afraid my lip utter no cry no prayer -- i drift out into total unconsciousness and go down chapter xxv the open boat i come back to a consciousness of pain and illness unable at once to realize where i be or feel any true sense of personality i seem to be float through the air aware dimly of suffer but helplessly in the grasp of some power beyond all struggle against then slowly i comprehend that i rested in a boat toss about by a fairly heavy sea that it be night and there be star visible in the sky overhead i stare at these vacant of thought wonder at they gleam when a figure seem to lean over I and i catch the outline of a face gaze eagerly down into my own instantly memory come back in a flash -- this be not death but life i be in a boat with she i could not move my hand and my voice be but a hoarse whisper mistress fairfax -- dorothy yes -- yes swiftly it be all right but you must lie still watkin captain carlyle be conscious what shall i do he must have be behind we at the steer oar for he gruff kindly voice sound very close yer might lift he up miss he say soberly he 'll breathe better how 's that captain much easier i manage to breathe i guess i be all right now you fish I out sam do he get a boat hook in you collar we cast off when yer go overboard and cruise about in the fog hunting fer yer who be it yer be fightin ' with sir levere that be what i tell the lad he be a goner i reckon i never see he after we sink be all the man here all but those in the forward boat sir they get away furst a ' we be not have no sight ov 'em since maybe we will when it get daylight who have charge harwood sir he be the best man o ' ther lot a ' a good sailor i give he a compass a ' tell he ter steer west wus thet right all i could have tell he i admit lift myself on one elbow to look about i have not have a observation and it be all guesswork i know the american coast lie in that direction but that be about all i could not tell if it be a hundred or a hundred and fifty mile away so the fog have lift without a storm yes sir but leave a ugly sea there have be plenty o ' wind somewhere but we seem to be out of it must a bin midnight when the mist lift be it as late as that i must have be in bad shape when you pull I in we think you be go sir you be bleedin ' some too but only from flesh wound the young lady she just would not let yer die she work over yer for two or three hour sir afore i hed any hope she eye be downcast and she face turn away but i reach out my hand and clasp she finger they remain quietly in my grasp but neither of we speak the boat lay before I a black shadow under the star fling up on the crest of the wave and dart down into the hollow it require all of watkin ' skill to keep it upright the fly spray constantly dash against we face the man be but dimly reveal sit with head lower beneath the slight protection afford by the lug sail although one be upon he knee throw out the water which dash in over the front rail he be succeed so poorly i call to another to help he and the two fall to the job with new vigor i could not distinguish the face of the fellow but count nine altogether in the boat and feel assure the huge bulk at the foot of the mast be the dutchman schmitt beyond these dim outline there be nothing for the eye to rest upon only a few yard of black sea in every direction render visible by the reflect star-shine and the dull glow of crested wave it be dismal awe inspiring and i feel that i must speak to break the dreadful silence my eye seek the avert face beside I and for a moment in peculiar hesitancy observe the silhouette of cheek and form she rest against the gunwale she eye on the dark vista of sea she chin cup in she hand the mystery of the night and ocean be in she motionless posture only as she hand gently press mine do i gain courage with a knowledge that she recognize and welcome my presence watkin say i owe my life to you i say so low the word be scarcely audible above the dash of water alongside it will make that life more valuable than ever before she turn she head and i feel she eye search the dim outline of my face questioningly of course i do everything i know she reply why should i not you be here captain carlyle for my sake i owe you service and must i be content merely with that thought i urge far from pleased this would mean that you only interest in I arise from gratitude and friendship she voice as confidential as my own there be no reason why you should doubt that surely it would be easier for I to understand but for the memory of what i be -- a bond slave you mean the fact that you be sell to my uncle remain a barrier between we to my mind yes i hope you forget but i can not if i return to virginia it be to servitude for a term of year i be exile from my own country by law and thus prevent from follow a career on the sea i belong to roger fairfax or if he be dead to he heir and even this privilege of be the property of a gentleman be mine through you intercession i know you sympathy you eagerness to help -- but that be not all of friendship you meaning be that true friendship have as a basis equality do it not can real friendship exist otherwise no she acknowledge gravely and the fact that such friendship do exist between we evidence my faith in you i have never feel this social distinction captain carlyle have give it no thought this may seem strange to you yet be most natural you bear a honorable name and belong to a

clasp mine courage to fight on in faith i would have that my gift to you geoffry we be in peril still great peril but you will face it beside I know that whether we live or die we be together i be not afraid anymore she be like a child i could feel she body relax in my arm as though relieved of its tension i know i answer she whispering into she ear word of love and confidence scarcely know myself what i say in that moment of unrestraint i feel she eye on my face and know she lip be part in a smile of content yet doubt if they answer I she seem to yield unconsciously she head upon my shoulder she face upturn to the star while slowly all the intense fatigue of the day and night stupified mind and body almost before i realize she weariness the eye be close and she be sleep in my arm i hold she closely so awaken by what have pass between we as to feel no desire to sleep myself dorothy fairfax love I i could scarcely grasp the thought i have dream of love but only to repress the imagination as impossible yet now voluntarily from she own lip it have prove true with eye uplift to the star i swear fidelity pledge solemnly all my year to she service nor could i drive my think away from the dear girl sleep so confidently upon my shoulder then slowly there come back memory of where we be of what grave peril surround we of my own responsibility my eye seek to pierce the gloom of the night only to gain glimpse of black water heaving and tumble on every side the boat fling high on a whitened crest and then hurl into the hollow beneath as though it be a mere chip in the grasp of the sea the skill of watkin alone keep we afloat and even he iron muscle must be strain to the limit forward the boat be a mere smudge the man curl up asleep and no longer visible all that stand out with any distinctness of outline be the lug sail stiff as a board i endeavor to turn my head without disturb the slumbering girl to gain view of the steersman how be she make it watkin a little stiff sir but she be a staunch boat the sea 's likely to go down after sunup well you have have long enough trick -- call one of the man aft i be not strong enough yet for that job no sir and i catch the echo of a chuckle and yer have yer arm full i kin hold on yere till daylight ` two not be long now make one of they help who be the best man schmitt for this sorter job i call he and growl to himself at be awaken the dutchman creep past cautiously and wedge himself in beside watkin there be a few word of controversy between the two man but in the end schmitt hold the steer oar and a few minute later watkin have slip down into the boat 's bottom and be sound asleep and so the gray dawn find we chapter xxvi a float coffin the labor boat rest so low in the water it be only as we be throw upward on the crest of a wave that i could gain any view about through the pallid light of the dawn at such brief instant my eye sweep the far horizon to discern nothing except the desolate endless expanse of sea a more dismal gloomy view surely never unrolled itself before the eye of man everywhere the gray monotony of roll wave slowly stretch out into greater distance as the light strengthened yet bring into view no other object it be all a desolate restless waste in the midst of which we toss while above hung mass of dark cloud obscure the sky we be but a hurtle speck between the gray above and the gray below how tiny the boat look as my glance range forward with this memory of we surroundings still fresh in mind the crest of the surge sweep to the edge of the gunwale send the spray fly inboard occasionally drop sting my cheek and all the thwart forward be wet with drizzle the negro sam alone be awake baling steadily he face turn aft although scarcely glance up from he labor he look tired and worn a strange green tinge to he black face as the dim light strike it the other be curl up in the bottom of the craft soak with spray yet sleep soundly the wind have lose its steadiness come now in gust that flap the sail loudly against the mast but fail to awaken the slumberer depress by the sight my eye seek the face of the girl whose head yet rest against my shoulder she lay there with tightly close eye the long lash outline against she cheek breathing softly between lip slightly part she white tooth gleam as she smile from pleasant dream it be a beautiful face into which i look the cheek faintly tint the chin firm the round throat white as snow -- the face of a pure true woman yet retain its appearance of girlish freshness whatever of hardship and sorrow the past day have bring she have be erase by sleep and she lay then utterly forgetful of danger and distress and she love I -- love in spite of all divide we -- and in she rare courage have tell I so the memory thrill my blood and i feel my arm close more tightly about she as i gazed eagerly down into the unconscious feature she be actually mine -- mine not even death could rob I of the treasure of she heart while life offer I every reward no doubt assail I i believe each whisper word from she lip and the day dawn about we with rare hope not now would i yield to despair or question the future some sudden plunge of the boat cause the girl to open she eye and gaze half frighten up into my face then she smile in swift recognition be it you geoffry we be still alone at sea yes the night be end you have sleep well she draw herself away from I gently sit up and glance about how tired you must be i have be very selfish there be nothing in sight nothing and the man be still asleep who be they i name they as best i could point out each in turn be they reliable -- safe she ask you know they not well but they be select by watkin as among the best on board the _ namur _ no doubt they will behave themselves but they be pirate they can not be trust these fellow be not aboard the _ namur _ from choice but seaman capture on merchant ship and compel to serve to preserve they life they be as eager to escape as we anyway i shall see to it that they do they duty sam the negro look up quickly ya sah call the other who know where the food be store watkin speak up behind we it be store forward sir a ' all safe the water cask be lash amidship i 'll see what we have get and serve out i creep forward cautiously because of the erratic leap of the craft the man yield I room to pass and soon have sam busily engage in pass out the various article for inspection only essential have be choose yet the supply seem ample for the distance i believe we would have to cover before attain land but the nature of that unknown coast be so doubtful i determine to deal out the provision sparingly save every crumb possible the man grumble at the smallness of the ration yet munch away contentedly enough once convince that we all share alike watkin relieve the dutchman at the steer oar and i rejoin dorothy the silence be finally break by one of the man forward ask a question could you tell we about where we be sir only as a guess i answer frankly my eye travel over the sea vista but will do the best i can i have have no observation since we leave the cape but estada have he chart prick up to the time he be kill show the course of the _ namur _ we be then about a hundred mile off shore and the same distance south we have be sail to the north of west since take to the boat that be the best course possible with this wind then a couple day should bring land sir ay if figure be correct and this wind hold but these be stormy water and we go by dead reckoning that be near enough he say stubbornly even if you be astray fifty mile would make little difference there be land to west of we and plenty ter eat aboard till we get there -- so why not eat it i glance about into the face of the other forward but receive little encouragement -- evidently the fellow be spokesman for he mate the time have arrive for I to exhibit my authority but before i could choose word watkin give indignant utterance to a reply yer hed yer fair share with the rest ov we do not yer simm o ' course i do but damn it i be hungrier then i wus afore -- whut the hell 's the use let I tell you i break in determine on my course it be not just the boat trip to be consider although that may prove serious enough before we get ashore if i be any judge we be go to have some weather in the next twenty-four hour and may have to run before it to keep afloat that be one point to think over another be that coast line west of we do not contain a dozen white settlement between the cape and florida and you be just as liable to be hungry on land as sea you have eat as much as i have maybe i have but by god there be food enough there to last we a month and it may have to do so now simm listen to what i say and you other also i be not go to repeat this we be the same as ship-wrecked man and i be in command of this boat whatever i say go and i have handle worse fellow than you be many a time grumble all you please i do not mind that but if you try mutiny or fail to jump at my order i 'll show you some sea discipline you will not forget very soon you be with I watkin you bet i be sir heartily the dutchman already half asleep lift he head mine gott i cud eat a whale he growl rather discontentedly but what der difference say i do -- dat wus best ach simm make no answer sit sullenly at the foot of the mast i wait think some other might venture a word but evidently they have enough and i be willing to let the affair rest they have be show that i mean to enforce discipline and nothing remain but for I to carry out my threat if occasion arise meanwhile the least friction aboard the better all right lad i say cheerfully now we understand each other and can get at work we 'll divide into watch first of all -- two man aft here and one at the bow watkin and i will take it watch and watch but there be enough right now for all hand to turn to and make the craft shipshape two of you bail out that water till she be dry and the other get out that extra sail forward and rig up a jib she 'll ride easier and make better progress with more canvas show how do she head watkin nor ` west by west sir you can give two point more west with the jib drawing -- the sea be not quite so heavy ay ay sir -- she be ride fairly free a ' the wind be shift nor ` east thar will not be no storm terday the man work cheerfully enough finding sufficient to do to keep they busy for half a hour and thus dorothy and i watch they whisper occasionally to each other and comment on the varied appearance of the fellow they be rather a interesting lot in they way the type familiar to I but strange to she experience -- sea scum irresponsible reckless to be rule by iron hand yet honest enough accord to they standard the face be coarse and dissipate and many a half-smothered oath float back to we ear but i saw in they nothing to fear or cause uneasiness the sun have dissipate the cloud while the swell of the sea have sufficiently subside to permit of a wide view in every direction the vista only serve to increase we sense of loneliness and peril we be a tiny chip toss on the immensity of the water stretch away to the distant horizon it be a vast scene of desolation without another object to break its grim monotony -- just those endless surge of gray-green water brighten by the touch of the sun again and again i sweep my eye about the circle in a vain effort to perceive something of hope it be useless -- we be alone on the boundless ocean i know not what we talk about during those hour of all we have pass through together no doubt of we chance of escape and we dream of the future she bravery and confidence increase my own courage know as i do the uncertainty of we position i need she blind faith to keep I hopeful the man gradually knock off work and lay down and finally i also yield to she pleading and fall into a sound sleep it seem as though i scarcely lose consciousness yet i must have sleep for a hour or more my head pillow on she lap what arouse I i could not determine but schmitt be again at the steer paddle and both he and dorothy be stare across I out over the port quarter as though at some vision in the distance sufficiently strange to enchain they entire attention what be it i ask eagerly but before the word be entirely utter a hoarse voice forward bawl out excitedly there you see it straight out agin that cloud edge by god it be a full-rigged schooner ay boom another a headin ' straight cross we course astern i sit up ignore all else thoroughly awake from excitement gaze under hollow hand in the direction the man point for a instant i distinguish nothing but sea and sky with patch of white cloud speckle the horizon my heart sink with the belief that one of these have be mistake for the sheen of a distant sail then as we boat be suddenly fling higher on the crest of a great wave my strain eye catch the unmistakable glimmer of canvas could even detect its outline plainly delineate against the blue background i reach my foot cling to the mast to keep erect and as the boat be again fling upward gain clearly the glimpse i seek ay you be right lad i exclaimed it be a schooner head to clear we by a hundred fathom port you helm schmitt -- hard down man watch out the boom do not hit you miss fairfax now sam off with that red shirt tie it on the boat hook and let fly they can not help see we if there be any watch on deck we sweep about in a wide circle ship some water as we dip gunwale under but come safely out from the smother head straight across the bow of the oncoming vessel all eye stare out watchfully sam 's shirt flap above we and both watkin and schmitt strain they muscle to hold the plunge quarter-boat against the force of the wind a man forward on he knee growl out a curse what the hell 's the matter aboard there he yell do yer ever see a boat yaw like that afore damn I if i believe they get a hand at the wheel the same thought have leap into my mind the schooner be head to pass we on the port quarter yet yaw so crazily at time as to make I fearful of be run down i could perceive no sign of life aboard no signal that we have be see indeed from where we crouch in the boat all we could see now be the bow with the jib and foresail not a head peer at we over the rail in silent mystery it seem to fly straight at we like a great bird sweep through water and sky the sight anger I stand by all hand i cry desperately we 'll board whether they want we or not slip across miss fairfax out of the way now watkin run we in under those fore-chain easy man do not let she strike we lay hold quick lad and hang on for you life give I that end of rope -- ready now all of you i 'll make the leap now then -- hold hard it be five foot and up my purchase the toss boat but i make it one hand desperately grip a shroud until i gain balance and be fling inboard by a sharp plunge of the vessel my head be at a level with the rail yet i see nothing my whole effort be to make fast before the grip of the man should be tear loose this do i glance back into the upturned face below hand in slowly lad yes let go the rope will hold and the boat ride safely enough let a couple of man come up till we see what be wrong with the hooker -- the rest of you trail on be i to remain here mr carlyle yes for a few moment there be no danger you stay also watkin let schmitt and sam come with I i help they clamber up and then lift my body onto the rail from which position i have a clear view of the forward deck it be unexpressibly dirty yet otherwise shipshape enough rope coil and the forward hatch tightly close nothing human greet I and conscious of a strange feeling of horror i slip over onto the deck the next moment the negro and dutchman join I the former stare about wildly the whites of he eye reveal he terror my gawd sah he ejaculate ah do know di boat -- it be shore de _ santa marie _ ah 's cook in dat galley what be do happen ter she sah you know the schooner be you sure sam what be she -- a pirate no sah a slaver sah he sniff the air ah kin smell dem nigger right now sah ah suah reckon dar a bunch o ' ded one under dem hatch right di minute -- you white man smell dat odor i certainly smell something unpleasant enough this be the _ santa marie _ the name be on the stern of that boat yonder when do you serve aboard here three year back sah frum habana to der african coast ah do not want no more dat sorter sailorin ' but what could have happen the boat be all in place but no crew i never see anything like it at sea schmitt 's hand fall heavily on my sleeve and i glance aside into he stolid face der 's a feller on ther gratin ' amidship captain he say point aft but i just bet i know vat wus der trouble what man cholera he whisper ve haf board a death ship chapter xxvii on board the slaver the terror of the two man as this thought dawn upon they in all its horror be apparent enough and in truth i share with they a vivid sense of we desperate situation nothing not even fire be more to be dread than a visitation of this awful nature on shipboard i have hear tale to chill the blood of whole ship ' crew stricken and die like fly yet i dare not hesitate or permit those under my command to flee in terror charnal ship though this might be the danger to we be not so great if we only remain in the open air and use proper precaution in put the dead overboard we be in health well nourished and we stay aboard would be a short one even if the schooner be a float sepulcher it be safer by far than the cockleshell tow alongside let 's find out the truth first man i say quietly stay here if you want to while i go aft only hold you tongue there be no use give up until we know what the danger be will you come with I or remain where you be the two exchange glance and then they eye range along the unoccupied deck i confess it be eery enough -- the silence the desolate vista the wind-filled sail above the schooner fly through the water as though guide by spectral hand and that single motionless figure crouch on the grate amidship it make my own nerve throb and cause I to clinch my tooth sam turn he head he frightened eye seek the scuttle lead into the forecastle he be more frightened to remain where he be than accompany I but when he endeavor to say so he lip refuse to utter any sound the terror in he eye cause I to laugh and my own courage come back with a rush afraid of dead man be you then we 'll face they together my lad and have it over with come on now both of you buckle up there be nothing to fear if you do what i tell you -- this be not the first cholera ship i have be aboard it be no pleasant job confront we although we have less dead man to handle than i anticipate indeed we find only five body on board and as the slaver must have originally carry a large crew it be evident the survivor have throw overboard the corpse of those who succumb first until they also become too weak to perform such service there be only two on deck the fellow crouch on the grate a giant coal black negro and a gray-bearded white man he face pit with smallpox lie beside the wheel before he fall to the deck he have lash the spoke and still grip the end of the rope in he dead hand determine on what be to be do i waste no time with either body the two sailor hang back so terrorize at the mere thought of touch these victim of plague i steel myself to the job and handle they alone drag the inert body across the deck and by the exercise of all my strength launch they over the low rail into the sea it be indeed a relief to know the deck be clear and i order schmitt to cut the lashing and take charge of the wheel sam be shake like a leaf he face absolutely green what -- what dey die of sah -- cholera he ask faintly no doubt of it but they be safely over the side now there be nothing to be frighten about but s ` pose we git it sah s ` pose we git it there be no reason why we should i contend speak loud and confident so both could hear we be all in good health and in the open air see here you man stop act like fool we will take a look below and then have the other on board but ah 's suah fear sah at what you be in no more danger than i be see here sam and you too schmitt i be in love with that girl in the boat do you suppose i would ever have she come on this deck if i believe she might contract cholera you do as i say and you be perfectly safe now schmitt remain at the wheel and you sam come with I there will be a dead nigger aboard unless you jump when i speak he trot close at my heel as i flung open the door lead into the cabin the air seem fresh enough and i note two of the port wide open a tall smooth-shaven man with a ugly scar down one cheek lay outstretch on a divan at the foot of the after mast he very posture proclaim he dead he face be the color of parchment wrinkle with age but i know he at once as spanish a uniform cap lay beside he and i stop just long enough to scan he feature here sam do you know this fellow the negro creep up behind I reluctantly enough and stare at the upturned face over my shoulder my gaud sah he wus de ol' captain the one you serve under what be he name paradillum sah damn he soul a slaver i suppose well he be run he last cargo of nigger let 's look into the room they be empty all in disorder but unoccupied in what be evidently the captain 's room i discover a pricked chart and a log-book with no entry in it for three day without wait to examine these i stow they away in my pocket and return to paradilla relieved to learn we labor aft be so light and eager to have it over with some physical persuasion be necessary to compel sam to assist I but finally he take hold and between we we force the stiffened form of the captain through the open after port and hear it splash into the sea astern then i close the cabin door and lead the way forward to my great relief the hold be empty although the smell arise through the partially open hatch be stifle the reminder of a cargo lately discharge there be two dead seaman in the forecastle both swarthy fellow with long indian hair i never see a dirtier hole the filth overpowering and once satisfied that both man be beyond help i be content to lower the scuttle and leave they there god it be a relief to return once more to the open deck and breathe in the fresh air schmitt be hold the schooner close up in the wind which however be barely heavy enough to keep the sail full yet at that the sharp-nosed craft be make the best of it leave a long wake astern the wave crest within a few foot of she rail as she sweep gloriously forward i lean over and hail the boat towing below come aboard watkin i call sharply pass the lady up first and turn the boat adrift what be she sir a abandon slaver i 'll tell you the story later come aboard ay ay sir i catch dorothy 's hand and aid she over the rail the schooner ride steady and she stand still grasp I she eager eye on the deck aft then they seek my face questioningly the seaman begin to gather between we and the rail why be the vessel abandon she ask what have happen do you know yes the story be plain enough i explain deem it best to tell the whole truth this be a slaver the _ santa marie _ ply between cuba and the african coast sam the negro who come aboard with I serve as cook on board for one voyage i do not know why they should be in these water -- driven north by a storm likely -- but cholera be the trouble the crew be all overboard or dead overboard or dead you find they dead -- the slave also no there be no slave the hold be clear we find a few dead man the last of the crew to survive one man be lie beside the wheel he have lash it to its course before he die and the captain be in the cabin and he be dead yes a tall lean spaniard sam say he name be paradillum we find five altogether and fling they body over the side except two sailor in the forecastle she eye evidence she horror she lip barely able to speak they -- they die of cholera all of they there be no one leave alive on board not even a dog it be a tragedy of the sea of which we will never know all the truth i have the log here in my pocket all write out until three day ago -- perhaps that be when the captain die but can you imagine anything more grim more horrible than this schooner with all sail set stand on she course with a dead man at the wheel and -- and other dead man in cabin and forecastle she voice break and she hand cover she eye o geoffry must we stay aboard the thought be terrible besides you say it be cholera there be nothing we need fear i insist firmly clasp the upraised hand and meet she eye frankly and i rely upon you to help I control the man they be sailor fill with superstition and will look to we for leadership please do not fail I you have already pass through too much to be frighten at a shadow this be a staunch vessel provision and fit for any sea we be far safer here than in the boat it be as if god have send we deliverance yet we face disease -- cholera i do not hold that a peril -- not to we if we use precaution that be a ever-present sea danger and i have read every book treat of the disease so long as we be well feed and keep in the fresh air we be not liable to suffer the dead be overboard and every hatch close i will have the deck scour from end to end the bedding we need and the food be be bring up from the boat we shall come in contact with nothing to spread the disease you must meet this emergency just as bravely as you have the other you will will you not she eye meet mine smilingly resolute if you say so -- yes how can i help you tell the man just what i have tell you i say gravely they will pay more heed to what you say and will be ashamed to show less courage than you do you agree we turn and face they together as they form a little group against the rail they dunnage together with a few box of provision and a couple of water cask lay scatter about the deck and now they immediate task do the fellow be sullenly stare around hallin be first to speak vot vas eet you say ` bout di sheep eet haf cholera -- hey dorothy take a step forward and confront they she cheek flush you be sailor she say speak swiftly and ought not to be afraid if a girl be not it be true this vessel be ravage by cholera and the crew die but the body have be fling overboard -- captain carlyle risk he life to do that before he ask we aboard now there be no danger so long as we remain on deck i have no fear the swede shake he head grumble something but before the revolt could spread watkin break in a ' that be right miss i wus on the _ bombay castle _ when she take cholera a ' we hed twenty-one day of it beatin ' agin head wind off the cape we lose sixteen o ' the crew but not a man among we who stay on deck get sick anyhow these bloke be goin ' ter try they luck aboard yere er else swim fer it he grin cheerfully let slip the end of the painter the release quarter-boat glide gently away astern the width of water constantly increase the light craft wallow in the wave now bully jump fer it if yer want ter go why do not yer try it ole you be so keen about get away you ought not to mind a little water so ye prefer to stay along with the rest of we all right then my hearty let 's hunt up something to work with and scrub this deck that be the way to clean out cholera he lead the way and they follow he grumble and cursing but obedient i add a word of encouragement and in a few minute the whole gang be busily engage in clear up the mess forward make use of whatever come to hand they first fear evidently forget in action watkin keep after they like a slave driver that be the style throw all the litter overboard bend you back pierre now ole take hold here what the hell be you man loaf for now heave altogether i glance astern catch a fleeting glimpse beneath the main boom of the disappear quarter-boat bob up and down in the distance then my eye seek the face of the girl she meet my gaze with a smile they be all right now be they not she ask yes as long as they can be keep busy and i will see to that let 's go aft and get out of this mess i want to plan we voyage it be not difficult finding plenty for the lad to do make the neglect schooner shipshape and adjust the spread of canvas aloft to the new course i decide upon fortunately we have man enough to manipulate the sail real seaman able to work swiftly sam start a fire in the galley and prepare a hot meal singing as he work and before noon i have as cheerful a ship 's crew forward as any man could possibly ask for the weather keep pleasant but with a heavy wind blow compelling we to take a reef in the canvas but the schooner be a excellent sea boat and all alike feel the exhilaration of rapid progress dorothy and i glance over the log but gain little information the vessel have be drive into the northwest by a succession of storm and lack of provision have weaken the crew cholera break out among they the third day at sea the first victim be the cabin steward with no medicine chest aboard and everything below foul the disease spread rapidly within twenty-four hour sixteen body be throw overboard and in they terror the remainder of the crew mutiny and refuse to work ship both mate die and finally only three man be leave alive -- a negro know as juan the quarter-master gabriel lossier and the captain who be already lie sick and helpless in the cabin that be the last entry barely decipherable as the sun reach the meridian i venture again into the cabin and return with the necessary instrument to determine we position with these and the pricked chart i manage fairly well in determine we location and choose the most direct course toward the coast dorothy watch closely and when i look up from the paper the man be gather about the open door of the galley equally interested i order watkin to send they all aft and as they range up across the narrow deck i spread out the chart before they and explain as best i could we situation and what i propose do i doubt if many be able to comprehend yet some grasp my meaning bend over the map and ask question point to this and that mark with stubby forefinger from they muttered remark i judge they only anxiety be to get ashore as early as possible out of this death ship convince this be also my object they venture forward cheerfully as i roll up the chart and place it in the flag locker one of the frenchman relieved schmitt at the wheel and a little later sam serve dorothy and i on deck the food be appetizing and well cook and we linger over it for some time while watkin busy the man forward chapter xxviii a new plan of escape nothing occur during the afternoon to disturb the routine work aboard or to cause I any uneasiness the swift slaver make excellent progress in spite of light wind and prove easy to handle watkin find enough to occupy the crew on deck and aloft and they seem contented although i notice the fellow gather together in group whenever idle and discuss the situation earnestly while they might not be entirely satisfied and no doubt some fear linger in they mind the fellow lack leadership for any revolt and would remain quiet for the present at least i make one more trip into the desolate cabin return with pipe and tobacco which i take forward and distribute a ample supply for all the crew as the man smoke watkin and i lean over the rail and discuss the situation sunset bring cloud and by the time it be really dark the entire sky be overcast but the sea remain comparatively calm and the wind steady i judge we be make in the neighborhood of nine knot and carefully prick my chart to assure myself of we position even at that i be not entirely satisfied although i keep this lack of faith hide from the other dorothy however who keep close beside I much of the time must have sense my doubt to some extent for once she question I curiously be you not sure of you figure she ask glance from the chart into my face that be three time you have measure the distance it be not the figure it be the accuracy of the chart i explain it be not new for the schooner evidently seldom make this coast and it be probably only by chance that they have such a map aboard even the best of the chart be not absolutely correct and this one may be entirely wrong i shall rely more on keep a careful watch tonight than on the map you see this cape for all i know it may jut out fifty mile east of where it appear to be and we might run into shoal water at any minute she wrinkle she brow over the line on the map and then stare out across the darkening sea without speak it be a pleasant night in spite of the darkness the air soft and refreshing we divide the man into watch watkin select the more capable for lookout i explain to these the danger and post they on the forecastle head ready to respond instantly to any call i could see the glow of they pipe for some time but finally these go out one by one and the growl of voice cease the schooner be in darkness except for a faint reflection from the binnacle light aft reveal the dim figure of the helmsman overhead the canvas disappear into the gloom of the sky the locker be fill with flag represent almost every nation on earth evidently the _ santa marie _ be willing to fly any color which would insure safety or allay suspicion in she nefarious trade i drag these out and spread they on the deck abaft the cabin thus form a very comfortable bed and at last induce the girl to lie down wrap she in a blanket but although she recline there and rest she be in no mood for sleep and whenever my restless wander bring I near i be make aware of she wakefulness finally i find a seat beside she on a coil of rope and we fall into conversation which must have last for a hour or more i shall never forget that dark ship 's deck with no sound break the silence except the soft swirl of water alongside the occasional flap of canvas aloft and the creak of the wheel dorothy be but a shroud figure as she sit wrap in she blanket and the only other object visible be the dim outline of the helmsman we seem to be completely shut in between sea and sky lose and forget yet the memory of the tragedy this vessel have witness remain with I -- the helpless slave who have suffer and die between deck the dead sailor in the forecastle they ghastly face stare up at the beam above and the horrible figure of paradillum outstretch on the cabin divan i be a sailor and could not feel that any good fortune would come to we from such a death ship the memory bring to I a depression hard to throw off yet for she sake i pretend a cheerfulness i be far from feeling and we conversation drift idly into many channel this be the first opportunity we have enjoy to actually talk with each other alone and gradually we thought veer from the happening of the strange voyage and we present predicament to those personal matter in which we be peculiarly interested i know not how it occur for what have pass between we in the open boat seem more like a dream than a reality yet my hand find she own beneath the blanket and i dare to whisper the word my lip could no longer restrain dorothy i say humbly you be frighten last night i can not hold you to what you say to I then you mean you do not wish to but i be not frighten they be honest word you have not regret they since no geoffry perhaps they be not maidenly yet be they honest why should i not have tell you the truth i have long know my own heart and yours as well and you still repeat what you say then perhaps i do not remember all i say i can never forget -- you say ' i love you ' she draw a quick breath and for a instant remain silent then she courage conquer yes i can repeat that -- i love you those be dear dear word but i ought not to listen to they or believe i be not free to ask a pledge of you or to beg you to trust I in marriage be not that rather for I to decide she question archly i give you my faith geoffry and surely no girl ever have more reason to know the heart of a man than i you have risk all to serve I and i would be ungrateful indeed be i insensible of the sacrifice yet do not think that be all -- gratitude for what you have do i do not need that to teach I you nature i make a confession now you remember the night i meet you on deck when you be a prisoner and tell you that you have become the property of roger fairfax i could never forget nor i i loved you then although i scarcely acknowledge the truth even to myself i go back to my berth to lie awake and think until morning a new world have come to I and when the dawn break i know what it all mean -- that my heart be yours i care nothing because you be a prisoner a bind slave under sentence we be all alike we fairfax 's we choose for ourselves and laugh at the world that be my answer geoffry carlyle i give you love for love ` tis a strange place for such a pledge with only hope before we a fit place to my mind in memory of we life together thus far for all the way it have be stress and danger and what more can we ask than hope i would ask a opportunity deny I -- to stand once more in honor among man i would not be shame before dorothy fairfax nor need you be she exclaim impetuously she hand press mine you wrong yourself even as you have be wrong you have already do that which shall win you freedom if it be properly present to those in power i mean that it shall be once i be safely back in virginium tell I what be you plan with -- with this schooner to beach it somewhere along shore and leave it there a wreck while we escape i suspect as much -- yet be that the best way the only way which have occur to I the man insist on it with good reason they have be pirate and might be hang if catch and yet to my mind she insist earnestly that choice be most dangerous i be a girl but if i command here do you know what i would do i shall be glad to hear i would sail this vessel straight to the chesapeake and surrender it to the authority the man have nothing to fear with I aboard and ready to testify in they behalf the governor will accept my word without a question these man be not pirate but honest seaman compel to serve in order to save they life they mutiny and capture the bark but be later overcome and compel to take the boat the same plea can be make for you geoffry only you be there in a effort to save I it be a service which ought to win you freedom but if it do not i pledge you my word it shall if the governor fail I i will bear my story to the foot of the king i be a fairfax and we have friend in england strong powerful friend they will listen and aid I i be convinced i admit after a pause that this course be the wiser one but fear the opposition of the man they will never go willingly there be a argument which will overcome they fear you mean force no although i doubt not that might suffice i mean cupidity each sailor aboard have a interest in the salvage of this vessel under the english law you tell I the schooner be a slaver drive out to sea by storm immediately after discharge a cargo of slave there must be gold aboard -- perhaps treasure also for i can not think a slaver above piracy if chance arise let the crew dream that dream and you will need no whip to drive they into a english port full pardon and possibly wealth with it i laugh a beautiful scheme dorothy yet it might work still if i know sailorman they would doubt the truth if it come direct from I for i be not really one of they but watkin be and he have intelligence explain it all to he tell he who i be the influence i can wield in the colony and then let he whisper the news to the other will you not do this -- for my sake yes i answer i believe you have find the right course if you will promise to lie down and sleep i will talk with watkin now i promise but be you not go to rest very little tonight i may catch some catnap before morning but most of the time shall be prowl about deck you see i have no officer to rely upon but do not worry about I -- this sort of life be not new good night dear girl she extend she arm and draw I down until we lip meet you be actually afraid of I still she say wonderingly why should you be i can not tell i have never know what it be before somehow dorothy you have always seem so far away from I i have never be able to forget but now the touch of you lip have -- break down the last barrier yes forever be you sure would you not feel still less doubt if you kiss I again i hold she closely gaze down into the dimly reveal outline of she face and this time feel myself the master now i be sure sweetheart i whisper the note of joy ringing in the word that i have win the most precious gift in the world yet you safety and those of all on board be in my hand tonight i must not forget that i be go now to find watkin and you have promise to lie down and sleep to lie down she correct but whether to sleep i can not tell i leave she there lie hidden and shapeless on the deck beneath the cover of the blanket she head pillow on the flag and grope my own way forward pause a moment to gaze into the binnacle and exchange a word with the man at the wheel i find watkin awake seat on the forecastle step where i join he light my own pipe for companionship we conversation gradually drift toward the point i come to make he listen gravely to what i have to say with little comment and be evidently weigh every argument in he mind i have bin in virginium and maryland sir he say at last seriously and if the young woman be a fairfax she 'll likely have influence enough ter do just whut she say they be not over-kind ter pirate in they province o ' late i have bin tell -- but the savin ' o ' she life wud make a heap o ' difference with the governor yer know she be a fairfax absolutely i tell you the story that night in the forecastle and i take more risk than any of you in give myself up i be bind in servitude to she uncle roger fairfax and be therefore a runaway slave well he agree i 'll talk it over with the lad it be a good story a ' i would be ready ter take chance but i be not so sure sir on makin ' 'em feel the same way all most of 'em think about be ter escape bein ' hang if they wus only sure thar wus treasure aboard like you suspicion there may be i guess most of 'em would face hell ter git they hand on a share of it then why not search and see he shake he head obstinately and he face show in the dull glow of the pipe prove that he sturdy intelligent seaman as he be share to no small extent the fear of the other not I sir i do not prowl around in no cholera ship load with dead man -- not if i never git rich then i will and i get to my foot in sudden determination you keep the deck while i go below have you see a lantern on board anywhere ay sir there be one hangin ' in the cook 's galley i hope yer do not think i be a damn coward mr carlyle oh no tom i know how you feel exactly we be both of we sailor but you see i have get to make this crew take the _ santa marie _ into the chesapeake and it be a easier job if i can find gold aboard yer have get to sir yes i have give my promise to the girl light the lantern and bring it here then we 'll go aft together if there be any specie hide aboard this hooker it will be either in the cabin or lazaret and whether there be or not my man the _ santa marie _ turn north tomorrow if i have to fight every sea wolf on board single-handed chapter xxix a struggle in the dark he come back with it swing in he hand a mere tin box contain a candle the dim flame visible through numerous puncture it promise poor guidance enough yet emit sufficient light to show the way around in that darkness below so as not to arouse suspicion i wrap the thing in a blanket and with watkin beside I start aft dorothy must have be asleep already for there be no sign of movement as we pass where she be lie neither of we speak until my hand be on the companion door ready to slide it open i 'll not be long below i say soberly and meanwhile you keep a sharp watch on deck better go forward and see that you lookout man be awake and then come back here likely i 'll have a story to tell you by that time the wind seem lessen yes sir shall we shake out a reef in the foresail not yet watkin wait until i learn what secret be below a hour will make little difference with the lantern hold before I its faint light barely pierce the intense darkness i stand on the first step lead down into the cabin and slide the door back into place behind I i have no sense of fear yet feel a nervous tension to which i be scarcely accustom for the instant i hesitate to descend into the gloom of that interior the constant nerve strain under which i have labor for day and night make I shrink from grope blindly forward search for the unknown the very darkness seem haunt and i could not drive from my memory the figure of that dead captain whose life have end there it even seem to I i could smell foulness in the air that i be breathe in cholera yet i drive this terror from I with a laugh remember the open port through which the fresh wind be blow and cursing myself for a fool begin the descent guide by the flicker ray of light i be conscious of a quicken pulse as i peered about I in the gloom every article of furniture assume grotesque form the rustling of a bit of cloth over one of the open port cause I to face about suddenly while every creak of the vessel seem the echo of a human voice a blanket in the form of a roll lay on the divan where i have find captain paradillum and for a moment as i stare at it dimly visible in a ray of light i imagine this be he motionless figure indeed i be so string up it require all my reserve of courage to persevere and traverse the black deck my mind be fix on a great chest in the captain 's stateroom which find lock i have not disturb on my former visit but first i explore the steward 's pantry in search of knife or hatchet i find the latter and with it tuck into my belt feel my way aft it may have require five minute to pry open the chest and the reward be scarcely worth the effort the upper tray contain nothing but clothing and beneath this be book and nautical instrument with a bag of specie tuck into one corner together with a small packet of letter i open the sack finding therein a strange collection of coin mostly spanish estimate the total roughly at possibly five hundred english pound either this be paradillum 's private purse or money keep on hand to meet the expense of the voyage i search the room thoroughly discover nothing finally conclude that if there be treasure on board it must be conceal elsewhere i do find however that which strengthen my suspicion for in rummage hastily through a drawer of the rude desk i come upon a bill of sale for a thousand slave date two week before but unsigned although the party mention within the document be paradillum and a merchant of habana name carlo martino this would evidence the sale for cash of the late cargo of the _ santa marie _ -- a goodly sum -- but whether the amount have be leave ashore remain undecided only a careful search of the vessel could determine this however this discovery nerve I to press forward with my exploration all fear and dread have leave I and i go at the task coolly enough and with a clear purpose there remain aft two place unvisited -- the lazaret and the port stateroom which i have not previously enter because of a lock door i determine on break in here first suspect its use as a storeroom there be no key in the lock and the stout door resist my effort place the lantern on the deck i succeed finally in insert the blade of the hatchet so as to gain a purchase sufficient to release the latch as the door yield the hinge creak dismally a sharp cry human in its agony assail I from within it come forth so suddenly and with so wild a accent i step blindly backward in fright my foot overturn the lantern which with a single flicker of candle go out in that last gleam i see a form -- either of man or boy -- a dim grotesque outline fronting I then in the darkness gleam two green menacing eye grow steadily larger nearer as i stare at they in horror i could not move i seem paralyzed i doubt if i even breathe in that first moment of overwhelming terror another cry like that of a mad person strike my ear and i know the thing be come toward I there be no other sound no footstep on the deck i merely feel the approach realize the increase glare of those horrible eye they seem to fascinate to hold I immovable the blood chill in my vein be it man or beast devil from hell or some craze human against whom i must battle for life the green eye glare into my face i could even feel the hot breath of the monster i lift my hand toward he and touch -- hair even as the creature 's grip catch I rip through jacket sleeve to the flesh i know what my antagonist be -- a giant african ape horrible as the reality be i be no longer paralyze with fear helpless before the unknown this be something real something to grasp and struggle against a beast with which to pit strength and skill the sting of the claw madden I bring I instantly to life and i drive my hatchet straight between those two gleaming eye i know not how it strike but the brute stagger back drag I with he in the clutch of he claw he human-like cry of pain end in a brutal snarl but brief as the respite prove it give I grip on he under jaw and a opportunity to drive my weapon twice more against the hairy face the pain serve only to madden the beast and before i could wrench free he have I clutch in a iron grip my jacket tear into shred he jaw snap at my face but i have such purchase as to prevent they touch I and mindless of the claw tear at my flesh i force the animal 's head back until the neck crack and the lip give vent to a wild scream of agony i dare not let go dare not relax for a instant the exercise of every ounce of strength i feel as though the life be be squeeze out of I by the grasp of those hairy arm yet the very vice in which i be hold yield I leverage the hatchet drop to the deck and both hand find lodgment under the jaw the muscle of my arm strain to the utmost as i force back that horrid head little by little it give way the suffering brute whining in agony until the pain become unendurable the clinging arm suddenly release they hold let I drop heavily to the deck by some good fortune i fall upon the discard hatchet and stumble to my foot once more grip the weapon again in my finger i stand tremble breathing hard my flesh burn peer about the darkness reveal nothing yet i know i have be drag within the stateroom from which there be no escape as i have lose all sense of direction for a instant i could not even locate the brute with a intense desire to escape to place the door safely between I and my antagonist i feel blindly about in the black void silently as i endeavored to move i must have be overhear by the beast for suddenly he jaw snap savagely and i see once again the baneful glow of those horrible eye i know enough of wild life to realize that now the ape fear I and that my safer course be to attack act on this impulse determine to have a end before he could grip I once more in those awful arm and crush I into unconsciousness i spring straight toward he send the sharp blade of the hatchet crash against the skull the aim be good the stroke a death blow yet the monster get I with one jaw and we fall to the deck together he savagely claw I in he death agony then the hairy figure quiver and lay motionless with barely strength enough for the task i release the stiffen grip and creep aside rise to my knee only to immediately pitch forward unconscious it seem to I as i go down that i hear voice see light flash in the outer cabin but all these merge instantly into blackness when i come back once more to life i know immediately i be upon the schooner 's deck breathe the fresh night air i could see the outline of the helmsman in the little circle of binnacle light a ray of which extend far enough to assure I of the presence of dorothy i watch she for some time my mind slowly clear to the situation and it be not until i speak that she become aware i have recover consciousness dorothy yes yes she bent lower eagerly oh i be so glad to hear you speak watkin say you be not seriously hurt but you clothes be tear into shred and you bleed terribly it be not a nightmare then i really fight that beast yes but it be too horrible to think about -- i -- i shall never blot out the sight you see what occur yourself i question in astonishment you actually come below then i do hear voice and see a light before my sens leave I yes watkin hear the noise of struggle the cry of the brute and wake I at first he be afraid to go into the cabin but i make he rather than let I go alone the only light we have be a torch make from a rope end we get there just as you fall i see you stagger on you knee and that beast outstretch on deck a great gash in its skull watkin say it be a chimpanzee it be a huge ape of some kind craze with hunger no doubt i sit up aware of the smart of my wound but already convince they be not deep or dangerous you do not look about you take no note of what be in the room no puzzle at my sudden interest i have no thought of anything but you at first i believe you dead until i feel the beat of you pulse the light reveal little until watkin find the overturn lantern and relit the candle but i see not even that much the fight be in pitch darkness yet i strike against thing not furniture -- what be they oh you mean that i think it must have be a storeroom of some kind for there be cask and box pile up and a strange iron-bound chest be against one wall i sit on it and hold the lantern while watkin see to you wound then we carry you up here that be the answer i seek yes you must let I get up dear oh i can stand alone a little weak from loss of blood yet but none the worse off where be watkin he go forward do you need he perhaps it can wait until daylight you know what i venture below for to learn if there be treasure hidden aboard you hope such a discovery would induce the man to sail this schooner to the chesapeake yes and now i believe there be -- hide away in the lock room and guard by that ape in all probability no one but paradillum know the creature be on board and he could have have no better guardian no sailor would ever face the brute we may have talk there for a hour watkin join we finally and listen to my story my wound while painful enough be all of the flesh and the flow of blood be easily staunch my strength return quickly to my surprise the hour be but little after midnight and i have so far recover when the watch be change as to insist on watkin go forward leave I in charge of the deck i feel no desire for sleep and so he finally yield to my order and curl up in a blanket in the lee of the galley the girl be harder to manage yet when i leave she alone she lay down on she bed of flag twice later she lift she head and speak as i pass but at last remain motionless while i carefully cover she with a extra blanket the time do not seem long to I as i pace the desert deck aft or go forward occasionally to assure myself that the lookout on the forecastle be alert there be nothing to see or do the sea and sky both so black as to be indistinguishable and the breeze barely heavy enough to distend the canvas give the schooner a speed not to exceed six knot i suspicioned a storm in the hatching but nothing evidence its near approach however my thought busy I and vanish all drowsiness i believe i have win a way to freedom -- to a government pardon the good fortune which have befall I in the salvage of this vessel as well as we success against the pirate of the _ namur _ could scarcely be ignore by the authority of virginium while the rescue of dorothy fairfax and she plead in we behalf would commend we to mercy and reward from the very highest official the money the treasure i personally think nothing about willing enough that it should go to other but i be ambitious to regain my honor among man my place of respectability in the world for the one vital purpose which now dominate my mind -- that i might claim dorothy fairfax with clean hand my love and the confession of she own have bring to I a new vista a fresh hope it seem to I already she faith have inspire I with new power -- power to transform dream into reality i stand above she motionless figure as she lay asleep and solemnly take a resolve at whatever cost to myself or other the _ santa marie _ should sail in between the cape to the water of the chesapeake be the result reward or punishment liberty or freedom the chance must be accept for she sake as well as my own chapter xxx open the treasure chest the dawn come slowly and with but little increase of light the breeze have almost entirely die away leave the canvas aloft motionless the schooner barely move through a slightly heave sea in the midst of a dull-gray mist it be a dismal outlook the deck wet the sail drip moisture and nothing to look about upon but wreath of fog even as the sun rise its ray fail to penetrate this cloud bank or yield slightest color to the scene it be all gray gloomy mysterious -- a narrow stretch of water disappear so suddenly the eye could not determine ocean from sky the upper mast vanish into the vapor and from where i stand aft i could but dimly perceive the open deck amidship the light yet burn in the binnacle be hazy and dull there be to my mind a threat in the weather express in the silence overhead as well as in the sullen swell underfoot we could not be far from the coast -- a coast line of which i know next to nothing -- and at any instant the blinding fog encircle we might be sweep aside by some sudden atmospheric change catch we aback and leave we helpless upon the water again and again i have witness storm burst from just such condition and we be far too short-handed to take any unnecessary risk i talk with harwood at the wheel and wait occasionally walk over to the rail and peer out into the mist uneasily it seem to I the heave of water beneath we keel grow heavier the fog more dense the mystery more profound safety be better than progress particularly as there be no real object any longer in we cling to a westerly course the sensible thing be to lay too until the envelop fog blow away explore that room below and explain my plan to the man this determine upon i call all hand and with watkin in command forward precede to strip the vessel of canvas leave expose only a jib sheet with closely reef foresail barely enough to give the wheelsman control this require some time and compel I to lay hold with the other and when the last gasket have be secure and the man aloft return to the deck sam have the galley fire burning and breakfast nearly ready the lad saturate with moisture and in anything but good humor be soon restore to cheerfulness and i leave they sit about on deck and return aft where dorothy arouse by the noise stand well wrap up near the rail sleep have refresh she greatly she eye welcome I a red flush on either cheek have you be up all night yes but i would hardly know it -- a sleepless night mean nothing to a sailor but it be so selfish of I to sleep all those hour i have you to think about all we have say to each other and we plan what be they you have determine to do as you suggest it be the braver and i believe the better way the difficulty be go to lie in convince the crew of they safety i shall explore below before have a talk with they in hope of discover treasure to be divide yes that will have greater weight with those fellow than any argument or promise here come sam with we breakfast we will eat here from the flag locker the negro serve we with some skill and discover we be hungry both do full justice to the well-cooked fare the denseness of the fog hide the man from we but we could hear they voice and occasionally a burst of laughter we be talk quietly together and have nearly finish when watkin emerge through the mist and approach respectfully you do not like the look o ' thing sir he ask stare out into the smother astern i have see storm bear from such fog i answer and know nothing of this coast you think then it be not far away -- out yonder it be all a guess we make good progress most of the night and i have no confidence in the chart there be headland hereabout and we might be within hail of one at this minute it be safer to lie quiet until the mist lift by the way watkin -- ay ay sir miss fairfax tell I that be a storeroom in which i fight the ape last night it be sir and she report have see a chest iron-bound among the other stuff do you notice it he walk across to the rail spat overboard and come back politely wipe he lip on he sleeve yes sir i do it be store ter starboard a ol' fashion sea chest padlock a ' look like a relic but a damned strong box you think maybe there be gold in it likely enough i find about five hundred pound in the captain 's room but there must be more aboard unless it be leave behind in cuba my idea be that be why the monkey be lock up in there -- to guard the treasure do that sound reasonable he scratch he head he eye wander from she face to mine yes sir it do i have hear o ' such thing afore a chimpanzee be better 'n a big dog on such a job thar be not no sailor who would tackle the beast that be my way of look at it so while we be lie here and the lad be in good humor -- hear that laugh -- i be go to find out what be in the chest after i know i 'll talk to the man do you agree he nod but without speak be you willing to go below with I i be not overly anxious ` bout it mister carlyle he reply gruffly pluck awkwardly at the peak of he cap i be a seaman sir a ' know my duty a ' so i 'll go ` long if yer wus ter order I to yer know that but i be not fergot yet this yere be a cholera ship a ' it be goin ' ter be as black as night down thar in thet cabin -- do not urge he geoffry the girl interrupt she hand on my sleeve leave he here on deck i be not in the least afraid and all you need be someone to hold the light please let I do that i look down into she eye and smile suppose we should encounter another ape then i would want to be with you she respond quickly you be go to consent i suppose i be although if there be the slightest danger my answer would be otherwise keep the man busy watkin while we be go -- do not give they time to ask question you bring the lantern on deck yes sir it be over there against the grate very well we 'll light up in the companion so the flame will not be see by the crew come dorothy she accompany I cheerfully but she hand grasp mine as we grope we way down the stair into the dark cabin a faint glimmer of gray daylight filter through the glass from above and find entrance at the open port but the place be nevertheless gloomy enough and we need what little help the candle afford to find we way about the memory haunt we both and hurry we to we special mission the door of the storeroom stand wide open but the after port be close the air within heated and foul dorothy hold the lantern she hand tremble slightly as i step across and unscrewed both port the moist fog blow in upon I but be welcome although i stare forth into a bank of impenetrable mist the dead ape lay just as he have fall with he hideous face upturn and a great gash in the head the hatchet with which i have deal the blow rest on the deck disfigure with blood the hugeness of the creature its repulsive aspect in death with savage tooth gleam in the ray of the lantern and long hairy arm outspread give I such a shock i feel my limb tremble for a moment i could not remove my eye from the spectacle or regain control of my nerve then i some way see the horror reflect in she face and realize the requirement of leadership he be certainly a big brute i say quietly and it be a lucky stroke which finish he now to complete we work in here and get out i pick up the hatchet and my glance seek the whereabouts of the chest the light be confusing and she step forward throw the dim yellow flame directly upon the object this be what i saw -- see do it look like a treasure chest to you if it be not i never see one -- and a hundred year old if it be a day what a story of the sea it might tell if it have a tongue there be no way to find its secret but to break it open place the lantern on this cask of wine now if i can gain purchase with the blade it will be easily accomplish it prove harder than i have believe the staple of the lock cling to the hard teak wood of which the chest be make i must have be ten minute at it compel to use a wooden bar as lever before it yield groan as it finally release its grip like a soul in agony i feel the girl clutch I in terror at the sound she frightened eye search the shadow but i be interest by then to learn what be within and give all my effort to lift the lid this be heavy as though weight with lead but as i finally force it backward a hinge snap and permit it to drop crash to the deck for a instant i could see nothing within -- no more indeed than some dimly reveal outline the nature of which could not be determine yet somehow it give I a impression horrible grotesque of a human form i grip the side of the chest afraid to reach downward lift up the lantern -- dorothy please no higher than that what in god 's name why it be the corpse of a woman i hear she cry out and barely catch the lantern as it fall from she hand the hatchet strike the deck with a sharp clang and i feel the frightened clasp of the girl 's finger on my sleeve yet i scarcely realize these thing my entire attention focus on what be now reveal writhin the chest at first i doubt the evidence of my own eye snatch the bit of flare candle from its tin socket and hold it where the full glare of light fall across the grewsome object ay it be a woman with lower limb double back from lack of space but otherwise lie as though she sleep so perfect in preservation she cheek appear flush with health she lip half smile it be a face of real beauty -- a english face although she eye and hair be dark and she mantilla and long earring be unquestionably spanish a string of pearl encircle she throat and there be numerous ring upon she finger the very contrast add immeasurably to the horror she be alive surely she be alive the word be sob into my ear tremble from dorothy 's lip as though she could barely utter they i stare into she face the sight of she terror arouse I from stupor alive no that be impossible and conquer a repugnance such as i have never before experienced i touch the figure with my hand the flesh be like stone i say thus hold lifelike by some magic of the indy i have hear of such skill but never before realize its perfection good god she actually seem to breathe what can it all mean who could the woman be and why should she body be thus carry about at sea be it love or hate not love geoffry love would never do this thing it be hate the gloating of revenge there can be no other answer -- this be the end of a tragedy the truth of which will never be know be you sure be there nothing hide with she in there to tell who she be or how she die there be nothing not a scrap of paper not even the semblance of a wound expose the smile on those part lip have become one of mockery i could bear the sight no longer and rise to my foot clasp dorothy close to I as she still gaze down in fascination at the ghastly sight we will never know the man who could tell be dead captain paradillum who else could it be this be he schooner and here he alone could hide such a secret there be nothing more we can learn and the horror unnerve I hold the light dear while i replace the lid of the chest it require my utmost effort to accomplish this yet i succeed in slide the heavy cover back inch by inch until it fall finally into place i be glad to have the thing hide to escape the stare of those fix eye the death smile of those red lip it be no longer a reality but a dream of delirium i dare not think or speculate -- my only desire be to get away to get dorothy away my eye sweep about through the confusing shadow half expect to be confront by other ghost of the past but all they encounter be the indistinct outline of cask and box and the hideous hairy figure of the ape outstretch upon the deck the candle flutter in the girl 's shake hand the yellow glare form weird reflection ugly shape along the wall god what if it should go out leave we lose and grope about in this chamber of horror in absolute terror i draw she with I to the open door -- then stop paralyze the half reveal figure of a man appear on the cabin stair stop who be you watkin sir i come below to call you there be sumthin ' bloomin ' odd takin ' place out there in the fog captain carlyle we want yer on deck sir right away chapter xxxi the boat attack he wait for we just without the companion but my eye catch nothing unusual as i emerge into the daylight i could barely see amidship but thus far the deck be clear and on either side hang the impenetrable bank of cloud leave sea and sky invisible simme be at the wheel with no other member of the crew in sight what be it watkin where be the man forrard sir a hangin ' over the starboard rail thar 's somethin' cursedly strange a happenin ' in that damn fog harwood be the first ter hear the clatter ov en oar slippin ' in a rowlock i think the feller wus crazy till i heerd sumthin ' also a ' then sir while we wus still a listenin ' we both catch sound ov a spanish oath speak as plain as if the buck be aboard you see nothing not so much as a shadder sir a lose boat likely -- ship-wrecked sailor adrift in the fog perhaps we other quarter-boat no one hail they no sir i tell the man ter keep still till i call you it might be a cuttin ' - out party this be not no coast fer any honest sailor ter be huggin ' up to a ' i do not like that feller talkin ' spanish but if they purpose be to take we by surprise i say they would be more cautious about it maybe they do not know how near they be ` tai not likely they kin see we much better 'n we kin see they the sea 's get a ugly swell to it a ' the feller likely cuss afore he think enyhow it wa ' not my place ter hail 'em all right where be they straight off the starboard quarter sir the crew be all gather there stare out into the mist whisper to each other even they be indistinct they face unrecognizable until i press my way in among they i bring up beside harwood hear anything more not yet sir peer about to make sure of who speak but there be a boat out yonder i 'll swear to that how far away when you hear they not mor 'n fifty fathom a ' maybe not that -- the voice sound clearest we may have be cling there a minute or two breathlessly listen we hand tensely grip the rail my come have silence the other and we wait motionless the stillness so intense i could hear the lapping of wave against the side and the slight creak of a rope aloft then a voice speak directly in front of I out from the dense fog a peculiar penetrate voice carry farther than the owner probably think and distinctly audible try the port oar pedro we must have miss the damn ship i straighten up as though strike my eye seek those of harwood who stare back at I he mouth wide open in astonishment you hear that i whisper do you know who speak by god do i dead or alive sir it be manuel estevan ay no other and alive enough no doubt lad come close to I and listen -- they must not hear we out there by some devil 's trick the _ namur _ have follow we course or else yonder be a part of he crew cast away they clearly know of we -- perhaps have a glimpse through some rift in the cloud -- and be seek to board with a boat party ` tis not likely those devil know who we be probably take we for a merchant ship becalm in the fog and liable to become a easy prey if they can only slip up on we unseen how be you bully ready to battle you old mate those be no mate o ' ours sir say watkin indignantly they be half-breed mongrel and no sailor estevan be a hell-hound a ' so far as my voice go i would rather die on this deck than ever agin be a bloody pirate be that the right word lad the other grumble assent but they muttered word have in they a ring of sincerity and they face exhibit no cowardice harwood alone ask a question i be fer fightin ' sir he say grimly but what 'll we use they lad be not comin ' aboard bare-handed but damn if i have seed a weapon on this hooker dar 's three knife a ' a meat cleaver in der galley sah chime in sam we 'll do well enough some of you have you sheath knife yet and the rest can use belay pin and capstan bar the point be to not let they get aboard and if there be only one boat we will be pretty even-handed pick up what you can and man this rail -- quietly now hearty and keep you eye open it prove a longer wait than i expect the fog give we no glimpse of the surrounding water and not another sound enable we to locate the approach boat i feel convinced we have not be overhear as no one have speak above a whisper and the man aboard have be noiseless in they movement about deck i have compel dorothy to remain on the port side of the cabin remove from all danger and the only upright figure in sight be the man at the wheel the rest of we crouch along the starboard rail peer out into the mist and listen for the slightest sound they be a motley crew arm with every conceivable sort of knife or war club but sturdy fellow ready and willing enough to give a good account of themselves watkin be forward swallow up in the smother of mist but schmitt hold a place next I a huge ungainly figure in the dull light so still it be i begin to doubt have hear the voice at all -- could it have be imagination but no that be impossible for the sound have reach all of we alike somewhere out yonder that boat be creep along silently seek blindly through the fog to reach we side unobserved -- those wolf of the sea have the scent i do not know how long the suspense last but i have never feel a greater strain on my nerve every deeper shadow increase the tension imagination play strange trick as i stare fixedly into the void and tremble at the slightest sound once i be sure i hear the splash of a oar but no one on deck speak and i remain silent the faint creaking of a rope aloft cause my heart to thump and when a loosen edge of canvas slap the mast in a sudden breath of air it sound to I like a burst of thunder where be the fellow have they abandon they search confuse by the fog or be they still stealthily seek to locate we position could there be more than one boat and if not what force of man might such a boat contain these question never leave I and be alike unanswerable unable to withstand inaction any longer i arise to my foot think to pass down the line with a word of encouragement to each man a glance upward tell I the heavy mist be pass drive away by a light breeze from the south through the thick curtain which still cling to the deck i could perceive the upper spar already tip with sunlight and edge of reefed canvas flap in the wind the schooner feel the impulse the bow swing sharply to port and i turn and take a few step aft think to gauge we progress by the wake astern i be abaft the cabin on the port side when dorothy call my name -- a sudden accent of terror in she voice the alarm be sound none too soon either fortune or skill have serve those demon well glide silently through the obscure cloud hanging in dense fold of vapor to the water surface propel and guide by a single oar use cautiously as a paddle they have succeed in circle the stern of the _ santa marie _ unseen and unheard by anyone aboard not even the girl unconscious of the possibility of approach danger from that quarter she attention divert elsewhere have she slightest suspicion arouse as they glide noiselessly alongside and make fast beneath the protection of the after-chain one by one move like snake the devil pass inboard to where they could survey the seemingly desert deck some slight noise awake she to they presence yet even as she shriek the sudden alarm a hand be at she throat and she be struggle desperately in the merciless grip of a half-naked indian yet at that they be too late the advantage of surprise have fail they a half dozen have reach the deck leap from the rail the other below clamber after they leader when with a rush we meet they it be a fierce mad fight fist and club pit against knife and cutlass but the defender know well the odds against they anger by the plight of the girl realize that death would be the reward of defeat strike like demon incarnate crush they astounded antagonist back against the bulwark i doubt if the struggle last two minute and my memory of the scene be but a series of flash i hear the blow the oath the cry of pain the dull thud of wood against bone the sharp clang of steel in contact the shuffling of foot on the deck the splash of body hurl overboard these sound mingle in my mind with the flash of weapon the glare of infuriate eye the dark savage face yet it be all confusion uproar mingling of body and hoarse shout each man fight for himself in he own way i think only of she and leap straight for she assailant with bare hand smash recklessly through the hasty guard of he cutlass ignorant that he have even strike I and grip the copper devil by hair and throat i know she fall to the deck beneath we foot but i have my work cut out for I he be a hell-hound slippery as a eel in he half nakedness strong as a ox and fight like a fiend but for that first lucky grip i doubt my kill he yet i have he foul my grip unbreakable as i jerk and force he neck back against the rail until it crack the swarthy body slide inert to the deck whirling to assist the other assure of the fellow 's helplessness i find no need except for body here and there the deck be clear man be struggle in the chain two below in the boat be endeavor to cast off and schmitt with estevan helpless in he arm stagger to the side and fling the shriek spanish cur overboard out into the dark water i hear the splash as he fall the single cry he lip give but he never again appear above the surface above the bedlam watkin roar out a order that be it bully that be it now let she drop we 'll send they to hell where they belong good shot she land it be the hank of a spare anchor balance for a instant on the rail then send crash down through the frail bottom of the boat beneath the wreck drift away into the fog the two miserable occupant cling desperately to the gunwale i lift dorothy to she foot and she cling to I unsteadily she face yet white be it all over have they be drive off yes there be nothing more to fear from they be you injure not -- not seriously he hurt I terribly but make no attempt to use he cutlass i -- i guess i be more frightened than anything else be -- be the man dead if not he might as well be i answer glance at the body but not care to explain it be no time for mercy when i get to he watkin ay ay sir have you figure up result not fully sir two of we man be cut rather badly and cole have not come too yet from a smart rap on the head none get away he grin cheerfully not ` less they swim thar 's six dead one aboard four take ter the water mostly because they hed too the only livin ' one o ' the bunch be thet nigger ` longside the wheel a ' nuthin ' but a thick skull save he then there be eleven in the party what do you suppose have become of the other aboard the _ namur _ he shake he head puzzle by the question i dunno sir they might be a waitin ' out there in the fog perhaps the nigger cud tell you i cross over to where the fellow sit on a grate he head in he hand the girl still cling to my sleeve as though fearful of be leave alone the man be a repulsive brute he face stain with blood drip from a cut across he low forehead he look up sullenly at we approach but make no effort to rise what be you name my man i ask in spanish jose mendez senor you be aboard the _ namur _ he growl out a answer which i interpret to signify assent but watkin lose he temper look yere you black villain he roar drive the lesson home with he boot do not be a playin ' possum yer stand up a ' answer mister carlyle or yer 'll git a worse clip than i give yer afore whar be the bloody bark pound she heart out on the rock yonder he say more civilly unless she be slide off a ' go down wreck where hell i be not sure -- what be west frum here off we port quarter then that be ` bout where she be -- maybe a mile er so what about the crew they get away in the boat a ' likely mostly be ashore we be in the last boat launch a ' head out so far ter get ` round a ledge o ' rock we get lose in the fog then the mist sorter open a ' give we a glimpse o ' yer topsail manuel be for board you right away and the rest of we talk it over and think it would be all right we do not expect no fight once we get aboard expect to find something easy of course perhaps it would have be if you fellow in the boat have hold you tongue by any chance do you know now who we be he roll he eye toward watkin and then at schmitt engage in some job across the deck those two use to be on the _ namur _ he say he tone again sullen be you the feller who lock we in between deck we be the one jose you be up against fight man when you come in over we rail what be it you see out there harwood the seaman who be stand with hollow hand shade he eye stare forth into the swirl drapery of fog turn at my call and point excitedly there be a bark aground yonder sir and by god it look like the _ namur _ even as i cross the deck to he side eagerly search the direction indicate the wreath of obscure mist seem to divide as though sweep apart by some mighty hand and there in the full glow of the sun a picture in a frame lay the wreck vessel other see it as i do and a chorus of voice give vent to recognition damned if it be not the old hooker she get what be come to she all right mate maybe that be not hell bully and she be lousy with treasure come here sam that be the last of the _ namur _ chapter xxxii the last of the namur even from where we be look across that stretch of water yet obscure by float patch of mist the vessel be plainly a total wreck rapidly pound to death on a sharp ledge of rock both mast be down and lift as the bow be it be easy to perceive the deck be in splinter where fall spar and topmast have crash they way through she must have strike the ledge at good speed and with all sail set for the canvas be overside with much of the top-hamper a horrible mess toss about in the breaker break end of spar viciously pound against the ship 's side the bow have catch seemingly jam in between rock the stern sink deep with cabin port hole barely above reach of the wave it seem probable that any minute the whole helpless mass might slide backward into the water and be sweep away not a living thing appear on board and as the fog slowly drift away my eye could discern no sign of any boat no evidence of the crew along the wide sweep of water little by little as the vista widen and we still remain watch the miserable wreck as though fascinate we be able to distinguish the dark line of coast to the westward and to determine that the unfortunate _ namur _ have strike at the extremity of a headland whose rocky front have push its way far out to sea a voice not far distant arouse I what be it you say jack ` bout treasure on the old hooker hell if it be there why not get it afore it be too late it be thar all right ole and i know the speaker to be haine be not it mr carlyle yes lad there must be money on board unless those fellow take it with they in the boat i know of fifty thousand pound steal in virginium and no doubt there be more than that perhaps they take the swag along with 'em sir that would not be the way i would figure it break in watkin that nigger say the boat what attack we be the last one ter git away a ' thar wa 'n' t no chest in she if manuel do not stay aboard long ` nough ter git he finger outer thet gold none ov the other do they wus so damned anxious to save they life they never think ov nuthin ' else sir but maybe they 'll think about that later a ' cum back insist haine press forward be not that right sir right enough only they will not have much time to think it over from the look of thing out there i answer the bark be liable to slide off that rock any minute and go down like a stone what do you say bully here be a risky job but a pocket full of gold piece if we can get aboard and safely off again who 'll go across with I there be a babel of voice the man crowd about I all else forget as the lust of greed grip they imagination stand back lad i can not use all of you four will be enough i choose haine harwood ole hallin and pierre lower that starboard quarter-boat you four and see to the plug and oar no watkin i want you to remain in charge here there be plenty to do get those body overboard first and clean up this litter then shake out the reef in the foresail and stand by -- there be wind come from that cloud yonder and no time to waste you 'll not lose anything of what we bring back it 'll be share and share alike so fall too hearties shall we lower away sir ay if all be fast i 'll be with you in a minute get aboard ole and ward she off with a boat hook easy now till she take water i pause a instant to speak to dorothy seat on the flag locker explain to she swiftly my object in explore the wreck and pledge myself not to be reckless in attempt to board i read fear in she eye yet she say nothing to dissuade I and we hand clasp as i lead she to the side where she could look down at the cockleshell toss below it will mean much if we can recover this pirate hoard i whisper freedom and a full pardon i hope yes i know geoffry but do not venture too much you be more to I than all the gold in the world i shall not forget sweetheart the sky and sea be almost clear now and you can watch we from here in a short time we shall be safely back again i slip down a rope and drop into the boat take my place with a steer oar at the stern and we shoot away through the green water the man yet line the rail watch we enviously although watkin ' voice begin roar out order dorothy wrave she hand which i acknowledge by lift my cap the schooner with she sharp cutwater and graceful proportion make so fair a sea picture outline against the blue haze i find it difficult to remove my gaze but finally my thought concentrate on the work ahead and i turn to urge the oarsman to a quicker stroke the distance be greater than i have suppose it to be from the deck of the _ santa marie _ nor do the dark cloud slowly poke up above the sea to the southeast ease my anxiety to get this task over with before a storm break the _ namur _ prove to be a more complete wreck than we distant view have reveal and lie in a more precarious position while the sea be not high or dangerous beyond the headland the charge billow there break in foam and be already play havoc with the stranded vessel smash great spar entangled amid canvas and cordage about so as to render we approach extremely perilous we be some time seek a place where we might make fast but finally nose we way in behind the shelter of a huge boom hold steady by a splinter of rock until harwood get the hank of he boat hook in the after-chain and hang on it be no pleasant job get aboard but order haine to accompany I and the other to lie by in the lee of the boom i make use of a dangling backstay and thus haul myself up to a reasonably secure foot the fellow join I breathless and together we perch on the rail to gain view of the deck it be a distressing hopeless sight the vessel rise before we like the roof of a house the deck plank stove in a horrible jumble of run rigging boom and spar block the way forward aft it be clearer the top-hamper of the after mast have fall overboard smash a small boat as it fall but leave the deck space free there be three body tangle in the wreckage within we sight crush out of all human resemblance and the face of a negro catch beneath the ruin of the galley seem to grin back at I in death every timber groan as the wave strike and rock the sodden mass and i have no doubt but that the vessel have already break in two i hear haine utter a oath by god sir do you ever see the like she can not hang on here not long surely i admit a bit more sea and she break into kindle wood if there be any salvage aboard my man it will be do in the next twenty minute there be no hope o ' gittin ' forrard sir -- look at that damn litter a ' -- a ' they dead man it be not forward we need to go haine it be aft into the cabin and that seem a clear enough passage -- only the water down there may be too deep let 's make a try of it he be evidently reluctant but sailor enough to follow as i lower myself to the deck clinging hard to keep my footing on the wet incline a light spar have lodge here and by make this a species of bridge we creep as far as the companion the door of which be open and gain view of the scene below the light be sufficient to reveal most of the interior from the confusion and dampness the entire cabin have evidently be deluge with water but this have largely drain away leave a mass of wreckage behind and a foot or two still slush about the door of the after stateroom it be a dismal hole in the dim light more like a cave than the former habitation of man but present no obstacle to we entrance and i lead the way down the stair grip the rail to keep from fall haine swear as he follow and he continual growling get upon my nerve stop that infernal noise i order shortly look he savagely in the face i have have enough of it you be wild to come on this job now do you work like a man try that room door over there slide down you fool the water be not deep wait a minute now give I a hand be the gold in here sir he ask with interest more than likely this be the captain 's room see if it be leave lock the door give but it require we combined effort to press it open against the volume of water slushing about within while the stern port be yet slightly above the sea level the crest of break wave obscure the glass leave the interior darker than the outer cabin for a moment my eye could scarcely recognize the various object as i clung to the frame of the door and stare blindly about in the gloom then slowly they assume shape and substance screw to the deck the furniture retain its place but everything else be jam in a mass of wreckage or else float about in a foot of water deepen toward the stern there be two chest in the room one of which i instantly recognize as that of roger fairfax the sight of this make I oblivious to all else urge on as i be by a desire to escape from the doomed wreck as soon as possible there be the chest we want haine i cry point it out have the lad back the boat up to this port then come down and help I handle it he do not answer or move and i whirl about angrily what be the matter with you do you hear what i say yes sir he voice tremble but -- but be not that a man over there -- in the bunk good god sir look at he the white ghastly face stare at we look like nothing human in that awful twilight i actually think it a ghost until with desperate effort the man lift himself cling with gaunt finger to the edge of the bunk then i know sanchez you those damn coward leave you here to die no one come for I he answer choke so the word be scarcely intelligible be that what have happen the bark be wreck the crew go yes they take to the boat -- manuel with they manuel he enunciation clearer from passion the sneak cur but i can not see you face who be you and what bring you here i 'll tell you frankly captain sanchez and i step closer we risk come aboard to save that chest -- roger fairfax 's chest -- before it go down this vessel have its back broken and may slide off into deep water at any minute we must get you out of here first get I out he laugh hideously you pretend to place my safety ahead of that treasure to hell with you help i want none of it i be a dead man now and the easiest way to end all will be to go down with the ship -- ` twill be a fit coffin for black sanchez by god i know you now -- geoffry carlyle yes but a enemy no longer that be for I to say i hate you race you breed you cursed english strain the very sound of you name drive I mad i accept no rescue from you damn you take you gold and go but why i insist shock at the man 's violence i have do you no ill be it because i interfere between you and dorothy fairfax he laugh again the sound so insane haine grip my sleeve in terror that chit bah what do i care for she but as a plaything no my hate run deeper than that how come you here -- in the boat steal from the _ namur _ no captain sanchez the day after we leave the ship we board a schooner find adrift the crew stricken with cholera with not a man leave alive on deck or below she lie yonder now a schooner what name the _ santa marie _ -- a slaver merciful god and he eye fairly blaze into mine as he suddenly force he body upward in the bunk the _ santa marie _ adrift the crew dead from cholera and the captain -- paradillum franci paradillum -- what of he he lay alone on a divan in the cabin -- dead also he try to speak but fail he finger claw at he throat when he finally gain utterance once more it be but a whisper tell I he beg there be no woman with he i stare back into the wild insanity of he eye try to test my word suddenly aware that we be upon the edge of tragedy perhaps uncover the hidden secret of this man 's life there be no woman i say gravely on deck or in the cabin what mean you by say that there be one on board do not lie to I in a hour i be dead -- but first tell I the truth do the woman live no she die before we find she body in a chest preserve by some devilish indian art richly dress and deck with jewel english i judge she so but with dark hair and eye you know she in the name of all the fiend yes and i know she end he kill she -- paradillum kill she -- because she be as false to he as she have be to I hell but it be strange you should be the one to find she -- to bring I this tale geoffry carlyle why what be it to I because she be of you line -- do you know she now no nor believe it true then i will make you ` tis naught to I anymore for i be dead within the hour you go back to england and tell he tell the duke of bucclough how he precious sister die he sister good god you can not mean that woman be lady sara carlyle who should know better than i sneeringly once i be call in england sir john collinswood he sink back exhaust struggle for breath but with eye glowing hatred i know it all now the dimly remembered story come vividly back to memory here then be the ending of the one black stain on the family honor of we race on this strange coast three thousand mile from its begin the final curtain be be ring down the drama finish the story have come to I in whisper from other never even speak about by those of we race -- a wild headstrong girl a secret marriage a duel in the park she brother desperately wound and then the disappearance of the pair ten day later it be know that sir john collinswood have default in a large sum -- but from that hour england know he no more as though the sea have swallow they both man and woman disappear leave no trace behind the face i gaze dumbly into be draw and white with pain yet the thin lip grin back at I in savage derision you remember i see he snarl then to hell with you out of here geoffry carlyle leave I to die in peace the gold be there take it and my curse upon it hurry now -- do you hear the bark grate on the rock it be near the end chapter xxxiii before the governor the sound startle I i imagine i hear the keel slip yet before we have reach the door open on deck the slight movement cease my hand grip the frightened haine tell they in the boat to do as i say then come back here my god sir she be a goin ' down not for some minute yet there be thousand of pound in that chest you have risk life for less many a time jump my man the boat lay in close bob up and down dangerously yet hold firmly beneath the open port pierre warped she in with a rope 's end leave the other two free to receive the box as we cautiously pass it out within grasp of they hand it be heavy enough to tax the strength of two man to handle it but of a size and shape permit its passage sanchez have raise himself again and clung there to the edge of the bunk watch we even in the darkness cause by the chest obscure the port i feel the insane glare of he eye fasten upon I once he attempt to speak but he voice fail he now let down easy lad i call no place it amidship get it even or you go over wrap you line about the thwart pierre and take a hand ay that be better watch out now we 'll drop this end -- lord but i think it be go fix it to ride steady and stand by -- we 'll pass a wounded man out to you i step across to sanchez slushing through the water and barely able to keep my foot no matter who the brute be he could not be leave there to die like a rat alone willingly or not the fellow must be remove before the bark go down he see I come and draw back he ghastly face like a mask no you do not -- damn you carlyle he snap angrily keep you hand off I so you want I to die with my neck in a noose do you well you 'll never see that sight i be bear a gentleman and by god i 'll die like one -- and go down with my ship get out of here now -- both of you you will not hell 's fire but you will or else die here with I i 'll give you a minute to make you choice he leave no doubt as to he mean he purpose from somewhere beneath the blanket the long black muzzle of a pistol look straight into my eye the hand hold it be firm the face fronting I savagely sardonic i would like to kill you carlyle he hiss hatefully by god i do not know why i should not the devil in hell would laugh if i do -- so do not tempt I too far get out of here damn you every time i look at you i see she face if you take a step nearer i pull the trigger -- go i hear haine scramble back up the sharp incline of deck and realize the utter uselessness of attempt to remain any instant might be we last the man craze and probably die would kill I gladly he have choose he fate -- what be it to I i turn and work my way upward to the companion step half expect every instant to be strike by a bullet from behind at the door i pause to glance below through the semi-darkness i could see he eye glare at I like those of a wild beast you refuse still to let I aid you sanchez to hell with you leave I alone it be a hard pull back to the _ santa marie _ for the sea have grow noticeably heavier while the weight of the chest sink the boat so deeply in the water as to retard progress and keep one man bail the cloud in the southwest have already assume threatening proportion and i urge the oarsman to greater exertion anxious to get aboard before the come storm break it be hard to keep my gaze from the doomed _ namur _ but i could detect no change in she position as we draw in toward the wait schooner harwood alone question I and i tell he briefly what have occur within the cabin and he comment seem to voice the sentiment of the other he make a bloomin ' good choice sir that be how the ol' devil ought ter die -- the same way he be send many another it beat hangin ' at that dorothy greet I first and we stand close together at the rail as the man hoist the chest on deck and then fasten the tackle to the boat she say nothing ask nothing but she hand cling to my arm and whenever i turn toward she we eye meet i do not find the courage to tell she then what we have find aboard the _ namur _ although i could not prevent my own eye from wander constantly toward the doomed vessel the rise sea be slapping the submerge stern with increase violence the salt spray rise in cloud over the after rail watkin approach we come from among the group of sailor forward there be a smart bit of wind in those cloud sir he say respectfully a ' i do not like the look o ' the coast ter leeward shall we trim sail not quite yet watkin it will be some time before the gale strike here the bark be go down presently yes sir but the man better stand by he glance from my face to that of the girl lower he voice harwood tell I sanchez be aboard sir and refuse to leave very true but he be die no doubt be dead by now there be nothing to be do for he i should say not mr carlyle i would not lift a finger ter save he frum hell there be a sudden cry forward and a voice shout there she go bucky that damn dutchman 's do with that be the last o ' the _ namur _ i turn swiftly my hand grasp she finger as they cling to the rail with a rasping sound clearly distinguish across the intervene water as though every timber cry out in agony to the strain the battered hulk slide downward the deck break amidship as the stern splash into the depths then that also topple over leave nothing above water except the blunt end of a broken bow-sprit and a tangle of wreckage toss about on the crest of the wave i watch breathlessly unable to utter a sound i could only think of that stricken man in the cabin those wild eye which have threaten I he be go now -- go watkin speak it be all over sir yes there be nothing to keep we here any longer i answer still daze but realize i must arouse myself shake out the reef in you mainsail and we 'll get out to sea who be at the wheel schmitt sir -- what be the course captain carlyle nor ` west by nor ' and hold on as long as you can ay ay sir nor ` west by nor ' she be i yet hold dorothy 's hand tightly clasp in my own and the depths of she uplifted eye question I we will go aft dear and i will tell you the whole story i say gently for now we be homeward bind \* \* \* \* \* i write these few closing line a year later in the cabin of the _ ocean spray _ a three master full to the hatch with a cargo of tobacco bind for london and a market dorothy be on deck eagerly watch for the first glimpse of the chalk cliff of old england i must join she presently yet linger below to add these final sentence there be after all little which need to be say the voyage of the _ santa marie _ north prove uneventful and after that first night of storm the weather hold pleasant and the sea fairly smooth i have some trouble with the man but nothing serious as watkin and harwood hold as i do and the pledge of dorothy 's influence bring courage i refuse to open the chest believe we safety and chance of pardon would depend largely on we hand this over in good faith to the authority watkin and i guard it night and day until the schooner round the cape and come into the chesapeake no attempt be make to find quarter below the entire crew sleep on deck dorothy comfortable on the flag locker it be scarcely sunrise on the fifth day when we drop anchor against the current of the jame we sail furl and the red english color fly from the peak two hour later the entire company be in the presence of the governor where i tell my story gravely listen to supplement by the earnest plea of the young woman i shall never forget that scene or how breathlessly we await the decision of the great man who so closely watch we face they be surely a strange rough group as they stand thus hat in hand wait to learn they fate shaggy-haired unshaven largely scum of the sea never before in such presence shuffling uneasily before he glance feeling to the full the peril of they position they eye turn to I questioningly opposite we behind a long table sit the governor dignified austere he hair powdered and face smoothly shave while on either side of he be those of he council many of the face stern and
