the mexican 's church in the southwest dr joe carbrook do such work as this in china the genesis of the experiment after year of wait for time and place and person the rev walter drury a average methodist preacher be ready to begin he experiment the process of get adjust to its condition be end he believe that if he have health and nothing happen to he mind he might count on at least eight year more at first church delafield -- a ten-year pastorate be nothing wonderful in to-day 's methodism the right preacher make he own time limit he would not think himself too good for delafield but neither do he rate himself too low he just feel that he be reasonably secure against promotion and that he need not be afraid of demotion there be such man they be a boon to bishop the unforeseen be to be reckon with of course the possible shatter of all he plan by some unimagined misfortune but the man who wait until he be secure against the unknown never discover anything not even himself walter drury have at last find he man or rather he boy here in delafield it be necessary to the experiment that its subject should be a decent young fellow not particularly keen on formal religion but well set-up in body and mind clean straight and able to use the brain he have when need arise john wesley jr be such a boy would the result be worth what he be put into the venture that would depend on one 's standard the church do not doubt that the more than twice ten year ' experiment of helm in the south end of boston have be worth the price and helm have for company a few pioneer in other field who will tell you they have draw good pay in the outcome of they patience still walter drury be a new sort of specialist the thing he have in mind to do have be almost try a thousand time a thousand time it have be begin but so far as he know no one preacher have think to focus every possible influence on a single life through a full cycle of change he mean he work to be intensive : not in degree only but in duration at the end of ten year if then he have not show in result beyond question the direction of the church 's next great advance at least he would have have the measureless joy of the effort no seeming failure could rob he of he reward now do not image this preacher as a dream scattergood he would do as much as any man should that be to say he utmost in he pulpit and he parish the experiment should be no rob of collective peter to pay individual paul but every man have he avocation he recreation you know -- golf rose coin first edition travel walter drury be a confirm bachelor miss both the joy and the demand of home life no recluse but rather a companionable man he care little for what most people call amusement but he care tremendously for the human scene in which he live and work he would be happy in the experiment for its sheer human fascination that it hold a deeper interest that if it succeed it would reveal a untapped reservoir of resource available for the church and the kingdom of god do but make he the more eager to be at it in hard earnest the church to whose work he have joyfully give himself from he youth have grow to be a mighty and a highly complex machine some think it be more machinery than life more organization than organism but walter drury know better it _ be _ a wonderful machine wheel within wheel but there be within the wheel the living spirit of the prophet 's vision partly because the church be so vast and its work of such infinite variety very few of its member know what it do or how or why it be all over the land and in the end of the earth for people join it and they live they life in the cheerful and congenial circle of its fellowship but the planetary sweep of its program and its enterprise be to most of they not even as a tale that be tell they be content to be busy with they own affair and have small curiosity to know what meaning and mystery might be discover out in place they have never explore even though just ` round the corner from the week-by-week activity of the familiar home congregation walter drury at the end of one reasonably successful pastorate have stand bewildered and baffle as he look back over he five year of effort against this persistent and amiable passivity it be not a deliberate sin or he might have denounce it nor a temporary numbness or he might have wait for it to disappear all the more it dismay he at the beginning of he ministry he have set this goal before he that every soul under he care might see as he see and see with he more clearly year by year the church 's great work its true and total business he have not fail as the annual conference reckon failure but he know he have be less than successful the people of he successive appointment be receptive people as church folk go then who be to blame that sermon and book and advocate and picture and high official and frequent great assembly always accomplish something always leave behind they the untouched unmoved majority of the people call methodist it be all this and more of the same sort which at last take shape in drury 's thought and fix the manner and matter of the experiment this boy he have find with a name that might be either prophecy or mockery he would study like a book he would brood over he life mind you he would take no advantage use no influence unfairly he would neither dictate nor drive he would not trespass even so far as to the outer edge of the boy 's free personality for the most part he would stay in the background but he would watch the boy as for lesser outcome darwin watch the creature of wood and field without reveal all he purpose he would set before this boy good and evil the lesser good and the greater he would use for high and holy end the method which the tempter never tire of use for confusion he would show this boy the kingdom of the child of god and the glory of they and would promise they to he not for a moment 's shame but for a life 's devotion as to the particular form in which the result of the experiment might appear he care little he have a certain curiosity on the subject naturally but he know well enough that the experiment would be useless if he lay interfere hand on its inner process that would be like trim a whitethorn tree in a formal garden to make it resemble a pyramid he be not make a thorn pyramid in a italian garden he want a oak to grow by the common road of all man 's life and oak must grow oak-fashion or not at all \* \* \* \* \* four year of the ten have pass that part of the history of john wesley jr which be tell in the follow page be the story of the other six year chapter i a institute panorama if anybody expect I to stay away from institute this year he have get a surprise come that be all the meeting be just break up after a speech whose closing word have be a shade less tactful than the occasion call for but the last two sentence of that speech make all the difference in the world to john wesley jr the epworth league of first church delafield be give one of its fairly frequent social the program have go at top speed for more than a hour all that noise could do re-enforced by that peculiar emanation by youth term pep have be draw upon to glorify a certain forthcoming event with whose name everybody seem to be familiar for all call it simply the institute pennant poster and photograph supply a sort of pictorial noise the better to advertise this evidently remarkable event which one might gather be a yearly affair hold during the summer vacation at the seat of cartwright college the yell and song the cheer and game and reminiscence re-enforce the noisy decoration at the last in one of those intense moment of quiet which young people can produce as by magic come a neat little speech whose purpose be highly praiseworthy but to john wesley jr it end on the wrong note another listener take mental exception to it though he anxiety prove to be groundless it be a recruiting speech direct at anybody and everybody who have not yet decide to attend the institute the speaker be if anything a trifle more cautious than canny when he come to he in conclusion and he zeal touch the word with anti-climax of course he say since ten or at most twelve be we quota we be not quite free to encourage the attendance of everybody particularly of we younger member they have hardly reach the age where the institute could be a benefit to they and they natural inclination to make the week a period of good time and mere pleasure would seriously interfere with the interest of other more mature and serious mind now the pastor of the church the rev walter drury would have put that differently he say to himself if it produce any bad effect it would need to be correct certainly just then amid the inevitable applause and the dismissal of the brief formal assembly for the social half-hour something snap inside of john wesley jr and it be the feeling of it which prompt he to say if anybody expect I to stay away from institute this year he have get a surprise come that be all you see john wesley jr have just be graduate from high school and he family expect he to go to college in the fall though he face that expectation without much enthusiasm he feel he new freedom he address he rebellious remark to the league president marcium dayne a sensible girl whom he have know as long as he have know anybody in the church last year everybody say i be too young they all talk the way he do just now but they can not say i be too young now and with that easy skill which be one of the secret of youth he manage to contemplate himself serenely conscious that he be personable and right the girl turn to he with a gesture of surprise but i think you father have agree to let you take that trip to chicago you have be save up for will he let you go to the institute too chicago can wait say john wesley jr grandly dad do say i could go to chicago to see my cousin or i could go anywhere else that i want well i be go to the institute it be my money and besides i be tire of be tell i be too young a fellow 's get to grow up some time that be all right say marcium but what be you special interest in the institute do you truly want to go how do you know what a institute be like she voice carry further than marcium thought and a man who seem a little too mature to be one of the young people turn toward she he be smile and any time these four year the town would have tell you there be not a friendlier smile inside the city limit he be in business dress and suggest anything but the parson in he bearing but through and through he look the good minister that he be marcium move toward he with a unspoken appeal she want help he be wait for that signal for he depend a good deal on marcium and he be still worry about that unlucky speech well marcium be you tell jw what the institute really be he ask no mr drury i be not i be too much surprised at find that he be about decide to go you be just in time to tell he for I i want he to get it right and straight well the pastor respond i be glad of that if he be really go he 'll find out that definition be not description now we saint sheridan use to say that a institute be a combination of college circus and camp meeting i would venture a different put of it a institute be a bit of young democracy in action its people play together for play 's sake and for find they honest human level they study together to become decently intelligent about some of the real business of the kingdom of god and how the church propose to transact that business they wait for new vision together the institute be a good time and a good place for see life clear and see it whole yes say marcium that be exactly it only i never could have find quite the right word do you think jw will find it too poky and preachy tell he to try it and see as you do last year say pastor drury i 'll risk that say john wesley jr in he newly resolute mood he know when to stop this preacher particularly concern as he be about john wesley jr he see that this be one of the many time when that young man would need to work thing out for himself marcia would give what help might be call for at the moment the boy be turn toward the institute so far so good to-night be nearly four year from the beginning of he interest in this young fellow with the methodist name he be a special friend of the family though no more so than of every family in the town which give he the slightest encouragement to a degree which no one suspect he share this family 's secret hope for its son and heir and he cherish hope which even the farwell could not suspect unless he be much mistaken he have find the subject for he experiment that mention of the farwell need to be explain of course john wesley jr be only part of the boy 's name in full he be john wesley farwell jr son of john wesley farwell sr of the jw farwell hardware co as a little fellow he have no chance to escape junior since he be name for he father there be many jack and john and johnny about he mother good methodist that she be secretly enjoy call he john wesley jr and before long the neighbor and the neighborhood child follow she example a little later he might have be tease out of it but at the impossible age when boy discover that queer name and red hair and cross-eye make convenient excuse for mutual torture it happen that he have attain to the leadership of he gang for some reason he take pride in he two methodist name and make short work of those who venture to take liberty with they in all other respects he play without reserve boyhood 's immemorial game of give and take but as to he name or any part thereof he would tolerate no foolishness and no back talk when he reach the high school period however most of he intimate rarely call he by he full name have like all high school people no time for long name though possess of infinite leisure for long dream straightway they shorten he name to jw which to this day be all that he friend find necessary very well then this be jw at eighteen a young fellow worth know take a look at he impulsive generous not what you would call handsome but possess of a genial eye and a ready tongue a stubby nose and a few scattered freckle a fair student he be yet far from bookishness and he make friend easily of late he have be pay furtive but detailed attention to he hair and he necktie and the hang of he clothes though still in small danger of be mistake for a tailor 's model with such a name you will understand that he be a methodist by first intention bear so he be a pretty sturdy young christian show it in a boy 's modest but direct fashion which even he teammate of the high-school football squad find it no trouble to tolerate because they know he for a human healthy boy and not a morbid self-inspecting religious prig pastor drury you may be sure have take note of all that for he and jw have be fast friend since the day he have receive the boy into the church the morning after the institute social jw announce at breakfast he sudden change of plan if you do not mind dad i have about decide to go to the institute instead of chicago there be a bunch of we go and mr drury will be there uncle henry 's folk might not want to be bother with I now and anyway i do not know they very well but i can go to the institute with the church crowd and there will be tennis and swimming and plenty of other fun besides the big program which be quite a speech for j w john wesley sr do not know much about the institute but he have a endless regard for he pastor and the mother be characteristically willing to postpone she boy 's introduction to the unknown and in she thought therefore the menacing city so after the brief but unhurried devotions at the breakfast table which have come to serve in place of the old-time family prayer parental approval be forthcoming and thus it befall that jw select for himself a future whose every experience be to be affect by so slight a matter as he impulsive choice of a week 's holiday that choice express to he the new freedom of he year for he have not even be conscious of the quiet influence which have make it easier than he know to decide as he have do \* \* \* \* \* it be a mixed and lively company that find itself crowd around the registrar 's table at the institute one Monday evening in July with j w and he own particular chum martin luther shenk better know as marty right in the middle of it jw wonder where so many epworthian could have come from do they really hanker after the institute or have they come for reason as trivial as he own he put the question to martin luther shenk marty do you reckon these be all here for real epworth league work or do the institute want anybody and everybody marty have be scout a little and he answer : no to both question i should say some have come just to be come and other seem to be here for business but i see joe carbrook just now and if he be a epworth leaguer i be the prince of puget sound you know how he stand at home wonder what he come for just then joe carbrook himself come up he be from delafield too member of the same league chapter as the two chum but he have rarely condescend to league affair have have two rather variegated year at college he feel he must show he sophistication by hold himself above some of those simple old observance s ` pose you be here for solemn and serious work you two he remark mockingly as he see the boy i just meet marcium dayne and she tell I you be register well i be here too -- drive up in my car -- but you do not catch I tie myself down to all that study stuff i be look for fun not work nothing new for you in that joe say marty but i should think you might try the study stuff if only for a change after you have spend good money on gas and tire and you have to pay for you meal you know well i study hard enough last month in college cram for the final exam so i could get within gunshot of enough sophomore credit and i be through with study for a while if i find a few live one in this crowd i guess we can enjoy ourselves without interfere with any of you grind if you must study and joe carbrook go off in search of he live one jw and marty be in no hurry to register the crowd milling around in the office be interesting and jw be still wonder how many of they himself include would get enough institute long before the week be over besides it be yet a hour before supper think of it marty all these people come from epworth league just like ours from springfield and wolf prairie and madison and all over this part of the state what for i would like to know will you look at those pennant wish we have bring one or two of ours we could add to the display anyway i have two in my suitcase say marty we 'll have they out this evening at the introduction meeting and maybe you 'll find out ` what for ' by that time the introduction meeting in the chapel after supper be for the most part informal yell and song and the wave of pennant punctuate the proceedings as be quite the proper thing in a epworth league gather some people who see only what be on the surface can not wholly understand the exuberance of a epworth league crowd but it have root in something very real the dean of the institute manage amid the roystering and the interval of attention to set thing up for the week a few regulation would need to be lay down and these would be fix not by the faculty or by the dean but by the student council would each district group please get together at once and select some one to represent the group on this council this request be obey amid considerable confusion with marcium dayne appoint from the fort adam district and the council excuse to draft the basic law for the week the faculty be introduce one by one each teacher be give the opportunity to describe he or she course so that out of the eight or nine course offer every delegate might select two besides the two which be require of all student and so qualify for a institute diploma jw find himself enjoy all this hugely it appeal to he grow sense of freedom from schoolboy restraint if he do go to any of the class it appear that he could pick the one he like up to now he have entertain no thought of any serious work but the faculty talk about these course make he think there might be worse way of spend the week than qualify for a institute diploma the whole thing seem to be so easy and so friendly of course he could see that the study would not be much even if he sign up for it be just for a week but it might not be bad fun morning watch be a experience to jw he be surprise to find himself stay awake in a before-breakfast religious meeting and be even more surprised to be enjoy it something about this big crowd of young people stir all he pulse and the religion they hear about and talk about seem to jw something very real and desirable he think of himself as a christian but he wonder if he christian life might not become more confident and productive in this atmosphere one almost feel that anything be possible meal time turn out to be time of orderly disorder jw and he friend be at a table with other group from the fort adam district and he quickly master the raucous roar which serve the district for a yell before the end of the second day he alert good nature make he cheer leader and thereafter he rarely have time to eat all that be set before he though possess of a boy 's healthy appetite it be simply that the other possibility of the hour seem more alluring than mere food from the first day of the class work jw find himself keen for all that be go on there be variety enough so that he feel no weariness and the range of new interest open up each day keep he at constant and pleasurable attention without know just how he be catch the institute spirit he walk away from the dining hall one noon with he pastor-friend and he talk he have to talk to somebody and walter drury contrived to know of he need why mr drury he say eagerly i be just find out how little i know about the church and real christian work i think i be something of a average methodist boy but if the people at home be no better than i be i can see how be a preacher to such a bunch be a man 's job correct jw say the minister i find that out many a time to my humbling but honestly now be you learn thing you never know before ye-e i be jw answer and then again i be not it seem to I as if i have always know a lot of what we be get in these class though there be plenty of new stuff too but until now i do not get much out of what i know i have always like to hear you but you be different as for most of the thing i have hear i just think of it as religious talk church stuff you know it do not seem to matter but here it be begin to matter in all sort of way and i can see that it matter to I how for instance well take the class in home mission americanization they call it maybe you notice that the first thing the teacher do be to divide the class right down the middle and tell those on the left hand -- yes i be one of the goat -- that for the rest of the week they be to consider themselves alien the other be to play native-born american and so the study start but believe I we alien have already begin to make it interesting for those native some of 'em want to come over on we side already but they can not a few of we have find some immigration dope in the college library and it be pretty strong we 'll show up those pilgrim father before the week be out they think they have do everything a alien could ask when they let he into the country and then they work he twelve hour a day seven day a week or else let he hunt the country over for any sort of a job they rob he by make he pay higher price than other people for all he have to buy they force he to live in place not fit for rat and on top of everything else they call he name so that they kid stick up they nose at he child in the school grounds after all that they expect he 'll become a good citizen just by hear ` the star-spangled banner ' at the movie and watch the flag go by when there be a parade say mr drury it make I sick and if i feel that way just to be pretending i be a ` wop ' for a week how do you suppose the real alien feel excuse I for talk like this but honestly something like that be go on in all these class i wish we could take up such thing in the league at home and he force a embarrassed little laugh pastor drury laugh too and say of course they could as he link arm with jw and they pass on down the road the preacher talk but little contrive merely to drop a question now and then and jw talk on half-ashamed to be so gabby as he put it and yet move by a impulse as pleasant as it be novel and foreign mission mr drury you will not be offend i hope but somehow as far back as i can remember i have always connect foreign mission with collection and ` greenland 's icy mountain ' and little naked hottentot and something -- i do not know just what -- about the river gange but here -- why that china class just make I want to see china for myself and find out how much of the advantage of american life over chinese have come on account of religion well why not jw maybe you will go to china some day and have a hand in it all suggest the pastor to try he out the boy shake he head no i do not think so i be certainly get a new line on foreign mission but i do not think there be missionary stuff in I i 'll have to go at the proposition some other way then pastor drury set he go on another subject what do you think of the young folk who be here he ask well at first i think they be all away ahead of we bunch at home and some of they be but you soon find out that the majority be pretty much of the same sort as ours i think i have spot a few slacker but mighty few most of the crowd seem to be all right and i have already make some real friend but do you know which one of they all be the most interesting fellow i have meet the pastor think he do but he merely ask who why that greek boy phil khami he be from salonika you know he know the old country like a book and he be go back some day maybe to be some kind of missionary to he people in the very place where the apostle paul preach honest i never know until he tell I that he salonika be the town of those christian to whom paul write two of he letter those to the thessalonian -- ` thessalonika ' you know well you ought to hear phil talk he come over here seven year ago and learn the english language from the preacher at westvale yes i have hear about he say mr drury they say he live in the parsonage and pay the preacher for he english lesson by give he a new understanding of the greek new testament not many of we have find out yet how to get such pay for be decent to we friend from the other side well he be a thoroughbred anyway and do you notice how he be right up in front when there be anything do the only way you can tell he be not american bear be that he be so anxious to help out on all the unpleasant work when i look at phil it make I boil to think of fellow like he be call ` wop ' by this time the two have swing back into the campus and jw find himself draft to hold down second base in the faculty-student ball game but that be a story for other to tell on the step of the library marcium dayne and some other girl be hold a informal reception joe carbrook with one or two of he friend be find it agreeable to assume a superior air concern the institute the impression the boy give be that they come to the institute at all have be a great concession but that they be under no illusion about the place all this be all right joe be say for those who need it but what be the good of it all to we for instance what do you get out of it marcium what do you think i want to get out of it if you care for the young people 's work at home i should think you could see how ` all this ' as you call it would help you to do better work and more of it at delafield as you ought to know pretty well marcium joe reply back home they think i do not care much for the young people 's work it be a little too prim and ready-to-wear for I if you 'll excuse I for say so no fun in it at all though i 'll admit some of the class here have more life in they than i look for one of the other girl who know he well enough to speak with large frankness come to the defense of they all say : well joe i do not see that you get very far with what you call fun it be mostly at the expense of other people include you father who pay the bill besides since you come home from college this spring you seem to have run out of nearly all the bright idea you start with i wonder if it ever strike you that be a sport as you call it be mostly be a nuisance to everybody some of we long ago get over think you clever and original you must be get over it yourself by now surely many thanks dear lady for they kind word joe respond as he bow low in mock acknowledgment you make yourself quite plain miss alma wetherell he fling back the insult jauntily as he and he companion move on but at least one of the group suspect that the word have strike home you who know the general secretary could easily forgive jw he delight in the class of which the program say the subject be method this be the only hour in a institute which the epworth league take for its own work rightly enough it be a crowded hour with the whole institute present and usually it be a hour of unflagging interest jw and marty be enjoy they first institute too much to be late at any class they be merely a little earlier at this class to miss any of it would be a distinct loss now what the general secretary talk about be no more than the everyday work of the league -- how it mean the young people of the church and they work for and with young people for the sake of the future but he have a way with he he say the league be a great scheme of self with the ish leave off in the league one practice self-help and enjoy the twin luxury of self-direction and self-expression and come sooner or later to that strange new knowledge which be self-discovery he explain how epworthian as such could live on twenty-four hour a day the plan be a ingenious and yet simple financial arrangement for keep the league work move both where you be and where you be not even around the world he have innumerable story of the devotional meeting idea the win-my-chum idea the stewardship idea the institute idea the life service idea the recreation idea the study-class idea and every other league idea so far invent but all this be merely a hint of what the general secretary mean to the institute and particularly to the delegate from delafield even joe carbrook have be impressed he hear the general secretary the morning after that little exchange of compliment on the library step and for a hour thereafter let himself enjoy the rare luxury of think the result be somewhat disconcerting it be funny say marty as the four of they the other three be joe marcium and jw sit under a tree in the afternoon but i believe that man could make even trigonometry interesting i think i would hear all that could be say about the devotional meeting but do you get that scheme for leader he spring this morning watch I when we get back home that be all you need not suppose you be the only one who get it say marcium everybody be try to watch the general secretary and to take note at the same time and i do not believe you be any quicker at that than the rest of we of course all of we will use as many of he idea as we can remember when we get home again joe carbrook with a new seriousness which sit awkwardly on he confess that he could not understand just what be happen it be evident that he be ill at ease marcium have notice it every time she have see he since that encounter with alma wetherell i guess you folk know i be not easily catch but i be ready to admit that man have hold of something yes and i be half convinced that this institute have hold of something i wish i know what it be if i could really believe that all i hear and see at this place be part of be young and part of be a christian i might be think before long about get into the game myself the trouble be you three and the other leaguer i have watch at home be just you three and the other and that be all i know and you know what you can do you 'll take all these idea of league work and use they maybe but what i can not see be how you will pick up the big idea of this place and get back home without lose it we can not say marcium not without all sort of help visible and invisible you for instance if you would really get into the game as you say nobody could guess how much it would mean to we league and it might mean more to you marcium 's right about that say jw the big idea of this place that you speak of be a lot too big for we to take home alone maybe you 'll think i be preach but i do not care if i say that for god to handle alone it be not big enough he make the star and give we he son without any help from we nobody else can do that but he will not make we league at home a success without we and all of we together can not do it without he i be not say i know how to do it even then but that be the way it look to I why joe he say with sudden intensity as he face joe carbrook if you ever get hold of the big idea and the big idea get hold of you something be sure to happen something bigger than any of we can figure out now i know you have it in you all four show a surprised self-consciousness over jw 's unexpected venture into these rather deeper conversational water than usual and there be more surprise when joe carbrook begin to talk about himself he laugh to hide a touch of embarrassment but with little mirth and then he say well jw that be not all foolishness though i do not see why you should pick on I why not marty of course i come here for fun and i have have some though not just the sort i expect and i have have several jolt too i might as well admit that if i could just only see how you hitch all of this league and church business to real life i would be for it with all i have get the trouble be while i have never be especially proud of my own record neither have i see much excuse yet for what you ` active member ' have be busy with i have be play my way and you have be play yours but it all seem mostly play to I all the same i guess i be get tired of my kind if joe could ever have speak wistfully you might have suspect he of it just then clearly think marcium dayne in the silence that follow something big be already happen but how to help it on she could not tell so with a desperate effort to do the right thing she contrived to turn the subject it seem to she it have become too difficult to go further just now without peril to joe 's strange new interest as well as to a very new and tremulous little hope that have begin to sing in she own heart the shift of the talk be a true institute change and would have be most disconcerting to anyone unfamiliar with the way of young christian but marcium be sure that what have be say would not be forget and she know there would be another time it be this that make she say i wish you boy would suggest what sort of stunt we district should give on stunt night you know the time be get short that be a fact exclaim marty sit up stunt night be to-morrow and we delegation have to fix up the stunt for the fort adam district let 's get to work on something we have be moon long enough for though marty never think as quickly as marcium he too feel some instinct of fear lest by a unfortunate word they should break the spell of joe carbrook 's interest in the big idea and promptly the four be deep in a study of stunt to the uninitiated stunt night at the institute be without rime or reason but not to those in charge who be look ahead to Sunday they know that the converging and cumulative psychic force which the institute invariably produce must be temper along about midway of the week by some sharp contrast in the communal life otherwise the group like over-trained athlete will grow emotionally stale before the week be do and at the end of that be let-down and flatness hence stunt night in the early institute year it be easy as in some place it still be for stunt night to be no more than clown witless and cheap but there be a distinct tendency to exercise the imagination in produce more self-respecting effort cartwright happily be one of the forward-looking institute and stunt night crowd with most excellent fooling produce two or three creditable and thought-provoking performance one of they deserve remember for its own sake besides it be a part of this story the home mission class furnish the inspiration for it and call it scum o ' the earth a impromptu immigration pageant a boy who have memorize schauffler 's poem stand off stage and recite it while group after group of immigrant in the motley of the steerage pass slowly through the improvise elli island sift process it be all make-believe of course all but one tense moment then phil khami step on the platform incarnate in he own proper person the poet 's apostrophised greek boy : stay be we do you wrong young fellow from socrate ' land you like a herme so lissome and strong fresh from the master praxitele ' hand so you be of spartan birth descend perhaps from one of the band -- deathless in story and song -- who comb they long hair at thermopyla 's pass ah i forget the strait alas more tragic than theirs more compassion-worth that have doom you to march in we ` immigrant class ' where you be nothing but ` scum o ' the earth ' the audience be catch unaware it have be vastly interested in the spectacle as a spectacle the more because the unusual americanization class which produce it have attract general attention but phil khami everybody 's friend standing there a immigrant of the immigrant smile he wistful friendly smile be a picture as dramatic as it be unexpected first there be ejaculation of astonishment and surprise then come the moment of understanding and a shining-eyed stillness fall on all then what a shout jw lead off the unashamed tear fall from he brimming eye on Saturday morning jw be sit beside phil khami at morning watch the leader have ask for answer to the question why do i come to the institute get several response of the conventional sort suddenly phil nudge jw and whisper shall i tell why i come and jw with the memory of stunt night 's thrill not yet dull say promptly sure go ahead when phil get up a attentive silence fall upon they all the greek boy have make many friend as much by he engaging frankness and anxiety to learn as by he perpetual eagerness to have a hand in every bit of hard work that turn up since the stunt night incident he be everybody 's favorite friend he say in he rather careful precise way i be here for a different reason than any when i be in america but a little time a methodist preacher make himself my friend i could not speak english only a few word he take I to he home he teach I to talk the american way he find I other friend though i could do nothing at all for they to pay they back now i be christian -- real not only baptize the young people of the church take I in to whatever they do they call I ` phil ' and never care that i be a foreigner so when i hear about this institute i say to myself ` it be something strange to I but i hear that many people like those in my church will be there ' i can not quite believe that but it sound good and i want to come and see and now i know that many people be young people like those i first know they treat I just the same it make I love america much more and if i could tell my people in the old country that all this good have come to I from the church they could not believe it still it be true everything i have to-day have come to I by goodness of christian people there be some half-embarrassed amen and more than one hitherto unsuspected cold require considerable attention all the way to breakfast phil hold embarrassed court while he hand be shake and he shoulder be thump and he be tell solo and chorus by all who could get near he that he be all right -- who be all right phil khami but jw be walk slowly toward the dining hall alone as he have listen to phil at first he think good old scout he be put it over but by the time the greek 's simple word be end jw be look himself straight in the eye young fellow he be say you have come mighty near feeling glad that you have have so many more advantage than this stranger and yet can not you see that what he say about himself be almost as true about you all you have to-day -- this institute you religion you church you friend the kind of a home you have and be so proud of -- everything have come to you by what phil call the goodness of christian people and then it be breakfast time with a imperative call on jw from the fort adam table for that new yell we fix up last night and the minute in which he have talk with himself be for the time forget but the memory of they come back in the day after the institute be itself a memory \* \* \* \* \* the Saturday night camp fire at this institute contrary to the usual custom be not co-ed the boy go down to the lake shore and sit around a big fire on the sand the girl have they fire on the slope of a hill at the other edge of the campus nor do this institute care for too much praise of itself its traditional spirit be to work more for outcome than for the device which produce complacency it stage only a few opportunity of tell why i like this institute so at the camp fire a man talk to the boy and a woman to the girl not about the institute but about life these speaker know the strange effect a institute week have on impressionable and romantic youth they know that by this time score of the student be either say to themselves i have get to do something big before this thing 's over or be vainly try to put the conviction away the woman who talk to the girl happen to be a preacher 's wife this give she a certain advantage when she tell the listen girl that the greatest of all occupation for they be not some special vocation but what ida tarbell have call the business of be a woman it be good preparation for the next day 's program with its specific and glamorous appeal for it put first the great claim so that special vocation could be see in clear air and could be fairly measure pastor drury who talk to the boy be talk to they all as jw very well know but every word seem for he as indeed it be in a sense that he do not suspect he be not surprise that he pastor should present the christian life as effectively livable by bricklayer and business man as surely as by missionary he have hear that before but to jw the old message have a new set a new force and never before have he be so ready to receive it the song have sing themselves out as the fire change from roar flame and fly spark to a great bed of live coal from the world 's begin a glowing hearth have be perfect focus for straight thought and plain speech the boy find it so this night the minister begin so simply that it seem almost as if he voice be only the musing of many just become audible i know say he that to-morrow some of you will find yourselve and will eagerly offer you life for religious calling we shall all be proud of you and glad to see it but most of you can not do that you be already sure that you must be content to live ` ordinary christian life ' it be possible that to-morrow you may feel a little out of the picture and those who be hear a special call might regard you quite unconsciously of course as not exactly on they level now suppose we get this thing straight to-night there be no great nor small no high nor low in real service the difference be only in the form of work you do the quality may be just as fine in one place as in another the boy who go into the ministry or who become a medical missionary will have peculiar chance for usefulness so also will the boy who go into business or farming or teaching or any other so-called secular occupation just because he be not call to religious work as a daily business he dare not think that he have no call god 's calling be not for the few but for the many and just now the man who put he whole soul into be a out-and-out christian in he daily business and in he personal life as a responsible citizen must have the genuine missionary spirit he must live like a prophet that be a messenger from god he must know the christian meaning of all that happen in the world and he must stand for the whole christian program otherwise not all the minister and missionary in the world can save we civilization it be you chance of a great career you who will make up the rank and file of the christian army in the next twenty-five year -- do you know what you be _ you be the hope of the world _ as the group break up in the dim light of the die ember jw stumble into joe carbrook and the two head for the tent together they have be on a much more friendly footing since Thursday say jw say joe abruptly what be the matter with I i come to this place without know just why think i would just have a good time i suppose but here i be be bump up against something new and big every little while until i wonder if it be the same world that i be live in before i come do you suppose anybody else feel that way be it the place or the people or what i do not just know say jw try to keep from show he surprise i feel a good deal that way myself i think it be maybe that this be the first time we have ever be force to look squarely at some of the thing that seem so natural here at home it be easy to dodge you know that only you have dodge one way and i have do it another but do you feel different the way i do jw do you feel like say to yourself : ` looka here joe carbrook quit be a fool see what you could do if you settle down to get ready for something real like be a doctor now ' do _ you _ feel that way you do not know it but i have always think i could be a doctor if i could see anything in it and then the other side of I speak up and say : ` joe carbrook do not kid yourself you know you have not get the nerve to try even if you have the grit to stick it through ' be it that way with you jw you have pay more attention to religion and all that than i ever do and what you say on Thursday about the ` big idea ' have keep I guess ever since no joe my trouble 's not like yours i know i can not be a doctor nor a preacher nor a missionary i have get nothing of that in I but what we hear to-night at the camp fire come straight at I as i try to say the other day if you get the ` big idea ' of the institute christian service look like a great life but I -- i have no hope to be anything particular just one of the crowd and i never quite see until to-night how that might be a great life too as they be parting jw venture a bold suggestion say joe if you think you could be a doctor _ why not a missionary doctor _ joe 's answer be a swift turn on he heel and he stride away with never a word probably make he mad thought jw i wonder why i say it joe 's the last boy in the world to have any such notion but -- well something 's already begin to happen to he that be sure -- and to I too on Sunday the little world of the institute assume a new and no less attractive aspect everybody be dress for Sunday as at home class be over and game also the dining room become for the first time a place of comparative quiet with now and then the singing of a great old hymn just to voice the institute consciousness the morning watch talk have be a little more direct a little more tense and before the bishop 's sermon come the love feast now the methodist of the older generation make much of they love feast but in these day except at the annual conference a occasional institute be almost the only place where it flourish with something of the ancient fervor many change have come to methodism since the great day of the love feast change of custom and thought and speech but you ardent young methodist of any period chaplain mccabe peter cartwright jesse lee captain webb would have understand and glory in this institute love feast it speak they speech we group from delafield will never forget it nearly all of they speak marcium dayne first because she be usually expect to lead in everything of the sort then marty then jw and last of all and most astounding joe carbrook marty look the soldier and he put he confession into military term he speak about he captain and wait for order and a new understanding of obedience before jw get he chance to speak the leader read a night letter from a institute far away convey the greeting of six hundred young people to they fellow epworthian jw could not bring himself to speak in term of personal experience he be still under the spell of last night 's camp fire and he brief encounter with joe carbrook but without quite know what could possibly come of all that and the telegram give he a excuse to speak in another vein you must remember that up to now he have be wholly local in he league interest he have go to no convention he be not a reader of _ the epworth herald _ and to he the central office be as though it have not be i wonder if anybody else feel as i do he say about this league of ours until this last week i never think much about it but we have just hear that telegram from a institute bigger than this a thousand mile off and there be fifty-five or sixty institute go on this year besides the winter institute the convention and all the other gathering we seem to belong to a movement that enroll almost a million young people with all sort of chance to learn how it can do all sort of christian work by actually _ do _ it this be not the only thing i have find out here but it make I want to see the whole league become as good as it be big i do not want to be dazzle by the size of it because i know how many other member be just as little use as i have be only when i get home i hope i be go to be a different sort of a epworthian and i can not help wish that we all feel that way about be more good in the league we can make it a hundred time more useful to the church and to we master many other speak like that some of they because they could find nothing more intimate to say some here and there those who like jw could not quite trust themselves yet to talk of they deeper personal experience and then joe carbrook arise he speak easily as joe always do but it be a new joe carbrook and only the delafield delegation understand how amazing be the change this institute have make I all sort of trouble he say i have nothing else to do and without care anything about it except to get some new fun out of it i come along intend to stir up some of you if i could and i know i could but i have see what a fool i be every day i have see that a little more distinctly and last night just as i be leave one of the boy after the camp fire he say something about what i might do with my life i do not know how seriously he mean it maybe he do not either i go off without answer he there be not any answer except that i know i be not fit even to think about it and then thank god i meet a man who understand what be wrong with I he be we pastor i have not be anything but trouble to he at home but that make no difference to he and he introduce I down yonder by the lake to a friend i have never know before some one infinitely understand infinitely forgiving he show I that before i could find what i ought to be i would have to come to term with that friend and i have whatever happen to I whatever i may find to do i want now and here for the first time in my life to confess jesus christ as my savior and lord the bishop preach a great sermon but it be doubtful whether the delafield delegation rightly appreciate it they be too much occupy with the incredible fact that joe carbrook have be convert and have openly confess it more be to come the afternoon meeting long establish in the institute world as the life work service be in the hand of a few leader who know both its power and peril a invitation would be give for all to declare they purpose who feel call to special christian work the difficulty be to encourage the most timid of those who despite they timidity feel sure of the inner voice and yet prevent a stampede among those who without any depth of desire be in love with emotion and would enjoy be conspicuous if only for the brief moment of the service for once a woman make the address -- a wise woman let it be say who make skillful and sure distinction between the christian life as a life and the work of the christian church as one way of live that life it would have be a successful afternoon in any case but three incident help the speaker when she ask those to declare themselves who have decide for definite christian work young people in all part of the room arise and one after another they speak for the most part simply and modestly of they hope and purpose and joe carbrook be among they he say very little the nub of it be that he have always think of be a doctor but not until a chance remark make by john wesley jr last night have the idea appear to he important just to make one more among the thousand of doctor in america be one thing he say it be quite another to think of be the only physician among a great helpless population but to be a missionary doctor a man have to be first a missionary and how could he be a missionary if he be not a christian well as he have confess at the love feast that be settle last night and as soon as it have be attend to be know there be nothing else in the way so he must work now toward be a medical missionary joe 's declaration stir the whole assembly and while the influence of it be still on they jw see martin luther shenk he classmate and doubly he chum since a memorable day of the precede October get up and quietly announce he purpose of become a minister and i hope say marty that i may find my lifework in some of the new home mission field we have be learn about this week at that point the leader feel more than a little anxious these two decision with all they restraint have in they something infectious and she fear lest some young people not hold themselves perfectly in hand might be move to sentimental and unreflecting declaration if there have be any such danger marcium dayne dispel it she be all aglow with a new joy of she own whose secret none know but herself though one other have almost dare to hope he could guess may i speak she ask i have no decision to make for myself last year i take the ` whatever whenever wherever ' pledge and i intend to keep it though i be not yet sure what it will mean but i know a boy here who will not talk unless somebody ask he and there be a reason why i think he should be ask please may not we hear from john wesley farwell jr about _ he _ kind of a call jw take unaware at the mention of he name be still at a loss when the leader second marcium 's invitation and the knowledge that he be expect to say something unusual do not make for self-control but he understand marcium 's purpose and try to pull himself together miss dayne be president of we home chapter and she have a lot to do with my come to the institute he begin she have hear I talk since i find out a little about the institute and i tell she this morning something of what joe carbrook and i have discuss last night after the camp fire well to get to the point i think she want I to say and i be say it to myself most of all that for nearly all of we young people christian lifework must mean make a honest living do all we can to make we religion count at home and then back up with all we have get by prayer and money and brain all these other like joe carbrook and marty shenk who be go into the hardest place to put up the biggest fight that be in they we have just get to do it or be quitter as phil khami say at morning watch yesterday ` everything we have have come to we by the goodness of christian people ' we be not willing to be the last link of that chain we do not want any special recognition but i hope the bishop and the general secretary and the dean and all the rest of the league leader will know they can count on we just as we know they can count on these friend of ours who have just become life service volunteer nobody know what might have happen if some one have not speak like that but as the group of new volunteer stand about the platform at the close of the meet the other young people instead of wander off and feeling themselves of no significance come crowd about they to say to they boy-and-girl fashion something of what jw 's little speech have suggest out of some four hundred epworthian enrol in the institute about forty have make definite decision but certainly not less than two hundred more have also face the future and in some sort have make a new contract with themselves and with god the institute end there except for a simple vesper service after the evening meal and on Monday morning the whole company be homeward bind the delafield delegation have separate the larger group go home by train but joe carbrook 's insistence be not to be withstand so jw and marty marcium dayne and pastor drury be joe 's passenger for the fifty-odd mile between institute and home they sing they cheer they yell the institute yell they live over the crowded day of the week that have so swiftly pass but most of all they deeply resolve that so far as they could help to do it while they be at home the league chapter of delafield should be make over into something of more use to the church to which it belong it be marty who put they purpose into the fewest word we and the other who have be to the institute do not think we know every little league thing say he and we do not think we be the whole league either but every time anybody in we chapter start anything good he be go to have more and better help than he ever have before which thing come to pass as may one day be record the rev walter drury keep he own counsel but he know that more have happen than the put of new life into the league the experiment have progress safely through some most difficult stage chapter ii john wesley jr 's bring up those word of phil khami at morning watch keep pop into jw 's head in the day follow the institute -- everything i have to-day have come to I by the goodness of christian people i know that must be true he would say to himself but it be worth trace back the preacher be come over to supper one night as he love to do and jw make up he mind to bring phil 's idea into the table talk he be on even better term with the preacher than he use to be jw 's mother have not say much about the institute though she have listen eagerly to all he talk of the crowded week and she be vaguely ill at ease she have hope for something she do not know just what from the institute and she be not yet sure whether she ought to feel disappointed but she provide a fine supper to which the menfolk pay the most practical and sincere of all compliment and since nobody have anything else on for the evening there be plenty of time for talk the mother have a moment aside with the minister and there be a touch of anxiety in she question : do you think the institute help my boy and the pastor have just time to whisper back it help he much but he give even more help than he get you have reason to be proud of he i be he be grow it be not very definite but it bring no small comfort to the mother 's heart this institute idea seem to be everywhere say jw sr to the pastor but how do it get start i use to be in the epworth league but we have nothing like it then that be not so very much of a story say the pastor we have the institute idea because we have to have it and so the league give it form and substance well jw jr chime in i think it be about time more people know about it i have want to ask you to explain it ever since we come back from the institute the pastor nod i know but remember even you be not really interested until you have be at a institute do you think we institute just happen jw i know it do not jw reply somebody do a lot of planning and scheming yes return the pastor but do you notice that a large part of its work touch subject familiar to you the local league activity for instance -- the devotional meeting and mission study and stewardship and the scope of the business meeting which not so long ago elect you to membership yes you be right though i do not see anything remarkable in that it be a league institute be not it certainly but still if there have not be any local chapter there could have be no institute do not you see what i mean be that the institute come because you chapter need it and you need it not because the institute need you it be merely a matter of trace thing back jw jr thought of phil 's word sure enough he respond trace thing back make a lot of difference i have be go over what phil khami say at the morning watch -- you remember how everything he have to-day have come to he by the goodness of christian people at first i think that be no more than a description of he particular case because i know how true it be but when you begin to trace thing back as you say what be true about phil be true about all of we -- anyway about I how be that son mr farwell ask gently well i mean jw smilingly answer she though flush a little too the institute that seem to I something new and different be really tie up to what you folk and the whole church have be do for I as far back as i can remember and so they talk parent and pastor and jw quite naturally and freely of the long chain of interest which have link he life to the church 's life back through all the year to he babyhood jw have be in the league only a year or two but it seem to he that he have be in the church always and the memory of he boyhood which have the church for center be intimately interweave with all he other experience as he father say i guess pastor if you try to take out of jw 's young life all that the church have mean to he it would puzzle a professor to explain whatever might be leave jw have be bear in the country on a farm whose every tree and fence corner he still love he first recollection of the church as part of he life have to do with the Sunday morning drive to the little meetinghouse which stand where the road to town skirt a low hill it have horse-shed on one side stretch back to the rear of the church lot and some sizeable elm and maple be group about its front and side it be a one-room structure unless you count the space curtain off for the primary class as jw always do for back of this curtain 's protect fold he have begin he career as a Sunday school pupil and have make he first friend at that time even district school be yet a year ahead of he with its wider democratic joy and grief and its larger freedom from parental oversight when jw be six go on seven the family move to delafield though retain ownership of the farm and for year jw spend nearly every Saturday on the old place in free and blissful association with the shenk child whose father be the tenant it be here that he and martin luther shenk already introduce as marty being of the same age have swear eternal friendship a vow which as yet show no sign whatever of the ravages of time there be three other child ben and alice and jeannette now jeannette be only two year younger than jw and marty but through most of the year when jw be go every week to the farm she be only a girl and far behind the two chum by all the exacting standard which to boy be more than law but there come a time -- jw sr revel in reminiscence before so patient a listener as the preacher though it be a old story rehearse how he have serve for year as superintendent of the country Sunday school and how mr farwell be teacher of the girl ' bible class they home have always be methodist headquarters he say as old-time methodist usually say and with truth when they move to town the change bring no loss of church interest the farwell merely transfer it entire to delafield first church -lrb- first be more a title than a numeral since there be no second -rrb- but first church have not a few progressive saint they want the best that could be have so jw sr Sunday school enthusiast that he be find himself in a new place of opportunity the board of Sunday school at chicago have be ask to help delafield get itself in line with the best idea and method and jw sr find the beginning at least of Sunday school science in active operation at first like a true country man he be a little inclined to counsel of caution but in he country Sunday school work he have acquire such strong opinion about old fogy that he dread be think one himself and that be how it happen he say with a laugh that i be soon reckon among the progressive in that first year i help 'em win they fight for separate department and before long we have the makings of a real grade Sunday school do not you remember mother how proud you be when young jw there be graduate from the primary into the junior department all this be before pastor drury 's time of course but he have go through the same experience in other pastorate and need not to have anything explain how long have we have a teacher-training class in we Sunday school he ask that call out the story of the struggle to set up what many openly call a useless and foolish enterprise the Sunday school be chronically short of teacher and yet jw sr and the other reformer insist on take out of the regular class the best teacher in the school and a score of the most promising young people this group go off by itself into a remote part of the church it furnish no substitute teacher it be not hear of at all and loud be the complaint about its crippling the school but pastor you should have see the difference when the first dozen real teacher come out of that class we be able to reorganize the whole school we john wesley get a teacher he 'll never forget and of course we keep the training class go it be never stop since the board of Sunday school have give we the course and help we keep the class up to grade in its work and you know what sort of teacher we have now the pastor do and be properly thankful in some of he other pastorate it have be otherwise to he sorrow speaking of the board of Sunday school the elder farwell resume for this be a hobby he miss no chance to ride it make all the difference with we in we work for a better Sunday school -- give we expert backing you know and i notice by its latest annual report -- yes i always get a copy though jw think it dry reading -- that it be help Sunday school by the thousand not in this country only but wherever in the world we church be at work of course you know how it start Sunday school and how often they grow into church well it do not quite do that here but this church be a sight better and bigger because we begin to take the board 's advice when we do it be a good thing for we boy and many another boy and girl that the board wake we up it have not all be easy work though the minister suggest i remember that when i come i find there be a good deal of discontent over the grade lesson sure there be say jw sr we have all be bring up on the uniform lesson and most of we think they be just right besides we rather enjoy thinking of ourselves as keep step with the whole Sunday school world -- all over the wide earth everybody study the same scripture on the same Sunday and that be a big idea to get into the mind of christian of every name everywhere yes but dad put in jw what be the good of it if the lesson do not fit everybody do people think that the kid in the primary and they mother in ma 's class ought to study the same lesson or do they think they could fit the same lesson to everybody by the different note they put into the quarterly well son he father reply i reckon we think both way and i be not so sure yet that it can not be do but if one thing more than another reconcile I to the grade lesson it be that they make be a Sunday school teacher a good deal bigger job than it have ever be it be harder work because every lesson have to be study by the teacher and in a different way from what be think good enough in the old day and i be for anything grade lesson or whatever that 'll make people take Sunday school teaching more seriously then mr farwell venture to take up the story it be about that time in the very beginning of the drury pastorate that jw join the church on probation much to she surprise and humbling i have not even think of it she say though i should have be the first one he have be get ready in the junior league as i very well know but one day as you may remember -- brother drury do for that day be the real beginning of this story -- you make a invitation at the end of a real simple sermon and if jw jr do not get right up from my side and walk straight to the front after that there have be a probationer ' class with jw and perhaps twenty other meet the pastor every week for straight religious teaching so that at easter when they come up for membership what with they Sunday school and junior league training and what with the pastor 's more personal instruction they be able to pass a pretty fair examination on the great christian truth and on the general scheme of the church 's work for a time mother be a trifle disappointed that jw have not wait for the big revival we have the next year say jw sr but i think she be glad afterward yes i be the mother say you see i have be bring up to believe in revival and i do yet but we have no such chance to get the right christian start when we be little child as jw have have if you 'll let he mother say so and that make a revival a good deal more important to we when we church do get ready for one but the other way be all right too i be mother enough to be glad jw have not know some of the experience the boy of my time go through and the girl as well he be no worse a christian for have be right in the church ever since i put he in short dress be you son and i will say that he father be always with I in hold to the promise we make when he be baptize we have not do what we might but we have never forget that those promise be make to be keep jw feel none of he old shrinking from such talk especially since the institute and yet he have the healthy boy 's reluctance to discuss himself in company but this be interesting he outside himself he turn to the pastor that be what i mean when i tell you what phil say i be all for the church and church people and church way why should not i be i have never know anything else i remember well the one thing i do not like when it first come along and that be the new sort of christmas celebration dad and the other plan when i be ten or eleven you know what christmas mean to such kid and i guess we be all selfish together because we do not use we head well the Sunday school propose that instead of we all get something we should all give something it look pretty cheap to we little fellow at first and we teacher have all he could do to hold we in line but let I tell you every boy be for it when the time come we find that we could have as much fun give thing away as we could grab thing and anyway nobody really care for those mosquito net stocking fill with nut and candy and one orange it be only the idea of get something for nothing that first ` give christmas ' i remember we class dress up as delivery boy and we come on the platform with enough grocery for a small truck load that we have buy with we own money the orphanage get 'em next day and one class be dusty miller carry sack of flour and another put on a stunt of search for captain kidd 's treasure and they find a keg of shine coin -lrb- new penny they be -rrb- -- more than a thousand of 'em everything go to the orphanage or the hospital and then when the board of Sunday school begin to get we interested in other Sunday school and in mission -- i remember a scheme they call a ` partnership plan ' that be great i do not know what happen to it -- i get right into the game every time how do you happen to know so much about the board of Sunday school jw ask mr drury oh that be easy you know how it be in we Sunday school : they do not make one or two of we young fellow serve as librarian and secretary and such and miss all the class work : they have more help and we all get into class for the lesson well two year ago dad tell I you have nominate I for something at the annual Sunday school meeting it be only a sort of assistant secretary 's job but very soon i begin to catch on and i have see a lot of the letter and leaflet that come from the board in chicago well let I tell you that board of Sunday school be a whale of a machine why it be the whole church at work to make better Sunday school and more of 'em they have Sunday school worker in all sort of wild place and Sunday school missionary in foreign land yes and last year i happen to meet one of they secretary at you house you may remember but you would never think he be just a secretary he be so keen and wide awake he know the boy scout from a to z and that get I 'cause i be not so old that i have forget my scout and he know baseball and boy ' book and all that do not you think brother drury if more of the fellow know what the real Sunday school work be they would take to it like colt to a bran mash they could not help it say the pastor and you may have notice that you father and the other people of we Sunday school board be try to get they to find out some of the thing you have find out for instance you know what the two organize class of high-school freshman be do and the other organize class seem to I they member be find out that Sunday school be something big and fine that they be mr farwell agree and you must not forget my wonderful class of young married woman and the man 's class of nearly a hundred i think we Sunday school have really begin to change the idea of a lot of people just think how little trouble we have now with what grade lesson we have and how happy all we teacher be because they have the help they need for just the sort of pupil that be in they class that be so say jw sr i do not suppose even old brother barnacle ` sot ' as he be would vote to go back to the time when the superintendent review the lesson the same way the teacher teach it from a print list of question seem as if i can hear henry j locke yet -- he farm join ours down by the creek -- when he conduct the review at deep creek he would hold he quarterly at arm 's length to favor he eye and then look up from it to the school and shoot the question at everybody ` and what do peter do _ then _ hey ' he sure do come out strong on peter but i 'll say this for he that he never skip a question from start to finish all three laugh a little over henry j locke and then the pastor say he must not stay much longer but he do want to back up jw 's belief that what phil khami have say be true of everybody -- we be all debtor look at this young jw here will you he say to the father and mother for once let himself go with a name he be proud of and a home life that many a fifth avenue and lake shore drive family would be glad to pay a million for if such goods be on sale in the store i be go to tell he something he already know young man and there be a gleam in the pastor 's eye that be not all to the credit of the work he be praise you owe a big debt to the Sunday school i be not jealous for the church or for any other part of it but by you own admission the Sunday school have have a lot to do with you education very well remember it be a part of what phil say and what you be because of the Sunday school you have become by the goodness of christian people i do not think you 'll forget it see that you have two of that sort of people in you own home all the time and then with a fine naturalness the little group kneel by the chair and two of the four he who be pastor of the whole flock and he who with simple dignity be priest in he own household give thanks to god for the manifold goodness of christian people of which they be all partaker every day as he go home walter drury thought of the long day that stretch out ahead before he could see the outcome of the great experiment but this night have see a good night 's work do in the laboratory and he be content one tale of the past have be much in jw 's thought that night but nothing on earth could have induce he to talk about it especially since the happening at the institute only one other person know all of its inwardness though the preacher guess most of the secret pretty shrewdly and everybody be familiar with its outcome it be the story of marty shenk 's conversion these two have be david and jonathan from they little boy day no less friend because they be so unlike marty a quiet brooding knowledge-hungry youngster and jw matter-of-fact take thing as they come and ask few question but always the leader in game and mischief each the other 's champion against all comer marty 's father tenant-farmer on the farwell farm be steady enough and dependable but never one to get ahead much before the farwell move to town he have rarely stay on the same farm more than a year or two but as he say jw farwell be different and anybody who want to be decent could get along with he so for many saturday and vacation of boyhood year jw and marty have roam the countryside and be letter-perfect in they boy-knowledge of the old farm marty come in to high school from the farm and often he stay with jw over the weekend he school work be uneven -- ahead in mathematics and the science and something below the average in other study that however have no place in this story of course he and jw be thick as thief except when class work make temporary separation necessary they live the high-school life together that mean also for these two the social life of the church which occasionally pay special attention to the student so you might find they at epworth league social Sunday school class doings in the Sunday school orchestra -- violin and b-flat cornet respectively -- and most significant of all in its effect on all the later year they go through win-my-chum week together the hand of the pastor be in that too marty be not a christian jw have be a church member for year and early in he course he have face and accept all that be a christian seem to mean to a high-school boy there have be hard place to get over some of the boy and girl be merciless in they unconscious test of he religion some be openly scornful and other seek by indirect and furtive means to break he influence in the school for he have no small gift of leadership and he care a good deal that it should count for the decency of high-school life by senior year the sort of trouble that a christian boy encounter in school be almost all end but it have be more through he dogged resistance to opposition than because of any special zest in christian service and then come the announcement of win-my-chum week with jw confront by two stubborn fact he have only one real chum and that chum be not a christian pastor drury have let fall a remark a month before the week to the effect that any christian who have a chum could dodge win-my-chum week but he could not dodge he chum when the week be past the chum would still be on hand think as he would there be no honest way of escape from whatever those fact might require of he so jw long accustomed to go ahead and take what come have know himself bind by the obligation of this matter also day and day before the activity of win-my-chum week begin the two be out one Saturday on the north road they have be up to the wood on barker 's hill for nut and with good success the day be warm the way be long and there be no hurry when they come to the roadside at the wood 's edge they sit on a fall tree and talk at least marty do for jw be not himself it be he chance and he know it but a thousand impulse leap to life within he to make he put off what he know he ought to say the fear of be misunderstand -- even by marty -- the knowledge that marty in the quality by which boy judge and be judge be quite as good as himself and above all he sense of total unfitness to be a pattern of the christian life to anybody fill he with a uneasiness that actually hurt and marty soon discover that something be amiss willing as he be to do he full share of the talk he become aware that except for inarticulate commonplace he be have to do it all what be the matter with you all at once jw he ask you be not take suddenly sick be you you be all right when we be among the tree _ be _ you sick jw laugh shortly no old man i be not sick but i be up against a new game for I and i be not in training sound interesting say marty but sort of mysterious be it anything i can do team-work on it surely be but first i have get to say something and i want you to promise that you will not think i be put on or but in because i be not nothing like it will you will i promise say marty much bewildered course i 'll promise not to think anything about you that you do not want I to think but i must say i do not know within a thousand mile what you be drive at out with it and even if you be the train bandit who hold up the cannonball or if you have plot to kidnap the board of education i 'll never tell marty 's quizzical humor be not make jw 's enterprise any easier he have always suppose that what the leaflet call personal evangelism have to be do in a spirit of solemnity but how be he to acquire the proper frame of mind and certainly there be nothing solemn about marty just now yet the thing have go too far it be too late to retreat he try to think how mr drury would do it but see only that if it be mr dairy 's business he would go straight to the center of it desperately therefore he plunge in well marty he say speak now with nervous haste what i be up against be this what be the matter with you be a christian he will never forget the swift look of blank amazement that marty turn on he nor the slow-mounting flush that follow the first astonished start for marty do not answer and turn he face away jw be sure that in he blundering bluntness he have offend and probably anger he closest friend the distress of that thought serve at least to drive away all the self-consciousness which thus far have plague he say marty he plead put he hand on the other 's arm forget it if i have hurt you feeling i know as well as you do that i be not fit to talk about such thing to anybody and honest i mean nothing but to say what i know i would get to say then marty turn himself back slowly and jw see the troubled look in he eye in a voice that tremble despite he proud effort at control he say old man you need not apologize you do surprise I i 'll admit i be not look for anything like this it be all right though and i be certainly not mad about it but say jw let I put something up to you why do you never think to ask I that question before why it be this way jw begin somewhat puzzle at the form of the question and still think he must set himself right with marty you know the epworth league be plan for those special meeting soon -- ` win-my-chum week ' -- and i have be ask to lead one of the meeting but you can see that i would not be ready to lead a meeting like that unless i have put this thing of be a christian up to you anyway you be the only real chum i have get mr drury say something a little while ago that make it mighty plain yes say marty i can see that but why do you never say anything to I about it when there be not any meeting come have not we always share everything else since away back this be the one subject that you and i have keep away from in we talk of all we have ever think about and i be wonder why well i do not exactly know jw reply it may have be that it never seem to be any of my business that it be the preacher 's business or the Sunday school teacher 's or somebody 's and you know i have always be surer of what you really be than i have of myself i think i be always afraid you would either make fun of I or believe i be let on to be better than you be but when the league get into this win-my-chum plan why the name itself be a eye-opener and i have see lately that a fellow 's get to be a christian out and out or he religion be no good and when i hear the preacher say not long ago that a fellow might dodge win-my-chum week but he could not forever dodge he chum i know i have to speak to you but you be sure you be not offend let I admit a thing to you jw i have never say so before but i have be want somebody to ask I to be a christian for a long time i be a coward about it and would not let on i have be want to find out what i have get to do but i would not ask do you think i _ could _ be a christian i know you could be a long way better christian than i be jw answer with unwonted feeling and if you do take jesus christ to be you master it would be more than just you get religion you would be the biggest kind of stand-by for I and for other people i know of it be the one thing you need to be a hundred per cent right i be a pretty poor christian myself marty partly because i do not know how to think much about it but you would be dead in earnest to get all that there be in the christian life and maybe i could follow along behind you have always help every other way and i have always want you to help I be a genuine christian marty put he hand on jw 's shoulder and look he straight in the eye : you have get I rate a lot too high he say how can i help you but we two have be pretty good chum so far have not we well there be a lot to settle before i can be sure i be a christian but it mean everything for you to think i can be of some use and i promise you this jw i 'll not let up until i be a christian and we 'll stick together all the more when i be we two be that ago it be a go jw be ready and far more than ready to call it a go it have be easier than he have expect but then it have all be so different from the vague and formal thing he have be afraid of he could hardly believe but he have one request to make i know you 'll settle whatever have to be settle he say a bit unsteadily but when it be all do and you tell people about it as i know you will please marty do not bring I into it publicly i mean let 's just have this understanding between ourselves i can lead my meeting now but there be no need to say anything about I besides i make a mess of it it may be the best mess anybody ever stir up for I jw but i will not say anything to worry you if the time come for I to say anything at all and i believe it will it do marty and the pastor have two or three long interview from the last of they the boy come away with a new light on he face and a new spring in he step evidently whatever need to be settle have be settle he keep he promise to he chum but that do not prevent he from choose the night when jw lead the meeting to stand up at the first opportunity and make he straightforward confession of love and loyalty since god have make he a sharer in the life that be in christ then for a moment jw fear marty might forget they agreement but marty say simply and part of the joy that be in my heart to-night be because there be a new tie the only other one we need between myself and my old-time chum the leader of this meeting in the back of the room walter drury quietly look on send up a silent thanksgive the great experiment be go well chapter iii campus day so it be that jw and marty have come into the inner place of each other 's life of all the development of institute week naturally the one which fill jw 's thought with a sort of awed gladness be marty 's decision to offer himself for the ministry joe carbrook 's right-about-face be much more dramatic for jw see when the decision be make that marty could not have be mean for anything but a preacher it be as fit as you please as to joe previous opinion have be pretty equally divide one side lean to the idea that he might make a lawyer and the other predict that he be more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer in the light of the institute happening it be to be expect that the question of college would promptly become a practical matter to four delafield people marty be greatly trouble for he know if he be to be a preacher he must go to college and he could not see how jw feel no great urge though it have always be understand that he would go marcium dayne have one year of normal school to she credit and would take another next year perhaps but this year she must teach joe carbrook spend little time in debate with himself he let everybody know that he be go to be a missionary doctor and that he would go to the state university for the rest of he college course but what about the religious influence of the university marcium dayne have venture to ask he one evening as they walk slowly under the elm of monroe avenue i do not know about that joe answer and maybe i be make a mistake but i do not think so to begin with there be not any question about equipment at the state university they have everything any church school have and probably more than most church school for what i want and they work in close relationship to the medical school that be one thing the big reason though -- i wonder if you 'll understand it i believe i could understand anything you might be think about -- now joe and marcium 's voice have in it a note which stir that usually self-possessed young man out of all he easy composure i 'll remember that marcium he say in the thrill of a swift elation i 'll remember that because i think you do -- understand and some day i -- but i have get at least five year of plug ahead of I and -- you be go to tell I about you big reason for go to the state university marcium break in though she wonder afterward if she instinct have not play she false yes joe say with a little effort well this be it you know i do not make much of a hit at college i pull through sophomore year but that be about all and i doubt if the faculty will pass resolution of regret when i do not show up there in the fall the religious influence of a church school do not prevent I from be a good deal of a heathen though i will say that be no fault of the school maybe i ought to go back and face the music it would not be so bad i guess but i feel more like make a clean new start in a new place the state university would not be any worse for I than i should be for it if nothing have happen to change my point of view so that be not the issue but if the state university life be able to beat I before i get to saw bone at all i would make a pretty missionary doctor if i ever land in foreign part would not i marcia could find nothing to say perhaps because she thought be busy with other and more personal aspect of joe 's plan for the future and as joe 's people be completely oblivious to everything except the startling change that have come over he and be abundantly able to send he to three university at once if necessary joe carbrook be as good as enrol marty and jw do not find the future open up before they so easily marty for all he could not imagine the way opening before such as himself be all eagerness about the nearest methodist school which happen to be the one where the institute have be hold cartwright college it be name as may be suppose in honor of peter cartwright that pioneer methodist preacher who become famous on the same sort of schooling which suffice for abraham lincoln and once run against lincoln himself for congress jw be not specially eager to look for a college education anywhere why should he be since he be expect to go into business the two have many a discussion marty argue in favor of college for everybody and jw admit that for preacher and teacher and lawyer and doctor it be necessary but what use could it be in business but say jw you be not go to be one of these ` bear a man die a grocer ' sort of business man urge marty broad-minded -- that be you future with a knowledge of more than market and look at the personal side of college life have not you hear mr drury say that if he have not anything else to show for he four year at college than the lifelong friendship he make there it would have be worth all it cost and you have reason to know he do not forget the study that be all right marty jw rejoin i do not need much convincing on that score i can see the good time too you know i would try for all the athletics i could get into and i guess i could keep my end up socially but be all that worth my time for the next four year study subject that would be no earthly good to I in business in make a living i mean the other boy in hardware store would have four year the start of I but do not you remember jw what we commencement speaker say on that very point he tell we we have to be man and woman first no matter what occupation we get into and he bear down hard on how it be a good deal bigger business to make a life than to make a living in these day the most dangerous people to themselves and to all of we be the uneducated people yes i remember jw admit ` cultural and social value of education ' he call that do not he and that be what i be not sure of it seem pretty foggy to I but old man you be go that be settle and maybe i 'll just let dad send I to keep you company if i can not find any better reason that be all very well for you to say jw marty retort with the least little touch of resentment in he tone you 'll _ let _ you dad send you my dad can not send I though he 'll do all he be able to do and how i can earn enough to get through be more than i can see from here but jw assert confidently : there be a way just the same and i think i know how to find out about it i have not be a second assistant deputy secretary in the Sunday school for nothing you remind I of the commencement address i 'll ask you if you remember child 's day it come the very next Sunday yes i remember it but what of it well my boy we take up a collection for you we do not much we do and anyway do you think i would accept that sort of help i be not look for charity yet and marty show the hurt he feel steady martin luther i would not want you to get that collection anyway it be not near big enough but do not you know that every child 's day collection in the whole church go to the board of education and that it have become a big fund never to be give away but always to be loan to student get ready to be preacher and such it be no charity it be the same broad-minded business you want I to go to college for i can see that much without get any nearer to college than the delafield first church Sunday school you borrow the money just as if you step up to a bank window and you agree to pay it back as soon as you can after you graduate then it go into the fund again and some other boy or girl borrow it and so on more than twenty-five thousand student have borrow from this fund about fifteen hundred of 'em get loan last year ask the preacher if i be not give you this straight marty have no immediate way of testing this unusual wealth of information so he say well maybe there be something in it i 'll talk to brother drury about it anyway that observe man be quite willing to be talk to when marty present himself at the study a few day later he find the pastor as well prepare as if he have be expect some such interview as indeed he have he tell marty the story of the student loan fund -- how it originate in the celebration of the centenary of american methodism in 1866 and how it have be grow all through the year both by the annual child 's day offering and by the increase return of loan from former student then he explain that this fund and many other educational affair be in the hand of the church 's board of education this board marty hear be a sort of educational clearing house for the whole church and especially for methodist school of higher learn it help young people to go to college and it help the college to take care of the young people when they go of course always use money which have come from the church it have charge of a group of special school in the south and it set the scholastic standard to which all the church 's school and college must conform besides look out for these interest it help the school to provide course in the bible and christian principle and it furnish worker to serve the college in care for the religious life of the student marty listen carefully and with no lack of interest but when the minister pause the boy 's mind spring back to he own particular concern but mr drury can any student borrow money from that fund well no say the preacher not every student only those who be prepare for the ministry or for other career of special service they have to show that the loan will help they in prepare to be of some definite christian value when they graduate that will not affect you you can borrow not all you could use perhaps but enough to be a big help how much do you expect to need why answer marty i hardly know i have not really think it possible i could go but dad say he 'll let I have all he can and they tell I a fellow can get work to do if he be not particular about easy job i be pretty sure i could manage except for tuition and book but -- then you may as well consider it settle say the pastor cartwright college will welcome you on those term or i 'll know the reason why and i think you can count on jw go with you jw be not hard to convince he parent be all for it the pastor have no intention of overdo he own part in the affair and contented himself with a suggestion that dispose of jw 's main objection jw have be say to he one day i know i should have a good time at college but i should be four year later get into business than the other boy that depend on what ` later ' mean reply mr drury you would not need four year to catch up if college do for you what i think it will besides you be intend to be a christian citizen i take it and that will be even more of a job than to be a successful hardware man college have be operate these many year to give young people the best possible preparation for a whole life remember what john milton say : i care not how late i come so i come fit ' you want to come to you work as fit as they make 'em do not you and jw own up that he do i do not mean to be a dub in business and i have no right to be a dub anywhere I for cartwright brother drury another day 's work in the laboratory walter drury know how to be patient yet every experience like this be a tonic to he soul and now he must be content for a time to let other carry the work through its next stage though he would hold himself ready for any unexpected development that might arise so it befall that jw and marty start to cartwright and a week later joe carbrook go off to the state university the day after they have matriculate jw and marty be put they room to rights -- oh yes they think it would be well to share the same room -- and as they putter about they review the happening of the first day they have make a preliminary exploration of the grounds and building revisit the place which have become familiar during institute week and living over that crowded and epochal time marty scout around for something to do have discover that he could get work such as it be for ten hour a week anyway and maybe more at thirty to fifty cent a hour he have a little money leave after pay he tuition and the college registrar assure he that the loan from the board of education would be forthcoming therefore the talk turn on money that tuition bill sure reduce the swell in my pocketbook marty remark jw as he examine he visible resource what do you think it do to mine marty observe quietly i be still giddy from be relieve of so much money in one operation and yet i can not see how they get along look at the big faculty they have and all these building to keep up and keep go when i think of how big a dollar seem to I the tuition look like the national debt of mexico but when i try to figure out how much it cost the college per student i feel as though i be pay lunch-counter price for a dining-car dinner how _ do _ they do it jw who tell you i be to be look on in the light of a world almanac my son i could give you the answer to that question without get out of my chair but for one small difficulty -- i just do not know tell you what -- it be a good question -- let 's look in the catalogue i would like to find information in that volume about something besides the four century of study that loom before my freshman eye so they look in the catalogue and discover that cartwright college have a endowment of $ 1750000 produce a income of about $ 80000 a year and that the church of its territory give about $ 25000 more they learn also that most of the building have be provide by friend of the college with the carnegie library mainly the gift of the millionaire ironmaster they learn also that about $ 500000 of the endowment have be raise in the last two year under the promise of the general education board which be a rockefeller creation to provide the last $ 125000 the college property be value at about half a million dollar and there you be martin luther my bold reformer say jw cheerfully the people who put up the money have invest about two and a half million on you and I and the other five hundred student say about $ 250 a year per student and we pay the rest of what it cost to give we a college career $ 125 to $ 175 a year depend on we taste in course i remember i feel as if the john wesley farwell family have almost go break when dad sign up for $ 1000 on that last endowment campaign i think the money go forever but i see now he merely invest it i have come to cartwright to spend the income of it and a little more five or six people have give a thousand dollar apiece to make a college course possible for each of we there be some reason in college endowment after all and marty say one good i can see in this particular endowment be that anybody but a selfish idiot would be glad to match four year of he life against all the money and work that christian people have put into cartwright college i hope you do not mean anything personal by that remark jw say with mock solemnity because i be inclined to believe you be more than half right it remind I again of what phil khami say i be begin to think i 'll never have a chance to forget that greek 's christian remark about christian by be off at school together jw and marty give each other unconfessed but very real moral support in those first day when a lone freshman would have know he be homesick but another antidote both pleasant and potent be supply by the epworth league of first church it have ally itself with the college ymca -- and for the woman student with the ywca -- in various way but particularly it purpose to see that the first few sunday be safely tide over so the two chum find themselves in one of the two highly attractive study course which have be put on in partnership with the Sunday school it be in the early afternoon of one of the early sunday that jw call marty 's attention to a still more alluring opportunity looky here marty it be rain i know but i have a feeling that you would better not write that letter home until a little further on in the day what be to stop we from take a look at this league fellowship hour we be invite to and get a light lunch we do not need to stay to the league meeting unless we choose though we be member you know marty pick up the card of invitation which jw have flip across the table to he and read it well he comment it read all right let 's try it out into the rain they go and put in two highly cheerful hour include one in the devotional meeting so that when marty at last sit down to write home he produce without quite know how a letter that be vastly more heartening when it reach the farm than it would have be if he have write it before dark joe carbrook set out for the state university in what be for he a fashion quite subdue before he experience at the institute he would have go if at all in he own car and he arrival would have be notice to the sporty crowd that another candidate for initiation into that select circle have arrive but joe be enjoy the novelty of think a little before he act though he would always be of the irrepressible sort he be not the same joe he have lay out a program which surprise himself somewhat and astonish most of the people who know he he know now that he would become if he could a doctor a missionary doctor no other career enter he mind he would finish he college work at the state university and then go to medical school he would devote himself without cease to all the study he would need not for he any social life any relaxation of purpose grimly he tell himself that he play day be over they have be lively while they last but they be do of course that be foolish if he have persist in any such scholastic regimen the effort would have last a few day or possibly week and then in a reaction of disgust he might easily have come to despair of the whole project fortunately for joe and for a good many other people he purpose of digging into he book and laboratory work and doggedly avoid any other interest be temper by the happening of the first week doubtless he would have make a desperate struggle but it would have be useless not even conversion can make new habit overnight and in he first two year at college joe have be know to teacher and student alike as distinctly a sketchy student wholly inexpert at concentrated effort and so instead of become first a grind and then a discourage rebel against it all he have the immense good fortune to be capture by a observant junior whom he have meet while they be both register for chemistry iii you be new here say the junior heatherby by name and i have have two year of it maybe you 'll let I show you the place i be the proud half-owner of a decidedly second-hand ` hoot nanny ' you know and i rather like bump people around town in it that be the beginning of many thing joe like it that heatherby make no apology for he car and before long he discover that the other half-owner barnard be equally unaffected and friendly it be something of a surprise though to learn that barnard be not a student but the youthful-looking pastor of the university methodist church of late know as the wesley foundation i be not up on methodism as i should be say joe to barnard a day or two later and i may as well admit that i never hear before of this wesley foundation of yours be it a church affair well rather barnard answer it be just exactly that you know or could have guess that a good many of the student here be from methodist home -- about a fourth of the whole student body as it happen and we church have be come to see perhaps a bit slowly that although the state could not provide any religious influence and could certainly do nothing for denominational interest there be all the more reason for the church to do it that be the idea under the foundation so to speak and the work be now establish in nine of the great state university yes i see joe muse but just what be the foundation 's duty and how do you do it barnard laugh as he say we do pretty near everything in this university we have a regular methodist church with a membership make up almost entirely of faculty and student the town people have they own first church over on the west side we church have its Sunday school its epworth league chapter and other activity we try to come out strong on the social side and in a little while when we social center building be up -- we be after the money for it now -- we can do a good deal more there be plenty of demand for it that be all church work of course i suppose you have no relation to the university though joe ask study and all that yes indeed and we be come to more of it but gradually we be already offer course in religious subject with teacher recognize by the university and credit give it be all very new yet you know but we be hope and go ahead i should think so say joe with emphasis but where do the money come from for all this it must be methodist money of course who put it up oh the usual people say barnard a few well-to-do methodist have provide some of it but the really big money have to come from the church -- collection and subscription and all that this sort of work be be do in forty-odd other school where the wesley foundation be not organize the money come officially through two of the benevolent board yes query joe i have often hear of ` the benevolence ' but i never think of they as mean anything to I how do they hook up to a proposition like that well say barnard the board of education naturally be interested because of the methodist student who be here and the board of home mission and church extension be interested because at bottom this be the realest sort of home mission and church extension work do these board supply all the money you need be joe 's next question no not all at once anyway barnard answer we be need a good deal more before this thing really get on its foot and when we people know what work can be do in state school and what a glorious chance we have i think they 'll see that the money be provide the student be there half a hundred thousand of they and the church must be there too well joe say i admire the faith of you and i want to join you know although i be a mighty green hand at religious work i have get to go at it hard there be a reason so please count I in on everything where i be likely to fit at all i do not tell you do i that i be head for medicine -- go to be a missionary doctor if they 'll take I when i be ready maybe you foundation can do something with I barnard think it could and the next two year justified he confidence joe carbrook as downright in he new purpose as he have be in he old scornful refusal to look at life seriously quickly find a place for himself in the church and the other activity of the foundation it save he from he first heedless resolution to study a impossible number of hour a day and from the certain crash which would have follow it give he not a few friend and he be soon deep in the affair of the league and the church besides it make possible some special friendship among the faculty which be to be of immense value in later day while joe carbrook be fitting himself into the life of the university and the wesley foundation the chum at cartwright be quite as busy make themselves a part of they new world as always they make a good team so much so that people begin to think of they not as individual but as necessarily relate like a pair of shoe or collar and tie or pork and bean and though the old difference of temperament and interest have not lessen the two have reach a fine contentment over each other 's purpose jw be happy in marty 's preacher-plan and marty believe implicitly in the wisdom of jw 's understand purpose to be a forthright christian layman but it be not all plain sailing for jw nobody bother marty he be go into the ministry and that settle that among the student who go in for religious work be several who could not quite share marty 's complacence over jw 's program they think it strange that so active a christian with the right stuff in he as everybody recognize should not declare himself for some religious vocation and from time to time man come to college -- bishop secretary specialist -- to talk to the student about this very thing there be a student volunteer band in which be enrol all the student look to foreign mission work the prospective preacher have a club of they own and there be even a little organized group of boy and girl who think seriously of social service in some form or another as a career now jw before the end of sophomore year have come to know all or nearly all of these young enthusiast some of they develop into staunch and satisfying friend if he have run with the sport crowd which be always look for recruit or if he have be merely a hard student work for phi beta kappa he might have be let alone but without be able to wear a identify label he yet belong with those who have come to college with a definite life purpose just because nobody seem to realize that be a christian in business could be as distinct a vocation as any jw be at time vaguely trouble in spite of he confident stand at the institute he wonder a little at what he have almost come to feel be he callousness not that he be uninterested for marty he have vast unspoken ambition which would have stun that unsuspecting youth if they have ever become vocal and he never tire of the prospects which open up before he other friend he keep up a intermittent correspondence with joe carbrook and find himself think much about the strange chain of circumstance which promise to make a medical missionary out of joe he more than suspect that joe and marcium dayne be vastly interested in each other 's future and he get a lot of satisfaction out of that they would have a great missionary career no he be not unfeeling about all these high purpose of the boy and girl he know and if he could just get a final answer to the one question that be bother he he college life would need nothing to make it wholly satisfy he have early forget all he old reluctance to put college before business marty know something of what be pass in jw 's mind and it trouble he a little he think of tackle jw himself and by this time there be nothing under the sun they could not discuss with each other freely but he do not quite trust himself at last he make up he mind to write to they pastor at home he know that for some reason mr drury have a peculiar interest in jw and be sure he could count on it now i know jw 's bother he write but he do not talk about it i think he have be disturb by hear so much about special call to special work we have have several lifework meeting lately and the need of the world have be pretty strongly state but the stand he take at the institute be just as right for he as mine be for I can not you write to he or something walter drury could do better than write he turn up at cartwright that same week it happen that three or four prospective preacher and christian worker have be in they room that afternoon and jw be try to think the thing through once more he recall what he pastor have say at the camp fire and he own testimony on institute Sunday in the life-service meeting after marcium dayne have put it up to he but he be make heavy weather of it and just then come the pastor 's knock at the door there be a boisterous welcome from they both with something like relief in jw 's heart that he would not could not speak but he could get help now for the sake of say something he ask the usual question what in the world bring you to cartwright oh say pastor drury i like to come to cartwright you president 's a old friend besides why should not i come to see you two if i wish you be still part of my flock you know so they talk of anything and everything by and by marty say he must go over to the library and pretty soon jw be tell he friend the pastor all that have be disturb he it all begin in the summer before i come to college at the institute here you know when you speak at the camp fire on Saturday night i remember the pastor reply you have not take much interest in you future work before that no real interest i guess jw admit i would always take thing as they come and do not go look for what i could not see i be enjoy every day 's living and do not care deeply about anything else why though i have be a methodist all my life you remember how i know nothing at all about the methodist church outside of delafield except what little i pick up about its Sunday school by serve as a assistant to we Sunday school secretary and when i begin to hear at the institute about home mission and foreign mission about negro education and other business that the church be do i see right off that it be up to we young people to supply the new worker that be always need but even so only those who have a real fitness for it ought to offer themselves and i think too that something else would be need i be not any duller than lot of other church member -- even the older one do not seem to know much more about the church outside than i do you would take up collection for the benevolence but if you tell we what they mean we do not pay enough attention to get the idea clearly so as to have any real understanding i suppose the woman 's society have more i know my mother talk about industrial home in the south and school in indium -- she be in both the society you know -- but that be about all and it seem when i begin to find out about thing mr drury that if we whole church need worker for all these place it need just as much to have in the local church man and woman who would know about the work in a big way and who would care in a big way to back up the whole work as it should be back up so when you speak at the camp fire it be just what i want to hear and when i be call on i make that sort of a declaration the next day at the life decision service yes i remember that too say mr drury and i remember tell joe carbrook that you have undertake as big a career as any of they that be what i kind of thought too say jw simply but room with marty shenk -- he be go to make a great preacher too -- keep I think and i know about all the student who be get ready for special work and lately i have be wonder -- about some special sort of work you would like to do mr drury prompt no not that at all i be just as sure as ever i be not that sort if only i can make good in business there be where i belong but can a fellow make good just as a christian in the same way i expect marty shenk to make good as a christian preacher the pastor stand up and come over to jw 's chair my boy i know just what you be face it be a pretty old struggle and there be only one way out of it god have not any first place and second place for the people that let he guide they a man may refuse he call either to go or to stay and then no matter what he do it will be a second best but you -- wait for you call for my part i think probably you have get it and it be to a very real life if you and those like you should fail we should soon have no more missionary and if the missionary should fail we should soon have no more church god have little patience with a church that always stay at home and i doubt if he have more for a church that do not stand by the man and woman it have send to the outpost it be all one job there be much more of the same sort and when jw walk with he pastor to the train the next morning the only doubt that have ever really disturbed he in college be quiet for good walter drury go back to delafield and he work surer now than ever that the experiment be go forward he know certainly that all this be only the get ready that the real test would come later but he be well content \* \* \* \* \* it be early football season of the junior year the state university take on cartwright college for the first Saturday 's game everybody well know that it be only a practice romp for the university always a big time for cartwright this year it be a day for remember joe carbrook who have be graduate from the university in June and be now a medical student in the city drive down to see the game for loyalty 's sake he join the little bunch of university rooter on the east stand otherwise it be cartwright 's crowd as well as cartwright 's day to the surprise of everybody neither side score until the last quarter and then both side make a touchdown cartwright first a high tricky wind spoil both attempt to kick goal and time be call with a score at 6-6 cartwright have hold state to a tie for the first time in history joe come from the game with the chum and take supper with they the whole town be ablaze with excitement over its team 's great show against the state and the talk at table be all of the way cartwright 's eleven could now go romp down the schedule and take every other college into camp include of course barton poly they dearest foe the boy be happy to have joe with they he look so big and fine and have the same easy breezy bearing as of old nor have he lose any of that frank attitude toward he own career which never fail to interest everybody he meet after supper they have a hour together in the room those boy in the medical school surely do amuse I he laugh when i tell 'em i be to be a missionary doctor which i do first thing to give 'em sort of a shock they do not often get they stand off and say ` what you ' as if i have tell 'em i be to be a traffic cop or a trapeze artist in the circus some of 'em seem to think i be queer in the head but boy they be the one with room to let when the other talk about hang out a shingle in chicago or saint loui or cleveland or some other over-doctored place i tell 'em to watch I when i be the only doctor between siam and sunrise will not i be somebody with my own hospital -- make out o ' mud i know -- and a dispensary and a few native helper who do not know what i be go to do next and all the sick people come from ten day ' journey away to the foreign doctor and then he mood change that be what 'll get I though all those helpless ignorant human who do not even know what i can do for they body let alone have any suspicion of what somebody else can do for they soul but it will be wonderful next thing to be with he in galilee there be a pause each boy fill it with thought he would not speak where do you expect to find that work joe jw ask he the answer be quick and straight : wherever i be send jw boy he say only i have tell the candidate secretary what i want i meet he last summer in chicago and there be nothing like get in you bid early he be agree to recommend I when i be ready for the hardest neediest most neglect place that be open if i be go into this missionary doctor business i want a chance to prove christianity where they will not be able to say that christianity could not have do it alone it _ can _ then with one of those quick turn which be joe carbrook 's device for conceal he feeling he say and how 's everything go at this methodist college of yours you boy put up a beautiful game to-day and they ought to have win how 's the rest of the school both the boy assure he everything be go in a properly satisfactory fashion but marty have catch one word that he want joe to enlarge upon why do you say ` methodist college ' it be a methodist college but be there anything the matter with that joe rise to the mild challenge do not think i mean to be nasty he say but i can not help compare this place with the state university and i wonder if there be any big reason for such college as this you know they all have a hard time and the state spend dollar to the church 's dime yes we know that do not we jw and marty appeal to he chum remember the frequent and half-curious talk they have on that very contrast jw say sure but plainly mean to leave the defense of the christian college to marty who to tell the truth be quite willing there be room for both and need for both say that earnest young man each have its work to do -- the state university will probably help in attract most of those who want special technical equipment and the church college will keep on serve those who want a education for its own sake whatever special line they may take up afterward : though each will say it welcome both sort of student this suit joe he intend marty to keep it up a while so he say but why be a church college anyway and he get he answer for marty too be eager for the fray the church college he retort with the merest hint of asperity be at the bottom of all that people call higher education the church be found college and support they before the state think even of primary school look at oxford and cambridge -- church college look at harvard and yale and princeton and the smaller new england college -- church college look at syracuse and wesleyan and northwestern and chicago look at vanderbilt and most of the other great school of the south they be church college found most of they before the first state university and many before there be any public high school the church college show the way if it have never do anything else it have some rights as the pioneer of higher learning jw have be get more interested he have never hear marty in quite this strain and he be proud of he that be a pretty good answer he be give you joe he say with a chuckle now be not it it be admit joe i reckon i know most of what you say marty but i have not think of it that way before now i want to ask another question only do not think i be do it for meanness i have get a reason and my question be this : grant all that the church school have do be it worth all they cost to keep they up now in we time i mean i think it be marty answer quieter now they do provide a different sort of educational opportunity as i say then they be produce most of the recruit that the church need for they work since the church begin to care for they member in the state university a rather larger number of candidate for christian service be come out of the university but until the last year or two nearly all come and the very large majority still come and probably for year will come from the church college and there be another reason that you state advocate ought to remember we methodist college in this country have about fifty thousand student if these college be to be put out of business ten of the very greatest state university would have to be duplicated dollar for dollar at public expense to take care of the methodist student alone when you think of all the other denomination you would need to duplicate all the state university now in existence if you purpose to do the work the church college be now do and if you could not get the money or if the student do not take to the change the country would be short just that many thousand college-trained man and woman the whole methodist church with the other church be do a piece of unselfish national service that cost up into the hundred of million and where 's any other big money that be better spend when marty stop he look up into joe 's good-natured face and blush with a embarrassed self-consciousness you think you have be string I do not you now marty joe speak genially do not you misunderstand i say i have a reason i have my folk have some money they want to put into a safe place and they like cartwright i do too but -- you know how it be i want to be sure anyhow i be glad i ask these question you have give I some highly important information and honestly i be grateful you surely do not think i be small enough to be make fun of you or of cartwright if i seem to be i apologize on the spot believe I and there be no mistake he genuine earnestness of course i believe you old man marty rejoin just a wee bit ashamed forgive I too but i have be read up on that college thing lately and it be a little different from what most people think so you get I go i be glad he do say jw it make I prouder than ever of cartwright college and as he get up he say as though still at the game the ` locomotive ' now and give cartwright 's favorite yell as a solo while marty and joe grin approval and some student pass in the street answer it with the skyrocket \* \* \* \* \* there be material for a book all mixt of interest vary from very light comedy to unplumbed gloom in the life of two boy at college -- any two and some day the chronicle of the delafield duo may be write but not now senior year with its bright glory and its seriously bear responsibility it find marty a trifle less shy and reticent than when he come to cartwright and jw jr a shade more studious marty would miss phi beta kappa but only by the merest fraction jw would rank about number twenty-seven in a graduate class of forty-five marty have successfully represent he college twice in debate and jw have play second on the nine and end in the eleven do each job better than well but rarely draw the spotlight he way curiously enough you have but to talk to marty and you would learn that jw jr be the finest athlete and the most popular student in school conversely jw jr be prepare to set cartwright 's debate record as incarnate in marty against that of any other college in the state what be more he cherish a unshakable confidence that the rev martin luther shenk would be one of the lead minister of he conference within five year and so they come to commencement with the shenk and the farwell family pastor drury and marcium dayne in the throng of visitor mr drury rarely miss commencement at cartwright and naturally he could not stay away this year the farwell think marcium might like to see she old schoolmate graduate and the boy have write she that they want somebody they could trot around during commencement week who might be trust to join in the i know he when chorus without be tempt to introduce devastating reminiscence and marcium be in love with life and youth have be delight to accept the combined invitation she be not at all in love with either of the boy nor they with she they think they know where she heart have be give and they count joe carbrook a lucky man tell we marcium say jw jr one afternoon as the three of they be down by the lake how it happen you go to the training school instead of the normal school last year that be just like a man say marcium here be i you awed and admiring slave bring on to adorn the crowning event of you scholastic career and you do not even remember that i finish the normal school course in three year and graduate a year ago marty roll over on the sand in wordless glee aw now marcia why -- jw jr boggle fairly catch but soon recover himself you must have be ashamed of it then i do remember something about you get through now you mention the fact but why do not i receive a invitation answer I that young lady oh we educator do not think commencement amount to so much as all that with we you know life be real life be earnest and so forth but i 'll tell you the truth jw i know you could not come either of you and i be save up a little on commencement expense so i leave you -- and a good many other -- off the list i need the money that be the simple fact and the reason you do not see I at home last summer be because i be busy spend the money i have save on you invitation and other expensive thing marty usually wait for jw but the idea which now occur to he demand utterance say marcium i think it be fine of you to be study dispensary work and first aid how do you know marcium demand never mind i see joe carbrook in chicago when we go through on we way to the buckland-cartwright debate and i guess a good deal more than he tell I which be not much marty say marcia she face aglow and she brave eye look into he there be nothing secret about it when joe get through medical school we shall go out together to whatever field they choose for he the least i can do be to get ready to help be that why you have be go to training school ask jw they have so long be use to such complete frankness with each other that the question be take as mean yes jw it be say marcium joe have be do perfectly splendid work in he medical course and they say he will probably turn out to be a wonderful all-round doctor -- everybody be surprise at he thoroughness except I i know what he mean by it but of course he have little time for training in other sort of religious work and so ever since last June i have be divide my time between a settlement dispensary and the training school why should not i be as keen on my preparation as he be on he when we be go out to the same work you should marcia -- you should jw agree vigorously and we be proud of you be not we marty i remember think two year ago what fine missionary pioneer you two would make only trouble be we 'll never know anything about it after we have once see you picture in _ the epworth herald _ among the recruit of the year if you be only go where a feller could hope to visit you once every two year or so marcium look out across the lake but she be not see the white sail that glide along above the ripple blue of its water in a moment she pull herself together and observe that there have be enough talk about a mere visitor what of you two now that you student occupation 's go tell she about yourself marty say jw she know what i be go to do and for the moment it seem to he a very drab and unromantic prospect in spite of he agreement with mr drury that all service rank alike with god marty be always slow to talk of himself it be not much he say the district superintendent be ask I to fill out the year on the elli and valencium circuit -- the present pastor be go to colorado for he health so i be to be the young circuit-rider and he smile a wry little smile he have no conceit of himself to make the appointment seem poor rather he wonder how any circuit would consent to put up with a boy 's crude preaching and awkward pastoral effort but jw jr be otherwise mind a country circuit for marty do not accord with he view at all marty be too good for a country church he argue mainly from he memory of the bare little one-room meetinghouse of he early childhood in he periodical trip to the farm he have see the old church grow older and more forlorn as one family after another move away and the multiply car bring the town and its allurement almost to the front gate of every farm so jw have try to say no for marty who would not say it for himself it be one of the rare time when they do not see eye to eye but it make no difference in they sturdy affection nothing ever could and marty would take the appointment commencement over for the first time in many year the chum go they separate way marty to he circuit and jw home to delafield then for a little while each have frequent dark-blue day without quite realize what make he world so flavorless but that pass and the young preacher settle down to he preach and the young merchant to he merchandising and soon all thing seem as if they have be just so through the year to jw come just one indication of the change that college have make pastor drury though he find it wise to do much of he important work in secret thought to make use of the college-consciousness which most town possess in June and which be feel especially though not confess by the college colony the year 's diploma be still very new in June so a college night be announce for the social room with a college sermon to follow on the next Sunday night the league and the senior Sunday school department unite to send a personal invitation to every college graduate in town and to every student home for the vacation they respond four score of they to the college-night call as jw move about and greet people he have know for year he begin to realize that college have its own freemasonry these other graduate be from all sort of school two have be to harvard and one to princeton several be state university alumnus cartwright be represent by nine six of they undergraduate and the other confess themselves as be from chicago syracuse de pauw three or four sort of wesleyan northwestern knox wabash western reserve and many more not even all methodist by any means jw perceive and yet the fellowship among these stranger be very real they speak each other 's tongue they have common interest and common experience he tell himself that here be a suggestion as to the new friend he might make in delafield without forget the old one and the prospect of life in delafield begin to take on new value on the next Sunday night not so many college people be out to hear mr drury 's straight-thinking and plain-spoken sermon on what we town ask of its college-trained youth and a few of those who come be incline to resent what they call a lecture on manners and duty but to jw the sermon be precisely the challenge to service he have be look for it make up for he feeling at commencement that he be out of it it complete all which mr drury have suggest at the institute camp fire four year ago all that he himself have try to say at the decision service on the day after the camp fire all that the pastor have urge two year ago when jw jr confess to he he new hesitation and uneasiness the pastor have not preach any great thing he have simply tell the college folk in he audience that no matter where they have go to school many people have invest much in they and that the investment be one which in its very nature could not be realize on by the original investor the only possible beneficiary be either the successive college generation or the community in which they find they place if they choose to take as personal and unconditional all the benefit of they education none could forbid they that anti-social choice but if they accept education as a trust a stewardship something to be use for the common good they would be worth more to delafield than all the new factory the chamber of commerce could coax to the town and to those who might be interested in this view of education pastor drury say : young people of the college you have be train to some form of laboratory work in chemistry in biology in geology -- yes even in english i invite you to think of you own town of delafield as you living laboratory in which you will be at once experimenter and part of the experiment stuff look at this town with all its good and evil its die power and its new force its dullness and its enthusiasm its folly and wisdom its old way and its new people its wealth and want do you think it be already become a bit of the kingdom of god or if you conclude that it seem to be go in way that lead very far from the kingdom do you think it might possess any kingdom possibility if you do no matter what you occupation in delafield delafield itself may be you true vocation you call from god for john wesley farwell jr it be to become all of that chapter iv explore main street jw jr find small opportunity to make himself obnoxious by become a civic missionary before the time he be busy enough with he adjustment to the business life of delafield and madison county this be the declare commercial sphere of the john w farwell hardware company jw always have know hardware but hitherto in a purely amateur and detach fashion now he live with it from tack to tractor ten or twelve hour a day he find that be the son of he father gain he no safe conduct through the shop or with the customer he have a lot to learn even if he be john wesley farwell jr that he be the heir apparent to all this array of cast iron and work and galvanize of tin and wire and steel and aluminum and nickel do not save he from ache back and skin knuckle nor from the various initiation stage by the three or four other employee but he be get he bearing and not from the store and the warehouse only a good hardware store in a country town be a center of democracy for town and country alike in what other place do farmer and artisan country woman and city woman meet on so nearly equal term not in the postoffice nor in the bank and certainly not in the department store but the hardware store 's customer man and woman all be master of the tool they work with and whoso love the tool of he craft be brother to every other craftsman it be in the store therefore that jw begin to absorb some of the knowledge and acquire some of the experience that be to make he work something to he town for one thing he get a new view of local geography in term of tool all the farmer from the bottom of mill creek call for pretty much the same implement the upland farm have different need the farmer ' wife who live along the route of the creamery wagon have one sort of trouble with tinware the woman of the fruit farm another jw know this by the exchange of experience he listen to while he sell milk strainer and canning outfit he find out that the people on the edge of town who make garden be particular about certain tool and equipment which the wheat farmer would not even look at and the townpeople he learn to classify in the same way he be soon on good term with those store clerk who be handy man about the house with woman who do all they own work with blacksmith and carpenter with unskilled laborer and garage mechanic in time he could almost tell where a man live and what he do for a living just by the hardware he buy and the question he ask about it heretofore jw have think he know most of the people in delafield but the first week in the store show he that he know only a few up to this time most of the people in delafield have mean practically he school friend the clerk and salespeople in certain store -- and the member of the first methodist church that be to say in the main to he delafield have be the church and the church have be delafield but now he realize that he church be only a small part of delafield the town have other church it have lodge when the store outfit odd fellow ' hall with new window shades he learn that the odd fellow share the place with strong lodge of the maccabee and modern woodman and there be other hall jw farwell sr be a mason but these other lodge seem to have as many member as the mason and one or the other of they be always get ready for a big public display the same condition be true of the country people he begin to hear about the farm federation and the grange and the farmer ' elevator and the cooperative creamery for member of all of these group pass in and out of the store one day jw remark to the pastor who have drop into the store : mr drury i never notice before how this place be alive with society and club and lodge and thing everybody seem to belong to three or four organization and they talk about 'em but i do not hear much about we church and nothing at all about the old church out at deep creek yet i use to think that the church be the whole thing the older man nod it be true jw he say all the church together be only a small part of the community they be the best and usually the best-organized force we have i be sure of that but the church and the town have to reckon with these other what good be they all they must cost a pile of money what for that be what you might call a whale of a question jw john w farwell senior who have be stand by listen essay to answer and you have not hear yet of all the organization look at I for example i belong to the chamber of commerce and the rotary club i be on the executive committee of the madison county horticultural society and i have just retire from the board of director of the civic league then you must think of the political party and the county Sunday school association and the annual chautauqua and i do not know what all yes and i notice dad that a good many of these say jw jr be just for the man the woman must have nearly as many why delafield ought to be a model town and the country ` round here ought to be a regular paradise with all these helper and uplifter on the job but it be not maybe they be not all on the job that be about it my boy he father agree i sometimes think we need just one more organization -- a society that would never meet but between the meeting of all the other society would actually get do the thing they talk about and pass resolution about and then go off and forget until the next meeting well dad what i want to find out jw say as he start off with mr drury to the post office be where the church head in mr drury be sure it have a big responsibility and maybe it have but what be it willing to do and able to do and what will the town let it do it seem to I that be the question jw hear he father 's voice echo after he up the street sure that be the question and mr drury add three question in one jw find himself take notice in a way he have not do before through all he year in delafield as might be expect he have come home from college with new idea and new standard the town look rather more sordid and commonplace than be he boy 's remembrance of it of late it have take to grow and a large part of its development have come during he college year so he must need learn he own town all over again cherish he young college graduate 's vague new enthusiasm for a better world he have little sympathy with much that delafield opinion acclaimed as progress the delafield daily dispatch carry at its masthead every afternoon one or more of such slogan as these : be a delafield booster boost for more industry put delafield on the map double delafield in half a decade delafield the darling of destiny watch delafield grow but do not stop boost to rubber these be take by many citizen as a sort of business gospel any theorist who venture to question the wisdom of bring more people to town whether the town 's business could give they all a decent living or not be tell to sell he hammer and buy a horn jw say nothing he be too young and too recent a comer into the town 's business life but he could not work up any zeal for this form of town loyalty a big cannery have be build down near the river where truck garden flourish and there be a new furniture factory at the edge of the freight yard hereabouts a lot of supremely ugly flat have go up two family to each floor and three story high and in jw 's eye the rubbish and disorder and generally slattern appearance of the region be no great addition to delafield 's attraction still more do the tumbledown shack in the neighborhood of the cannery offend the eye and to be frank the ear and nose as well it be a forlorn-looking lot of hovel occupy by listless frowsy adult and noisy child here existence seem to be a grim caricature of life the child the only symbol of abundance to be see continue to be grotesque in they very dirt what clothes they have be second or third-hand garment too large for they which they seem to be perpetually in danger of lose altogether to jw delafield have always be a town of home but in these dismal quarter there be little to answer to the home idea they be merely place where people contrived to camp for a time longer or shorter none but a gradgrind could call they home one of the factory foreman be a great admirer of mr drury who introduce he to jw one day when the foreman have come to the store for some tool he have talk with jw and in time a rather casual friendliness develop between they it be this same foreman angus macpherson a scot with a name for shrewdness who give the boy he first glimpse of what the factory and the cannery mean to delafield -- especially the factory jw be down at the factory to see about some new band-saw that have be install and he errand finish he stop for a chat with angus this factory be not here when i go off to college he say what ever bring it to delafield at that macpherson be off to a perfect start ye see my boy he begin delafield be so central it be a good town for a good-working plant freight on lumber and finish stuff be not so high as in some place and then there be labor lot of husky fellow around here want better than farm wages and they want a chance at town life as well man from the big city with family hope to find a quieter cheaper place to live so we have have no trouble get help skill be not essential for most of the work it be not much of a trick nowadays to get by in most factory -- the machine do most of the think for you and that be good in some way only the man that ` tend the machine can not work up much pride in the output thing go well enough when business be good but when the factory begin to run short time and lay man off like it do last winter there be trouble jw want to know what sort of trouble oh well say macpherson strike hurt worst at the time but strike be just like boil a sign of something wrong inside and short-time and lay-off -- well ye can not expect the factory to go on make golden oak rocker just to store in the shed somebody have to buy 'em but the boy be not happy over four-day week let alone no job at all he sociology professor at cartwright jw recall have talk a good deal about the labor question but maybe this foreman know something about it too so jw put it up to he : what be at the bottom of it all macpherson what make the thing the papers call ` labor unrest ' macpherson hesitate a moment then he settle himself more comfortably on a pile of board and proceed to deliver he soul or part of it i can tell you but there be they that would ship I out of town if i talk too much so i 'll have to be careful john wesley you have get a grand name and the church john wesley start have a good name though it be not my church i be a scot you know but i know you preacher and he and i be of the same mind about this i know well then if you methodist church could find a method with labor it would get hold of the same sort of common people as the one who hear jesus gladly these working-man be not in the way of be saint ye ken but they think that somewhere there be a rotten spot in the world of factory and shop and mill they think they learn from experience who by the way be the dominie of a high-priced school that they get most of the loss and few of the profit of industry they get a living wage when time be good when time be bad they lose the one thing they have get to sell and that be they day 's work when a loaf day be go there be nothing to show for it and no way to make it up maybe that be as it should be but the worker can not see it especially if the boss can still buy gasoline and tire when the plant be idle oh yes laddie i know the work man be headstrong i 'll tell you privately i think he be a fool because so often he get into a blind rage and want to smash the very tool that earn he bite and sup he may have reason to hate some employer but why hate the job it be a good job if he make good chair he go on strike many 's the time without care that it hurt he and he worse than it hurt the boss and often the boss think he want nothing bigger than a few more thing maybe he _ be _ wild for a phonograph and a ford and golden oak rocker of he own in the parlor and photograph enlarged in crayon hanging on the wall -- and a steady job but listen to I john wesley jr and you 'll be a credit to you namesake : these wild unreasonable worker with all they foolishness and sometimes wickedness be while dream of a different world a better world for everybody ` twould be no harm if some boss dream more about that too I boy you preacher -- he be a fine man too be mr drury -- he understand that and he want to use it for something to build on that be why i tell folk he be a methodist preacher with a real method in he ministry now i 'll quit I fashin ' and get back to the job i doubt you 'll be busy yourself this afternoon he grip jw 's hand so that the knuckle be unable to forget he all day but what he have say grip harder than he handshake if the furniture factory be a mixed blessing what of the cannery somewhat to he own surprise jw be get interested in he town but if at first he be incline to wonder how he happen to develop all this new concern he soon cease to think of it so slight a matter could not stay in the front of he think when he really begin to know something of the delafield to which he have never pay much attention it be through joe carbrook that he get he next jolt joe now spend he vacation in way that amaze people who have memory of he wild younger manner be in and out of the farwell store a good deal also he spend considerable time with pastor drury though there be no record of what they talk about jw old boy joe ask one day come away from the pastor 's study have you ever by any chance observe main street why yes jw answer see that two or three or four time a day i walk six block of it back and forth to this store door i suppose i have oh yes that way joe come back at he and you have see I a thousand time but do you ever observe I my ear for instance and he put he hand over they which one be the larger without in the least understanding what he friend be drive at and stupidly wonder if he ever have notice any difference in joe 's ear jw stare with inane bewilderment be one really larger than the other he ask helplessly joe take he hand down and laugh i know it he say you have never observe my ear and yet you think you have observe main street as it happen each of my ear take the same-sized ear-muff but you do not know it well never mind ear i be think about main street what do you know of main street jw think he could make up for the ear question so he say boldly joe carbrook i can name every place from here to the livery barn north and from here to the bridge south on both side of the street want I to prove it no jw i do not i reckon you can but i believe you be still as blind as i have be about main street just the same i know chicago pretty well and i doubt if there be as big a percentage of graft and littleness and dollar-pinching and go to the devil generally on state street or wabash avenue as there be a main street delafield you be not try to say that we business man be crook be you joe jw ask with a touch of resentment you know i happen to be connect with a business house on main street myself sure i know it and there be marshall field 's on state street and lyon & healy 's on wabash avenue and hart schaffner & marx over by the chicago river just the same as here but i -- well of course there be a story back of it all mother hear a couple of week ago that one of we old epworth league girl be have a hard time of it -- she be work at the racket store help to support she folk they have have sickness and the girl do not get big wages so mother ask I to look she up mother can not get about very easily you know and since i be study medicine she seem to think i be the original mr fix-it i make a few discreet inquiry discreet that be for I and can you guess who that girl be you can not i know well she be alma wetherell and that be the identical girl who give I such a dress down one day at the cartwright institute four year ago remember say jw that day she tell I so much of the deadly truth about myself that i hate she even more for know what to say than i do for say it but she have a big lot to do with wake I up and i owe she something jw have not remember the institute incident but he recall that alma be at cartwright that summer and he have see she at church occasionally since he come home from college she be live in town and work in some store or other he know but that be all what do you find out he ask joe i find out enough so that alma have a better job and thing be go easier at home but that be just a starter my brave john wesley do you remember you college sociology and economics and civic and all the rest never mind confess you do not i do not either but i begin to review 'em in actual business practice first i tell the right merchant what sort of a bookkeeper i have find slave away for ten dollar a week on the dark smelly balcony of the racket -- and he be give alma a job at twenty in a sun-lighted office then i tell mr peter of the racket what i have do and why he do not like it but it will do he good that make I feel able to settle anything and i be look around for my next joy as journeyman rescuer and expert business adjuster honest jw i have not see near all there be to see but i be swamp already you have get to come along you and some other and see for yourself what be the matter with main street not all at once but before very long jw share joe 's arouse interest pastor drury be with they of course and the three call into consultation a few other capable and trustworthy man and woman marcium dayne have come home for a few week ' holiday and at once enlist alma wetherell be able to give some highly significant suggestion there be no noise of trumpet and no publicity of any sort mr drury insist that what they need first and most be not newspaper attention and not even organization but exact information so for many day a group of puzzle and increasingly astonished people set about the study of they own town 's principal street as though they have never see it before and in truth they never have it be no different from all other small town business district the gem theater vie with the star and the orpheum in lavish display of gaudy poster advertise picture that be come to-morrow and in two week of observation the investigator learn what sort of move picture delafield demand or at least what sort it get they take note of the amethyst coterie 's Saturday night dance -- wardrobe 50 cent lady free -- and of the boy and girl who patronize the place the various cigar and pocket-billiards combination be quietly observe some of the observer learn for the first time that young man be so determine to get together that they be not to be deter by dirt or bad air or foul and brainless talk the candy store with soda fountain and some of the drug store which serve refreshment take on a new importance instead of be no more than handy purveyor of sweet of soft drink and household remedy they be see to be also social center place for date and telephone flirtation and dalliance much of they doings be the merest silly time-killing but generally the youthful patron welcome all this because it be a change from the empty dullness of home that have miss the home secret and from the still duller and waste monotony of uninteresting toil it be pastor drury who suggest the explanation for all these form of profitless and often dangerous amusement he be chat with the whole group one night and merely happen to address himself first to jw jr you great namesake jw be so much a part of he day that he believe with most other great religious thinker of he time that play be a device of the devil he belief belong to eighteenth-century theology and psychology but even more it grow out of the vicious diversion of the rich and the brutalize amusement of the poor both be bad and there be not much middle ground but here on main street we see people most of they young who feel without always understand why that they simply must be amuse they feel it so strongly that they will pay any price for it if circumstance will not let they get it any other way and main street be ready to oblige they there could be no amusement business if people be not clamor to be amuse and we know now why we have no right to say that all this clamor be the devil 's prompt be not it queer that the church be only now begin to believe in the genuineness and wholesomeness of the play instinct though it be a proper and natural human hunger literally everybody want to play people pay more for the gratification of this hunger than they do for bread or shoe or education or religion they take greater moral risk for it than they do for money we have see people who undoubtedly be go to the devil by the amusement route unless something be do to stop they they go wrong quicker and oftener in they play than in they work be we go to be content with denounce the dance hall and the poolroom and the vile picture and the loose conduct of the soft-drink place and electric park have not we some sort of duty to see that every young person in delafield have a chance at first-hand enjoyable and decent play all agree that the pastor be right though they be not so clear about what could be do but commercialize amusement be not all they find in they quiet voyage of discovery up and down main street the chain store have come to delafield -- not the 5 and 10 only but store which specialize in grocery tobacco shoe dry goods drug and other commodity alongside of they be the locally own store altogether main street have far too many store to afford good service or reasonable price with all this duplication on the one hand and absentee-control on the other main street be a street of underling -- clerk and salespeople and delivery man that condition produce low wages and inefficient method many of the worker be too young to be out of school and too dense to show any intelligence about the work they be suppose to do cheap help be costly and the efficient help be scarcely to be find at any price the investigator be frankly dismay at the extent and complexity of the situation they have think to find occasional case call for adjustment or even for the law but instead they have find a whole fabric of interwoven question -- amusement wages competition cooperation ignorance vulgarity vice cheapness trickery business be business true they have find more honest business than shady one more faithful clerk than shirker more decent people in the pleasure resort than doubtful people but the total of folly and evil be very great could the church do anything to decrease it and that question lead the little company of inquisitive christian into yet wider reach of inquiry jw and joe and marcium at mr drury 's suggestion agree to be a sort of unofficial committee to find out about the church of delafield he tell they that this be first of all a work for layman the preacher might come in later joe invite the other to the new carbrook home on the height into which he people have lately move the height be a new thing to jw -- a rather exclusive residential quarter which have be lay out park-wise in the last four or five year with house in the midst of wide lawn a height club house and tennis court and a exquisite little gothic church when we folk first talk about move out here i think it be all right and i do yet in some way explain joe but the height be get a little too good for I i be not as keen about be exclusive as i use to be i have think lately that exclusiveness may be just as bad for people inside the gate as for the people outside but here we be as the atlantic city whale say when the ebb tide strand it in front of the board walk what be we up to we three we be up to find out about the town church say jw maybe they can help the town more than they do but we do not know how and so far we have not find anybody else who know how and marcium say : at least we know some thing we have the figure about one delafield citizen in seven go to church or Sunday school on Sunday church membership be one in ten and as many people go to the movie and the columbium vaudeville and the dance hall and poolroom on Saturday as go to church on Sunday to say nothing of the crowd that go on the other five day joe carbrook whistle that be a tough nut to crack gentle people he say because you have simply get to think of those other five day the chance be that four time as many people in delafield go to other public place as go to church and Sunday school what can the church do ask jw you can not make people go to church no assent marcium and if you could it would be foolish we want to make people like the church not hate they one thing i believe we church can do be to put they public service more into method and form that do not have to be take for grant or just mentally dodge half the time people do not know what a religious service really stand for mean by that -- joe query as much to hear marcium talk as for the sake of what she might say well they have see and hear it since they be child when they be little they do not understand it and now it be so familiar that they forget they do not understand it marcium respond not wholly oblivious of joe 's strategy but too much in earnest to care i have hear of a successful preacher in the east who seem to be make they understand he say he try to put into each service four thing -- light music motion that be change -- and a touch of the dramatic why not i think it could be do without destroy the solemnity of the worship they do it in the temple at jerusalem and they do it in saint peter 's at rome and in westminster abbey and saint john 's cathedral in new york why should not we do it here in we little church make a note of it jw order joe it be worth suggest to some of the preacher jw make he note rather absently and offer a conclusion of he own : the church must take note of the town 's sore spot too i have find out that crowd people in tenement and shack mean disease and immorality be not that the church 's affair angus macpherson have teach I that when the job be go little crime come follow by bigger one and sickness come too with the death rate go up baby be bear to unmarried mother and baby with name or without die off a lot faster in the river shack and the east side tenement than they do up this way maybe the church could not help all this even if it know but i be for ask it to know i 'll vote for that joe assert if you 'll vote for my proposition which be this : we church must quit try just to be prosperous they must quit compete for business like rival barker at a street fair they must begin to find out that they only reason for existence be the service they can give to those who need it most they have get to believe in each other and work with each other and with all the other town force that be try to make a better delafield that be right say jw i be talk to mr drury this morning and i ask he what he would think of we start a suggestion list he say it ought to be a fine thing but he want we to do it all ourselves just the same we can take we suggestion to he and then if he believe in they he can talk to the other preacher about they and of course about any idea of he own because you know i be pretty sure he have be think about all this a good deal longer than we have it be agree that the list should be start marcium be not willing to keep it to themselves she want to have it talk about in league and Sunday school and prayer meeting and then when everybody have be give the chance to add to it and to improve on it -- but not to weaken it -- that it be put out for general discussion among all the church and then say joe carbrook we might call it ` the everyday doctrine of delafield ' if we stick to the thing every citizen will admit he ought to believe and do the church will still have all the chance they have now to preach those thing which must be leave to the individual conscience that be the beginning of a document with which delafield be to become very familiar in the month which follow never before have the town be so generally interested in one set of idea and to this day you can always start a conversation there by mention the everyday doctrine of delafield the methodist preacher give they they final form but he take no credit for the substance of they though secretly he be vastly proud that the young people and especially jw should have so thoroughly follow up he first suggestion of a civic creed the everyday doctrine of delafield 1 every part of delafield be as much delafield as any other part we be citizen of a commonwealth and delafield should be in fact as well as name a democratic community 2 whenever two delafield citizen can better do something for the town than one could do it they should get together and the same hold good for twenty citizen or a hundred or a thousand one of the town 's motto should be delafield be not divide 3 everything will help delafield if it mean better people in better home with better chance at give they child the right bringing-up but anything which merely mean more people or more money or more business be likely to cost more than it come to we will boost for delafield therefore but we will first be careful 4 every part of delafield be entitle to clean street and plenty of air water and sunlight it be perhaps possible to be a christian amid ugliness and filth but it be not easy and it be not necessary 5 every family in delafield have the right to a place that can be make into a home at a cost that will permit of family self-respect proper privacy and the ordinary decency of civilized living every case of poverty in delafield should be consider as a reflection on the town as be preventable and curable by remedy which any town that be careful of its good name can apply 6 delafield believe that beauty pay better than ugliness therefore she be for tree and flower green lawn and clean street paint where it properly belong and everybody set a good example by care for he own premise and so incite he neighbor to outdo he 7 the only industry delafield need be those which can provide for they operation without force worker to be idle so much of the time as to reduce apparent income and so to cause poverty sickness and temptation to wrongdoing the standard of income ought to be for the year and not by the day in the interest of home rather than in the interest of lodge house and lunch room 8 delafield can support or should find way to support the worker need in she store shop and factory at fair pay without make use of child who should continue in school and without reckon on the desperation of those make poor by they dependence on a job 9 amusement in delafield can be and ought to be clean self-respecting and available for everybody this call for playground and weekday playtime as well as plenty of recreational opportunity provide by the church without money-making feature 10 the form of amusement provide for pay can be and should be influence by public opinion positively express rather than by public indifference any picture house would rather be praise for bring a good picture to town than condemn for show a bad one picture people enjoy praise as much as preacher do 11 delafield 's many organization should tell the whole town what they be try to do so that unnecessary duplication of plan and purpose may first be discover and then do away with 12 whenever a delafield church or club or society propose to engage in a work that be to benefit the town the plan ought to be make known and in due time the result should be publish as widely as be the plan this will help we to learn by we delafield failure as well as by we delafield success 13 the church of delafield be delafield property as the school be though pay for in a different way neither school nor church exist for they own sake but for delafield and then some 14 every church in delafield should have a definite parish and every well-defined section or group should have a church the churched should lead in provide for the unchurched and the overchurch might spare out of they abundance of worker and equipment some of the resource that be need 15 the first concern of all the church should be to reach the unchurched and to make church friend of the church-hater this go for all the church it be more important to get the sense of god and principle of jesus into the thought of the whole town than to set protestant and roman catholic in mutually suspicious and hateful opposition devout jew and sincere christian must realize that righteousness in delafield can not be attend to by either without the other 16 the church of delafield believe that all matter of social concern -- work wages housing health amusement and moral -- be part of every church 's business therefore they will not cease to urge they member always to deal with these matter as christian citizen not merely as christian 17 every child and young person in delafield ought to be in the day school on weekday and in Sunday school on Sunday delafield discourage needless absence from one as much as from the other 18 delafield want the best possible teacher teach in all she school she insist on trained teacher on week day and need they on sunday therefore she believe that teacher-training be part of every church 's duty to delafield there be one thing about all this that bother I say jw when they have finish the final draft of the every day doctrine not that it be the only one but some of these doctrine stand small chance of be put into practice until the church people be willing to spend more money on such work it can not be do on the present income of the church or by the usual money-raising method that be a fact joe carbrook agree i would already make up my mind that the carbrook would have to dig a little deeper and so must everybody else who care yes but how to get everybody else to care that be the trouble jw persist dad 's one of the steward you know and they find it no easy job to collect even what the church need now they have a deficit to worry with every year almost marcium dayne be the only other member of the let 's know delafield group who happen to be present at this last meeting she have be wait for a chance to speak i be surprised at you two she say do not you know the only really workable financial way out well not exactly jw admit i suppose if we could only get people to care more they would give more it be a matter of let they know the need and all that i guess for instance -- marcium be not ready for he for instance john wesley jr she interrupt with mock severity as a thinker you have shine at time with a good deal more brilliance than that if you have say it just the other way ` round you would have be nearer right people _ will _ give if they care of course but it be even more certain that they will care if they give the thing we need be to show they how to give joe carbrook break into a incredulous laugh in other word my fair marcium you want christian to give before they care what it be they be give to or even know about it do not you think we church will be a long time finance the every day doctrine on that system joe and marcium never hesitate to take opposite side in a discussion and always with good-humored frankness so marcium come back promptly : i know you think it unreasonable she say but there be a condition you overlook we become christian long before any of we think about study delafield 's need and if we and all the rest of the christian of the town have accept we financial relation to the kingdom and have act on it from the start there would always be money enough and to spare oh yes joe say understandingly i see now you mean the tithe marcium know no matter how that joe have begin to think about tithing and this seem the opportune time to stress it a little more it could help the every day doctrine and both joe and jw be keen for that so marcium admit that she do mean the tithe i do not pretend to know how it begin any more than i know how real home be establish after the fall or how keep Sunday begin i do know these begin long before there be any fourth or fifth commandment or any child of israel and i have go over all the whole subject with mr drury -- he have a lot of practical pamphlet on the tithe i believe that it be the easiest surest fairest and cheerfulest way of do two christian thing at once -- acknowledge god 's ownership of all we have and go into partnership with god in he work for the world what the book sometimes call christian stewardship i would like to see those pamphlet say jw it be queer you have not see they before this say marcium mr drury have distribute hundred of they but maybe that be when you be away at cartwright anyway i 'll get some for you joe be hold he thought to the main matter marcium say he if you can make good on what you say just now pamphlet or no pamphlet i 'll agree to become a tither first to start where you do how be tithe easier than give whenever you feel like give now though marcium expect no such challenge she be game i be not the one to prove all that but i believe what i say and i 'll try to make good as you put it but please do not say ` give ' when you talk about tithing or even about any sort of financial plan for christian the first word be ` pay ' give come afterward well then tithe be the easiest way because when you be a tither you always have tithe money you begin by set the tenth apart for these use and it be no more hardship to pay it out than to pay out any other money that you have be give with instruction for its use not bad at all say joe now tell we why it be the surest way of use a christian 's money by this time marcium be begin to enjoy herself it be the surest because it almost collect itself no beg no scheme you have tithe money on hand -- and you have almost always -- therefore you do not need to be coax into think you can spare it if the cause be a real claim that be all you need to find out and when you begin to put money into any cause you be go to get interested in that cause besides when all christian tithe there will be more than enough money for every good work jw have not think much of the tithe except as be one of those religious fad and he know that every church have a few religious faddist but he have long cherish a vast respect for marcium 's good sense and what she be say seem reasonable enough he wonder if it could be back up by evidence joe smilingly take up the next excellence of the tithe which marcia have name let I see do you say that the tithe be the fairest of all christian financial scheme not that exactly marcia correct i say it be the fairest way of acknowledge god 's ownership and of work with he in partnership and it be it put definiteness in the place of whim it be proportional to we circumstance it be not difficult mr drury say that forty year ' search have fail to find a tither who have suffer hardship because of pay the tithe well joe jw put in if marcium can produce the evidence on these three point you may as well take the fourth for grant if tithing be the easiest surest and fairest plan of christian stewardship seem to I it be just get to be cheerful i be go to look into it and if she be right as i should not wonder it be up to you and I to get we finances onto the ten per cent basis joe be never a reluctant convert to anything when he see the new way he instinct be for immediate action let 's go over to mr drury 's he propose and see if we can not settle this thing to-day i hope marcium 's right and he look into she eye with a glance of something more than friendly and if she be i be ready to begin tithe to-day pastor drury always a busy man reckon interview like this as urgent business always not once nor twice but many time in the course of a year he quiet indirect work result in similar expedition to he study and as a rule he know about when to expect they he produce the pamphlet add a few suggestion of he own and let the three young people do most of the talk they stay a long time no one care about that as they be thank the pastor before leave joe say with he usual directness marcium _ be _ right and here 's where i begin to be a systematic christian as far as my dealings with money be concerned jw not in the least ashamed to follow joe 's lead say same here wish i would know it sooner now we have get to preach it and joe say to mr drury in the last moment at the door mr drury if we could all get a conscience about the tithe and pay attention to that conscience half the everyday doctrine would not even need to be state they would be self-evident and the other half could be put into practice with a bang the delafield _ dispatch _ get hold of a copy of the everyday doctrine and print the whole of it with a not unfavorable editorial comment under the caption when will all this come true but walter drury when he see it say to himself it have already come true in a very real sense for john wesley jr and these other believe in it and he know it mark one more stage of the experiment so that he could thank god and take courage chapter v here the alien there the little brown church it be all very well to work out the everyday doctrine of delafield to secure they adoption and application by all the church of delafield be another matter the unofficial committee scatter for one thing joe carbrook go back to medical school and marcium to the settlement and the training school marty be travel he circuit j w and the pastor and a few other continue they study of the town nobody have yet venture to talk about expert but it begin to be evident that the situation would soon require thoroughgoing and skilled assistance otherwise all that have be learn would surely be lose one day in the late fall a stranger drop in at the farwell hardware store and ask for mr jw farwell jr he have call first on pastor drury who be expect he and that diplomat have say to he go see jw i think he 'll help you to get something start jw with two of the other clerk be unload a shipment of stovepipe the mark of he task be conspicuous all over he and he scarcely look the part of the public-spirited young methodist but the visitor be accustom to know man when he see they under all sort of disguise jw call to the front of the store meet the visitor with a good-natured question gaze mr farwell i be manford conover of philadelphium back there we have hear something of the ` everyday doctrine of delafield ' and i have be send to find out about they -- and they author send jw repeat why should anybody send you all the way from philadelphium to delafield just for that he could not know how much pastoral and even episcopal planning be back of that afternoon call do not think that we reckon it to be unimportant mr farwell say mr conover pleasantly you see i be from a methodist society with a long name and a business as big as its name -- the board of home mission and church extension the thing some of you be start here in delafield be we sort of thing it may supply we board with new business in its line and what we can do for you may make you local work productive of lasting result in other place as well as here jw do not quite understand but he be willing to be instruct for he have find out that the effort to promote the everyday doctrine be forever develop new possibility and at the same time reveal new expanse of delafield ignorance and need anybody who appear to have intelligence and interest be the more welcome they talk a while and then i 'll tell you what propose jw how long do you expect to be in town mr conover reply that as yet he have make no arrangement for leave then let 's get together a few people to-night after prayer meeting we pastor of course and the editor of the _ dispatch _ -- he be the right sort if he do boost ` boost ' a good deal and miss leigh of the high school -- she be all right every way and mr whitehill the president of the woman 's association of we church -- that be the woman 's missionary society and the lady ' aid merge into one -- she be a regular progressive and harry field who be just get hold of he job in the league and the Sunday school superintendent that be dad you know he be have the job for a couple of year now and he be as keen about it as harry be over the league they get together and out of that first simple discussion come all sort of new difficulty for delafield methodism to face and master \* \* \* \* \* manford conover be a preacher with a business man 's training and viewpoint he may have mention he official title when he first appear but nobody remember it when people could not think of he name he be the man from the board which be all the same to he after that first night 's meeting conover give several day to walk about delafield jw have find the shack and the tenement and joe carbrook have introduce jw to main street but it be leave to conover to show he europe and africa in delafield there be a certain town in a middle western state far better know than delafield rich intelligent highly self-content its church and school and club be matter for complacent satisfaction and you would be safe in say that not one in five of its well-to-do people know that the town have a negro quarter a italian section a bohemian settlement a scandinavian community a good-sized greek colony and some other center of culture and custom alien to what they assume be the town 's distinctive character they know of course that such people live in the town -- could not help know it they maid be scandinavian or negro they buy vegetable and candy from the greek they hear of bootlegging and blind tiger among certain foreign group the rough work of the town be do by man who speak little or no english but all this make small impression it be a commonplace of american town life and scarcely ever do it present itself as something to be look into or need to be understand so conover find it to be with delafield the everyday doctrine be well enough but he know a good deal of spade work must be do before they could take root and grow he front a condition which have its counterpart in most american town each of which be two town one be certain well-defined and delimit area where language and brace live amid condition far remove from the american notion of what be endurable and the other the better part of town sometimes smugly call the residence section where white american have home conover and pastor drury compare note they be of one mind as to the condition which conover have find condition not surprising to the minister who know more about delafield than any of he own people suspect one afternoon they meet jw on the street and he lead they into a candy store for hot chocolate as they sip the chocolate they talk jw as usual say whatever he happen to think of say mr conover he remark i notice in all you talk about the foreigner in america you have not once refer to the idea of the melting pot do not you think that be just what america be all these people come here and get americanize and assimilate and all that i would think america be the melting pot if i could see more sign of the melting conover answer but look at delafield how much do the melting pot melt here then he look across the store do you know the proprietor mr farwell he ask yes indeed nick and i be good friend answer jw then i wish you would introduce I return conover oh nick jw call will you come over here a minute nick come wipe he hand on he apron nick say jw do the honor you know mr drury the pastor of we church and this be mr conover from philadelphium a very good friend of ours he be be look around town and want to ask you something nick 's brisk and cheerful manner be at its best for he like jw besides like the trade he bring sure say he i tell he anything if i know it glad for the chance mr dula say conover -- he have take note of the name on the window you know the east side pretty well do you then you know that many italian live just north of linden street and there be a block or so of polish home between linden and the next street south sure i do say nick confidently i live on other side of they myself see 'em every day very well conover go on what i want to know be this : how do the italian and the pole get along together they do not have nothing much to do with one another nick reply it be like this the pole they talk polish and maybe a little english the italian they speak italian and some can talk english only not much but pole they can not talk italian at all and italian can not talk polish so how could they get together that be just the question mr dula conover agree i be tell these gentleman that it be harder for the different foreign-born people to know one another and to be friendly with one another than it be for they to know and associate with american sure mister nick say with great positiveness sure before i speak english i know nobody but greek and when i start learn english i get no time to learn polish or italian or whatever it be english i get to speak if i run a candy store but not those other language and he go off to serve a customer who have just enter there you have that side say conover to the minister and jw the need of english as a americanize force and the meed of it as a medium of communication between the different foreign group look as though we have get to bear down hard on english do not you think as nick say ` sure i do ' mr drury assent it will come out all right with the child i hope they be get the english but it make thing hard just now what can the church do jw put in should it undertake to teach english as that preacher teach phil khami you remember mr drury or americanization or what i think it should do something else first say conover why should we american try to make european understand we unless we first try to understand they be not ours the first move but this be the country they be go to live in return jw they can not expect we to adjust ourselves to european way they have get to do the adjusting have not they why conover come back because we be here first but the indian be here before we we tell he he need not do any adjust at all and see what we have make of he maybe these european can add enrich element to we american culture i guess so but -- and jw be evidently at a loss -- but they have get to obey we law you know and fit into we civilization the indian be different we could not make indian of ourselves and he would not become civilized americanize you mean and conover laugh a little at the irony of it no no not that but he would not meet we half way even jw say i think suggest pastor drury that what mr conover mean be that we would better be a little less stiff to newcomer than the indian be to we be i right exactly right return conover europe be in a general way the mother-land of we all but many of she child be late in get here the earlier one have make they contribution why may not the later one also bring gift for we common treasure well what in particular do you mean asked jw who be find himself adrift he have be quite willing in the institute day to be a admirer of phil khami and to forget that phil be of alien birth but this be something more complicated particulars be not so simple conover say but for instance : some european people have a fine musical appreciation some delight in oratory some be mystical and dreamy some be very child in they love of color some be almost artist in they feeling for beauty in they work some do not enjoy rough play and other can not endure to be quiet some have inherit a passionate love of country and great tradition of patriotism we can not value all these thing in just the way they do but at least we can believe that such interest and instinct be worth something to america then we americanization work will be not only more intelligent but far more sympathetic if i may turn to the immediate business mr drury say with a smile of apology suppose you tell jw what you board have to suggest for we here in delafield mr conover conover turn to jw i wonder if you know anything about centenary church he ask that little old brick barn over in the east bottom why yes or i use to if be quite a church when i be a youngster but i have not be that way lately i guess it be pretty much run down with all those foreigner move in most of the old member have probably move away i know there be two methodist boy with I in high school who live down there but they have move up to the height one of they live next to the carbrook mr drury should take you down that way one of these day say conover and you would find that when you friend move out of the church the foreigner who live nearby do not move in centenary church be run down as you say mr drury add and the few member who be leave do not know which way to turn they have a supply pastor who be not able to do much he get a pitiful salary but they can not pay more and there be no money at all nor any accommodation for any special attention to the newcomer well say conover i be instruct to tell you delafield methodist that the board of home mission and church extension be ready to help make a new centenary church for the people who now live around it we have a department that pay special attention to immigrant and alien population we worker know in general what be need we can put some trained people into centenary with a pastor who know how to direct they work i should not be surprise to see a parish house there and a modernized church building and a fine array of everyday work be do there my but that sound great mr drury do not it ask jw in a glow of enthusiasm then he check himself it sound well enough he say but all that mean a lot of money where 's the money to come from from you of course conover reply but not all or most from you my board be a benevolent board -- that be to say it be the whole church at work in such enterprise as this that be one way in which its share of the church 's benevolent offering be use but you do not mean to tell we say jw incredulously that you can drop in on a place like delafield make up you mind what be need and then dump a lot of money into a played-out church just like that oh it be not so informal as all that conover say the thing have to go through the official channel of course you district superintendent and brother drury and the bishop and several other have have a hand in it already all concern have agree as to the need and possibility but delafield be also a good place to put on a demonstration a actual operating scheme i have be make ready for a survey of the whole east side just a preliminary study and before anything positive be do we must make a more thorough inquiry we expect to find out everything that need to be know there be only one anxiety i have about it pastor drury say and that have be all take away i be keen to have this be a truly christian demonstration -- not just a settlement or a parish house or night school class but a real demonstration of christian service among people who now know little about it in some place these activity be be set go because church people know they ought to do something and it be easier to give money and have gymnasium and move picture than to make real proof of partnership with christ by personal service and sacrifice take you old friend martin luther shenk jw -- do you know that he be work at this very difficulty and i hear he be find even in the country that some people will really give themselves while other will give only they money and they time jw thought of win-my-chum week and how he have have to drive himself to speak to marty so he know the pastor be right and he go home with all sort of question run through he mind but with no very satisfying answer to make they come back in a wakeful night to mr drury 's casual mention of marty the thought of he chum set he to wonder how that sturdy young itinerant be make it go on the elli and valencium circuit just as the pastor guess it might to wonder be to decide he would take a long-desired holiday a word or two with he father in the morning give he the excuse for what he want to do then he get valencium on the long distance and the operator tell he she would find the reverend shenk for he in a few minute he have start out that morning to visit along the state line highway as it be part of she business to know at the third try marty be find and he answer jw 's hail with a shout after the first exchange of noisy greeting say marty dad 's ask I to run down in you part of the world and look at some new barn furniture that be be put in around elli -- ventilator and stanchion and individual drinking cup for the holstein -- not like the way we use to treat the cow on we farm hey well what do you say if i turn fashionable for once and come down for the week-end -- not this week but next no need to ask marty a question like that come on down make it Friday and i 'll show you the sight we have get something do at the elli church something i want you to see then marty thought of a few book that he have leave at home -- and -- hello jw be you listen well how would you like to go out to the farm before you come down here jeanette have gather a bundle of my book and i need 'em will not you get 'em for I and bring they along certainly jw would the farm be home to both the boy and jw be almost as welcome there as marty to one member of the family quite so though she have never mention it on the next Sunday morning jw drive out of town in time to get to the little old church of he childhood for morning service then he would go home with the shenk for dinner spend the afternoon get the book and come home when he be ready there be no hurry jw sr have give he two sunday ' leave of absence from Sunday school the next Sunday would be he and marty 's but this would be he and jeannette 's not that he need to make any special plan for be with jeannette shenk of late he have find the half hour drive down to the old farm the prelude to a pleasant evening sometimes he would make the round trip twice run out to bring jeanette into town when something be go on and take she home afterward in the immemorial fashion as jw turn to the church yard lane lead up to the old horseshed he notice that there be only two car there besides he own -- and one old-time sidebar buggy batter and mud-bedaubed with a decrepit and dejected-looking gray mare between the shaft it be time for meeting and he contrast to-day 's emptiness of the long shed with the crowd vehicle of he childhood memory in those day so tightly be buggy and surry and democrat and even spring wagon and a occasional sulky wedge into the space that it be nothing unusual for the sermon to be interrupt by a uproar in the shed when some peevish horse attempt to set its tooth in the neck of a neighbor with a resultant squealing and plunge a cramping of wheel and a rattle of harness which could neutralize the most vociferous circuit rider 's eloquence at the door jw fall in with the little group of man who accord to ancient custom have wait in the yard for the announcement of the first hymn before end they talk of crop and road and stock and join the woman and child within inside the contrast with the older day be even more striking the church small as it be seem almost empty the shenk be there include jeannette as jw promptly manage to observe father foltz and he middle-aged daughter stand in they accustomed place they have come in the venerable sidebar buggy just as for two decade past mother foltz have not be out of the house in year and among jw 's earliest recollection be those of the cottage prayer meeting that he have attend with he father in mr foltz 's speckless sickroom then there be the four newell and mr bellamy and mr and mr haggard with they two little girl and a few people jw do not know -- perhaps twenty-five altogether no wonder the preacher be dishearten and preach a flavorless sermon where be the boy and girl of even a dozen year ago where the child who begin they Sunday school career in the little recess back of the curtain and where the whole family that once fill the place surely old deep creek church have fall on evil day it be a dismal service with its dreary sermon and its tuneless hymn after the benediction jw shake hand with the preacher whom he know slightly and exchange greeting with all the old friend well john wesley say father foltz with glum garrulity this be not the church you use to know when you be little i mind in they time when you folk live on the farm how we think we would have to enlarge the meetinghouse but it be a good thing we never do it there be room enough now and the old man indulge in a mirthless toothless grimace the shenk do not invite he to dinner they understanding be finer than that pa shenk just say let I drive out first john wesley i 'll go on ahead and open the gate and jw say to jeannette jump into my car jean it be not fair to put everybody into pa shenk 's ford when mine 's younger and nearly empty so that be that all regular and comfortable and proper if mr newell smile as she watch they drive away what of it she be hear to say to mr bellamy i have know for three year that those two ought to wake up and fall in love with each other and they have be slower than father foltz 's old gray mare but it look as though they be get they eye open at last at the farm mr shenk hurry to finish up the dinner preparation with jeannette to help ben and little alice contend for jw 's favor until he take alice on he knee and put one arm about she and the other about she brother standing by the chair and pa shenk talk about the church i reckon i should not complain john wesley he say see that we marty be a country preacher and maybe he 'll be have to handle a job like this some time but i can not believe he will he letter do not read like it but pa shenk say jw do not you suppose the trouble here in deep creek be because you be so near town nine mile be nothing these day but when you first come to the farm there be only one automobile in the township now everybody can go into town to church they can boy pa shenk answer but they do not not all of 'em some do not care enough to go anywhere one-year tenant mostly they be some go to town all right enough but not to church a few go to church i admit but only a few jw start to speak hesitated then blurt it out maybe dad and other like he be responsible for some of the trouble they have pull out and leave just a few to carry the load you be all right of course you really belong here but a lot of the farmer who have move to town have rent they place to what you call one-year tenant and it seem to I that be a poor way to build up anything in the country church or anything else tenant that be always move do not get to know anybody or to count for anything it be not much wonder they be no use to the church there be a good deal in that john wesley say pa shenk you father and I we get along fine we be more like partner than owner and tenant but it be not so with these short-term renter the owner raise the rent as the price of land rise and the tenant be mostly too poor to do anything much after he be pay the rent besides he be get no stake in the neighborhood why should he pay to help build a new church when he be get to move the first of march and the church have be as careless about he as he have be about the church that be what bother I jw comment but even so i should think something could be do to interest these folk they have all get family to bring up something can be do too say pa shenk you remember when the people on upper deep creek use to come here to church four mile or so well now they be go to fairfield church -- owner renter everybody it be surprising how fairfield church be grow that be go away from town not to it and they be as near to town as we be then persist jw how do you account for it only one way my boy say pa shenk i be as much to blame as any but we have have some preacher here that do not seem to understand and then lately we have have preacher who stay in town all the time except on preach Sunday and we scarcely see or hear of 'em all the two week between they have not hold protracted meeting for several year and i be not blame 'em what be the use of hold meeting when you know nobody 's come except people that be convert before we present pastor be bear you say some people be go over to fairfield ask jw why do they go there when they could go to town about as easy well john wesley pa shenk answer soberly i think i know but you say you be go to spend next Sunday with marty from what marty write i have a notion it be much the same on he work as it be at fairfield except that marty have two point wait till next week and then come back and tell we how you explain the difference between deep creek church and elli in the afternoon jeannette and jw take a ride around the neighborhood whose every tree and culvert and rural mail-box they know without in the least be tire of see it they talk be on a old old subject and not remarkable yet somehow it be more to they both than any poet 's rhapsody and they occasional silence be no less eloquent but in a more than usually prosaic moment jeannette say john wesley i wonder if there be any hope to get the deep creek young people interested in church the way they use to be i be just hungry for the sort of good time the older boy and girl use to have when you and marty and i be nothing but child they enjoy themselves and so do everybody else what be the matter with so many country church nowadays to which question jw could only answer : i do not know i do not realize thing be so bad here maybe i 'll get some idea about it next Saturday and Sunday you father seem to think marty be get start on the right track and that remind I do not let I go away without those book he want will you this be not a record of that Sunday afternoon 's drive nor of the many other which follow on other sunday and on the day between some other time there may be opportunity for the whole story of jeannette and jw \* \* \* \* \* as jw drive up to elli corner post office late the next Friday afternoon marty waylay he and demand to be take aboard drive a half-mile further east he say after they boisterous greeting that be where we eat to-night -- at ambery 's then just across the road to the church we have get something special on a box supper ask jw or a bean-bag party but he know better marty tell he to wait and see supper be a pleasant meal the ambery be pleasant people who live in a cozy new house but jw be mystify to hear marty speak of henry ambery as a retired farmer he know retire farmer in town plenty of they and some no happier for be there but in the country oh say marty that be easy we church be the social hub of all this community and i tell the ambery that if they build here they would be as well off as in town i be right too they buy two acre for less than the price of a town lot and they have most of the farm comfort as well as all the modern convenience you do not notice any sign of homesickness do you no jw have not though he know the retired-farmer sort of homesickness when he see it and the ambery be worth more to the church than they ever be marty add i be think of a scheme to colonize two or three other retire farmer within easy reach of this church why not they have get car and can drive to the county seat in a hour if they want to that be better than live there all the time with nothing to do by this the two be at the church a pretty frame building l-shaped with a community house adjoining the auditorium people be begin to arrive in all sort of vehicle -- car mostly jw look for sign of a feed but vainly no spread table no smell of cooking or rattle of dish from the kitchen what be it marty he ask and marty laugh as he answer old-fashioned singing school with some new-fashioned variation that be all certainly it be something which interest the countryside for there be every indication of a crowded house jw hear the singing and note with high approval the variation which modernize the old order he think the idea plenty good enough even for delafield which for he leave nothing more to be say and there _ be _ a feed after all but it be distinctly light refreshment such as jw be use to at delafield first church on the way back to the ambery ' and well into the night in marty 's room they talk about the circuit and its work it be not a circuit rightly you know marty say i preach every Sunday at both place and for the present -- jw grin -- i can get across the whole parish every day if necessary but i be work it a little more systematically than that you must be i can hardly believe even what i have see already jw reply when i be at deep creek last Sunday i be sure it be all off with the country church and on the way down here i pass three abandon meetinghouse so i make up my mind to persuade you out of it you know i be not much in favor of you come here in the first place but maybe that be a bigger job than i think you be right john wesley about that i do not budge if i can make myself big enough for the job it be too interesting and thing be happen there be no danger of this church be abandon but what do you do marty to make thing happen i know they do not just happen i be from the country too remember that what do i do not ` i ' but ` we ' well we work with we head first and we heart then we get out and go at it take we very first social difficulty in delafield you have a dozen place to go to here it be either the church or the schoolhouse -- that be all the choice there be and the schoolhouse have its limitation so we folk have decide to make the church both here and at valencium the center of the community that explain the social hall we call it ` community house ' everything that go on except the barn dance over east that we can not do much with so far go on in the church or start with the church or end at the church that be the first scheme we put over it be fairly easy you know because all we country people be pretty much one lot we have no rich and no really poor and they be not organize to death either as you be in delafield do you try to have something go on every night and nearly every day as brother drury do with we jw ask not quite reply marty we can not we be too busy grow the food for you town folk but we keep up a pretty stiff pace for the preacher i have no time hang on my hand i should think not jw comment if you try to run everything mr drury always seem to have lot of time just because he make the rest of we run the work in delafield first oh he do do he say marty shortly who know something of the older minister 's strategy that be accord to how you look at it i be not above learn from he and i do not run everything either but i be there or thereabout most of the time how do you get time for you study and you sermon then query j w if you be on the go so much marty turn a quizzical look at jw my beloved chum how do you and i get time for we study at cartwright he say besides i be make one hand wash the other the social life here for instance use to be pretty bad before henderson come -- that be the preacher whose place i take it be pull away from the church now it draw to the church henderson start that the people who be my main dependence in the other affair be mostly the same people i can count on in the Sunday school and league and the preach service the more we do the better it be for what we do sunday then there be another because these people and i know one another so well i could not put on air in the pulpit if i want to i have just get to preach straight and i will not preach a thing i can not back up myself i use country illustration show they they own world it be one big white mark for the farwell farm as you might suppose that i know the best side of country life though i do not advertise you real estate i know say jw but do not you find country people pretty hard to manage that be we experience at the store they be particular and critical and think they know just what they want they do too marty assert why should not they i believe i can tell you one big difference between the city boy and the country you have be both see if i be right the country boy mind he folk and he teacher but everything else mind he he be boss of every critter on the place from the hen to the horse whenever he have anything to do with they at all so he learn to think for they as well as for himself in the city the boy have no chance to give order -- he be under order all the time the traffic cop the truant officer the boss in the shop or the office the street car conductor the janitor -- everybody boss he and he boss nothing except he kid brother and sister so he may come to be half cringer and half bully the country boy be not likely to be much afraid and he soon learn that if he try to boss even the boy without good reason it do not pay maybe that be the reason so many country boy make good when they go to the city and the reason why a city boy like I suggest jw would be a misfit in the country oh you scoff marty you do not count you be a half-breed but as i mean to say you be right about country folk they be a little close maybe they be more independent in they business than town people but they learn how to work together they exchange farm work and work the road and they be fairly dependent on one another for all social life on deep creek the tenant farmer be the biggest difficulty you dad tell I last Sunday say jw they go to town when they go anywhere and not to church either i know say marty and i do not much blame 'em from all i hear but henderson change that considerably in this community he find out that the tenant be just as human as the other only they have the idea that nobody care about they because they might be here to-day and go to-morrow and what do you think i find tenant farmer around here be begin to take longer lease one or two be about like dad 's be with you father -- more partner than anything else every renter family in this neighborhood come to we church and only three or four fight shy of we at valencium all right say jw drowsily go to sleep now i have get to inspect that holstein hotel in the morning and i know what country hour be the next day jw drive off toward the big barn of he customer and leave marty deep in the mystery of Sunday 's sermon marty be yet a very young preacher and one sermon a week be all he could manage as several of he admirer have find out to he discomfiture when one Sunday they follow he from ellis in the morning to valencium at night but the twicer profess to enjoy it jw 's farmer be quite ready to talk about the new barn equipment and how it be work and he have remarkably few complaint these more for form 's sake than anything else that business be soon out of the way but farmer bellamy be interested in other thing besides ventilator and horse-fork so you be a friend of we preacher he say in the question affirmative of the deliberate country well he be quite a go-ahead young fellow you never get up early enough to find he work in a cold collar maybe he be a mite ambitious but i do not know jw as always come promptly to marty 's defense he be not ambitious for himself mr bellamy i 'll vouch for that but i should not wonder he be ambitious about he work and maybe that be not a bad thing for a country preacher in these day that be so mr bellamy assent but i doubt we keep he he 'll be get a church in town before long now jw have no instruction from marty but he think he might venture and he have be introduce to a few idea that he have never meet in the day when he object to marty 's take a country circuit i 'll tell you something mr bellamy he say marty be a farmer 's boy who love the country if he have the right sort of backing i should not wonder he stay here a good long time he be get enough plan ahead for this circuit of he mr bellamy laugh he have that if he wait to get 'em all go we be sure of he for a while why he want to make the church the most important business in the whole neighborhood and what be more he be get some of we to see it that way too yes i guess that be he dream jw say and it be so much better than the reality up around where i use to live that i would not head he off if i be you head he off mr bellamy laugh again why do you know what he do in the fall when some of we tell he we could not do much for mission he phone all over the neighborhood the day before he set out with a ton-and-a-half truck he have hire for the job tell we to put into the truck anything we could spare and what do you think before night he drive into hill city with a big overload even for that truck of wheat corn butter egg chicken sausage apple potato and dear know what sell the lot for sixty-nine dollar he pay nine dollar for the truck -- get a rate on it -- and turn in for mission sixty dollar we have never give more than twenty in cash but that be not all next Sunday he report and before any of we could say ` praise the lord ' say he ` do not think the lord 's give any of we much credit for that stuff we owe he a good deal more than a few egg that we 'll never miss i just want to show you that when we country people really start pay we tithe to the almighty we missionary and other offering will make that truckload look like the crumb from we table i have prove that we be rich instead of be too poor to provide for mission and it be all we father 's you know when we pay he we tithe we admit that in the only practical way ' funny thing be the whole business have be so queer nobody get mad over he plain talk some of we have begin to tithe and to enjoy it yes that young feller be quite a go-ahead young feller jw rather admire the tale of the truck it be like marty right enough to get he tithing talk illustrate with a load of produce but there be more than a hint of a new marty with a new directness and confidence so he ask what else be he do that be make a difference and the floodgate be lift the bellamy gift of utterance have a congenial theme for a hour the stream run strong and steady and when it would have stop none could tell but jw remembered he have promise to be back with marty for dinner and so in the midst of a story about marty 's Saturday afternoon outing with the boy highly reminiscent of they own old-time saturday in the deep creek timber jw make he excuse and hurry away in that hour he have hear of the observe of special day thanksgive and christmas particularly of the rage for athletic equipment on every farm which have youngster so that the usual anaemic croquet outfit have give place to basketball practice set indoor-outdoor ball volley-ball net and other paraphernalia some of it not much use now since winter have come but under marty 's leadership a skating rink construction gang have throw up a dirt embankment in a low spot near the creek and then cut a channel far enough upstream to flood about four acre of swamp mr bellamy tell about the skating tournament every afternoon of the cold weather for the school child and Saturday afternoon for the older young folk more people go than skate too the garrulous farmer assert it be just another of that young preacher 's sociability scheme and there be no end to 'em seem like to he there be even more on the business side of country life : how marty have join force with the grange and the county agent and the cooperator of the creamery and the elevator and the school teacher and so on and so on jw would be the last to worry about such a program it just fit he idea but it make he a little more interested in the Sunday service would marty 's preach match he community work but before Sunday morning come jw have other question to ask he put they to marty in interval of the skating race and again after supper before go over to the church to meet a little group of sunday-school folk -- my teacher-partner marty call they -- who be learn with he how to adapt Sunday school science and the teaching art to the condition of the open country all of jw 's question be really one big question : say marty boy i always know you have something in you that do not show on the surface but i never think it be exactly the stuff they need to make up-to-date country preacher how do it happen that you have blossom out in these few month as a mose to lead a ` rural parish ' -- if that be the right scientific name -- out of such a wilderness as i see at deep creek last Sunday marty make a pass at he chum in the fashion of the cartwright day and wait for the return punch before answer do not you ` mose ' I john wesley besides this circuit be no wilderness henderson the preacher who be here before I be just the man for this work he know the country and believe it have the makings of even more attractive life than the town too bad he have to quit but he start these folk think the right way and then do not you remember i write last summer that i be spend two week at a school for rural minister oh yes i remember that jw answer but that be no explanation i spend four year at a college for town and country boy and now look at I two week be a little too short a course to produce miracle even with such a intellect as yours notwithstanding you name be bigger than mine martin luther now if you would say four week i might almost have believe you but two week -- well it just be not do that be all make fun of it will you say marty with another short-arm jab now listen to I that thing be simple enough first off i would be think four year about be a preacher on top of that i would be a country boy for twenty-three year i know the deep creek neighborhood better than you do because i have to live there you be just visit the farm you father pay tax on when i come here i find that henderson have set thing go he tell I what he dream be so when i go to that two-week ' school i be ready to take in every word and see every picture and get a grip on every principle maybe you do not know that it be one of many such school set up by the rural work leader of we home mission board and it be a great school they have no use for rocking-chair ruralist so the faculty instead of be make up of paper expert be a bunch of man who _ know _ it be worth a year of dawdle over text-book you see i know i could come back here and try everything on my own people it be like the squeer school in ` nichola nickleby ' ` member when the spelling class be up squeer say to smike the big helpless dunce ` spell window ' and smike say ` w-i-n-d-e-r ' ` all right ' squeer say ` now go out and wash 'em ' well i hope i get the spell a little nearer right but i come home and begin wash my window that be all jw say huh and that stand for understanding and approval and confidence as to marty 's preach it be a boy 's preach naturally but it be preach and the people come for it jw remark to himself the contrast between the close-parked car around elli church and the forlornly vacant horse-shed he have see at deep creek the Sunday before the hearty singing of people glad to be singing together the contagious interest of a well-filled house and the simple directness of the preacher be all of a piece here be no effort to ape the form of a cathedral but neither be there any careless cheap slovenliness and assuredly there be no religious stunt marty preach the christian evangel not moralize agriculture he make the gospel invitation a social appeal without blinking its primary message to the individual to place himself under the authority of christ 's self-forgetting love he put first thing in front -- he that cometh unto I and then with simple illustration and word as simple he show that they who have accept christ 's lordship be honor bind to live together under a new sort of law from that of the restless push self-centered world : it shall not be so among you besides he tell they they could not separate service from profit they know for instance that they farm value be a third higher because of the presence of the church and its work but they would find that the profit motive be not big enough to keep the church go they have to love the work and do it for love of it that afternoon the friend drive over to valencium where at night marty would preach again this he one sermon of the week and jw leave he there turn he car homeward for the fifty-two mile to delafield as they part jw grip marty 's hand and say : old man i own up i think you ought not to bury yourself in the country but i have no need to worry i know preacher who be bury in town all right you have a bigger field and a livelier one than they will ever find and i 'll never say another word about you two-week ' school if the home mission board have nothing else to do such work as it show you how to do would be worth all the board cost i be go to make trouble for mr drury and the district superintendent and the bishop and the board and anybody else i can get hold of until deep creek get the same sort of chance as this circuit of yours if only they know where to find another martin luther shenk -- that be the rub and with a last handclasp the chum go they separate way on Monday jw call up pastor drury and give that gentleman who be expect it a five-minute summary of he day with marty i be awfully glad i happen to think of go over there he say not only for the sake of be with the old boy again but because i have get some new notion about the country church and about what we methodist be begin to do for the place where methodism get its start and walter drury say yes i be glad too so he be he could put down a new mark on the credit side of the experiment chapter vi be he not a man and a brother the color methodist of delafield who call they church saint mark have always be on good term with they white co-religionist mr drury and the pastor of saint mark find many occasion of help each other in they work the single way in which these two show themselves conscious of the color line be that while the pastor of first church often preach in saint mark when the pastor of saint mark appear in the pulpit of first church it be to speak on some aspect of he work jw know saint mark of old in he high-school day that church have for its preacher one of a fast-vanishing race a man mighty in exhortation even though narrowly circumscribe in scholastic equipment he preach be redolent of the camp meeting and he count that sermon lose which do not evoke a shout or two from the front bench a few of first church 's younger people often go to sing at saint mark on special occasion and go all the more cheerfully because of the chance it afford to hear brother king officer preach where he get that name be not know but he have no other do not think the young people either go to scoff or remain to pray if at time they be amuse at brother officer 's peculiarity so be some member of he own flock and brother officer be wise enough to assume that no disrespect be intend and if the white visitor treat he fervent appeal to the unconverted and backslider as part of the program but have no slightest application to they this be also the regular thing and nobody be trouble thereat but while jw be away at college a new pastor have come to saint mark a college and seminary graduate and he have come just in time brother officer be get old but the determine factor which make the change necessary be that delafield happen to be near one of the general route by which thousand of color people be move northward exodus have be before kansa still remember the exodus from tennessee of forty year ago but this latest exodus have no one starting-point nor any single destination it be a vast shift of negro population from below mason and dixon 's line and it sweep northward toward all the great industrial center its cause and consequence make a remarkable story for which there be no room in this chronicle delafield think it could not absorb many more negro but before the exodus movement subside the straggler who have turn aside at delafield have more than double the negro population of the town a heavy burden of new responsibility be on the young pastor of saint mark the newcomer have no such alertness and resourcefulness as he own people they be helpless in the face of new experience soon they become a worry and a enigma to the town authority but especially and inevitably they turn to the church of they own color of which delafield could boast but two a methodist and a baptist so saint mark and its pastor find both new opportunity and new trouble one day in the early spring mr drury drop in to the farwell store and ask jw if he would be busy that night the road to deep creek be at its spring worst and jw have nothing special on he say as much and answer he look of inquiry the pastor say there be a man speaking at saint mark to-night who be a yale graduate and a negro he be also a methodist do the combination interest you why yes jw answer it might you know i use to go with the bunch to saint mark when brother officer be pastor but i have not be since he leave i would like to see what the new preacher be do and it ought to be worth something to hear a negro alumnus of yale william hightower it seem be the speaker 's name -- a strong-voiced confident man in he thirty as jw soon discover hightower be a distinctively modern negro where king officer have be almost cringe hightower 's thought however diplomatically speak be that of a up-standing mind where officer accept as part of the social order the color man 's dependence on the white hightower speak of something he call racial solidarity it be plain that he mean he negro hearer to make much of the negro 's capacity for self-direction there be little bitterness and no radicalism in the speech but to jw it have a queer new note he say as much to mr drury on the way home why that hightower hardly ever mention the church although he be speak at a church meeting and how independent he be so you notice that do you the pastor respond to I it be one of the sign of a new day but do you think it be a good day mr drury query jw yes -- perhaps i do not know anyhow it be new and some of the blame for it be on we shoulder the way the negro think and feel to-day be a striking proof of the fact often forget that when you settle old question you raise new one maybe say jw doubtfully but i do not know we have settle the negro question nor i agree mr drury what we -- i mean we methodist -- settle when we begin to deal with the negro right after emancipation be not the race question it be not even a missionary question in the old sense but it be the question of the nature of the education we should give the young colored people for we set out deliberately to give they schooling first with evangelism as a accompaniment the stress be on education and we decide at the outset on a certain sort of education i should think venture jw that any old sort of education would serve the first teacher have to begin at the bottom do not they yes and lower than any beginning you know anything about the pastor reply we first worker begin without equipment without encouragement and without everything else except a great pity for the freedman do you notice by the way that the speaker to-night never say ` freedman ' or mention slavery it be a new day i tell you i wish you would explain just what you mean by that mr drury jw say i do not seem to get it i mean say mr drury that as soon as we church have decide to do something for the emancipated slave it begin to work out a scheme of negro education that be before tuskegee and even before hampton institute maybe we never think of the booker washington idea or purely industrial education but at any rate we go on the theory that the negro deserve and in time could take as good a education as any other american so we start academy and college and even university for he and a medical school and a theological seminary i can see myself that there be a difference between that and the industrial idea say jw decidedly there be answer the minister all the difference which have help to bring this new day i be talk about and to produce such negro leader as william hightower you see jw it be this way : booker washington believe that after the negro have be teach to read and write and cipher he next and greatest educational need be to learn to make a living well what be the matter with that retort jw seem to I it be common sense possibly mr drury answer dryly but what would you say be the first thing need in the fight against the almost total illiteracy of the freedman why teacher i suppose say jw and it would sure take a lot of teacher even to make a start mr drury say that be exactly the fact it have call for so many that to this day there be not anything like enough teacher although some of we school and those of other church have be at work for fifty year and remember that practically all of these teacher except in a few advanced school must be black teacher themselves bring up out of ignorance well say jw that be my point the quicker we could teach the teacher the sooner they would be ready to teach other that be to say mr drury interpret the less we teach they the better seem to I i hear something of a small revolt in you time at cartwright because it seem necessary that a young tutor should be temporarily assign to the class in sophomore english jw chuckle it be my class why that fellow be never more than two jump ahead of the daily work we know he have to study he own lesson assignment before he could hear a recitation we be not get anything out of it except the bare text so some of the boy make thing lively for a few day and he ask to be relieved quite so you class have every imaginable advantage over the color boy and girl in we school -- just one teacher below par and yet you think it would be all right to have all color teacher no more than two jump ahead of they pupil well yes i see jw say with a touch of thoughtfulness i suppose a good teacher need more than the minimum text-book knowledge be that the methodist theory now you be talk like yourself mr drury tell he yes that be the methodist theory for the fifty year of the old freedman 's aid society -- now the board of education for negro -- it have run these school eighteen of they now with five thousand seven hundred and two earnest student enrol on a double theory the first part of the theory be that every child -- black white red or yellow -- ought to have all the education he can use anything less than that would be as good as say that america care to develop its human resource only just so far and not to the limit the other part of the theory be that the last person in the world to be put off with half a education be a preacher or a teacher the best be just good enough for all teacher whether they teach from a desk or from a pulpit i guess that be so too say jw you be get I interested now go on and tell I some more the new pastor of saint mark tell I say mr drury irrelevantly that they would be want some new roofing for the barn they be turn into a community house i should not be surprise if you sell the church a nice little bill of goods and while you be at it you might talk to the pastor -- driver 's he name -- about this thing from he side of the road he know more than i do jw say he would and though he would have mean it in any case the hint about roofing make certain that elder driver would have a call in the morning from a rise young hardware salesman by this time they be at the farwell gate and jw say goodnight mr drury walk home but before he get ready for he beloved last hour of the day with its easy chair and its cherish book he call up he colored colleague and they have a brief talk over the ` phone now walter drury have take no one into he confidence about the experiment nor do he intend to he have the best of reason for keep he own counsel through the year so elder driver could not know the true inwardness of this telephone call indeed it be so casual that he do not even think to mention it to jw when that alert roofing specialist turn up next morning i hear you be go to put new roofing on that barn you be fix up mr driver and i think i might get you order for the job maybe you know that we do a good deal of that sort of work and we can give you expert service the right roofing put on to stay and to stay put yes they be think of that roof have to because it leak like a market basket and they need the place right now what with the many color methodist who have come to town and have no home -- only room in the little house of the color settlement that have be too small for comfort even before the exodus but the place would be worth a lot to they work when they get it about how much do you think of spending mr driver jw ask know the limited means of saint mark he expect to supply the cheapest roofing the farwell hardware company have in stock but pastor driver have a surprise for he why he say we want the best there be that building be a barn i 'll admit but it be strongly build and we expect to fix it pretty thoroughly we have a gift from the board of home mission and church extension and we match that with as much again of we own money enough in all to swing the building around off the alley put it on a new foundation next to the church and remodel it for we need that be news to I say jw though of course i be glad to hear it but i do not know that the board put money into such work as this somehow i suppose you be under the board of education for negro no not for this sort of church work the color pastor answer i be ` under ' the board of education for negro as you put it for a long time myself in the day when it be call the freedman 's aid society and so be my wife but now we be do missionary work and that be the other board 's job oh yes jw assent i might have know that and you mean that you be under the freedman 's aid society when you be go to school -- be that it that be it say pastor driver with a gleaming smile i be in two of the school philander smith college at little rock arkansa and clark university at atlanta georgium then i get my theological course at gammon on the same campus as clark you say you wife be in school too yes -- with a even brighter smile -- she be at clark when i meet she like I she attend two school on that campus the other be thayer home a girl ' dormitory support by the woman 's home missionary society a home then how could it be a school jw ask that be just it mr farwell the minister explain it be a school of home life not only cooking and sewing and scrubbing and what all you think of as domestic science but a school of the home spirit -- just the thing my people need thayer be and be a place where the girl student of clark university learn how to make real home and in the college class they learn what you might suppose any college student would learn that be why i say mr driver go to two school jw recall the hightower speech of the night before and the discussion with mr drury on the way home he want to go into it all with this pastor who be not much past he own age and evidently have some idea for the first time he wonder too how it happen that in that draft of the everyday doctrine of delafield they have altogether ignore the negro be that a symptom of something then he remember he errand and the work which be wait up at the store so he say : excuse I mr driver for be so inquisitive i have never think much about we church 's color work but what i hear at last night 's meeting start I rather curious that i should be here talk about it with you the very next morning be not it but about that roofing now of course you 'll look around and get other estimate but anyway i would be glad to take the measurement and give you we figure i promise you they 'll be worth consider i be sure of that mr farwell say the other heartily and if i have any influence with the committee -- and i think i have -- you need not lose any sleep over any other figure we might get as for be inquisitive about we work here i wish more of this town 's white methodist would get inquisitive and that remind I : there be to be a epworth league convention here week after next and i have be tell to invite one of the league leader in you church to make a short address on the opening night you be a league leader i know and the first one i have think about so i be ask you right now will you come over and speak for we now though jw always say he be no speaker he have never hesitate to accept invitation to take part in league convention but this be different he make no answer for a minute and in the pause he mind be busy with all he know and all he have acquire at second hand about the relation of color christian and white and particularly about what might be think and say if it should be announce that he be to speak at a negro epworth league convention and then he have the grace to blush realize that this color pastor wait so quietly for he answer must infallibly have follow he thought in he swift self-blame he feel that the least amends he could make for he unspoken discourtesy be a prompt acceptance of the invitation so he look up and say hurriedly : mr driver forgive I for not speak sooner i 'll do the best i can and then regain he composure have you any idea as to the subject i be suppose to talk about yes the color minister reply not without a touch of curious tenseness in he voice the committee want I to get a representative from you chapter to make a ten-minute address of welcome on behalf of the epworthian of first church again jw be force to hesitate here he be a epworthian but know nothing at all about the work of these other young methodist until to-day he scarcely know they exist and now he be ask to welcome they to town in the name of the league but once again shame compel he to take the bold course with a apologetic smile he say well that be the last subject i could imagine you would give to any of we at first church you young people and ours have hardly be aware of each other and it seem queer that you should ask I to make a address of welcome in you church but as i think of it maybe this be just what somebody ought to do and i might as well try it trouble be what be i go to say we 'll risk that mr farwell say pastor driver confidently just say what you think and you 'll do all right jw be by no means sure of that and the more he think about he speech in the next few day the more confused he become any ordinary speech of welcome would be easy -- glad you be sensible enough to come to delafield make yourselve at home freedom of the city we latch string be out command we for anything we can do congratulate you on the fine work you be do know when we return this visit and come to the place you represent you will make we welcome -- and so on but it be plainly impossible for he to talk like that it would not be true and it would certainly not be prudent he put the thing up to jw sr what 'll i say dad he ask you know we have not have much to do with the people of saint mark and maybe it would not be best for we to make any sudden change as to that even if some of we want to but i have get to talk like a christian whether i feel like one or not my son he father answer he sententiously it be you speech not mine but if a old fogy may suggest something why not forget all about the usual sort of welcome address why not say something of the whole program of we church as it affect we colored people it touch the young folk more than any other welcome they to that that be all very fine jw object everybody who be on for a address of welcome be advise by he friend to cut out the old stuff but it mean work and you know that i do not know the first thing about what you call the whole program of we church for the color people that man driver know but i can not ask he of course not assent jw sr but you can ask somebody else i 'll venture mr drury can tell you where to find all you would want to talk about ask he you be never bother by bashfulness with he if i remember right jw admit he have already think of that he and i be talk about this very thing the night before i go to see about that roofing but here be the point -- i be not to represent the pastor but the young people and i be not so sure that what mr drury might give I if he be willing could be make to fit into a league speech under the circumstance i would try it anyway say the elder farwell he be nearly always willing seem to I and a pretty safe adviser most of the time all right agree jw i 'll see he but he 'll probably tell I to find thing out for myself he be a good scout be mr drury the best pastor i ever know or want to know but sometimes he have the queerest streak will not help a fellow a little bit and when you be absolutely sure he could if he would it will not be enough to see he though even if he be in a generous mood and give I more dope than i can use i would better talk to some of the league people and still he gravitate toward the pastor 's study it be the easiest way the pastor be always in a more generous mood than jw give he credit for it be only that he never supply crutch when people need to use they leg nor brain when they need to use they head nor emotion when they need to use they heart he tell jw to rummage through the one bookshelf in the study which hold he small but usable collection of book and pamphlet on the negro and see what he might find and as always they talk i can tell by that preacher at saint mark say jw how i have the wrong end of the argument that night we come from hightower 's address a man with a big job like he have to be a pretty big man and he need all the education he can get there be a principle in that jw suggest mr drury see if this seem a reasonable way to state it : in deal with any people the more needy they be the better equip and train they leader should be yes sir it sound reasonable enough jw admit and yet i never think of it until now but you say something the other night that i do not see yet that may be no fault of yours my boy say the minister with a laugh what be it why you say man like hightower be incline to overlook the work of the church and that it be the church 's own fault something about raise new question when you settle old one oh yes say mr drury i remember maybe say it be the church 's own fault be not just the way to put it say instead that you can not educate child nor yet race that be develop and expect they to turn out exactly accord to you notion of the future because when they mind be grow they be develop not accord to something in you but accord to something in they so every teacher and i suppose every parent have moment of wonder how it ever happen that young people learn so much that be not teach they and it be the same way with race you mean inquire jw that hightower be like that i mean pastor drury reply that everybody be like that if we have give the negro no education at all we could probably have keep he contented for a good many year with just be ` free ' if we have give no negro anything but a common-school chance the race would have be pretty slow to develop discontent but hightower go to yale and du bois go to harvard and germany and picken go to yale and so on thousand of color man and woman have be graduate from college of liberal art and so they be not satisfy with condition which would have be heavenly bliss to they grandfather and grandmother i know i be stupid say jw a trifle ruefully but i have always suppose that education be good for everybody now you seem to say that education make people discontented of course it do say mr drury that be the reason it be good for they would you be content to call a one-room shack home and live as the plantation hand live if you would the world 's profit out of you and you own profit out of yourself would not be much real education do exactly mean discontent and the people who be discontent may be uncomfortable to live with if we think they ought to be docile but they get we forward maybe you be right jw concede and the church be not to be blame still if we work for the black man have make he troublesome and give he idea bigger than he can hope to realize how do that fit in with we christianity should not the church be a peacemaker instead of a trouble-maker now john wesley jr the other say in mock protest that sermon of mine on ` not peace but a sword ' must have be waste on you we lord most certainly come to make peace and he speak a great blessing on peacemaker but he be himself the world 's greatest disturber peace while there be injustice or ignorance or any sort of wickedness have nothing to do with christ 's intention i know that the old-time slave-trader of the north and the more persistent slave-buyer of the south be always ask for that sort of peace but they could not have it nobody ever can have it so long as jesus have a single follower in the world well what have all this to do asked jw with we church 's special work for the color people ah yes the pastor answer that be the very thing you must find out before you make that address of welcome by this time jw have gather up a pile of book pamphlet report and papers -- enough he think to serve as the raw material of a phd thesis and he say to mr drury would you mind if i take this home i 'll bring it all back and it be not likely i 'll damage it much the ask be no more than a form for year the people of first church have know themselves freely welcome to any book in the preacher 's shelf a interest in he book be passport to he special favor he own evident love for book have be the best possible insurance that these particular borrower would be more scrupulous than the general this bit of pastoral work it should be say with the frequent book-talk that grow out of it be not least among all the reason why first church people think they bachelor minister just the man for they so off go jw with he armful and for a week thereafter you might have suppose he be cram for a final exam of some sort early in he preparation he decide that he father 's advice be wise and he put the stress of he effort on the church 's work and how negro youth have respond to it the other matter be too delicate he feel for he amateur handling and besides he be not altogether sure even of he own position on the convention night saint mark be crowd with young color people some of whom come from place a hundred mile away they be badge and pennant quite in the fashion to which jw be accustomed but for they color and to be frank for a little more restraint and thoughtfulness in they really unusual singing they be just young methodist at a convention not different from caucasian methodist of the same age when jw 's turn come to speak the chairman introduce he in the fewest possible word but with the courtesy which belong to self-respect say mr farwell will make the delegate welcome in the name of the first church epworthian and he do he have he note pretty full one to which he make frequent reference but the quality in he speech which draw the convention 's cheer be its frank and natural simplicity i would have beg off from this duty if i could he begin but i know from the moment i be ask that i have no decent excuse but i know so little of what i ought to say that it be necessary for I to dig just as i use to do at school the result of my digging be that i know now and i want you to know that i know why first church young people should join in welcome you to delafield some of they do not know yet any more than i do ten day ago but i intend to enlighten they the first chance i get we first church epworthian might welcome you for many reason but i have decide to stick to two because as i have say i have just be learn something about they we welcome you then because you represent the most eager hunger for complete education that exist in america to-day unless we new hebrew citizen can match it no other can the record of we church 's school for you race prove that it simply be not possible to keep the negro youth out of school they will walk further eat less work harder and stay longer to get a education than for anything else in the world not so many day ago i ignorantly think that the ` three r 's ' be all that ought to be offer partly because the need be so great i hope you will forgive I that think when i tell you that now i know what ignorance it reveal in I the great need be the strongest argument for the highest education because of you great number and because of you ever intenser racial self-respect the negro must educate the negro be physician for the negro preach to the negro nurse the negro lead the negro in all he upward effort otherwise these thing will be do badly or patronizingly or not at all but if you be to do you own educational work you educator must be fully equip it be not possible to send the whole race to college but it be possible to send college-trained youth to the race for this reason we church have establish normal school college of liberal art professional school home for college girl so that the coming leader of you people may have access to the best the world offer in science and literature in medicine and law in business and religion you will not mistake my purpose i be sure in say that you know better than we can guess how you people through no fault of theirs have be long in bondage to the unskilled hand the unawakened mind and the uninspired heart but it be more and more a unwilling bondage and we church you church have set up these school and these training home i have mention as though she be say in the word of one of you own wonderful song ` let my people go ' and the result be come you two bishop one in the south and one in africa you leader in the church 's highest council you educator you far-seeing business man you great preacher be part of the answer to you church 's passion to give full freedom to all she people for you be _ she _ people the people of the christian church we be all god 's people it seem to I that just now god be interested in bring to every race in the world the chance of liberty for hand and head and heart god have greater thing for we all to do than we can now understand but all he purpose must wait on we get free from everything that would defeat we work we first-church young people welcome you because with all else you represent a great purpose to make religion intelligent you know as we do that piety to be vital must be mix with sound learning you have the missionary spirit which never thrive in a atmosphere of resistance to education you be ` fellow christian ' fellow worker we be sharer with you in personal devotion to we lord and in the common purpose to make he master of all life and finally let I say it bluntly we welcome you because we believe in you pride of race and honor it in you as we honor it in we fellow citizen of other race they and you have some thing in common but you will not misunderstand I when i congratulate you on what be peculiar to you you have be fully americanize for more generation than most other american you have no need to strive after the american spirit i have a friend of greek birth who think pridefully back to the golden age of greece and i envy he he glory but you pride of race turn away from the unhappy past see you golden age in the day to come not in the dim yesterday you be the maker not the inheritor of a great destiny for that noble future which be to be yours in we common america you do well to hold as above price the purity and strength of you racial life better than we of caucasian stock you know that only so may all the value be fully realize which be to be africa 's contribution to the spiritual wealth of america and the world there be a moment of silence for the implication of the last sentence be not as plain as they might have be but when the audience catch jw 's somewhat daring appeal to its racial self-respect it break into such cheer as be not give to the polite phraser of conventional commonplace chapter vii the first american civilization the full record of jw 's commercial career must he leave to some other chronicler but a occasional reference to it can not be omit from these page pastor drury 's brother albert a saint loui business man who know the old city by the mississippus from the levee to the university be a citizen who love he city so well that he do not need to join a booster ' club to prove it the two drury see each other as both aver all too seldom on the infrequent occasion when they meet as for instance during a certain church federation gathering which have bring the minister down to saint loui from delafield they visit be a joyous thing to see lounge in the city club one day after lunch with every other subject of common interest at least touch on brother albert turn to brother walter : and how go the church and parish of delafield you tell I long ago that you want to stay there ten year it be more than eight now do the ten-year mark yet stand yes al it still stand if nothing should interfere say walter he have never tell he brother the reason back of that ten-year mark and he be not ready even yet for that of late he have take to wonder when and how the experiment would come to its crisis he want some help just now and here might be a opening so he go on i have be work away at several special job as you know i like to do and one of they have a good deal to do with a young fellow name farwell john wesley farwell jr who 'll be the mainstay of the best hardware store in delafield before long if he stick to it everybody call he ` jw ' and he be the sort of boy that have always interested I he be so ` average ' he pause he thought busy with the experiment well he brother break in after a moment what be this young john wesley methodist be do it be not altogether what he have be do but it be what i would like to see he get a chance to do explain the preacher he be tie to the store and to delafield so far and i have reason for want he to see some part of this country he 'll never see from main street in we town well brother mine maybe he could be induce to leave that particular main street there be where we get the best citizen of this village have he any objection to make a change -- to travel for instance i do not know say walter probably not he be young and have a pretty good education i do know that he be ambitious to make himself the best hardware man in we section and i believe he 'll do it in time personally i _ want _ he to travel but how would anybody go about get he the chance albert drury laugh that be easy only a preacher could not be expect to see it if any country boy really know the stuff he handle whether it be hardware or candy or hide he can get the chance all right this town want he do not you know that the big wholesale house recruit they sale force by spot just such boy as you john wesley farwell may be but what do you mean by call he average if he be such a keen judge of hardware oh well he _ be _ more than average on hardware but he be so beautifully average human one of those chap who do most of the real work of the world all right old man i be not sure that i follow you but anyway i may be of some use i 'll tell you what i 'll do i know the very man peter mcdougall who be a friend i can bank on be sales manager of the cumming hardware corporation nothing will come of it if peter be not impressed but all i need to do be to tell he there be a prospective star salesman up at delafield and he man who have that territory will be look up you john wesley before you have time to write another sermon by the way he add what part of the country do you say you want young farwell to see i do not say the preacher admit but i would like he to see something of the southwest i want to see what will happen when he bump up against the sort of civilization that follow the spanish to america well of course you know that wholesale hardware house do not run salesman 's excursion to help methodist preacher try out the effect of american history on they young parishioner no matter how lofty the motive and albert drury poke he brother in the rib but suppose this boy be otherwise good stuff he 'll be in the right place if he go with the cumming people a big share of they business be in that end of the world if jw have be tell of this conversation which he be not he might not have be quite so mystified over the letter from the great peter mcdougall which come a few week after the preacher 's return from saint loui mcdougall he know well by reputation have hear about he from every cumming man who unpack sample in delafield and to be invite to saint loui by the great man with the possibility of a opening ultimately in we sale force be a surprise as interesting as it be unexpected naturally jw could not know how much careful investigation have precede the writing of that letter the cumming corporation do not act on impulse but he would have accept the invitation in any case and that be enough for the present purpose of the story of jw 's first business venture away from delafield not without some hesitation do he close with the cumming offer but after he have talk it all over with the folk at home and then all over again out at deep creek with jeannette shenk who be both sorry and proud it be settle reach saint loui the canny mcdougall look he over and think he worth try out so over he go to the stock department then follow busy week in the building of the cumming hardware corporation down by the river learn the stock he discover before the end of the first day that he have never yet guess what hardware mean he wander through the maze of the vast warehouse until he leg ache much and he eye ache more at last come the day when he find himself on the road not alone of course but in tow of fred finch a old cumming salesman who have occasionally make delafield the cumming people do not throw they new man overboard and let they swim if they could they have a careful training system of which the stockroom day be one part and this personally conduct introduction to the road be another albert drury have be sufficiently interested in he brother 's wish to drop a hint to mcdougall to which that hard-headed executive would have pay no attention if it have not fit in just then with the requirement of he sale policy but the hint send jw out with finch over the longest route which the house work for trade on the map this route be a great kite-shaped thing with its point at saint loui and the whole southwest this side of the colorado river include in the sweep of its side and top to fred finch it be a weary journey but jw give no thought to its discomfort he be see the country as well as learn to sell hardware and both occupation be highly absorb before long he find too that he be see a new people storekeeper he know as be of he own guild the small town be much like delafield when you have become use to they newer crudeness of architecture and they sprawling planlessness and the people who use hardware be very much like he customer at home he have no fear of fail to become a salesman after the first few experience under finch 's watchful eye he father have teach he a sort of salesmanship which experience could only make more effective he know already never to sell what he could see he customer ought not to buy and he know always to contrive as much as possible that the customer should do the sell to himself the elder farwell use to say let you customer once see the advantage that buying be to he and he will not care what advantage selling be to you now as have be say before this be not a salesman 's story let it suffice to say that before the two get back to saint loui jw know he have find he trade he be a natural salesman and so fred finch report to peter mcdougall if it be hardware he say that boy can sell it and i do not care where you put he he can sell to people who can not speak english and i believe he could sell to deaf mute or the blind he know the line and they know he know it why this very first trip he be sell more goods on he own say-so than on the house brand say he know what the stuff would do and people take that who usually want to know about the guarantee all of which peter mcdougall file where he would not forget it but to go back to the trip itself along the railway in kansas jw begin to see box-car without truck roughly fit up for dwelling dark-skinned man and woman and child be in occupation and all the household function and process be go on though somewhat primitively mexican say finch as jw point out the car section hand when i first begin to make this territory you never see they except right down on the border but they have move a long way east and north i see lot of they in the yard at kansa city last time i be there jw watch the box-car life with a good deal of curiosity here and there be poor little attempt at color and adornment flower in window box and bit of lace at the window delafield have plenty of foreigner but these be foreigner of another sort they seem to be entirely at home i suppose he say to finch these mexican have come to the state to get away from the robbery and ruin that mexico have have instead of government these last ten year and more yes finch answer thousand of 'em but not all some of these mexican be older american than we be we take 'em over when we get texa and new mexico and californium from old mexico they be here then speak the spanish they ancestor have learn three hundred year ago and more but they be all the same mexican no matter on which side of the rio grande they be bear of course those bear on this side have have some advantage that the peon never know but do you mean jw want to know that they be not really american citizen fred finch say no he do not mean exactly that certainly those bear on this side be american citizen in the eye of the law and those who come across the rio grande could get naturalized but that make little real difference a mexican be a mexican and you have to deal with he as one jw be not quite satisfied with that explanation but he prefer to wait until he have see enough so that he could ask he question more intelligently so he keep relatively still but he eye do not cease from observe as the trip progress and the jump between town become longer the young salesman have time to see a good deal in the far southwest he become aware that the increasingly numerous mexican population be no longer a matter of box-car dweller more or less migratory it be a settle people its little adobe village queer and quaint as they seem to middle-western eye be center of established life and he discover that in these village always one build overshadow all the rest one day as they be head towards el paso he venture to mention this to he travel companion seem to I he say that none of these little mud village be too poor to have a church and mostly a pretty good church too how do they manage it now finch be no student of church life but he do know a little about the country that be the way it be all over this southwest my boy and across the line in old mexico it be a good deal more so my guess be that the church and the priest begin by teach the people that whatever else happen they have to put up for the church and from what i have notice i reckon that now nothing else matter much to the church it have become a kind of poor relation that be get to be feed and help whether it amount to anything or not but it be a long way from be as humble and thankful as you would naturally expect a poor relation to be during the el paso layover the two of they take a day across the international bridge jw have watch the mexican come over and he want to see the country they come from you 'll not see much over there a friendly speak custom official tell he it be a pretty poor section of desert ` round about these part you ought to get away down into the heart of the country yes i suppose so jw respond but there be not time on this trip be such people as these come over to the united state right along i should say they be say the man of authority with emphasis in the last four or five year the mexican population of the united state have about double three quarter of a million have cross the rio grande somewhere or the border further west you people from the east make a big fuss over immigration from europe but you hardly seem to know that a regular flood have be pour in through these southwestern gateway you will some day what they see on the mexican side of the bridge be as the custom man have say nothing much but jw come away with a strange sense of depression he have never before see so much of the raw material of misery and squalor what he have observe with wonder pity in the village on the american side be as nothing to the unrelieved hopelessness of the south bank of the river that night in the hotel lobby jw notice a fresh-faced but rather elderly man whom he recognize as one whom he have see over in mexico earlier in the day with the memory of what he have see yet fresh upon he jw venture a commonplace or two with the stranger and find he so genial and interesting that they be still talk long after fred finch have yawn himself off to bed i think i remember see you over there say the unknown and you do not look like a seasoned traveler more like the amateur i be myself though i do get about a little i be no seasoned sightseer say jw this be my first time out and that be maybe the reason i have develop so much curiosity about the people we see to-day do you know much about they who the mexican the other man smile and then be suddenly serious my friend i begin to think i be make the mexican my hobby i do not know who you be but if you be really interested in the mexican as human being i would rather tell you what i know than do anything else i can think of to-night it be not often i find a travel man who care well i do care jw assert stoutly they be people folk be not they and it look as though they could stand have somebody get interested in they a little ah i see now what you be you be that remarkable combination a travel man and a christian be i right why i suppose so say jw with a smile and a touch of the old boyish pride in he name my initial as you might say be ` john wesley ' and i be not ashamed of they and that mean you be not only a christian but a methodist my dear man we must shake on that i be a methodist myself as the stage robber say to brother van with the romantic name of tanner get my first interest in mexico and the mexican when my daughter marry a young methodist preacher and they go down there as missionary i make a trip to see they and the baby about once a year but now i be get interested in these people as a american and i hope a christian who try to work at the business what do you say you other name be jw have not say but now he do and the two settle to they talk this william tanner some sort of retired business man certainly seem to know he mexico and he have that most subtle of all stimulant to-night a curious and sympathetic hearer by consequence he be eager to give all that jw would take before long jw have edge in a question about the church he say you know mr tanner we have a pretty good roman catholic church in my home town though father o'neill do not tie up much to what the other church be try to do and some of he flock seem to I pretty wild for sheep now these church down here be all roman catholic too yet they certainly do not look any kin to saint ursulum 's at delafield be they it be the sort of question which william tanner have ask himself many a time when he first come to mexico this be the way of it mr farwell he say the church come to mexico and to all latin america from spain and portugal it have a few great name we must acknowledge in those early time but in a little while it settle down to two activity -- to make itself the sole religious authority and to get rich it be a church of god and gold and as a matter of course it preach that it be the supreme arbiter of life and death in matter of faith and extend its authority into every relation of life it bring from the land of the inquisition the idea of priestly power and there be none to dispute it in latin america as there be in the colony of we own country it give the people little instruction and no responsibility or freedom it make outward submission the test of piety and faith and so when spain lose its grip on the western hemisphere the church find itself with nothing but its claim of power to fall back on well you know that would work only with the ignorant and the superstitious mexico and all latin america for that matter clear to the strait of magellan be a land of innumerable cross but no christ the church have have leave to it what it want that be the priestly prerogative it marry baptize absolve bury where the people can pay the fee and the people for various reason have not care that this be all if they be afraid or want to make a show they call in the church if they do not care or if they be poor they go unbaptized unmarried unshriven and do not see that it make any difference they have no understanding of the church as a christian institution in fact i think it would puzzle most of they to tell what a true church ought to be now all this be the church 's reward for its ancient choice which so far as i can see be still its choice to the average latin american the church be and in the nature of thing must be a demander of pay for ceremonial and a bitterly jealous defender of all its old autocratic claim that be of the nature of the church but i do not understand interpose jw if the people have no real use for the church why do they support it it certainly be support that mr farwell be the tragedy of the church in all these land say mr tanner soberly the church begin by look to its own interest first it want great establishment and a docile people it find the gospel hard to preach to the native -- the real gospel i mean the cruelty and greed of the conquest have make impossible any preaching of a minister merciful and unselfish christ in fact the vast majority of the priest who come over from europe bring with they no such idea the church be ruler not missionary and so far as it dare it stick stubbornly to that notion even to this day so it have have to make practical compromise with the paganism and superstition it find here many of its religious observance be the aboriginal pagan practice disguise in christian dress and give christian name the church have sell its birthright for the privilege of exploit the credulity and the fear of the people it have make merchandise of all its function now after the century have come and go both church and people through long custom be willing to have it so the people have they great church with incense and light and all the pomp of medaeival day but they have no living christ and no thought of he the priest have they trade in ceremonial and they perquisite but they have no power over the heart of man as he new acquaintance pause for breath after this long answer to a short question jw remember something fred finch have say bring the remark in : the man who be show I the rope as a hardware man tell I that all over latin america the church be likely to be the one real building in every town and village be that also something that the people be so use to that they do not notice it any more oh yes mr tanner assent i suppose the contrast between the church and the miserable little hovel around it never occur to any of they it have always be so the church have build itself up out of the community and for the most part it put very little back it conduct school to be sure and yet eighty per cent of the mexican people be illiterate it have some few institution of help and mercy but the whole land cry out for doctor and teacher and friendly human concern be that really so jw ask do the people really want we missionary or be we protestant just shove ourselves in i can see that something be desperately wrong but we be mostly saxon and they be latin do these people want what to they must seem a queer religion and a lot of strange idea so long as they do not understand what we come for naturally they be suspicious when they find out they take to mission work and missionary with very little urge i wish you would meet my son-in-law mr tanner say with positiveness why the one torment desire of that man 's life be to see more missionary send down into mexico more doctor more teacher more worker of every sort he write letter to the board of foreign mission that would make you heart ache the church at home could not oversupply mexico with the sort of help it desperately need if it should turn every recruit that way and disregard all the rest of the world 's mission field do you mean asked jw who be see new question bob up every time a earlier one be answer do you mean that so many missionary could be use on productive christian work right away or be it that we ought to have a big force to prepare for the long future of we work in mexico now jw be not so sure that this be a intelligent question but he have hear that in some mission field it be necessary to wait year for real and permanent result he companion see nothing out of the way in the question it be part of the whole problem i mean it both way he say what i have see of we methodist work down in these part particularly its school and one wonderful hospital make I sure we could get big harvest of interest and success right off we be do it already consider we relatively small force and we limited equipment but all latin american work take patience i have make one trip down as far as santiago de chile and what be true in mexico be i guess about as true in other part the roman catholic church have be here four hundred year and its biggest result be that the people who do not fear it despise it latin america be call christian but it be a world in which what you and i call religion simply do not count well then that be what make I talk about the need of persistence and patience the bad effect of three or four hundred year of such religion as have be teach and practice between the rio grande and cape horn can not be get rid of in a hurry wait till mexico have have a real chance at the christ of the new testament for three hundred year and then see jw have yet another question to ask before he be ready to call it a day if all that you say be so -- and i believe it be mr tanner -- why should so many of the mexican hate the united state they do for i have hear it speak of a good deal lately and i remember what be always say when some one propose that we should intervene to make peace and restore order in mexico it would take ten year and a million man and all mexico would unite to oppose we you talk about how much the mexican need we and want we but a great many of they surely do not want we at all i know what that mean mr tanner admit and it be true we be all influence by the past look at the history of we dealings with mexico the very idea we fight to establish as the charter of we own freedom we repudiate when we deal with mexico three quarter of a century ago we have every advantage and what we want we take certainly we have do better by it than mexico might have do but i never hear that reason give in a court of law to excuse the same sort of transaction if it touch only private individual then in late year big business have go into mexico it have have to take big chance it have pay better wages than the peon could earn any other way it have a lot to its credit but it have be much like big business in other place and anyway the admit great profit have enrich the foreigner not the mexican besides mexico be not the state as you say it be latin in its civilization not saxon it do not want we sort of culture and some of we missionary both of the church and of industry have think that the mexican ought to be ` americanize ' that be a fatal mistake in any mission field outside the state all in all you can see that it be not entirely inevitable that the mexican should understand we motive or appreciate they when he do understand but that be all the more reason for bear down hard on every form of genuine missionary work it be the only thing that we american can do in mexico with any hope of avoid suspicion or of we presence be acceptable to the mexican in the long run we have get to fight the backfire of we american commercialism and the prejudice which be as real on the texa side of the river as it be on the other for if the mexican think in term of ` gringo ' the american of the southwest be just as likely to think in term of ` greaser ' when jw and mr tanner part for the night it be with the mutual promise that they would have another talk some time the next day but the promise could not be keep the retired business man hear from some of he business in the early morning and have just time to say a hurry farewell as he put it i think i have retire but unless i get back to look after this particular affair i may have to get into the harness again and that be not a cheerful prospect at my age so i go to business to avert the danger of go back to business a little later the two hardware salesman be in el paso again after a couple of side trip jw take advantage of a long train wait to hunt up the city library he want to know whether mr tanner be right in say that the latin-american question be much the same everywhere he write a letter to mr drury that night have thus far use picture postcard until he be ashamed in the letter he take occasion to mention he talk with the missionary father-in-law and he own bit of read up on the subject say he : i guess that man tanner be right he do not speak much of the difference between the people of one country and those of another which rather surprise I he say nothing of the two great class the ruler with much european blood and the peon largely or altogether indian there must be all sort of latin american rich and poor mixed blood of many strain castilian and aztec and inca and whatever other people be here when columbus set the fashion for american voyage but this be where this ` missionary father-in-law ' hit the heart of the trouble : latin america have all sort and condition of man but everywhere it have the same church and it be a church that can not ever make good any more it might at the beginning but it can not now it have a reputation as fix as julius caesar 's i be hardly ready to set up as a expert observer be only a cub salesman on he first trip but mr drury i believe i can see already that the only chance for these people to get religion and everything else which religion ought to produce be for we to send it to they maybe that would stir up the church down here and help to give it another chance at the people 's confidence though i be not sure we church ought to send doctor the amount of fearful disease that flourish among the poorer people be just frightful if joe carbrook be not so set on go to the orient he could do a big work here and so could a thousand other doctor it would be so much more than mere doctoring it would be the biggest kind of preach and the church should send teacher you know i believe in conversion but if the mexican i have see be sample of latin america 's common people they need teacher who have the patience of christ a good deal more than they need flame evangelist who make a big stir and soon pass on because these folk have just _ get _ to be make over in they very mind they be not ready for the preaching of the gospel until they have see it live long experience have make they doubtful of live saint though plenty of they pray to dead one this be the whole trouble mr drury it seem to I they have know only a church that have get off the track any religious work that reach they now have almost to begin all over again it have to undo they think about prayer and faith and god 's love and human conduct and nearly every other christian idea they have a christian vocabulary but it mean very little they think they can buy religion if they want it -- any kind they want and if they can not afford it or do not want it they do not quite think they 'll be send to hell for that in spite of what the priest say they think enough to be afraid but not enough to be sure of anything the missionary have to teach they a new set of religious numeral if you get what i mean before it be any use to teach they the arithmetic of the gospel i be begin to see that everything among the latin american run back to the need of christian live the wrong notion of religion have get they all twisted i know delafield be a long way from be christian but the difference between delafield and such a pitiful mud village as i have see lately have more to do with the sort of christianity each place have be teach than with anything else whatever but i never think of that before as pastor drury read that letter he heart warm within he he say to himself john wesley jr be ` begin to see ' he say please god he mus not stop now until he get he eye wide open the thing be work out he be grope around for something and some day he 'll find it chapter viii christ and the east for a first trip the southwestern expedition under fred finch 's tutelage have be something of a exploit finch 's report to peter mcdougall be more than verify by the order sheet and the observant peter keep track of thing during the succeed week notice with quiet satisfaction that not a single order be cancel to himself he say the lad 's a find i be think from finch 's talk i should say he have not only a natural knack of selling but he sell for keep and that be the idea peter anybody can sell if the buyer mean to call off the order by the next mail this john wesley boy may go far and i 'll have to tell albert drury the next time i see he that he be do the house of cumming a real favor the month go by jw keep he wit about he and on the road he stick to he salesman 's faith that goods be better sell by those who know exactly how they may be use and that they be never sell until they be buy so he find favor in the sight of peter mcdougall the proof of that be easy peter give he a week off before the end of he first year delafield look better to the homecoming salesman than it have to the boy come back from college and the town be glad to see he he mean something to not a few of its people altogether outside the interest of the farwell -- and pastor drury -- and jeannette deep creek be he first port of call after he first half-day at home he have be welcome with deep quiet gladness by the home folk and he have talk a little over the telephone with the preacher then time be a laggard until he could head the farwell car toward deep creek and the old farm jeannette 's welcome be all that even he could ask though of course just precisely what it be be none of we business in the car and by the fireplace in the shenk living room and around the farm they consider many thing some of they not so personal as other jw tell the story of he life in saint loui and on the road jeannette listen like another desdemona to the recital and once again it be not the adventure which supply the thrill but the adventurer and jeannette tell he the news of delafield how joe carbrook and marcium dayne 's wedding have be the most wonderful wedding ever see in delafield with the town as proud of its one-time scapegrace as it be of the beautiful bride how brother marty have be find many excuse of late for drive up from he circuit and how he manage to see alma wetherell a good deal how alma be now head bookkeeper and cashier of the emporium the town 's biggest store and how she be such a dear girl how pastor drury and marty have become great friend how the minister be not so well as usual and people be get to be a little worried about he how the delafield church have take up tithing and be not only do a lot better financially but in every other way how deep creek be go to have a new minister a friend whom marty have meet at the summer school for rural minister who would try to help the deep creek people get a up-to-date church building and learn to use it how the everyday doctrine of delafield have be first boost and then forget and now again several of they be be practice in some quarter and much more though never to the wear out of jw 's interest certainly not the news be just what he want to know and the reporter thereof be just the person he want to tell it to he one bit of news jeannette do not tell for the sufficient reason that she do not know it pastor drury and brother marty _ have _ become great friend but what jeannette could not tell be the special bond of interest which be back of the fact marty have long be aware that for some reason the delafield pastor be peculiarly concern about jw never do he guess walter drury 's secret but he know well enough there be one these two the town preacher and the young circuit rider read to each other jw 's letter and talk much about he and he experience and make jw in general the theme of many discussion it have be good for the boy that he have have that border trip say the pastor to marty a few day before jw get back do not you think so marty be as ever jw 's ardent and self-effacing chum i certainly do he say he be grow be jw and grow the right way we need business man of just the quality that be show in he the pastor hesitate a moment then he speak : marty when jw come home i hope something will set he think about the outer world that have no word of we christ he have not see it yet not clearly and you know that there be not any hope for that world to get out of the depths until it get the news of a helper i be count on you to help I with jw if the chance come just between ourselves you know i 'll do all i can mr drury you may be sure of that say marty and he do jw 's holiday bring several young people together who have not meet for a long time marty come up again and spend the day with jw all over town from the store to the house and back again in the evening mr farwell make a feast to which besides marty jeannette and alma and pastor drury be bid mr farwell be much more to delafield than the best cook and the most remarkable housekeeper in the place but she son insist that she be these to begin with certainly she have not be experiment on the two jw 's all these year for nothing after dinner -- talk no need of any other game in that company at such a time there be plenty to talk about and all have they reason for enjoy it naturally jw must tell about himself letter be all very well but they be no more than makeshift after all he be modest enough about it not have any special exploit to parade before they wonder eye but quite willing he western experience be call for he be soon tell not of desert and cactus and irrigation but of the people who have so take he attention the mexican i believe say he that we can do something really big down there and it be we business nobody except american christian will do it nobody else can besides the mexican be christian in name now what they need be the reality they be not impossible -- just uncertain all i hear and what little i see make I believe they be suffer from bad leadership and ignorance more than from anything hopelessly wrong they seem easy to get along with the woman be the most patient worker i ever hear of and the poor mexican the ` peon ' do want a end to fight and banditry well jw marty ask what be the first thing we ought to think about for mexico i tell you i do not know anything about mexico except at second-hand but i should say school school be good for any land do not you think mr drury and in mexico they be such great disturber of the old slouching indifference they will make the right kind of discontent school bring other thing new idea of health and sanitation home improvement social outlook and all that then with the school i guess the straight gospel the mexican will not get convert all at once and they will not become like we ever but i be about ready to say that whether mission be need anywhere else or not they surely be need in mexico and mexico be the first stepping-stone to south america which be next on my list of the place that ought to have the whole scheme of christian teaching and life yes say alma and you know i suppose that the beginning of we panama mission be a epworth league institute enterprise well it be california young people assume the support of the first missionary send there and later he go on down to south america with the same young people determine to take he on as they representative just as they do in panama where do you get that story jw want to know oh i forget alma answer he laugh you have not have time to read the epworth herald in saint loui yes i have young lady jw retort but i miss that anyway it be on the right track i think we have get to change the thinking of all latin america about christianity if we can most of the man they say be atheist make so very largely by they loss of faith in the church and many of the woman substitute a almost fierce devotion to the same church for what we think of as be genuine religion the minister speak up just here i should think it would be pretty difficult to treat we united state mexican in one way and those across the rio grande in another we must evangelize on both side of the river but only on this side can we even attempt to americanize that be right jw affirm and even on this side we can not do what we may do in delafield the language be a big question and it have two side but no matter what the difficulty i be for a great advance of mission and education start with mexico and go all the way to cape horn that be all very fine interpose marty but what about the rest of the world jw what about the world that have not even the beginning of christian knowledge marty have put the question on the urge of the moment and not until it be out do he remember that mr drury have ask he to help raise this very issue well jw answer slowly maybe that part of the world be worse though i do not know but we can not tackle everything latin america be a immense job by itself and we have some real responsibility there a sort of christian monroe doctrine ought we to scatter we force the non-christian world have its own religion and have have they for hundred maybe thousand of year what be the hurry just now if we could do everything we protestant christian i mean in this country and britain it might be different but we can not why not concentrate yes marty come back but not because latin america be so nearly christian what about this atheism and superstition and ignorance be not it just a non-christian civilization with christian label on some part of it one thing i have hear put in jeannette not that she want to argue but she feel she ought to say something on jw 's side if she could that the religion of the orient at least be really great religion more suit to the mind of the people than any other ` east be east and west be west ' you know but of course the people do not live up to the high level of they belief american do not either mr drury shoot a amuse yet admire glance at jeannette what a loyal soul she be then say he : the religion of the east _ be _ great religion jeannette they represent the best that man can do the orient have a genius for religion and it have produce far better system than the west could have do some of the truth that we western people get only in christianity the thinker of asia work out for themselves but god be back of it all that suit jw 's present mood all right then let 's clean up as we go -- delafield saint loui the southwest mexico latin america that be the logical order then the rest of the world marty put in a protest here : that will not do old man you logic 's lame you want we to go into mexico now with all we have get you letter have say so and you have say it again to-night but we be not ` clean up as we go ' look at delafield the town you have move away from look at saint loui the town where you make you living be they christianize clean up yet you be ready for mexico no you be all wrong jw i do not believe the world 's go to be save the way you break up prairie sod a field at a time and let the rest alone we have get to do we missionary work the way they feed famine sufferer they do not give any applicant all he can eat but they try to make the supply go ` round give each one a little remember jw the rest of the world be as human as we western hemisphere i know admit jw and i do not say i have get the right of it i would have to see the orient before i make up my mind but those country have wait a long while a few more year would not be any great matter alma wetherell now join the opposition it look as though jw and jeannette must stand alone for the old people say nothing though they listen with eager ear say alma i think it would matter a lot the more we do for one people while ignore all the other the less we should care to drop a develop work to begin at the bottom somewhere else there be something in that jw concede i be not mean to be stubborn but i have have just a glimpse of the size of the missionary job in one little corner of the world even that be too big for we we could put we whole missionary investment into mexico without be able to do what be need the missionary job as you call it be too big certainly for we present resource say the pastor everybody know that yes say marty who wonder if mr drury have forget they compact about jw but why limit ourselves to we present resource they be not all we could get if the church come to believe in the bigness of she privilege i would like to see for myself as jw say but i can not why do not you get a real travel job and go about the world look thing over for we old man I jw say sarcastically yes that be a likely prospect just as i be get over be scare by a sample case i 'll do well to hold the job i have get alma do not know what marty 's game be but she play up to he suggestion why should not you go she ask you have tell we that cumming hardware and tool be sell all over the world do not that mean salesman and be not you a salesman they have to send somebody why should not they pick on you some time jw rise to the lure for the moment all salesman nothing in it alma no chance at all but i would like to show the world the civilizing value of good tool and i would go if i get the chance jeannette 's reaction be quicker than think would you go half way around the world just for that she ask with a hint of alarm why yes i would say jw that be if you be willing whereupon everybody laugh but jeannette whose pale cheek flame into sudden rosiness the minister come to she rescue it would be a good thing every way if more layman would see the reality of oriental life and bring back a impartial report suppose you should be right jw and we find that the orient could wait until the western hemisphere have be thoroughly christianize think how many thousand -- perhaps million -- of dollar could be direct into more productive channel i can see what a great influence such report would have if they come from christian layman we have learn to expect story of complete failure when the ordinary traveler come back and maybe the missionary have they bias too but business man with christian ideal -- that would be different now all this be far from unpleasant to jw he detest pose but why would not it be worth something to have laymen report on missionary work of course though if the time ever come when the firm be willing to trust he abroad he would not have much chance to study mission business would have to come first it be no less a dream for be a agreeable one there be no danger of my go he tell they the cumming people be not send cub salesman to promote they big asiatic trade what could they make by it then the talk drift to the carbrook marty say well we have spoil you scheme a little jw right here in delafield joe carbrook and marcium be in china by now and i would like to see both of 'em as they get down to work you can not keep all we interest on this side of the pacific so long as those two be on the other no say jw warmly and i do not want to i 'll help to back up those two missionary wherever they go and he thought go back to camp fire night at cartwright institute when he have say to joe carbrook without suspect the consequence say joe if you think you could be a doctor why not a missionary doctor then he ask the company just where have these missionary infant be send nobody know exactly they have the name of the town and the province but the geography of china be not as yet familiar even to those who support the mission and missionary of that vast mysterious land the pastor think it be two or three hundred mile inland from foochow anyhow say he it be a good-sized town of about one hundred thousand people or more and joe 's hospital be the only one in the whole district the man whose place he take be home on furlough and i have look up he work in the annual report of the foreign mission board six or eight year ago the hospital be a building of sun-dried brick with a mud floor and accommodation for about seventy-five patient he be run it on something like five dollar a day but it be better now cost more too and there be a school attach where marcium have already begin to make herself necessary or i be much mistaken so the talk run on until the evening be far spend and everybody wish there could be half a dozen such evening before jw must go back to saint loui and the road no other opportunity offer however and all too soon for some people jw be go again from delafield walter drury see he chance set himself to follow up the talk of that one evening it have give he a lead as to the next phase of the experiment and he want to try out the idea before anything else might happen so he write to he brother albert in saint loui i know i be a bother to you the letter run but you have always be generous be you own unselfish self it be about young farwell ` john wesley jr ' you know i judge he be a boy with a fine business future and i have find out from he father some of the reason why he be make good now i do not know much about business but it seem to I that the very quality which make jw a good salesman for a beginner would be profitable to he company if they send he to they oriental trade he be young enough to learn something over there my own interest be not on that side of the affair but i know it would be out of the question to suggest he go unless the cumming people could see a business advantage in it if you think it be not ask too much i wish you would talk to mr mcdougall about it tell he what i have write and what i tell you long ago about jw albert drury have unbounded confidence in he brother 's sincerity and sense so he lose no time in get a interview with he friend mcdougall see here peter say he i 'll be frank with you i know you think i would better be if i be to get anywhere that be very true say mcdougall with assume severity well then read my brother 's letter and then tell I if he be want the impossible peter mcdougall read the letter twice no he say when he hand it back he be not want the impossible he be give I a idea i owe you something already for find this young fellow and i 'll tell you what i be think of of course the boy be not seasoned enough yet but he be get there fast a couple of long trip a few month under my own eye here in the office and he 'll be ready now you brother have hint at exactly what young farwell be good for that boy sell goods by get over onto the buyer 's side and he know tool -- know 'em before we hire he well then here be the idea one big need of we foreign trade be to show we agency what can really be do with american hardware and tool it take more than a salesman and farwell have the knack so there you be tell you brother the boy shall have he chance a few month later mcdougall send for jw and put the whole proposal before he but i be not a expert mr mcdougall jw protest i have not the experience and i might fall down completely in a new field like that we be not look for a expert say mcdougall shortly you know what every user of we stuff ought to know you can put yourself in he place and you 'll be a sort of missionary how about it at the word jw 's memory awake and he hear again what have be say in the living room at delafield when he be last at home a missionary and here be the very chance they have all talk about of course i should like to go if you think i 'll do he say peter look at he more kindly than be he wont my boy he say i know something about you outside of business though not much and i think you 'll do mind you you missionary work will be tool and hardware not the methodist church you will have to show people who have they own idea about tool how much more convenient we goods be handier lighter more adaptable what they need over there be modern stuff it will help they to raise more crop and do better work and earn a better income you have nothing to do with sell policy finance credit and all that just be a tool and hardware missionary where have you think of send I ask jw still somewhat dazed oh wherever we have agency that you can use as basis : china the philippine malaysium indium you will have to figure on a year or nearly that and you must not stick to the port or the big city get hold of people who 'll show you the country the place where we goods be most need and least known study the people and they tool work out better way of do thing do not try to hustle the east but remember that the east be do a little hustle on its own account these day and talk turkey to we agency -- when you be sure you have something to talk about the rest be detail the trip determine on preparation be hasten a month before the date of start jw have time for no more than a hurry visit to delafield to say good-by to the home folk and to the preacher whom he have come to think of as timothy might have think of paul then he have something else to say to jeannette he prospects be become so promising that he could ask she a very definite question and he dare to hope for a definite answer jeannette trouble at the thought of he long absence in strange land console herself by she promise which be he promise also as soon as he come home again they would be marry brother drury should officiate assist by the rev martin luther shenk brother of the charming bride as jw put it walter drury be not he usual alert self jw thought and it hurt he to see he much-loved friend touch even a little by the year but the pastor brighten up and grow visibly better as jw tell he all he plan just think mr drury he say with animation i be to be a missionary after all once long ago i remember you suggest i might go to china and see for myself the difference between they religion and ours and now i be go to china who know maybe i 'll see joe carbrook at he work and then i be to go all over the east to preach the gospel of better tool then he become thoughtful do not you think that be almost as good as the gospel of better body -- joe 's gospel surely i do say the pastor if you and joe preach in the same spirit know that china will not be save even by hospital and modern hardware they help but remember we understanding you have you chance now to see the religion of the east go right among the people as you will you can find out more in a week than the average tourist ever discover i 'll give you the name of some people who will gladly help you and we shall want a full report when you come back god bless you jw it be a tired preacher who go to bed that night this new adventure of he boy 's what would it mean to the experiment he have do he best to keep that long-ago pledge to himself not always have the project be easy he could not control all its circumstance but in the main it have go well and now jw be in the last stage of the experiment walter drury have contrived to shape its larger condition with the help of many friendly but unsuspecting conspirator this tour in the interest of better tool be due mainly to he initiative but he could do nothing more the event be now out of he hand the relax tension make he realize that he nerve be shaky and he have a sense of great depression but before he go to bed he pull himself together long enough to write to five missionary include joe carbrook whose field be on or near the route jw would travel he have tell jw that he would let these man know of he come but he do more to each one he say a word of appeal do not argue much with this boy of mine i want he to see it without too many second-hand opinion explain all you please and let he get as near as he can to the people you be deal with if as i hope he get a glimpse of the work 's inner meaning i shall be satisfied \* \* \* \* \* the first day which jw spend in shanghaus be a big day for he even amid the strangeness of the scene he feel almost at home the people who have the cumming agency have receive they instruction and be prepare to help he every way he could begin a up-country trip at once if he wish then he meet the first of the man to whom pastor drury have write mark rutledge and at once he see that this well-groomed alert young missionary who use modern speech in deliberate but direct fashion would be of immense service to he rutledge receive jw 's gospel of tool with almost boyish enthusiasm i have always say he exclaim that if the other business man of america have as much sense as the tobacco folk they would hasten the christianizing of china by many a year not that tobacco be help far from it but it be the idea of fitting they product to this particular market and you house have evidently catch that idea you must have a real sale manager in saint loui of course i 'll help you all i can some of the help which mark rutledge give he be of a sort that jw could not rightly estimate at the time but he know it be good as long as he stay in shanghaus and as often he come back to the city as a base he and rutledge be pretty frequently together the missionary keep he own counsel as to the drury letter merely drop a hint now and then or a suggestion which fit both the cumming agency 's program and the pastor 's desire the inland trip for business purpose keep jw busy for week he find himself in so utterly novel a situation that he see he could not work out anything without careful study and expert chinese cooperation as he come and go he see under rutledge 's guidance much of the inside of mission work in shanghaus he find a methodist publishing house send out literature all over china as well as two monthly papers one in chinese and one in english many missionary board have headquarters here from shanghaus as a business center every form of missionary work be be promote reach as far as the foothill of the thibetan plateau hospital equipment be distribute and school equipment and supplies of every variety he see that it be the financial center too and mission finance be a special science shanghaus seem to jw to be one of the great capital of the missionary world rutledge 's own work many side as jw see it be have two aspect of special significance rutledge be send back to america all the information he could gather from the whole field with the skill of a trained reporter he show the missionary how to write so as to make a genuine story seem convincing and how to subordinate the detail to the importance of make a clear and single impression the other work of rutledge 's which catch jw 's eye be he activity in behalf of the young people of china until lately nothing at all have be do comparable to the specialize development of young people 's work in america but now the epworth league be begin to be utilize and adapt to chinese way fund be available -- not much but a beginning leader be be train a larger measure of local chinese help be be employ jw ask mark rutledge about all this one day be not it go to make a difference with the work by and by if you get so many native into place of responsibility be they ready for it no say rutledge they be not but we must make they ready you have not begin to see china yet but already you can see that the country could never be ` evangelize ' even in the narrowest use of that word by foreign missionary and it ought not to be you mean that we american ought to consider we work in china as temporary jw ask rutledge answer frankly i do if you let I put my own meaning into ` temporary ' we must start thing and much that must be do in the long run have not yet be start we must stay here beyond my life expectation or yours but china will be christianize by the chinese not by foreigner as far ahead as we can see the work will have help from outside but i honestly want the time to come when we missionary will be look upon as the foreign helper of the chinese church not as now control the work ourselves and enlist the service of ` native helper ' then tell I another thing jw persist be we christianity as the chinese get it any advance on they own religion or be they religion all right if they would work it as we hope they may work the christian program that be two question say rutledge dryly but after all it be only one we christianity as the chinese get it be far ahead of the best they have in ideal in human value everything even if they be more consistent in respond to its claim than christian be the old religion -- and china have several -- be helpless we be not kill off the old faith if we should get out to-morrow these would none the less die out in time but then china would be leave without any religion at all instead she be go to have the christian faith in a form that will accord with the genius of the chinese mind that be my sure confidence or i would not be here it be necessary that jw should run down the coast to foochow the base for he next operation in the hardware adventure i know i be green he say to rutledge and i may be think of impossibility but do you suppose there 'll be any chance for I to get up to dr carbrook 's place from foochow i have tell you about he and he wife and i would rather see those two than anybody else in all the east it be not impossible at all rutledge assure he carbrook 's post be not so very far from foochow as distance go in china and ralph bellew at the college will help you yes my pastor at home tell I to be sure and call on he say jw and take he leave of a man he would long remember the call of professor bellew be not delay long after jw have find he bearing in foochow and the professor 's welcome be even more cordial than that of the cumming agency though these gentleman be of course the soul of courtesy if they be not so sure as peter mcdougall that jw or any other american could teach they anything about sell the cumming line in china at least they would not put anything in he way one important interior town yenping they have hope jw might visit but unfortunately there be no one connect with the agency who could be send with he they understand that some of he missionary friend be ready to help he in the general enterprise and perhaps they might be able to suggest something when the difficulty be state to professor bellew he say : why that be one of we station it be a little out of the way to go up to dr carbrook 's place on the way to yenping but we 'll see that you get to both town that be certainly good of you professor say jw gratefully i have tell you about joe carbrook and i can hardly wait until i get to he as a matter of fact he have tell everybody about joe carbrook professor bellew be sympathetic i know he say and i understand when you come back if we can manage the date you may find something here which you ought to see the carbrook hospital -- it have another name in the annual report but this will identify it sufficiently for we purpose -- spread itself all over the compound and beyond in its welcome to jw joe and marcium be first and joyfullest the school turn out to the last scholar and even the hospital 's walk case insist on have a share in the welcome to the foreign doctor 's friend tell we what you be up to say the carbrook when they be back in the house after a sketchy inspection of the whole establishment hospital dispensary school chapel and so forth and tell I what you be do with it now that you have the hospital you have be dream about so long say jw but jw tell he story first just to get it out of the way as he say then he turn to marcium and say how about it ` mrs carbrook ' well jw say marcium that name be not so strange as it be i be feel as if i have be marry a long time judge by the responsibility that be dump on I just because i be the doctor 's wife and this doctor man of mine hardly know whether to be happy or miserable he be happy because he have find the very place he want and he be miserable because he ought to be learn the language and can not get away from the work that crowd in on he and you yourself marcia jw ask be you happy or miserable or both she be as mix up as i be old man joe answer for she talk about the language i do not hanker after learn it but i have get to some time if they would just let I be a sort of deaf-mute doctor i would be much oblige the work be fairly maddening you know it be a question of close up this hospital or put I in as a green hand of course there be the nurse and a couple of student but i be glad they put I in only look at the job never a day without new patient a steady stream at the out-clinic why jw i have do operation alone here that at home they would hardly let I hold sponge for have to do 'em well jw comment be not that what you come for it be marcium answer -- these two have a queer way of speak for each other -- and it would be a good plenty if the hospital be all but we be put up a new building to take the place of a adobe horror and joe have to buy brick and deal with workman and give advice and dispense medicine and do operation all with the help of a none too sure interpreter he be the busiest man i do believe between here and foochow jw want to draw dr joe out about the work in general what of the evangelistic work and the educational work and all the rest but dr joe would not rise to it i 'll tell you honestly jw i just do not know have not have time to find out when i get here i find people stand three deep around the hospital door some want help for themselves and some anxious to bring relative or friend i be at work before anything be unpacked except my instrument and i have be at it ever since everything else could wait but all this human misery could not and i do not know much of what the evangelistic value of it all will be we have a bible woman and a teacher in the school who be very devoted they read and pray every day with the patient and as for gratitude i never expect to be thank for what i do as i have be thank here i 'll tell you one thing i do not dream a man could be so content in the midst of such a hurricane of work i be do to a standstill every day i bump into difficulty and tackle responsibility that i have not even hear of in medical school though i have not kill anybody yet and all the time i remember how i use to wish i might be the only doctor between siam and sunrise i be plenty near enough to that in all conscience the only doctor in this town of one hundred thousand and a district around we so big that i be afraid to measure it on one side the next doctor be a good hundred mile away now do you know how i feel oh yes insufficient until it hurt like the toothache yet somehow as though i be carry on here not in place of the man who have go home on furlough but in place of jesus christ himself you know i be not irreverent i might have be but this have take all of the temptation out of I it be he work not mine jw turn to marcia again i think you say this joe of yours be miserable i have see he when he be enjoy himself pretty well but i never see he like this i know marcium admit and i do not mean he be really unhappy but it be a big strain and there be no sign of its let up until the regular doctor get back the next day jw watch he old friend amid the press of duty which crowd the hour and he marvel as much as the wretchedness of the patient as he do at the steady resourcefulness of the man whom he have know when he be delafield 's adventurous and spendthrift idler as he look on jw could understand something which have be a closed book to he before no one could stand by and see this abjectness of need this helplessness this pathetic faith which be almost fatalistic in the foreign doctor 's miraculous power -- it recall that beseech cry in the new testament story lord if thou _ wilt _ thou _ canst _ -- without be deeply poignantly glad that there be such man as joe carbrook it be all very well to talk at long range about let china and other place wait but on the spot nobody could talk that way the visit might have last two week instead of two day and then the carbrook would have hang on and besought he to stay a little longer torture would not have draw any admission from they but back of all the joy in the work be a something that leave they without word as jw and he little group from foochow set out for the next stop place just before the last silent hand-grip jw tell he friend about jeannette and himself and promise joe a wedding present you see he say i never send you one when you be marry and i would like to send you a double one now for yourselve and for we you send I word what it be you most need for the hospital a x-ray outfit or a sterilizer or a thingamajig for make culture microscope include and jeannette and i will see that you get it i be a tither you know and my salary 's be raise and i want to do something to show what a fool i be before i know what sort of a business you be really in out here so do not be modest you can not hurt my feeling back at foochow in the course of the slow day which chinese travel give to those who go aside from the beaten path professor bellew welcome jw with eager warmth you be back just in time if you can stay a few day the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the college begin to-morrow jw have at least a week 's business with the cumming agent he have find some condition on he inland journey which call for much discussion so he have time for share in a good deal of the celebration it be something to marvel at that a christian college have be at work in this great city for forty year the president of the college and he wife start the proceedings with a formal reception at which a chinese orchestra furnished music outside the house and western musician render more familiar selection in the parlor alumnus flock to the reception man of every variety of occupation but all one in they devotion to they alma mater the next afternoon be give over to athletics and the evening to a lecture quite in the american fashion the third day be Sunday jw listen to a american missionary in the morning who speak boldly of the prime need for a college like this if the youth of china be to be train for the highest service to they country at night he sit through nearly three hour of the most amazing testimony meeting he have ever see it be lead by a chinese who have be graduate from the college thirty year before the eagerness almost impatience to confess what jesus christ and christian education have mean to these chinese leader -- for it be evident they _ be _ leader -- be a thing to stir the most sluggish christian pulse jw 's mind take he back to a memorable love feast at cartwright institute when joe carbrook have make he first confession of and surrender to jesus christ and it seem to he that the likeness between these two so different gathering be far more real than all they contrast on Monday the anniversary banquet bring the american consul a representative of the provincial governor and many other dignitary and on Tuesday the student put on a pageant which illustrate in gorgeousness of color and costume and accessory the history of the college besides all this pomp and circumstance there be a wonderful industrial exhibit the president of china send a scroll as do also the prime minister former student in the city of china from peke to amoy send subscription amount to twenty-five thousand dollar for new building and other old student in the philippine send a second twenty-five thousand dollar all of which stir jw to the very soul here be a christian college older than many in america its result could not be measure by any visible standard yet he have see graduate of the school and student who do not stay long enough to graduate man of light and lead man of wealth and station official man in whom the spirit of the new china burn christian worker and all these bear convincing testimony that this college have be the one great master influence of they life a christian college -- in china jw thought of it all and say to himself : i wonder if i be the same individual as he who not so many month ago be talk about the good sense of let china wait indefinitely for christ anyhow somebody have have better sense than that every day of the last forty year the tour of the tool be teach jw more than he could teach the merchant of asia and yet he be do no little missionary work as evidence both in he own report to peter mcdougall and still more in the report which go to that observant gentleman after jw have move on from any give place the cumming hardware corporation may be without a soul as corporation be know to be but it have many eye these eye follow jw 's progress from shanghaus to foochow to hong kong to manila they observe how he study artisan and they way with tool and the way of builder with house fitting and the various device with which in field and garden the toiler set themselves to they endless labor as the eye of the cumming organization see these thing the word go back across the water to saint loui and peter mcdougall take credit to himself for a commendable shrewdness but the ever-watchful eye have no instruction to report on the tool missionary 's other activity and therefore no report be make none the less they see and wonder and think that there be something back of it all there be more back of it than they could have guess for jw have come to a new zest for both of he quest the business which have bring he into the east be daily become more fascinating in its possibility and promise in even greater measure the interest which belong especially to this chronicle be take on a new importance everywhere he go he seek out the mission and the missionary he ply the worker with question on question until they tell he all the hope and fear and need and longing which often they hesitate to put into they official letter to the board in manila he see after a little more than two decade of far from complete missionary occupation the sign that a christian civilization be rise the school and church and hospital and other organization work establish in manila be proof that all through the island the everyday humdrum of missionary service be go forward perhaps without haste but surely without rest when he come to singapore that traffic corner to which all the sea road of the east converge he hear the story of a miracle and then he see the miracle itself the anglo-chinese college they tell he what it mean not the missionary only but the chinese merchant who control the cumming line for all the archipelago and sumatra planter and british official and business man from malaysian trade center whose name he have never before hear the teacher who put himself at jw 's service be one of the man to whom pastor drury have write he word of appeal on jw 's behalf he respect it altogether and the more because he well know that here be no need for mere talk a visitor with eye and ear could come to he own conclusion if the college be not its own strongest argument no word could strengthen it the college have be start by intrepid man who have no capital but faith and a overmastering sense of duty that be a short generation ago now jw saw crowded hall and student with purposeful face and he hear how at first by the hundred and now by thousand the product of this school be spread a sense of christian life-value through all the vast island and ocean space from rangoon to new guinea and from batavium to sulu but it may as well be tell that even more than china indium make the deepest impress on the mind and heart of we tool-traveler from the moment when he land in calcutta to the moment when he watch the low coast of the gange delta merge into the horizon far astern indium would not let he alone he see poverty such as could scarcely be describe and religious rite the very tell of which might sear the tongue if china 's poor have a certain apathy which seem like poise even in they wretchedness not so indium 's but rather a slow-moving misery a dull progress toward nothing better with only nothingness and its empty peace at last once in calcutta and he business plan set go he start out to find some of the city 's christian force they be not easy to find as in every oriental city missionary work be relatively small indeed j w begin to think that this third city of asia have little religion of any sort he have be prepare in part for the first meager showing of mission work on shipboard he have encounter the usual assortment of missionary critic the unobservant the profane the superior the loose-living and all that tribe the first of they he have meet on the second day out from san francisco and every boat which sail the eastern sea appear to carry its complement of self-appointed and all-knowing enemy of the whole missionary enterprise while steam up the bay of bengal the anti-mission chorus appear at its critical best jw be tell as they near calcutta that the indian christian be servile and slick and totally untrustworthy never have these expert observer see a genuine convert but only hypocrite liar petty thief and grafter in spite of it all at last he find the methodist mission and it be not so small when once you see the whole of it by great good fortune he instruction from home order he up country as far as cawnpore and to he delight he meet a methodist bishop one of the new one who be set out with a party for the northwest so on the bishop 's most cordial invitation he join himself to the company and learn in a day or two from expert how to make the best of indium 's rather try travel condition benare allahabad cawnpore lucknow -- jw come to these city with a queer feeling of have be there before long ago in he early Sunday school day the name of these place and the wonder of they have be the theme of almost the only missionary book he have at that age care to read at allahabad say he companion of the way a all-india epworth league convention be to be hold and jw make up he mind that a league convention in indium would be doubly worth attend he do attend it too but it leave no such memory as another gathering in the same city a memory which he know will last after every other picture of the east have fade from he recollection the party have reach allahabad at the time of the khumb melum a vast outpouring of mass humanity too great for any but the merest guess at its number this melum feast religious pilgrimage whatever it might mean to these endless multitude be hold here at stated time because the two sacred river the jumna and the gange come together at allahabad and tradition have it that a third river flow beneath the surface to meet the other so the place be trebly sacred its water potent for purification no matter how great one 's sin with the other jw set out for a advantageous observation point on the wall of the fort which stand on the tongue of land between the two stream on the way jw assure himself that if calcutta seem without religion here be more than enough of it to redress the balance in the throng be a holy man whose upraised arm have be hold aloft until it have atrophy and would never more swing by he side and yonder another holy one sit in the sand with a circle of little fire burn close about he the seeker after he know not what who make he search while lie on a bed of spike be here and once a procession pass two hundred man all holy after the fashion of hindu holiness all utterly naked with camel and elephant move in they train as if to show how these be count man of special sanctity the people fall on they face to the ground beside they as they pass and kiss they shadow on the sand the point of vantage reach jw 's bewildered eye could scarce make he brain believe what they see he be stand on a broad wall thirty foot above the water and perhaps a hundred foot back from it up and down the stream be a endless solid mass of head jw look for some break in the crowd some thin out of its packed body but as far as he could see there be no break no end government official have estimate the number of pilgrim at two million a signal must have be give or a hour have come -- jw could not tell which -- but somehow the people know that now be the opportunity to enter the water and gain cleanse from all sin a mighty resistless movement carry the human stream to meet the river inevitably the weaker individual be sweep along helpless and those who fall arise no more horrified jw stand look down on the slow irresistible movement of the writhe body and he see a woman drop a british police officer standing in a angle of the wall beneath order a native policeman to get the woman out but the native see the crush and unwilling to risk himself for so slight a cause wait until he superior turn away to another point of peril and then snatch the red-banded police turban from he head be lose in the general mass the woman trample to death and twenty other man and woman with she in sight of the stunned watcher on the wall who be compel to see these life crush out powerless to help by so much as a finger 's weight what be it all for jw ask he companion on the wall and they say that the word go out at certain time and the people flock to this melum they come to wash in the sacred water at the propitious moment nothing else matter not the inescapable pollution of the river not the weariness and hunger and many distress of the way it be a chance so the wise one declare to be rid of sin certainly it might not avail but who would not venture if mayhap there might be cleanse of soul in the water of mother gange on another day jw come to a temple not a great towering shrine but a third-rate sort of place a sacred cow temple here be a family which have journey four hundred mile to worship before the idol of this temple they offer rice to one idol flower to another holy water from the river to a third no one might know what inner urge have drive they here the priest slow to heed they at length deign to dip he finger in a little paint and with it he smear the caste mark on the forehead of the worshiper it be heartless empty formality jw watch the woman particularly she face be a unrelieved sadness she have fulfil the prescribe rite in the appoint place but there be no surcease from the endless round of dull misery which she know be she ordain lot think jw : i suppose this be a sort of join the church a initiation or something of that sort not much like what happen when i join the church in delafield everybody be glad there here nobody be glad not even the priest at cawnpore jw be able to combine business with he missionary inquiry here he find great woollen and cotton mill not unlike those of america except that in these mill woman and child be work long hour seven day a week for a miserable wage it be heathenism plus commercialism that be to say a double heathenism for when business be not temper by the christian spirit it be as pagan as any cow temple in these mill be a possible market for certain sort of cumming goods as jw learn in the business quarter of the city he want more opportunity to see how the goods he deal in could be use and have by now learn the path of least resistance he appeal to a missionary it be specially fortunate that he do for the missionary introduce he to the secretary of the largest mill in the city a indian christian with a history now this be a hint at the story of -- well let we call he abraham he own be another bible name of more humble association but he deserve to be call abraham thirty year ago a missionary first evangelize and then baptize some two hundred villager -- outcast untouchable social leper be newly become christian they depose they old village god the landlord beat they and berate they but they be do with the idol now that be no easy adventure of faith and those who thus adventure could not hope for material gain they be more despise than ever yet inevitably they begin to rise in the human scale the missionary find one of they a young man of part he he take and teach to read to write to know the scripture he begin to be a exhorter then a local preacher and at last he join the conference as a methodist itinerant at six dollar a month now this boy be the father of abraham as a preacher he open village school and teach the child they letter he own boy among they abraham learn quickly a place be find for he in a mission board school thence he move on and up to lucknow christian college it be this man who escort jw through the great mill of which he be a executive he have a salary of two hundred dollar a month if he father have be a american village preacher at twelve hundred dollar a year abraham 's salary relatively would need to be twenty or thirty thousand dollar abraham be the superintendent of a Sunday school in cawnpore he be give himself to all sort of betterment work which would lessen the misery of the poor he have a seat in the city council a hostel for boy be one of he enterprise here be a man do he utmost to christianize the industry in which thousand of he country man spend they life a second-generation christian and a man who must be reckon with no longer spurn and despise as a casteless nobody jw follow abraham about the mill with grow admiration inside the wall light orderly path flower cleanliness outside the gate to step across the road be to walk a thousand year into the past among the smell and the ageless noise of the bazaar with its chaffering and cheat its primitive crudity and its changeless wares certainly a cawnpore mill be not the ideal industrial commonwealth but without man like abraham to alleviate its grimness the come of larger opportunity through work like this might well lay a heavier burden on man 's life than the primitive and costly toil which it have displace there be just time for a visit to lucknow a city which to the british be the historic place of mutiny and siege to american methodist a place both of history and of present-day advance jw worship in the great hindustani methodist church the busy home of many activity in the congregation be many student girl from isabellum thoburn college and boy from lucknow christian college lifelong methodist as he be jw quickly recognize even amid these new surroundings the familiar aspect of a methodist church on its busy day the crowd congregation be enough to stir one 's blood a noble organ sound out the call to worship and lead the choir and people in the service of praise there be a Sunday school in full operation and a epworth league chapter completely organize and active he guide confide to jw that this church have yet another point of resemblance to the great church at home it be quite accustomed to send a committee to conference to tell the bishop whom it want for preacher next year jw be not quite satisfied the day of he wanderings must soon be over but before he leave indium he want to see the missionary in actual contact with the immemorial paganism of the village for he have discover that the village be indium how be the christian message meeting all the dreary emptiness and limitation of village life once more he appeal to he missionary guide this latest one the last of the five man to whom pastor drury have write before jw have set out on he travels could he show he visitor a little of missionary work in village environment surely nothing easier the district superintendent say we 'll jump into my ford -- great thing for indium the ford and still greater for we missionary -- and we 'll go a-village the village of they quest once reach the ford draw up before a neat brick house build around three side of a courtyard with veranda on the court side this be no usual mud hut but a house and a parsonage withal here live the indian village preacher and he family the preacher 's wife be neatly dress and capable the child clean and well-mannered the room have its table and on the table book that mean nothing to jw but the superintendent give he to understand that a table with book in a indian village house be comparable in its rarity to a small-town american home with a pipe organ and a butler the lunch of native food seem delicious if it be hot to jw 's healthy appetite and if he have not see over how tiny a fire it have be prepare he would have credit the smile housewife with a lavishly equip kitchen people begin to drop in it be somewhat disconcerting to the visitor to see these caller squat on they heel talk one to another but watch he continually out of the corner of they eye one of they the chaudrie headman of the village be introduce to jw tell he the superintendent act as interpreter how the boy ' school flourish and how he and other christian have go yesterday on a evangelize visit to another village not yet christian but sure to ask for a teacher soon the preacher in a rather precise clip english ask jw if he care to walk about the village we could go to the _ mohullum _ -lrb- ward -rrb- where most of we christian live they will be most glad to welcome you the way lead through dirty narrow street or rather let we say through the space between dwelling to the low-caste quarter here be people of the bottom stratum of indian life yet it be a christian community in the make the little school be in session -- a group of fifteen or twenty boy and girl with they teacher it be all very crude but the child read they lesson for the visitor and do sum on the board and sing a hymn which the pastor have compose and recite the lord 's prayer and the twenty-third psalm these say the pastor be the child of a people which for a thousand year have not know how to read or write yet see how they learn yes the superintendent agree but that be not the best of it as you know they be untouchable now but even caste which be stronger than death yield to education once these boy and girl have a education they can not be ignore or keep down they will find a place in the social order i can see that jw say thinking of abraham but education be not a missionary monopoly be it if these child be educate by hindu would not the result rise in they condition come just the same it would perhaps the missionary answer but you ` if ' be too big for the low caste and the out-caste people there be no education unless it be christian education we have a monopoly though not of we choose the educate hindu will not do this work under any circumstance it have be try with all the prestige of the government which be no small matter in indium and nothing come of it not long ago the government propose a wonderful scheme for the education of the ` depressed class ' the money be provide and the equipment as well there be plenty of hindu that be non-christian who be indebted to the government for they education they be invite to take position in the new school but no not for any money or any other inducement would these teacher go near and there you be i know of no way out for the great mass of indium except as the gospel open the door be there no attempt of any sort on the part of indian who be not christian surely some of they be enlighten enough to see the need and to rise above caste jw suspect he be ask a question which have but one answer yes there be such a effort occasionally the superintendent admit the arya samaj movement make a attempt once in a while but it always fail if a few be bold enough to disregard caste they be never enough to do anything that count the effort be scarcely more than a gesture and even so it would not have be make but for the activity of the missionary \* \* \* \* \* and so end jw 's indian study before many day he be retrace he way -- calcutta singapore hongkong shanghaus yokohama and then on a day he find himself aboard a liner whose prow turn eastward from japan 's great port and he heart be fly a homeward-bound pennant the like of which never trail from any masthead this experiment teacheth -- for the first day or so out from japan jw behave himself as do any ordinary american in similar case all the sensation of the journey be swallow up in the depths of he longing to be home the voyage so slow the pacific so wide but shortly he resign himself to the pervade restfulness of shipboard and begin to make acquaintance of they all one only have any interest for we -- miss helen morel late of manila she place be next to he at the table like jw she be travel alone and before they have be on board twenty-four hour they have discover that both be methodist he from delafield in the middle west she from pennsylvanium jw find altogether to he surprise that she listen with flattering attention while he talk for jw be no braggart nor be he overmuch give to self-admiration we know he better than that but it be pleasant none the less on good day to walk up and down the long deck and on other day to sit in comfortable deck chair with nothing to do but talk miss morel be a teacher go home after three year of steady close work in a manila high school be ready to talk of anything but school work she find herself immensely interested in jw 's experience he have tell she of the double life so to say which he have lead preach the good news of better tool and study the work of other man and woman as truly salesman as himself who preach a more arrest and insistent gospel i be glad to meet some one who know about mission at first hand miss morel begin one morning as they step out on the promenade deck for they constitutional you know i think people at home do not understand at all they be so absorb with they little parish affair that they can not appreciate this wonderful work that be be do so far from home jw agree though not without mental reservation he know how true it be that many of the home folk do not rightly value mission work but he be not so sure about they little parish affair he watch to see if miss morel mean to expand that idea but she evidently have think at once of something else say she sometimes i think that if the gossip about missionary and mission which be so general in the orient get back home as it surely do in one way or another it must have a certain influence on what people think about the work oh that say jw with no little scorn that stuff be always ignorant or malicious and i doubt if it get very far with church people of course it may with outsider i have hear it any amount of it you can not miss it if you travel in the east and there be just enough excuse for it to make it a particularly vicious sort of slander you could say as much about the church at home and a case here and there would not be lack to furnish proof certainly say the teacher and yet mission be so wonderful so much more worth while than anything that be be do at home do not you think there it be again i be afraid i do not follow you miss morel jw say with a puzzle air do you mean that the church at home be not onto they job if you 'll excuse the phrase he companion laugh as she answer maybe not quite as strong as that but they be do the same old thing in the same old way go to church and home again to Sunday school and home again to young people 's meeting and home again but out here and she hand swing in a half circle as though she mean to include the whole pacific basin out here man and woman be do such splendid pioneer work in all sort of fascinating way true enough jw assent i have see that all right but the home church be not so dead as you might think just before i leave delafield to go to saint loui for instance a new work for the foreign-speaking people of we town be be start with the board of home mission and church extension back up the local worker they be plan to make a great church center for all these people and i hear that it be get a good start oh yes i can well believe that mr farwell miss morel hasten to say i think work for the immigrant be so very interesting do not you but of course that be not quite what i mean the usual dull thing that church do you know well take another instance that i happen to remember jw have a touch of the sort of feeling he use to delight in at cartwright when he be gather he material for a debate my first summer after leave college a few of we in first church get busy study we own town we find two of the general church board ready to help we with fact and method the home mission people give we one sort of help and another board with the longest name of they all the board of temperance prohibition and public moral show we how to go about a investigation of the town 's undesirable citizen and they influence it be in that sort of business for all of we you know that must have be exciting say miss morel i know i should enjoy such work what do you find out and what could you do about it that be a question not to be glibly answer jw know but he mean to be fair about it we find out plenty that surprised we a great deal he add that ought to be do and much more that need to be change we even go so far as to draw up a sort of civic creed ` the everyday doctrine of delafield ' the town paper print it and it be talk about for a while but probably we be the people who get the most out of it it show we what we church member might mean to the town and that be worth something miss morel be sure it be but she come back to she first idea about the home church do not you think that much of the preaching and all that be pretty dull and tiresome i come from a little country church and it be so dreary jw thought of deep creek and say i know what you mean but even the country church be improve i must tell you some time about marty my chum he be a country preacher help in he training by the rural department of the home mission board and he people come in crowd to he preach country church be wake up and the board people at philadelphium have have a lot to do with it well i be glad but anyway home mission be rather commonplace have not you notice and miss morel look almost as though she be ask a question of state i can not say i have find it so jw say stoutly i be some time learn but i run into a lot of experience before i leave home take the work for color people for instance i have to make a speech at a convention and i find out that we church have a board of education for negro which be do more than any other agency to train negro preacher and teacher and home maker and doctor and other leader that be not so very commonplace would you say so well no the young lady admit it be very important work of course and i would dearly love to have a share in it i be a great believer in the color race you know but you be make I begin to think i be all wrong about the church at home i do not mean to belittle it perhaps i appreciate it more than i realize anyway tell I something else that you have find out there be not time jw object but if you will not think I a nuisance maybe i can tell you part of it for example Sunday school long ago i discover that the whole church be provide for Sunday school progress through a board of Sunday school and there be not a modern Sunday school idea anywhere that this board do not put into its scheme of work i be a very small part of it myself for a while so i know yes and even i know a little about the Sunday school board confess miss morel it have help we a lot in the philippine and so i must admit that the church do try to improve and extend Sunday school work what else jw tell about he experience on the mexican border where home mission and foreign mission come together then see that she be really listen he tell of he and marty 's college day how marty have borrow money from the board of education and how the same board have a hand in the college evangelistic work he tell about the deaconess who manage the hospital at manchester and the training school which marcia dayne carbrook have attend when she be get ready to go to china that school have send out hundred of deaconess and other worker the thought of marcium make he think of joe and he tell what he know of how the wesley foundation at the state university have help joe when he could easily have make shipwreck of he missionary purpose of course the story of he visit to the carbrook in china must also be tell miss morel change the subject again tell I mr farwell she ask be you in the epworth league when you be at home i surely be say jw that be where i get my first start at the cartwright institute and the story jump back to those far-off day when he be just out of high school as he pause miss morel say i be a epworthian too and in the young woman 's missionary society we have a combination society in we church so i be a ` queen esther ' and a ` standard bearer ' as well those organization do I a world of good you know when i think of it the woman 's missionary society have do a wonderful work in america and everywhere i guess they have say jw i know my mother have always be a member of both and she be always be the most intelligent and active missionary in the farwell family the talk languish for a while and then miss morel exclaim i know why we have stop talk we be hungry it be almost time for luncheon and if you have a appetite like mine you be impatient for the call jw look at he watch and see that there be only ten minute of the morning leave so they separate to get ready against the sound of the dinner gong but jw be not hungry he be struggle with a old thought that to he have all the tantalizing quality of novelty the talk of the morning have become a sort of roll-call of church board how do it happen that the church be busy with this and that and the other work why a board of hospital and home why a deaconess board even though deaconess work happen to be merciful and gentle and christlike what be the church do with a book concern how come it that we have that board with the long name -- temperance prohibition and public moral he have travel from yokohama to lucknow and back and everywhere he have find this same church do all sort of work with no slightest suspicion but that all of it be she proper business so picture after picture flicker before he mind 's eye as though he brain have build up a five-reel mental movie from all sort of memory film a hundred foot of this two hundred of that a thousand here there just a flash it have all one common mark it be all the church but the hit-and-miss of it its lightning change bewilder he the picture leap from cartwright to cawnpore from the country church at elli to joe carbrook 's hospital in china from new york and philadelphium and chicago and cincinnatus and washington to the end of the country and the end of the earth and in and through it all swift bit of unrelated yet vivid hint of _ advocate _ and _ herald _ of prayer meeting and institute of new church and old college of revival and sew society of league social and annual conference of deaconess visit dreary home and soft-footed nurse go about in great hospital of beginner ' department and old people 's home of kindergarten and clinic and preparatory class there seem no end to it all every moment some new aspect of the church 's activity show itself and then be go it be a most confused and confusing experience and all through the rest of the day jw catch himself wonder again and again at the variety and complexity of the church 's affair why should a church be occupy with all this medley why should it be so distract from its main purpose to be a jack of all trade why should it open its door and train its worker and spend its money in persistent response to every imaginable human appeal perhaps that might be it _ human _ once a philosopher have say i be a man and therefore nothing human be foreign to I what if the church by its very nature must be like that what if this really be its main purpose -- all these varied and sometimes almost conflicting activity no more than its effort to obey the central law of its life jw be in he stateroom he pace the narrow aisle between the berth -- three step forward three step back like a caged wild thing something be come to new reality in he soul he be scarce conscious of the wall that shut he in once he stop by the open port he look out at the tumble roller of the wide pacific and as he look he think of the vastness of this sea how its water wash the icy shore of alaska and the palm-fronded atoll of the marquesa how they carry on they bosom the multitudinous commerce of a hundred people how from santiago to shanghaus and from the yukon to new zealand it be one ocean serve all land and take toll of all in spite of all the complexity and diversity of the land about this ocean they have one possession which all might claim as it claim they -- the sea it give they neighbor and trade climate and they daily bread in the sociology and geography and economics of the orient this pacific ocean be the great common denominator _ and in the geography and economics and sociology of the kingdom of god might it not be -- must it not be the church _ not only the pacific basin but the round world be like that every part of it dependent on all the rest and grow every day more and more conscious of all the rest railway help this process and so do steamship and air route and telegraph and wireless more than that all the world be become increasingly related to the life of every part with raw material produce in brazil to make tire for the limousine of fifth avenue and the lake shore drive what of the new kinship between the producer in brazil and the user in the state all good be come to be the good of all the earth and all evil be able to affect the life of unsuspecting folk half the earth 's circumference away in such a time what a insistent call for the program and power of the christian faith and the call could be answer jw have see the church apply the program as well in a chinese city and in a indian village as in he home town and on the mexican border he be sure that the power that be in the christian message could heal all the hurt of the world and bring all people into a world-commonwealth of good will this be what jesus mean to do not just to save here and there a little group for heaven out of the general hopelessness but to save and make whole the heart of mankind the church be not first of all seek its own enlargement but extend the reach of its founder 's purpose it do all its many-sided work for a far greater reason than any increase in its own number and importance in a word for the christianizing of life Sunday and every day in delafield as well as in the forest of the amazon and the huddle city of china jw sit on the edge of he berth in the first glow of this new understand he nerve have steady to a serenity that be akin to awe yet he know he have make no great discovery the thing he see have be there all the time then he mind set to work again on that motley procession of picture which he have liken to a patchwork film be it as disjointed as it seem could it not be so put together as to make a true continuity consistent and complete why not in the event of he own life strangely enough he have the clue to its right arrangement by what seem to be accidental or incidental opportunity it have be he singular fortune to come in contact with some aspect or another of all the work he church be do and every element of it from the beginner ' class at delafield to the language school at nank from the college social in first church to the celebration at foochow -- it be all new testament work its center be always jesus christ 's teaching or example or appeal there be in its complexity a vast simplicity each be a part of all and all be in each john wesley farwell jr say that young man to himself this thing be not you discovery -- but how do that bit of keat ' go ` then feel i like some watcher of the sky when a new planet swim into he ken or like stout cortez when with eagle eye he stare at the pacific -- and all he man look at each other with a wild surmise -- silent upon a peak in darien ' there you have it but i might have know cortez if it _ be _ cortez could not have guess the pacific he have nothing to suggest it but i might have guess the singleness of the church 's work what be my name for unless i can appreciate the man who say ` the world be my parish ' and who would do anything -- sell book keep a savings bank open a dispensary -- for the sake of save soul that be the single idea the simple idea it make all these queer activity part of one great activity and rest they all on one under-girding truth -- ` the church 's one foundation be jesus christ she lord ' but the wonderful thing to I be that after all this time i should suddenly have find this out for myself what a story to take home to delafield pastor drury be go to have the surprise of he life \* \* \* \* \* three people meet jw as he train pull in to the station at delafield the other two be he father and mother after the first tearfully happy greeting jw look around the platform i rather think brother drury might have come too he say the other exchange mean glance and he father ask then you do not get my second letter at san francisco no say jw in vague alarm only the one what be wrong be mr drury -- he be at home now son say the elder farwell gravely he come home from we conference hospital at hillcrest two week ago we hope he be go to gain considerable strength but he be have some sort of a stroke we do not rightly know what and he be pretty hard hit he be better than he be last week but he can not leave he room sit in he easy chair and do not say much jw 's heart ache without always realize it he have be count on long talk with the pastor there be so much to tell he and especially so since that wonderful day out in the middle of the pacific when he have see what he even dare to call he ` vision ' of the church so he say you and mother drive on home i 'll walk up with jeannette for lover who have just meet after a year 's separation these two be strangely subdue they have everything to say to each other but this sudden fall of the shadow of suffer on they meeting check the word on they lip will he get better jw ask jeannette they fear not she answer the doctor say he may live for several year but he will never preach again he just sit there he be be so anxious to see you you must go to-day of course and what shall i say about the wedding if he can not leave he room -- jeannette interrupt he : if he can not leave he room it will make no difference church wedding or home wedding i should have choose as i have tell you but you and i john wesley be go to be marry by walter drury wherever he be if he be alive on we wedding day why yes say jw with a little break in he voice it would not seem right any other way we can have the dinner or breakfast or whatever it be just the same but we 'll be marry in he room i be glad you feel that way about it too though it be just like you and it be so jw go up to the study as soon as he could rid himself of the dust of the day 's travel more eager to show walter drury he love he than to tell he story or even to arrange for the wedding as to that ceremony the plan have long ago be understand nothing more be need than to tell walter drury he study afford a better background and set for this particular wedding than a cathedral could provide jw be prepare for a great change in pastor drury but he notice no such sign of breakdown as he have expect to see he do not know that the beloved pastor be key up for this meeting he could not guess that the beam eye the old radiant smile the touch of color in a face usually pale be on special if unconscious display because the pastor 's heart be thank god that he have be permit to welcome home he son in the gospel those have be dreary day in the hospital despite the ceaseless ministry of nurse and doctor and friend from delafield this hospital be a place of noble service one of many such place which have arise in the methodism of the last forty year it be a hospital through and through -- the last word in equipment and competence but not at all a institution it be at once a home for the sick and a training school of the christian grace where the distressed of body and mind could be give the relief they need -- all of it give gladly in christ 's name walter drury be not unmindful of the care and skill which the hospital staff lavish on he though no more faithfully on he than on many a unknown or unresponsive patient but he be in a pitifully question mood the doctor have tell he he could not expect to preach again when the district superintendent have come to visit he he carry away with he walter drury 's request for retirement at the come session of the annual conference in he quiet moment -- there be so many of they now -- the broken man count up he year of service all too few as it seem to he and lack much of what they might have show in outcome for the church and the kingdom he conference be one of the few which pay the full annuity claim of its retired preacher but even so he have not much to look forward to he twenty-five year in the active rank mean that he could count on twenty-five time $ 15 a year $ 375 on which to live when he give up he work perhaps he could live on this with what little he have be able to put aside at any rate he could be glad now that there be none but himself to think about but be it worth all he have put into he vocation he brother in saint loui not remarkably successful in he business have be able at least to make some provision for he old age he too might have be a moderately successful business or professional man truly it be more than the older preacher have this conference annuity which would keep he from actual want so much surely have be gain by the church 's grow sense of responsibility for its veteran but have it really pay be all the gentle efficiency of the hospital and all the church 's money which would come to he from the conference fund and the board of conference claimant enough to compensate he for the long year when he have be spendthrift of all he power for the sake of he work he know of course the answer to he question no one better but he be a broken-down preacher old before he time and know the answer be not at all the same as _ have _ the answer so he have be bring home from hillcrest mind-weary and much cast down nor do he regain any of he old buoyancy of spirit until the day when they tell he j w would be home next week it be then that he tell himself if jw have come back with only a story to tell -- and gloom be in he face but if he have come back with _ the _ story to tell -- and he heart leap within he at the think the pastor and jw be soon talk away with the old familiarity but mostly about inconsequential neither be quite prepared for more intimate communion and of course the return traveler have much to do the wedding be near at hand and everybody but himself have be get ready this long time so the call be too brief to suit either of they with the longer visit each hope for of necessity defer to a more convenient season jw must make a hurry journey to saint loui to turn in he report to peter mcdougall which report peter be much better prepared to receive than jw suspect and a highly satisfactory arrangement be make for jw 's continued connection with the cumming hardware corporation doubtless all wedding be much alike in they ceremonial aspect short or long solemn-spoken ancient ritual or commonplace legal form the essence of they all be that this man and this woman
