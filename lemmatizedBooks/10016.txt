culminate period of the summer season it be natural that the civic mind should turn itself to the contemplation of sweet rural thing include shady grove lunch-baskets wild flower sandwich bird song and bottled lager-bier the sky be at they bluest now the wood and field be at they greenest flower be bloom they yellowest and purplest and scarletest all nature be smile in fact with one large comprehensive smile exactly like a first-class prang chromo with a fresh coat of varnish upon it thing be thus what can be more charming than a rural excursion to some tangled thicket the very bramble and poison-ivy and possible copperhead snake of which be point of unspeakable value to a picnic party because they be sensational and one can not have they in the city without rush into fabulous extra expense it be good then that neighbor should club together for the festive purpose of the picnic and a few word of advice regard the arrangement of such party may be seasonable if you excursion include a steamboat trip always select a boat that be likely to be crowd to its utmost capacity more especially one of which a majority of the passenger be baby in arm there will probably be some rough on board who will be certain to get up a row in which case you can make the baby in arm very effective as buffer for ward off blow while the crowd will save you from be knock down should there be a bar on board the steamer it will be the duty of the gentleman of the party to keep serve the lady with cool beverage from it at brief interval during the trip this will promote cheerfulness and at the same time save for picnic duty proper the contents of the stone jar that be slumber sweetly among the pork-pie and apple-dumpling by which the lunch-basket be occupy never take more than one knife and fork with you to a picnic no matter how large the party may be the probability be that you may be attack by a gang of rowdy and it be no part of you business to furnish they with weapon avoid take up you ground near a swamp or stagnant water of any kind this be not so much on account of mosquito as because of the small saurian reptile that abound in such place if you party be a large one there will certainly be one lady in it at least who have have a lizard in she stomach for several year and the struggle of the confine reptile to join its congener in the swamp might induce convulsion and so mar the hilarity of the party to provide against a attack by the city brigand who be always prowl in the vicinity of picnic party it will be judicious to attend to the follow rule : select all the fat woman of the party and seat they in a ring outside the rest of the picnicker and with they face toward the center of the circle in the event of a discharge of missile this will be find a very effective _ cordon _ -- quite as effective in fact as the feather bed use in the make up of barricade let the baby of the party be so distribute that each or as many as possible of the gentleman present can have one at hand to snatch up and use for a fender should a attack at close quarter be make if any dark designful stranger should intrude themselves upon the party unbidden the gentleman present should by no means exhibit the slightest disposition to resent the intrusion or to show fight as the stranger be sure to be professional thief and as such ready to commit murder if necessary treat the stranger with every consideration possible under the circumstance should there be no champagne apologize for the absence of it and offer the next best vintage you happen to have of course have lunch the stranger will be eager to acquire possession of all valuable belong to the party the gentleman therefore will make a point of promptly hand over to they they own watch and jewelry as well as those of they lady friend have arrive home -lrb- we assume the possibility of this -rrb- refrain carefully from communicate with the police on the subject of the event of the day the publicity that would follow would render you a object of derision and no possible good could result to you from disclosure of the fact but you should at once make up you mind never to participate in another picnic \* \* \* \* \* a chance for we organ grinder the famous _ mitrailleur _ or grape-thrower with which loui napoleon have already commence to astonish the prussian suggest congenial work for the numerous performer on the barrel-organ with which we large city be at all time infested it be work with a crank exactly after the manner of the too-familiar street instrument and might easily be fit with a musical cylinder arrange for the performance of the most inspiriting and patriotic french air should italy at present neutral take side with france hereafter she should at once

descend from the famous chicken-dealer of sorrento who sell fowl in naple and be well-known in that fun-loving city for the humor of he speech and the oddity of he form he be call pulcinella i believe the name be the same as that of he wares if not to this celebrated wag perhaps you trace you origin to mr puccio d'anello who so delight a company of actor at acerium with he joke and gibe that they invite he to join they and soon discover that they have find a star if neither of these classical wag be you ancestor may i ask who the deuce _ do _ you come from yours truly curioso \* \* \* \* \* recipe to be test we see that they have be firing cannon in the field near pari to bring on a rain if there be any virtue in this recipe they be likely to get some moist weather to the north-eastward of pari to say the least the firing in that quarter may even lead to a reign in pari such as france have not lately see we would not go so far as to _ predict _ anything of this sort oh no for we be aware that the moment we should do so napoleon would lick the prussian on purpose to show the world that we do not hit it that time \* \* \* \* \* the water place punchinello 's vacation when one want to see the great people who be to be see nowhere else one go to the celebrated white sulphur spring of virginium and very correctly suppose that there might be person there who would like to see he mr punchinello take a trip to the aforesaid spring he find it charming there there be such a chance to study character from the parlor where chief-justice chase and general lee be hob-nobbing over apple-toddy and peach-and-honey to the cabin where the ward of the nation be luxuriate in picturesque ease beneath the shade of they newly-fledged angel of liberty everything be instructive to the well-balanced mind here too in these fertile region be to be see those exquisite floral creation know as mint-julep the absence of which in we northern agricultural exhibition can never be sufficiently deplored witness the beauty of the design and the ingenious delicacy of the execution of one of the humblest of the species from experience in the matter mr p be prepare to say that not only as a exponent of the beauty of nature but as a drink a mint-julep be far superior to the water which give thin resort its celebrity why people persist in drinking that vilest of all water which be find at the fashionable spring mr p can not divine if it be medicine you want you can get you drug at any apothecary 's and he will mix they in water for you for a very small sum extra and the saving in expense of travel board and extra will be enormous but in spite of this fact there be plenty of distinguished-looking people at the white sulphur mr p do not know they all but he have no doubt that one of they be general lee one phil sheridan another prof maury another goldwin smith and other governor wise henry ward beecher wade hampton wendell phillips raphael semme and lucretium mott one man a incognito excited mr p 's curiosity this personage be generally find in the society of lee johnston pope hampton greeley and those other fellow who do so much to injure the union cause during the war one day mr p accost he he be a oddity and perhaps it would be a good idea to put he picture in the paper sir say mr p with that delicate consideration for which he be so note why do you pull you hat down over you eye and what be you object in thus conceal you identity come sir let we know what it all mean the _ incognito _ glance at mr p with the corner of he eye and perceive that he

practical sense -- or the decline of the inventive faculty -- in writer for the young a better day be dawn and there be still some hope for the world man of sense and morality be come forward : they dedicate they mind to this service -- those practical mind whence will be extract the only true pabulum for the grow intellect it be to mind of this stamp -- so truly the antipode of all that be youthful spontaneous and child-like -lrb- in a word : frivolous -rrb- that we must look for those solid work which in the millennium that be come will perfectly supplant what may be term without levity the cock and bull system of juvenile entertainment worldly people may consider this stuff graceful and touching sweet and loveable but it be nevertheless clearly mischievous else pious and proper person would not have say so time and again for we part we may as well confess that we sympathy go out undividedly toward that important class who be averse to nonsense -- more particularly _

impatience of theory that positive and self-reliant -- we do not mind say somewhat dogmatical -- air that sternness of feature thinness of lip and coldness of eye which belong to the best example we respect even the humbler one for they at least hate sentiment they do not comprehend or approve of humor and they never relish wit what do a taste for these quality indicate but a idle and frivolous mind devote to trifle : and how fatal be such a taste in the pursuit of wealth and respectability fantastic people have much to say of the affection the grace and amenity of life soul-culture and the like we can not too deeply deplore they fatuity in give prominence to such abstraction as for child the most we can concede be that they have a natural -- though of course depraved -- taste for story : yes we will say that this fondness be irrepressible but what we really must insist on be that in gratify that fondness you give they _ true _ story where be the carefully train and upright soul that would not reject jack the giant-killer or goody two-shoe if it could substitute -lrb- say from new and true story for child -rrb- a tale as thrilling as this : when i be a boy i say to my uncle one

you have how replete with useful matter must not a book with _ that _ assurance be let we read : the indian can not build a ship they do not know how to get iron from the mine _ and they do not know enough _ besides they do not like to work and like to fight _ better _ than to work when they want to sail they burn off a log of wood and make it hollow by burn and scrape it with sharp stone now we ask do not this satisfy you ideal of food for the youthful mind observe that it be simple direct graphic satisfy it can not enfeeble the intellect it will be useful there be something tangible about it the child at once perceive that if the indian know how to get iron from the mine and know enough in general they would build ship in spite of they distaste for work there can be no doubt that this be all truth -- no fiction for indian be sadly in want of ship they like to sail for we learn that when they want to sail they be so wild for it that they even go to the length of burn off a log of wood and make it hollow by burn and scrape it with sharp stone we thus perceive the significance of the apothegm truth be stranger than fiction the day be not far distant when child will think as much of the new literature as they formerly do of certain worm-lozenge for which they be say to cry and where everything have be inspire by the love of truth even the cut may teach something if a canoe contrary to the general impression be at least as long as a ship it be very important that child should so understand it and if a pin-fish be really as big as a shark no mistaken deference to the
