from gutenberg to the reformation -rrb- charle f horne the renaissance mark the separation of the mediaeval from the modern world the wide difference between the two epoch of teutonic history arise we be apt somewhat glibly to say from the fact that we ancestor worship and be rule by brute force whereas we follow the broad light of intellect perhaps both statement require modification yet in a general way they do suggest the change which by a thousand different agency have in the course of the last four century be force upon the world mediaeval europe be a land not of equal but of lord and slave the powerful noble regard themselves as of wholly different clay from the hapless peasant whom they trample under foot serf so ignorant so brutalize by want that they be often little better than the beast with which they herd gradually the tradesman the middle class force they way to practical equality with the noble then come the turn of the mass to do the same the beginning of the merchant ' movement we have already trace in the precede volume the end of the peasant ' effort be perhaps even to-day scarce yet accomplish in deal with modern history therefore every writer be apt to begin with a different date some go back as far as petrarch who reintroduce the study of ancient art and learn that be they regard we world as a direct continuation of the roman with the thousand year of the middle age gaping between like a earthquake gulf of barbarism that be bridge at last some take the invention of printing as a starting-point feeling that the chief element of we progress have be the gathering of information by the poorer class some look to political change turn to the reign of loui xi of france note he as the first modern king or to the downfall of charle the bold the last great feudal noble other name later starting-point such as the establishment of modern art by michelangelo and raphael at rome the discovery of america with its opening of vast new land for the pent-up population of narrow europe or the reformation which have be call man 's revolt against superstition the establishment of the independence of think all of these epoch fall within the limit of the renaissance and all except that of petrarch within the later renaissance which we be now consider the period be therefore worth careful study intellectual supremacy of italy gutenberg 's invention have no immediate effect upon he world -lrb- 1 -rrb- indeed so little enthusiasm do it arouse that while the inventor 's plan be probably evolve as early as 1438 it be not until 1454 or thereabout that the first complete book be issue from he press he business partner faust sell he wares in wealthy pari without explain that these be different from earlier hand-written book and when they cheapness as well as they exact similarity be discover the merchant be suspect of have sell himself to the devil hence probably originate the faust legend superstition it be evident have still a extended course to run it be worth note that to sell he book faust left germany for pari and that while printing-presses multiply but slowly in the land of they origin the new art be instantly seize upon in italy be there make widest use of and push to its perfection in fact through all the middle age the romance or semi-teutonic people of italy france and spain be intellectually in advance of the more wholly teutonic race of the north many of they descendant believe half contemptuously that the difference have not even yet be overcome italy at this time hold clearly the intellectual supremacy of the western world and florence under the medicus cosmo and then lorenzo hold the supremacy of italy -lrb- 2 -rrb- not only in thought but in art be there a outburst brilliant beyond all earlier time a friend and pupil of cosmo de ' medicus be make pope at rome and under the name of nichola v originate vast scheme for the rebuilding and beautifying of he city of ruin -lrb- 3 -rrb- modern rome with all its beautiful church and wonder of art rise from the hand of nichola and he immediate successor it be they idea that the city should no longer be remember by its heathen greatness but by its christian splendor that the sight of it should impress upon pilgrim not the decay of the world but the glory and majesty of the church nichola also continue the work of petrarch gathering vast store of ancient manuscript refound and practically begin the enormous vatican library he establish that alliance of the church with the new culture of the age which for a century continue to be a honor and distinguishment to both in he pontificate occur the fall of constantinople bring with it the definite establishment of the turk in europe and the final extinction of that roman empire of the east which have originate with constantine for this reason the date of its fall -lrb- 1453 -rrb- be also employ as mark the beginning of modern europe it be at least the closing of the older volume the final not undramatic exit of the last remnant of the ancient world with its long decaying art and arrogance its wealth its literature and its law -lrb- 4 -rrb- greek scholar flee from the sack of they city bring many marvellous old manuscript to western europe and be eagerly welcome by pope nichola and all of italy nichola even preach a crusade against the terrible turk and try once more to rouse europe to ancient enthusiasm but he fail and die they say heartbroken at he helplessness the clash of race in the east the turk have recover from they defeat by the tartar of timur and become once more a active menace with constantinople in they power they attack the venetian and compel those wealthy trader to pay they tribute venice by sea and hungary on land remain for a century the bulwark of christendom and be force almost unaided to withstand all the assault of the east they wellnigh perish in the effort in hungary this be the period of the great hero hunyady a man of unknown birth and no official rank who rouse he countryman to repeat effort and lead they to repeat victory and defeat against the vastly more numerous invader -lrb- 5 -rrb- hunyady die wear out with ceaseless warfare and he son matthia be elect by acclamation to be monarch of the land the father have preserve this be the proudest era in the history of the hunnish race under matthia they even resume they german warfare of five century before and win from a hapsburg emperor he city of vienna ancient capital of austrium the eastmark or borderland which have be erect by otto the great to hold the hun in check for a few year matthia place he kingdom amid the foremost state of europe but with he death come renew disunion and disorder to he lawless people and the fierce fanatic turk return again to they assault further north the yellow race be less successful along the shift borderland of asia which mark the line of demarcation between the two mightier family of man the tide turn ever more steadily in the aryan ' favor the russian under they chief ivan iii throw off the galling tartar yoke which they have bear for over two hundred year ivan concentrate in he own hand the power of all the little russian duchy overthrow the celebrated russian republic of novgorod the great and defy the tartar equally noteworthy to modern eye be he wedding with sophium heiress of the last of the emperor of the east when that outworn empire perish with the fall of constantinople ivan succeed nominally at least to its heirship hence it be that he successor have assume the title of caesar or kaiser or czar and have grow to look upon themselves as inheritor of the ancient supremacy of rome -lrb- 6 -rrb- the fifteenth century be thus a time of many change in eastern europe not only do the eastern empire disappear at last not only do hungary rise to the brief zenith of she glory there be a sort of general movement sometimes speak of as the slavonic reaction against the hitherto successful teuton the slavic bohemian in they hussite war repel all the religious fighting strength of europe the pole begin to win back territory from the german empire and especially from they hereditary foe the teutonic knight of prussium and russium greatest of all the slav country grow into a strong kingdom she and turkey rise as twin menace to the west assume at almost the same period that threatening aspect which turkey have only lately lose and russium to some statesman 's eye still hold political change in western europe turn now to the affair of western europe the feebleness of the german empire continue for over half a century it be nominally rule by frederick iii -lrb- 1440-1493 -rrb- the lazy and feeble emperor who let matthia of hungary expel he from vienna and never make any vigorous effort to recover he capital he be succeed by he son maximilian a man of far other temper full of courage energy and hardihood maximilian have be call the last of the knight and indeed he whole career may well exemplify the change time the one achievement of he life be the recovery of vienna from the hungarian and in that he be successful only because the heir of matthia be be overwhelm by the turk the remainder of he career be spend in learn bitterly how little real power he have as emperor he attempt to bring the swiss once more under the imperial dominion but the little army he could scrape together against they be repeatedly defeat -lrb- 7 -rrb- he be always declare war against this kingdom or that and summon he great lord to aid he in uphold the glory of the empire they persistently decline and he be helpless at one time have pledge he alliance to the english king henry vii against france he preserve he knightly word by go alone and serve as a volunteer in henry 's army whither he people would not follow he instead they stay at home and demand from he constitution and court of law and other internal reform uninteresting matter about which the gallant soul of maximilian care not a straw and which he give he subject under protest to the westward of he a far subtler monarch by far subtler means be strengthen the power of france and make smooth she way toward that supremacy over european affair which she be later to assert loui xi -lrb- 1461-1483 -rrb- be call the first modern king though it be little flattery to modern statecraft to compare its method with he and perhaps we recent government have truly outgrow they loui be no warrior although under compulsion he show possibility of become a able general he prefer to send other who should do he fight for he to embroil he opponent one with another and then reap the fruit of they mutual exhaustion he be pass master of all falsity and craft and by he shrewdness he bring to he country peace and prosperity typically do he represent he age in which intellectual ability though sometimes wholly divorce from nobleness of soul begin to dominate brute force charle the bold stand as the representative of this brute force he be the mightiest of the french noble he ancestor a younger branch of the royal family have be make duke of burgundy and by skilful alliance and rapid change of side through the long hundred year ' war they have steadily add to they possession and they power the father of charle find himself stronger than he king possessor not only of burgundy but of many other fief from germany as well as france and lord of the netherland as well -lrb- 8 -rrb- charle be thus the last of those great overgrown vassal so characteristic of feudal time like hugh capet in france like william the conqueror in england he hope to establish himself as a independent king he open negotiation for this purpose with the emperor frederick maximilian 's father he make himself practically independent of france he wield a military power greater than that of any other prince of the moment and he know it and charge like a mad bull at whoever seem to interpose in he design over such a man loui xi 's cunning have full play he involve charle in fight with every neighbor finally he lure he into conflict with the swiss and those hardy mountaineer win the repute of be the best soldier of europe by defeat charle again and again till they leave he slay on the field of nancy -lrb- 1477 -rrb- -lrb- 9 -rrb- loui promptly seize most of he dead vassal 's domain maximilian have wed charle ' daughter inherit the remainder and the old burgundian kingdom so nearly revive to stretch as a permanent divide land between france and germany disappear forever what loui have do with burgundy he attempt with he other semi-independent duchy the hundred year ' war have almost destroy central government in france loui by means as secret and vary as he cunning could suggest gradually reestablish a undisputed leadership above he lord fortunately for france perhaps england be prevent by a long series of civil war from interfere in she neighbor 's affair these war though they originate before loui ' time be constantly foment and keep alive by he and england thus pay dearly for have become a source of danger to france the war of the rose -lrb- 10 -rrb- as they be call cause deep-seated change in england 's life and society they mark for she the transition from the mediaeval to the modern era which be everywhere take place beginning as a contest between two rival branch of the plantagenet for the kingship these war remain aristocratic throughout that be to say the common people take little interest in they while the noble espouse side fight savagely and murderously give one another no quarter spare the lesser folk but execute as traitor they prisoner of rank when one side seem hopelessly overcome loui would lend they arm and money wherewith to seek revenge once more thus almost all the old nobility of england perish and both line of king become extinct richard iii they last representative be accuse of murder all he relative or possible rival -lrb- 11 -rrb- at last richard too be slay and a new family of ruler only remotely connect with the old be inaugurate by henry tudor grandson of a private gentleman of wale this new king henry vii -lrb- 1485-1509 -rrb- find no powerful lord to oppose he will one or two impostor be raise against he -lrb- 12 -rrb- france make anxious effort to prolong the trouble of she dangerous neighbor but the attempt fail through the utter completeness of the aristocracy 's exhaustion thus in england as in france though by widely differ chance the kingly power have triumph over feudalism monarch begin to come into direct contact not always pleasant with the entire mass of they subject the third estate the common people rise of spanish power spain also be to pass through a similar experience indeed one of the most striking fact of this age of the renaissance be the swift and spectacular rise of spain from a land of feebleness and internal strife into the most powerful kingdom of europe we have see the spanish peninsula in previous age the seat of endless strife between saracen and christian gradually the moor have be drive back and the little independent christian state have be unite by the fortune of war and marriage into three -- portugal on the atlantic coast castile occupy the larger part of the mainland and aragon a maritime kingdom less extensive in spain but extend its sovereignty over many of the mediterranean isle over sicily and southern italy in 1469 isabellum heiress of castile and ferdinand heir of aragon be wed and soon afterward they country be unite under they joint rule the combined strength of both be then devote to a long religious war against the moor granada the last and most famous of the moorish capital and stronghold be finally capture in 1492 -lrb- 13 -rrb- the follower of mahomet be drive out of western europe during the same period that under turkish leadership they have at last win constantinople in the east the whole spanish peninsula with the exception of portugal be thus unite under ferdinand and isabellum greatest of the sovereign of spain the age of battle with the moor have breed a nation of cavalier intensely loyal passionately religious they be splendid fighter but stern hard-hearted merciless man isabella the saint most holy and pure-souled of woman herself introduce into she country the terrible inquisition -lrb- 14 -rrb- jew and moor be give little peace in life unless they turn christian heretic and relapse convert from the other faith be burn to death the queen declare she would approve all possible torture to man 's body when necessary in order to save they soul if such be the woman of spain what be to be expect of the man how could even ferdinand the wise keep they employ now that there be no longer moor to fight against uprising rebellion begin to threaten spain with such desolation as england have endure but a higher providence solve for ferdinand he impossible problem : the age of maritime discovery begin -lrb- 15 -rrb- the era of discovery the portuguese from they atlantic seaboard have already begin to explore southward along the african coast in 1402 they have settle the canary isle in 1443 they reach southward beyond the sand of the sahara and see cape verd discover that africa be not all burn desert that heat would not forever increase as they go southward in 1487 bartholomew diaz after almost a year of sailing reach the cape of good hope the southern point of the vast african continent and in 1497 vasco da gama round the cape and sail on to indium -lrb- 16 -rrb- he have find a way of bring indian spice silk and jewel to europe bring they in quantity and without pay tribute to the turk without cross the deadly desert of arabium he have make he little country wealthy meanwhile stimulate by portuguese success the mariner of other nation begin to brave the giant storm of the atlantic the turk have make trade with the far east wellnigh impossible portugal be not the only land to seek a sea-route to indium venice and genoa see before they the threat of ruin to they most profitable commerce so we may even say that it be the turk who set the genoese captain columbus to plan he great voyage it be the conquest of the moor that set isabellum free to listen to he and offer she crown jewel for the expedition which should convert other heathen establish other inquisition and it be the downfall of the moor which leave the spanish warrior so eager to throng to adventure and warfare in the west once columbus have show the way for a time the theater of great event shift to the new continent the portuguese explorer have double the size of the known world the spaniard double it again but the credit must not be give wholly to spain though it be the liberality of she monarch which have make discovery possible and though it be the daring of she warrior that laugh at danger and make conquest sure yet the spaniard be not sailor it be to italy the home of commerce that they turn for they captain and they pilot columbus the genoese have discover the island along the coast england wish to have a share in this world of wonder send a venetian mariner john cabot and he and he son sail along we northern mainland in english ship -lrb- 17 -rrb- columbus touch the coast of south america in 1498 -lrb- 18 -rrb- a florentine amerigo vespuccus be the first to cruise far along this southern coast probably in 1499 and it be he name which europe give to the new land -lrb- 19 -rrb- follow the discovery come settlement warfare with the unhappy indian a fierce and frantic search for gold it be while engage in this work that balboa cross the isthmus of panama see the vast water of the pacific and ride out into they upon he warhorse take possession in the name of spain of the largest ocean of the globe -lrb- 20 -rrb- man recognize at last that these be not the asiatic shore but a wholly new continent which they have find religious change let we pause to recapitulate the wonder which this age of the renaissance have see -- a new world of africa discover in the south a new world of america in the west the rise of spain the conquest of the last of the western saracen at granada and the rise of the turk in the east the rise of russium the downfall of the last vestige of the ancient empire of rome the last expire effort of feudalism in charle the bold and of errant knighthood in maximilian the beginning of modern statecraft in loui xi of france henry vii of england and ferdinand the wise of spain the spread of printing and with it the spread of thought and knowledge among the mass and sometimes account greatest of all come the wonderful awakening of art in italy we have trace the early part of this under the medicus and pope nichola lorenzo de ` medicus be the center of its later development -lrb- 21 -rrb- from he court go forth that galaxy of artist which the world of art unite in call the unequalled master of all age -- da vincus michelangelo raphael and a host of other -lrb- 22 -rrb- unfortunately in italy at least the great movement in art and literature take a antireligious sometimes a antipatriotic tone lorenzo be openly defiant and scornful of the teaching of the church and after he death a french king charle viii be able to enter italy and march from end to end of it without opposition religion seem die there and love of country dead florence undergo a extravagant though brief religious revival the monk savonarolum preach against wickedness in high place and thunder at the florentine for they presumption and vanity the impressionable people weep they appoint a day of vanity and lay all they rich robe and jewel at savonarolum 's foot they make he ruler of the city but alas they soon tire of he severity sigh for they vanity back again and at last burn the reformer at the stake -lrb- 23 -rrb- in rome itself there arise pope lorenzo 's follower who prefer art to christianity or other like the terrible alexander borgium who adopt the maxim of the new statecraft alexander a worthy disciple of loui xi admire falsehood before truth and seek to win he aim by poisoning he enemy the career of he nephew caesar borgium have supply history with its most awful picture of successful crime and the book write in he praise by macchiavellus have give we a new word for satanic subtlety and treachery we call it macchiavellian the rest of europe shrink from italy in fear and name it poisoning italy -lrb- 24 -rrb- against the spiritual dominance of such a land the world be surely ready for revolt the mind of man so long and slowly awaken and at last so intensely rouse see great discovery on every hand be no longer to be control by authority the time be ripe for

printing come concurrently with the revival of learn man 's mind be turn toward practical experiment in that art by the very influence make active through the labor of those scholar who usher in the renaissance the art preservative of all other art have also preserve the record of its own beginning and development although of its earlier source we knowledge be very obscure and even the modern achievement which antiquity in various way foreshadow be itself a subject of uncertainty and dispute bohn in he admirable survey of the origin and progress of modern printing give we a full and accurate account from the earliest evidence and conjecture relate to antiquity to the latter part of the nineteenth century confine himself however to european development but before the middle of the sixteenth century printing be introduce into spanish america exist book show that in mexico there be a press as early as 1540 but it be impossible to name positively the first book print on this continent north of mexico the first press be use 1639 by a english non-conformist clergyman name glover in 1660 a printer with press and type be send from england by the corporation for propagate the gospel among the indian of new england in the indian language this press be take to a printing-house already establish at cambridge mass it be not until several year later that the use of a press in boston be permit by the colonial government and until near the end of the seventeenth century no press be set up in the colony outside of massachusett in 1685 printing begin in pennsylvanium a few year later in new york and in connecticut in 1709 from 1685 to 1693 william bradford a english quaker conduct a press in philadelphium and in the latter year he remove he plant to new york he be the first notable american printer and become official printer for pennsylvanium new york new jersey rhode island and maryland he first book be a almanac for 1686 in 1725 he found the _ new york gazette _ the first newspaper in new york but the first newspaper publish in the english colony be the _ boston news-letter _ found in 1704 by john campbell a bookseller and postmaster in boston only four american periodical have be establish when in 1729 benjamin franklin who be already printer to the pennsylvanium assembly become proprietor and editor of the _ pennsylvanium gazette _ until the last quarter of the eighteenth century the progress of printing in america be slow but in 1784 the first daily newspaper the _ american daily advertiser _ be issue in philadelphium and from this time periodical publication multiply and the printing of book increase until the agency and influence of the press become as mark in the united state as in the leading country of europe even since the time when bohn write the progress make in various branch of the printer 's art have be such as might have astonish that famous publisher of so many standard work recent improvement for increase the capacity of the press and often the quality of its production be quite comparable to those which we own time have see in other department of industry as in the application of electricity and the like in addition to the further development of stereotype there have be marvellous improvement in nearly all the machinery and process of printing this be especially mark in rapid color-printing and in the successor of inadequate typesetting-machine -- in the linotype the monotype the typograph etc most wonderful of all perhaps be the improved printing-press itself in various class each adapt to its special purpose the sum of all improvement in this department of mechanical invention be see in the great cylinder-press now in general use especially the one know as the web perfect press this be a machine of great size and intricate construction which yet do its complex work with a accuracy that almost seem to denote conscious intelligence it print from a immense roll of paper make the impression from curved stereotype plate run at high speed print both side of the paper at one run and fold paste and perform other process as provide for by double and quadruple the part the ordinary speed of about twenty-four thousand impression a hour may be increase to one hundred thousand a hour the multicolor web perfect press print four or more color at one revolution of the impression cylinder to meet the demand of such a enormous consumption of paper as the modern press require it be necessary to invent other process and to utilize more abundant and cheaper material for paper-making than those formerly employ this requirement have be supply in recent year mainly through the extensive manufacture of paper from wood-pulp this method together with improve process in the use of other material have remove all fear of a paper famine such as have sometimes threaten the printing industry in the past nature do not advance by leap say a old proverb neither do she offspring art all the great boon vouchsafe to man by a munificent providence be of gradual development and though some may appear to have come upon we suddenly reflection and inquiry will always show that they have have they previous stage indeed nothing in this great world which concern the well-being of man take place by accident but be bring forward by divine will precisely at the moment most suitable to we condition so it be with astronomy the mariner 's compass the steam-engine gas the electric telegraph and many other of those blessing which have progress with civilization the element be there and know but the time have not arrive for they fructification and so it be with printing : although its invention be place in the middle of the fifteenth century and almost the very year fix this can only be regard as a matured stage of it to illustrate this i propose to begin with a cursory view of its primitive element of which the very first be no doubt initiative mark and numeral the use of numeral have be denominate the foundation of all the art of life and we know with certainty that several nation and among they the mexican have numeral before they be acquaint with letter the first method of reckoning be with the finger but small stone be also use -- hence the word calculate and calculation which be derive from _ calculus _ the latin for a pebble-stone the chinese count for many year with notch stick and even in england in comparatively modern time account be keep by tally in which notch be cut alike in two parallel piece of wood shakespeare allude to the score and the tally in he _ henry vi _ and this mode of keep account be still adopt by some of the baker and dyer in warwickshire and cheshire and tally be occasionally produce in the small-debt court where they be admit as authentic proof of debt hence the origin and name of the tally court of the exchequer the peruvian at the time they be conquer by pizarro count with knotted string after numeral come picture-writing hieroglyphic and symbolic character such be be use by the egyptian the chinese and the mexican which however unconnected they may be with each other be of the same general character indeed the chinese have never advance beyond symbolic character of which it be say they have more than one hundred thousand combination or variety rude as these condition of humanity may seem they be match in modern england even at a very recent date if we may credit a well-known story : a rustic shopkeeper in a remote district be unable to read or write contrived to keep he account by picture-writing and charge he customer the miller with a cheese instead of a grindstone from have omit to mark a hole in the center after picture and symbolic writings would follow phonetic character or mark for sound that be the alphabet even the alphabet which in civilized country have now exist for more than three thousand year be perfect by degree for it have be clearly ascertain that the earliest know do not comprise more than one-half or at most two-third of the letter which eventually form its complement thus the pelasgian alphabet which be derive from the phoenician and be the parent of the greek and roman consist originally of only twelve or thirteen letter the invention of the alphabet which in a small number of elementary character be capable of six hundred and twenty sextillion of combination and of exhibit to the sight the countless conception of the mind which have no corporeal form be so wonderful that great man of all age have shrink from account for it otherwise than as a boon of divine origin this feeling be strengthen by the singular circumstance that so many alphabet bear a strong similarity to each other however widely separate the country in which they arise in egypt the invention of the alphabet be by some ascribe to syphoa nearly two thousand year before the christian era but more commonly to athote thoth or toth a deity always figure with the head of the ibis and very familiar in egyptian antiquity cadmus be accredit with have introduce it from egypt into greece about five century later from the alphabet the gradation be natural to compound of letter and write language and though speech be one of the greatest gift to man it be write which distinguish he from the uncivilized savage the practice of write be of such remote antiquity that neither sacred nor profane author can satisfactorily trace its origin the philosopher may exclaim with the poet : whence do the wondrous mystic art arise of painting speech and speak to the eye that we by trace magic line be teach how both to color and embody think the earliest writing would probably have be with chalk charcoal slate or perhaps sand as child from time immemorial have be teach to read and write in indium the roman use white wall for write inscription on in red chalk -- answer the purpose of we posting-bill -- of which several instance be find on the wall of pompeius plutarch inform we that tradesman write in some such manner over they door and that auction bill run thus : julius proculus will this day have a auction of he superfluous goods to pay he debt next seem to have follow write or engrave on stone wood ivory and metal of which we have many early evidence the decalogue or the ten commandment give by god to mose on mount sinaus be originally we be tell in the bible write upon two table of stone the pillar of seth be of brick and stone the law of the greek be grave on table of brass which be call _ cyrbe _ herodotus mention a letter write with a style on stone slab which themistocle the athenian general send to the roman about bc 500 and we have another evidence of the same period still exist -- the so-called borgian inscription which be a passport graven in bronze entitle the holder to hospitable reception wherever he demand it upward of three thousand of such engraved tablet include the famous roman law of the twelve table be consume in the great fire which destroy the capitol in the time of vespasian i could cite a great many other evidence of early writing on stone or brass but will merely recommend you to see the rosetta -lrb- 25 -rrb- inscription which be conspicuously place in the british museum it be this very interesting stone which be partly greek and partly egyptian have enable we to decipher so many egyptian monument pliny inform we that table-book of wood -- generally make of box or citron wood -- be in use before the time of homer that be nearly three thousand year ago and in the bible we read of table-book in the time of solomon these table-book be call by the roman _ pugillare _ which may be translate hand-book the wood be cut into thin slice finely plane and polish and write upon with a iron instrument call a _ stylus _ at a later period table or slice of wood be usually cover with a thin layer of hard wax so that any matter write upon they might be efface at pleasure and the table use again such practice continue as late as ad 1395 in a account roll of winchester college of that year we find that a table cover with green wax be keep in the chapel for note down with a style the daily or weekly duty assign to the officer of the choir ivory also be use in the same way wooden table-book as we learn from chaucer be use in england as late as the fifteenth century when epistle be write upon table of wood they be usually tie together with cord the seal be put upon the knot some of the table-book must have be large and heavy for in plautus a schoolboy seven year old be represent as break he master 's head with he table-book writing seem also to have be common at a very early period on palm and olive leaf and especially on the bark of tree -- a material use even in the present time in some part of asia the bark be generally cut into thin flat piece from nine to fifteen inch long and two to four inch wide and write on with a sharp instrument indeed the tree whether in plank bark or leave seem in ancient time to have afford the principal material for write on hence the word _ codex _ originally signify the trunk or stem of a tree now mean a manuscript volume _ tabulum _ which properly mean a plank or board now also signify the plate of a book and be so use by addison who call he plate table _ folium _ -lrb- a leaf -rrb- have give we the word folio and the word _ liber _ originally mean the inner bark of a tree be afterward use by the roman to signify a book whence we derive we word library librarian etc one more such etymology the most interesting of all be the greek name for the bark of a tree _ biblo _ whence be derive the name of we sacred volume before i leave this stage of the subject i will mention the way in which the roman youth be teach write quintilian tell we that they be make to write through perforated tablet so as to draw the stylus through a kind of furrow and we learn from procopius that a similar contrivance be use by the emperor justinian for sign he name such a tablet would now be call a stencil-plate and be what to the present day be find the most rapid and convenient mode of mark goods only that a brush be use instead of a iron pen or style writing and material have so much to do with the invention of printing that i feel oblige to tarry a little longer at this preliminary stage the most important of all the ancient material for write upon be papyrus parchment and vellum and on these substance nearly all we most valuable manuscript be write papyrus or paper-rush be a large fibrous plant which abound in the marsh of egypt especially near the border of the nile it be manufacture into a thick sort of paper at a very early period pliny say three century before the reign of alexander the great and cassiodorus who live in the sixth century state that it then cover all the desk of the world indeed it have become so essential to the greek and roman that the occasional scarcity of it be record to have produce riot every man of rank and education keep _ librarii _ or book-writer in he house and many _ servus _ or slave be train to this service so that they be a numerous class papyrus be a very durable substance make of the innermost pellicle of the stalk glue together transversely with the glutinous water of the nile it be for many century the great staple of egypt and be export in large quantity to almost every part of europe and asia but never it would appear to england or germany after the seventh century its use be gradually supersede by the introduction of parchment and before the end of the twelfth century it have go generally out of use from papyrus the name of paper which with slight variation be common to many language be no doubt derive parchment and vellum -- which be make from the skin of animal the former from sheep or goat the latter from calf both prepare with lime -- be in use at a very early period long before they accredit introduction it have be by some suppose that eumene king of pergamus who live about bc 190 be the inventor of parchment but it be know much earlier as may be see by several reference to it in the bible -lrb- isaiah viii i jeremiah xxxvi 2 ezekiel xi 9 -rrb- it be however very probable that it may have be bring to perfection at pergamus as it be one of the principal article of commerce of that kingdom parchment in early time be not only expensive but often very difficult to procure whence arise the practice of erase old writing from it and engross it a second time such manuscript be call palimpsest modern art have find the means of discharge the more recent ink and thus restore the original writing by which mean we have recover many valuable piece particularly cicero 's lose book _ de republica _ and some fragment of he _ oration _ the most ancient manuscript both on papyrus and parchment be keep in roll call in latin _ volumina _ whence we english word volume chinese paper make from the bark of the bamboo the mulberry or the khu-ku tree and so extremely thin that it can only be use on one side be suppose to have be invent fifty year before the christian era or earlier chinese rice-paper be make from the stem of the bread-fruit tree cut into slice and press the skin of all kind of animal be use -- among they the african skin of a brown color upon which the hebrew pentateuch and service-book use in the jewish synagogue be formerly write silk-paper be prepare for the most part in spain and its colony but be never bring to much perfection asbestos a fibrous mineral be make into paper tolerably light and pliant which be incombustible be denominate eternal paper herodotus tell we that cloth be make of asbestos by the egyptian and pliny mention napkin make of it in ad 74 we know by tradition that the intestine of a serpent serve for homer 's _ iliad _ and _ odyssey _ and that the _ koran _ be write in part on shoulder-bone of mutton keep in a domestic chest by one of mahomet 's wife we now come to the great period of writing-papers make from cotton and linen rag as use at the present day and which from the first be so perfect that they have since undergo no material improvement cotton-paper be a eastern invention probably introduce in the ninth century although not generally use in europe till about the twelfth and thirteenth century greek manuscript be find upon it of the earlier period and italian manuscript of the later it seem to have prevail at particular period in particular country accord to the facility for procure it as it now do almost exclusively in america linen paper the most valuable and important of all the basis available for write or print be likewise suppose to have be introduce into europe from the east early in the thirteenth century although not in general use till the fourteenth before the end of the fourteenth century paper-mill have be establish in many part of europe first in spain and then successively in italy germany holland and france they seem to have come late into england for caxton print all he book on paper import from the low country and it be not till winkin de worde succeed he in 1495 that paper be manufacture in england the chinese be suppose to have use it for century before and appear to have the best title to be consider the inventor of both cotton and linen paper paper may be make of many other material such as hay straw nettle flax grass parsnip turnip colewort leave wood-shaving indeed of anything fibrous but as the invention of printing be not concern in they i see no occasion to consider they merit before i pass from paper it may not be irrelevant to say a word or two on the name by which we distinguish the sort and size the term post-paper be derive from the ancient water-mark which be a post-horn and not from its suitableness to transport by post as many suppose the original watermark of a fool 's cap give the name to that paper which it still retain although the fool 's cap be afterward change to a cap of liberty and have since undergo other change the smaller size call pot-paper take its name from have at first be mark with a flagon or pot demy-paper on which octavo book be usually print be so call from be originally a demus or half-sized paper the term be now however equally apply to hard or write papers hand-cap which be a coarse paper use for pack bear the water-mark of a open hand i will now say a few word about pen and ink for without they we could neither have have printing nor book pen be of great antiquity and be frequently allude to in the bible pen of iron which may mean style be mention by job and jeremiah reed pen be know to have be in common use by the ancient and some be discover at pompeii pen of gold and silver be allude to by the classical writer and there be evidence of the use of quill in the seventh century of whatever material the pen be make it be call a _ calamus _ whence we familiar say _ currente calamo _ -lrb- with a flow pen -rrb- the use of style or iron pen must have be very prevalent in ancient day as suetonius tell we that the emperor caligulum incite the people to massacre a roman senator with they style and previous to that caesar have wound cassius with he style the next and not the least important ingredient in write and print be ink staining and color matter be well know to the ancient at a very early period witness the lustrous pigment on etruscan vase more than two thousand year ago and ink be often mention in the bible gold silver red blue and green ink be thoroughly understand in the middle age and perhaps earlier and the black writing-ink of the seventh down to the tenth century as see in we manuscript be in such perfection that it have retain its lustre better than some of later age printing-ink by the time it begin to be currently use for book-printing in the fifteenth century have attain a perfection which have never be surpass and indeed scarcely equal paper and ink be at they highest point we will now consider the advance which have in the mean time be make in engraving and type or letter cut it will be see that the material element of printing be by degree converge to a culminate point the evidence of engrave both in relief and intaglio be of very ancient date i need hardly remind you of the exquisite workmanship on coin cameo and seal many century before the christian era to illustrate the high state of cultivation at which the art must then have arrive the art of casting and chasing in bronze be extensively practice in the twelfth century and i have see a specimen with letter so cut in relief that they might be separate to form movable type the goldsmith be certainly among the greatest artist of the early age and be competent to execute form or mould of any kind to perfection in the british museum be a brass signet stamp more than two thousand year old on which two line of letter be very neatly engrave in relief in the reversed order necessary for printing and as the interstice be cut away very deeply and roughly there be little doubt but that this stamp be use with ink on papyrus parchment or linen for paper be not then know indeed the experiment of take impression from it in printing-ink have be try and find to answer perfectly a large surface so engraved would at once have give to the world a equivalent to what be now regard as the most advanced state of the art of printing that be a stereotype plate vergil mention brand for mark cattle with they owner 's name probably this kind of brass stamp but larger i could cite many more example of ancient engraving which would yield impression on paper either by pressure or friction but we business be with printing rather than engrave i will therefore go back to the subject and cite a very early and interesting example of stamp engraved letter on clay i mean the babylonian brick suppose to be four thousand year old mostly sun-baked but some apparently kiln-burnt almost to vitrification of these there be now many example in england add to we store by the indefatigable research of layard rawlinson and other these brick which be about a foot square and three inch thick be on one side cover with hieroglyphic evidently impress with a stamp just as letter be now stamp on official papers another evidence of the same kind and of about the same age be the famous babylonian cylinder find in the ruin of persepoli and now preserve in the library of trinity college cambridge it be about seven inch high barrel-shaped and cover with inscription in the cuneiform character dispose in vertical line and afford a positive example of a indented surface produce by mechanical impression such cylinder be suppose to have be memorial of matter of national or family importance and be in early age as we know by tradition very numerous stamped or print block of lead bear the name of roman authority be to be find in the british museum printing on leather be practice by the egyptian as we discover from they mummy which have bandage of leather round they head with the name of the deceased print on they and in pompeius a loaf be find on which the name of the baker and its quality be print among ancient testimony one of the most interesting be that afford by cicero in he _ de natura deorum _ he order type to be make of metal and call they _ forma literarum _ -- the very word use by we first printer and in another place he give a hint of separate cut letter when he speak of the impossibility of the most ingenious man throw the twenty-four letter of the alphabet together by chance and thus produce the famous _ annals _ of ennius he make that observation in opposition to the atheistical argument of the creation of the world by chance we have besides in what be generally class as a manuscript a reasonable although disputed evidence of a elementary stage of printing i mean the _ codex argenteus _ -lrb- or _ silver book _ -rrb- of upsalum which contain a portion of the gospel in mesogothic suppose to be of the fourth or fifth century the work of ulfila in this codex the first line of each gospel and of the lord 's prayer be in large gold letter apparently print by a stamp in the manner of a bookbinder as there be indentation on the back of the vellum the small letter be write in silver the whole be on a light purple or violet color vellum have say enough i think of the ancient ' knowledge of type-form and printing material i pass on to the recognize establishment of the art in the fifteenth century for whatever knowledge the ancient have of print it would appear to have yield no immediate fruit to posterity but before i proceed to modern time i be bind to note that the chinese who seem to have be many century in advance of europe in most of the industral art be suppose to have practice block-printing just as they do now more than a thousand year ago nor do the complicated nature of they write language which consist of more than one hundred thousand word-sign admit of any readier mode but they print or rather rub off impression with such speed -- seven hundred sheet per hour -- that until the introduction of steam they far outstrip european gibbon it will be remembered regret that the emperor justinian who live in the sixth century do not introduce the art of printing from the chinese instead of they silk manufacture block-printing usher in the great epoch and the first dawn of it in europe seem to have be single print of saint and scriptural subject with a line or two of description engrave on the same wooden plate these be for the most part lose but there be one in existence large and exceedingly fine of st christopher with two line of inscription date 1423 believe to have be print with the ordinary printing-press it be find in the library of a monastery near augsburg and be therefore presume to be of german execution till lately this be the earliest-dated evidence of block-printing known but there have since be discover at maline and deposit at brussels a wood-cut of similar character but assume to be dutch or flemish dated mccccxviii and though there seem no reason to doubt the genuineness of the cut it be assert that the date bear evidence of have be tamper with there be a vague tradition depend entirely on the assertion of a writer name papillon not a very reliable authority which would give the invention of wood-cut-printing to venice and at a very early period he assert that he once see a set of eight print depict the deed of alexander the great each describe in verse which be engrave in relief and print by a brother and sister name cunio at ravenna in 1285 but though the assertion be accredit by mr ottley it be generally disbelieve there be reason to suppose that playing-card from wooden block be produce at venice long before the block-book even as early as 1250 but there be no positive evidence that they be print and some insist that they be produce either by friction or stencil-plate it seem however by no means unlikely that card which be in most extensive use in the middle age should for the sake of cheapness have be print quite as early if not earlier than even figure of saint and the same artist be presume to have produce both from single print with letter-press inscription the next stage that of a series of print accompany by letter-press be obvious such be we first recognize block-book among which be the apocalypse and the _ biblia pauperum _ -lrb- or _ poor man 's bible _ -rrb- suppose to have be print at haarlem by laurence koster between 1420 and 1430 i say suppose because we have no positive evidence either of the person place or date and erasmus who be bear at rotterdam in 1467 and always ready to advance the honor of he country be silent on the subject we rely chiefly upon the testimony of ulric zell a eminent printer of cologne who be quote in the _ cologne chronicle _ of 1499 and hadrian junius a dutch historian of repute who write in the next century both agree in ascribe the invention of book-printing from wooden block as well as the first germ of movable wood and metallic type printing to haarlem and junius add the name of laurence koster he surname of koster be derive from he office which be that of custodian sexton or warden of the cathedral church of haarlem the story tell of the accident by which the discovery be make be as follow : koster as he be one day walk in a wood adjoining the city about the year 1420 cut some letter on the bark of a beech tree from which he take impression on paper for the amusement of he brother-in-law 's child the idea then strike he of enlarge they application and be a man of a ingenious turn he invent a thicker and more tenacious ink than be in common use which blot and begin to print figure from wooden tablet or block to which he add several line of letter first solid and then separate or movable these wooden type be say to have be fasten together with string one thing seem pretty clear which be that whether or not koster be the printer the first block-book be produce somewhere in holland as several be in dutch a language seldom if ever print out of its own country they be generally print in light-brown ink like a sepia drawing which i think be adopt with a view to they be color -- a condition in which we find the greater part of they when these print be color they present very much the appearance of the low country stained-glass window block-book continue to be print and reprint first in holland and afterward in germany with considerable activity for twenty or thirty year during which period we have several edition of the _ biblia pauperum _ the _ ar moriendi _ -lrb- or _ art of die -rrb- _ the _ speculum humanae salvationi _ and many other chiefly devote to the promulgation of scripture history the earliest one be print or rather transfer by friction -- and therefore on one side only of the paper -- entirely from solid block later on some portion be print with movable type of wood and at last the letter-press be entirely of movable metal type junius say that koster by degree exchange he wooden type for leaden one and these for pewter and i will add that it be not unlikely they may have be cast in lead or pewter plate from the wooden block as metal-casting be well understand at the time the pretension of haarlem and koster have for more than a century be a matter of fierce controversy and there have be upward of one hundred and fifty volume write for or against without any approach to a satisfactory decision this one thing be certain that whether or not we owe the first idea of movable type to laurence koster or to haarlem we do not owe to the period any very marked use of it that be reserve for a later day there be a story current dependent on the authority of junius that koster 's principal workman assume to be han or john faust -- and some to reconcile improbability even say john gutenberg -- who have be swear to secrecy decamp one christmas eve after the death of koster while the family be at church take with he type and printing apparatus and after short sojourn at amsterdam and cologne get to mainz or mayence with they and there introduce printing he be say by junius to have print about the year 1442 -- that be two year after koster 's death -- the _ doctrinale _ of alexander gallus and the _ tract _ of peter of spain with the very type which koster make use of in haarlem but as no volume of this kind have ever be discover nor any trace of one the entire story be generally regard as apocryphal laurence koster die in 1440 at the age of seventy therefore any printing attribute to he must be within that period what have hitherto be advance prove only that mankind have walk for many century on the border of the two great invention chalcography and typography without have fully and practically discover either of they we now come to the great epoch of printing -- i mean the complete introduction if not actually the first invention of movable metal or fusile type this take place at mainz in or before 1450 and the general consent of europe assign the credit of it to gutenberg of a man who have confer such vast obligation on all succeed age it may be desirable to say a few word john gutenberg be bear at mainz in 1397 of a patrician and rather wealthy family he leave he native city it be say because implicate in a insurrection of the citizen against the nobility and settle at strasburg where in 1427 we find he a established merchant and sustain a suit of breach of promise bring against he by a lady name ann of the iron door whom he afterward marry while resident here and before 1439 he attention appear to have be actively direct to the art of printing as we learn by a legal document of the time find of late year in the archive of strasburg he be there state to have enter into a engagement with three person name dreizehn riffe and heilmann to reveal to they a secret art of printing which he have lately discover and to take they into partnership for five year upon the payment of certain sum the death of dreizehn before he have pay up all he instalment lead to a suit on the part of he relation which end in gutenberg 's favor in the course of the evidence one of the witness a goldsmith depose to have receive from gutenberg three or four year previously -- that be about 1435 -- upward of three hundred florin for material use in print other witness prove the anxiety that gutenberg have show to have four page of type distribute which appear to have be screw up in chase and lie on a press on the decease 's premise this would be evidence that gutenberg have arrive at a knowledge of movable type either of wood or metal and probably of both before 1440 and have it not be for the rupture of the partnership before anything have be print by the new process strasburg might have claim the honor which be now give to mainz soon after this -- it be suppose in 1444 -- gutenberg return to he native city by leave of the town council which he be oblige to ask bring with he all he material in 1446 he enter into a partnership with john faust -- a wealthy and skilful goldsmith and engraver -- who engage upon be teach the secret of the art and admit into a participation of the profit to advance the necessary fund which he do to the extent of two thousand two hundred florin goldsmith it should be bear in mind be then the great artist in all kind of metal work and extremely skilful in model engraving and casting which be exactly the art require for type-found the new partnership immediately commence operation hire a house call zumjungen and take into they employ peter schoeffer who have be faust 's apprentice as they assistant faust be suppose to have employ himself in cut the type which be a extremely slow process till peter schoeffer afterward he son-in-law suggest a improve mode of cast it in copper matrix strike by steel punch pretty much in the same manner as be till recently practice throughout europe the firm have for some time previously adopt a method of cast type in mould of plaster which be a tedious process as every letter require a new mould although to gutenberg be undoubtedly due all the main feature of metal-type printing yet we owe perhaps to the practical skill of faust and the taste of schoeffer who be a accomplished penman the exquisite finish and perfection with which they first joint effort come forth to the world this be a latin vulgate print in a large cut metal type and commonly call the mazarin bible because the first copy know to bibliographer be find in the library of cardinal mazarin it consist of six hundred and forty-one leave form two sometimes four large volume in folio some copy on paper of beautiful texture some on vellum it be without date or name of the printer as it be evidently intend to present the appearance of a manuscript but it be suppose on good evidence to have be print between 1450 and 1455 and it be not improbable the volume be all that time that be five year and some say more at press for we know by certain technicality that every page be print off singly these precious volume as splendid as they be wonderful have excite the admiration of all beholder the sharpness and elegant uniformity of the type the lustre of the ink and the purity of the paper leave that first great monument of the typographic art unsurpassed by any subsequent effort nor could it be exceed with all the appliance of the present day it be a striking circumstance say mr hallam that the high-minded inventor of this great art try at the very outset so bold a flight as the printing of a entire bible and execute it with astonishing success it be minerva leap on earth in she divine strength and radiant armor ready at the moment of she nativity to subdue and destroy she enemy there be a curious story current about this bible which as it be connect with a popular fiction i will venture to repeat it be that faust go to pari with some of he bible for sale one of which print on vellum and richly illuminate he sell to the king for seven hundred and fifty crown and another to the archbishop of pari for three hundred crown and to the poorer clergy and the laity copy on paper as low as fifty crown and even less faust do not appear to have disclose the secret of how they be produce and probably let it be suppose that they be manuscript for the aim of the first printer be to make they book equal in beauty to the finest manuscript and as far as possible undistinguishable from they to which end the large capital and decoration be fill in by hand the archbishop proud of he purchase show it to the king who compare it with he own find with surprise that they tally so exactly in every respect except the illuminated ornament as convinced they that they be produce by some other art than transcription and on further inquiry they find that faust have sell a considerable number exactly similar order therefore be give without delay to apprehend and prosecute he as a practitioner of the black art in multiply holy writ by aid of the devil hence arise the popular fiction of the devil and dr faustus which under different phase have find its way into every country in europe and probably give rise to goethe 's celebrated drama in 1455 as we find by a notarial document date November 6th of that year faust separate from gutenberg and successfully institute proceedings against he for money advance gutenberg who have exhaust all he means in bring he invention to maturity be oblige to mortgage and in the end surrender all he material and it should seem he print stock he impoverishment may easily be account for when we be tell as a receive fact that before the first four sheet of he bible be complete he have already expend four thousand crown upon it -- a large sum in those day of this he then wealthier partner reap all the subsequent advantage after this period faust and he son-in-law peter schoeffer in possession of the material print on they own account and within eighteen month of they separation from gutenberg produce the celebrated latin psalter of 1457 the first book in any country which bear a complete imprint -- that be the name of the printer place and date this magnificent volume of which the whole edition be print on vellum be now even rarer than the mazarin bible and of extraordinary value the letter be very large and bold cast in metal type and the ornamental initial be beautifully cut in wood two year later that be in 1459 faust and schoeffer produce a almost fac-simile reprint of the psalter and in the same year _ durandus rationale divinorum officiorum _ the latter with a entirely new font of metal type -- the first cast from schoeffer 's punch -- which some in the erroneous belief that the psalter be print from wooden type have assert to be the first dated book print with metal type then follow in 1460 the _ constitutione clementi v _ a handsome folio and in 1462 they famous latin bible the first one with a date in the mean time gutenberg undaunted by the loss of all that have cost he so many year of unremitted application and he whole fortune begin afresh and this time it should seem with better success as we find he in 1459 undertaking to present for certain consideration all the book he have then print or might thereafter print to a convent where he sister be a nun no book however have yet be discover bear the name of gutenberg and we can only guess what come from he press by a peculiarity of type of which after the first bible the most marked be the famous _ catholicon _ date 1460 -- a kind of universal dictionary the germ of all future cyclopaedia and which become so popular that more than forty edition be print of it in as many year in 1465 gutenberg retire from printing be appoint to a lucrative office at the court of the archbishop of mainz and in 1467 he die and here we take leave of gutenberg with admiration for he patience he perseverance and he self-sacrifice in a cause which have produce such glorious fruit he be one of those noble spirit who be endowed with a perception of what be good and pursue it independent of worldly consideration posterity have do he tardy justice in erect a marble monument to he memory and establish a jubilee which give rise to one of the most touching of mendelssohn 's composition by this time the secret have transpire to the neighboring state and mentelin of strasburg and pfister or bamberg be before the beginning of 1462 in full activity indeed pfister be by some think to have print before 1460 and he finely execute latin bible in cast type be for many year regard as the first at this critical period when the art be reach its zenith the operation of the mainz printer be suddenly bring to a standstill by the siege and capture of the city in 1462 the occasion of this be a fierce dispute between the pope and the people as to who have the right of appointment to the archbishopric lately become vacant the original hive of workman disperse to other state and by degree the mystery of the art become spread over the civilized world such indeed be the fame printing have acquire and its manifest importance that every crown head seek to introduce it into he kingdom and welcome the fugitive within a few year of this period the art have be carry by the scatter german workman into italy france spain and switzerland and before the close of the fifteenth century it be practice in more than two hundred twenty different place before enter upon the history of printing in england i will take leave to call you attention to a few prominent fact connect with its progress abroad as well as to some point of its early condition which could not be conveniently introduce in chronological order all the book print previously to 1465 be in the gothic or black letter which still remain the favorite in germany and the low country long after the italian introduce they beautiful roman letter the first book in which any greek type occur be cicero 's _ office _ print by faust and schoeffer in 1465 directly after the resumption of they establishment and _ lactantius _ print the same year by sweynheim and pannartz in the monastery of soubiaco at rome the first book print entirely in greek be constantine lascar 's _ greek grammar _ milan 1476 one of the earliest of the italian book and to use the word of dr dibdin perhaps the most notorious volume in existence be the celebrated boccaccio print at venice by valdarfer in 1471 this book deserve particular mention because of a extraordinary contest which once take place for its possession between two wealthy bibliomaniac it be a small black-letter folio in fade yellow morocco and suppose to be unique its history be this : in the early part of the eighteenth century it have come accidentally into the possession of a london bookseller who successively offer it to harley earl of oxford and to lord sunderland then the two principal collector for one hundred guinea but both be stagger at the price and higgle about the purchase a ancestor of the late duke of roxburghe whom nobody dream of as a collector hearing of the book secure it and then invite the two nobleman to dinner with the view of parade he trophy in due course he lead the conversation to the book and after let they expatiate on its rarity tell they he think he have a copy in he bookcase which they emphatically declare to be impossible and challenge he to produce it on produce the book about the purchase of which they have only be temporize they be not a little chagrined this same copy make its appearance again half a century later at the duke of roxburghe 's sale in 1812 a time when bibliomanium be at its height loud note of preparation foretold that it would sell for a considerable sum five hundred and even one thousand guinea be guess as it be know that lord spencer the duke of devonshire and the marquis of blandford be all bent on its possession but nobody anticipate the extravagant sum it be to realize after a very spirited competition it be knock down to the marquis of blandford for two thousand sixty pound this book be resell at the marquis of blandford 's sale in 1819 for eight hundred seventy-five guinea and pass to lord spencer in whose extraordinary library it now repose before the commencement of the sixteenth century that be within forty or fifty year of the invention of printing with movable type upward of twenty thousand volume have issue from at least a thousand different press all the principal latin classic many of the greek and upward of two hundred fifty edition of the bible or part of the bible have appear one of the most active and enterprising of the early printer be anthony koburger of nuremberg a accomplished scholar who begin there in 1472 and before the year 1500 have print thirteen large edition of the bible in folio and a prodigious number of other book he keep twenty-four press at work employ one hundred workman and have sixteen shop for the sale of book in the principal city of germany besides factor and agent all over europe he print in 1493 that grand volume the _ nuremberg chronicle _ which be illustrate with upward of one thousand woodcut by michael wohlgemuth the master of albert dürer and be curious as be one of the first book in which cross-hatching occur in wood-engrave the sixteenth century open with another invention in type the italic which be beautifully exemplify in a pocket edition of vergil the first of a portable series of classical work commence in 1501 at venice by the celebrated aldus manutius who after some year of preparation have enter actively on he career as a printer in 1494 and deservedly rank as one of the best scholar of any age then come the giuntus the learn family of the stephens of whom robert be accredit as the author of the present division of we new testament into chapter and henry author of the great greek _ thesaurus _ the most valuable greek lexicon ever publish to the opprobrium of the age he die in a almshouse among many other immortalize by they successful contribution to the great cause we must not forget the plantin whose memory be still so cherish at antwerp that they printing establishment remain to this day untouched just as it be leave two century ago with all the freshness of a chamber in pompeius the type and chase of they famous polyglot lie about as if the workman have but just leave the office the accordance of the art of printing with the spirit of the time which give it birth must be regard as singularly providential the protestant reformation in germany be bring about by luther 's accidentally meeting in a monastic library with one of gutenberg 's print latin bible when at the age of twenty a mighty change say luther then come over I and all he subsequent effort be to be attribute to that event he recognition of the importance of printing be give in these word : printing be the best and highest gift the _ summum et postremum donum _ by which god advanceth the gospel thanks be to god that it have come at last holy father now at rest would rejoice to see this day of the reveal gospel william caxton by common consent be the introducer of the art of printing into england he be bear about 1422 in kent and receive what be then think a liberal education he father must have be in respectable circumstance as there be at that time a law in full force prohibit any youth from be apprentice to trade whose parent be not possess of a certain rental in land in he eighteenth year caxton be apprentice to robert large a eminent london mercer who in 1430 be sheriff and in 1439 lord mayor of london at he death in 1441 he bequeath caxton a legacy of twenty mark -- a large sum in those day -- and a honorable testimony to he fidelity and integrity soon after this the mercer ' company appoint he they agent in the low country in which employment he spend twenty-three year in 1464 he be one of two commissioner officially employ by edward iv to negotiate a commercial treaty with philip of burgundy and in 1468 when the king 's sister margaret of york married charle of burgundy call the bold he attach himself to they household probably in some literary capacity as in the next year we find he busy in translate at she request during the greater part of this long period he be reside or travel in the midst of the country where the new art of printing be the great subject of interest and would naturally take some measure to acquaint himself with it indeed it have be say that he have a secret commission from edward iv to learn the art and to bribe some of the foreign workman into england be this as it may we know that caxton acquire a complete knowledge of it while abroad for he tell we so and that he have print at cologne the _ recueil des histoires de troye _ -lrb- or _ romance history of troy _ -rrb- in 1465 and in 1472 a english edition of the same translate by himself these two early production be remarkable as be the first book print in either the french or english language -lrb- 26 -rrb- the english edition be sell at the duke of roxburghe 's sale for one thousand sixty pound and be now in the possession of the duke of devonshire caxton return to england about 1474 bring with he press and type and establish himself in one of the chapel of westminster abbey call the eleemosynary almondry or arm ` ry suppose to have be on the site of henry vii 's chapel a printer would naturally resort to the abbey for patronage as in those day it be the head-quarter of learn as well as of religion before the foundation of grammar school there be usually a _ scholasticus _ attach to the abbey and cathedral church who direct and superintend the education of the neighbor nobility and gentry he be besides one of the member of the _ scriptorium _ a large establishment within the abbey where school and other book use to be write the first book caxton print after he return to england and establish himself at the almonry be suppose to be _ the game and play of chesse _ date 1474 but some have raise doubt whether this be print in england as there be no actual evidence of it one of the argument be that the type be exactly the same as what he have previously use at cologne but this be no evidence at all as both the type and paper use in england for many year come from cologne and there be no doubt that caxton bring some with he a second edition of the book of chess with woodcut be print two or three year later and this be generally admit to have be print in england the first book with a unmistakable imprint be he _ dicte and saying of philosopher _ which have be translate for he by the gallant but unfortunate lord river who be murder in pomfret castle by order of richard iii the colophon of this state that it be print in the abbey of westminster in 1477 he appear to have print but one single volume upon vellum which be _ the doctrynal of sapience _ 1489 of which a copy formerly in the king 's library at windsor be now in the british museum this be a very interesting work as connect with caxton be entirely translate by himself into english verse it be a allegorical fiction in which the whole system of literature and science come under consideration caxton die in 1491 after have produce within twenty year of he active career more than fifty volume of mark include chaucer gower lydgate and he own _ chronicle _ of england before caxton 's time the youth of england be supply with they school-book and they reading which be necessarily very limit by the company of stationer or text-writer who write and sell by a exclusive royal privilege the school-book then in use these be chiefly the a b c -lrb- call _ absy _ -rrb- the lord 's prayer the creed and the address to the virgin mary call _ ave marium _ the location of these stationer be in the neighborhood of st paul 's cathedral whence arise the name paternoster row creed lane amen corner and ave marium lane manuscript of a higher order that be in the form of book be mostly supply by the monk and be scarcely accessible to any but the wealthy from they extreme cost thus a chaucer which may now be buy for a few shilling then cost more than a hundred pound and we read of two hundred sheep and ten quarter of wheat be give for a volume of homily minstrel instead of book be in early time the principal medium of communication between author and the public they wander up and down the country chant singing or recite accord to the taste of they customer and have certain privilege of entertainment in the hall of the nobility it may be wonder that caxton like many of the foreign printer do not begin with or at least some time during he career print the scripture especially as wycliffe 's translation have already be make but there be good reason religious persecution run high and the clergy be extremely jealous of the propagation of the scripture among the people knighton have denounce the reading of the bible lament lest this jewel of the church hitherto the exclusive property of the clergy and divine should be make common to the laity and archbishop arundel have issue a enactment that no part of the scripture in english should be read either in public or private or be thereafter translate under pain of the greater excommunication the star chamber too be big with terror a little later erasmus ' edition of the new testament be forbid at cambridge and in the county of surrey the vicar of croydon say from the pulpit we must root out printing or printing will root out we winkin de worde who have come in he youth with caxton to england and continue with he in the superintendence of he office to the day of he death succeed to the business and conduct it with great spirit for the next forty year he begin by entirely remodel he font of gothic type and introduce both roman and italic become he own founder instead of import type from the low country promote the manufacture of paper in this country and such be he activity that he print the extraordinary number of four hundred eight different work he deserve perhaps more praise than he have ever receive for the important part he play in establish and advance the art in england but no one of we early printer deserve more grateful remembrance than richard grafton who in 1537 be the first publisher of the bible in england i say in england because the first bible know as coverdale 's and several edition of the testament translate by tyndale have be previously print abroad in secrecy grafton 's first edition of the bible be a reprint of coverdale and tyndale 's translation with slight alteration by one who assume the name of thoma matthew but whose real name be john roger then prebendary of st paul 's and afterward burn as a heretic in smithfield even this be print secretly abroad nobody yet know where and do not have grafton 's name attach to it till the king have grant he a license under the privy seal though this year 1537 have by the annalist of the bible be call the first year of triumph on account of the king 's license yet bible be still apt to be dangerous thing to all concerned and what be permit one day be not unlikely by a change in religion or policy to be interdict the next with severe visitation although henry viii have recently complete he breach with rome and be excommunicate he alternately punish the religious movement of protestant and catholic accord to he caprice and it be but a few year previously that the reading of the bible have be prohibit by act of parliament that man have be burn at the stake for have even fragment of it in they possession and that tyndale 's translation of the new testament have be buy up and publicly burn -lrb- 1534 -rrb- by order of cuthbert tunstall bishop of london and even as late as may 1536 the reading of the sacred volume have be strictly forbid grafton therefore must have be a bold man to face the danger thus in 1538 when a new edition of the bible commonly call the great bible afterward publish in 1539 be secretly print in pari at the instance of lord cromwell under the superintendence of grafton whitchurch and coverdale the french inquisitor of the faith interfere charge they with heresy and they be fortunate in make they escape to england shortly after the death of caxton 's patron lord cromwell grafton be imprison for the double offence of printing matthew 's bible and the great bible notwithstanding the king 's license and though after a while release he be again imprison in the reign of philip and mary on account of he protestant principle and after all he service to religion and literature die in poverty in 1572 printing be now spread all over england it have already begin at oxford in 1478 -- some say earlier -- at cambridge soon after although the first dated work be 1521 at st alban in 1480 york in 1509 and other place by degree printing do not reach scotland till 1507 and then but imperfectly and ireland not till 1551 owe it be say to the jealousy with which it be regard by the priesthood we will now take a rapid survey of the vast stride printing have make of late year in england and therewith close the principal movement have be in stereotype electrotype the improvement of press and the application of steam power stereotype be the transfer of page of movable type into solid metal plate by the medium of mould form of plaster of paris _ papier-mâché _ gutta-percha or other substance this art be suppose to have be invent in or about 1725 by william ged a goldsmith of edinburgh a small capitalist who have engage to embark with he withdraw from the speculation in alarm he accept overture from a mr william fenner and in 1729 come to london here he obtain three partner in conjunction with whom he enter into a contract with the university of cambridge for stereotype bible and prayer-book but the workman fear that stereotype would eventually ruin they trade purposely make error and when they master be absent batter the type so that the only two prayer-book complete be suppress by authority and the plate destroy upon this the art get into disrepute and ged after much ill-treatment return to edinburgh impoverished and dishearten here he friend desirous that a memorial of he art should be publish enter into a subscription to defray the expense and a sallust print in 1736 and compose and cast in the night-time to avoid the jealous opposition of the workman be now the principal evidence of he claim to the invention but the time have not come for without a very large demand such as could not exist in those day stereotype would be of no advantage book which sell by hundred of thousand and be constantly reprint such as bible prayer-books school-book shakespeare bunyan robinson cruso uncle tom and very popular author and edition will pay for stereotype but for small number it be a loss after the invention have be neglect long enough to be forget earl stanhope who have for several year devoted himself earnestly to the subject and make many experiment resuscitate it in a very perfect manner in 1803 and he printer mr wilson sell the secret to both university and to most of the lead printer to the art of stereotype the public be mainly indebted for cheap literature for when the plate be once produce the chief expense be dispose of something akin to stereotype be another method of printing call logography invent by john walter of the london _ time _ in 1783 and for which he take out a patent this mean a system of printing from type cast in word instead of single letter which it be think would save time and correction when apply to newspaper but it be not find to answer a joke of the time be a suppose order to the type-founder for some word of frequent occurrence which run thus : please send I a hundredweight sort of murder fire dreadful robbery atrocious outrage fearful calamity alarming explosion melancholy accident a assortment of honorable member whig tory hot cold wet dry half a hundred weight make up in pound of butter cheese beef mutton tripe mustard soap rain etc and a few devil angel woman groan hiss etc this method of printing do not succeed for if twenty-four letter will give six hundred sextillion of combination no printing-office could keep a sufficient assortment of even popular word -lrb- footnote 1 : see vol 1 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see accompany fac-simile of a page of the english edition -- a reproduction as faithful as possible in text color texture of paper etc -rrb- john hunyady repulse the turk -lrb- 1 -rrb- ad 1440-1456 arminius vambéry from the time -lrb- 1354 -rrb- when the turk take gallipolus and secure they first dominion in europe the ottoman power on that side of the hellespont be gradually increase in 1360 amurath i cross from asia minor ravage a extensive district and take adrianople which he make the first seat of he royalty and the first shrine of mahometanism in europe he next turn toward bulgarium and servium where in the warlike slavonic tribe he find far stronger foe than the greek victim of earlier turkish conquest pope urban v preach a crusade against the turk and servium hungary bosnium and wallachium league themselves to drive the ottoman out of europe amurath defeat they and add new territory to he previous acquisition a peace be make in 1376 but a new though fruitless attempt of the slavonic people against he give amurath a pretext for further assault upon southeastern europe in 1389 he conquer and annex bulgarium and subjugate the servian in the same year amurath be assassinate bajazet i the son and successor of amurath still further extend the turkish conquest under bajazet 's son mahomet i

that follow and which for a time promise the complete expulsion of the turk from europe the great leader be the hungarian john hunyady bear in 1388 accord to some writer he be a wallach and the son of a common soldier creasy call he the illegitimate son of sigismund king of hungary and the fair elizabeth morsiney with he appear a new spirit such as the ottoman up to that time could not have expect to encounter in that part of europe in vambéry 's narrative we have the authority of hungary 's greatest historian for the lead event in the life of she greatest hero in europe a new power pulsate with youthful life have arrive from somewhere in the interior of asia with the intention of conquer the world this power be the turk -- not merely a single nation but a whole group of people cluster round a nation inspire by one single idea which urge they ever forward -- there be no god but god and mahomet be the apostle of god the mahometan flood already beat upon the bound of catholic christendom in the forefront of which stand hungary hungary 's king sigismund be able for a moment in 1396 to unite the nation of europe against the common danger but the proud array of mail-clad knight be sweep away like chaff before the steady rank of the janizary and herewith begin the long series of desolating inroad into hungary for the turk be wont to suck the blood of the nation they have mark down as they prey they take the country by surprise secretly suddenly like a summer storm appear in overwhelming number burn murder rob especially man in the hope of a rich ransom or child whom they might bring up as mahometan and janizary this body the flower of the turkish army owe its origin for the most part to the christian child thus steal from they parent and they country this infantry of the janizary be the first standing army in europe living constantly together under a common discipline like the inmate of a cloister they rush blindly forward to the cry of god and he prophet like some splendid powerful wild beast eager for prey the turkish sultan publish the proud order : forward let we conquer the whole world wheresoever we tie up we horse ' head that land be we own to resist such a nation that would not listen to negotiation but only thirst for war and conquest seem already a impossibility europe tremble with fear at the report of the formidable attack design against she and listen anxiously for news from distant hungary which lay so to say in the lion 's very mouth against such a enemy a soldier of the modern type be useless one who slay only in defense of he own life and at the word of command whose force consist in the high development of the military art and the murderous instrument of modern technical science what be want be a heroic soul inspire by a burning faith like to that which impel the mahometan soldier this heroic soul this burning faith unite to the tenacious energy of youth be all find unite in john hunyady accompany withal by a singular talent for leadership in war he could not rely for support upon the haughty magnate who could trace they descent back for century and despise the parvenu with a shorter pedigree and a smaller estate he be consequently oblige to cast in he lot with the mass of the lesser nobility individually weaker it be true but not deficient in spirit and a consciousness of they own worth of this class he soon become the idolize leader around he gather the hitherto latent force of hungarian society especially from transylvanium and south hungary and the great hungarian plain which suffer most from the incursion of the turk and be therefore most impressed with the necessity of organize a system of defense it be these who be the first to be inspire by hurvyady 's heroic spirit before commence he career as independent commander he follow he father 's example attach himself to the court of sigismund the emperor-king in whose train he visit the country of western europe germany england and italy till he at length return home he mind enrich by experience but with the fervor of he first faith unchill when over fifty year old he repair at he sovereign 's command to the south of hungary to organize the resistance to the turk at first he be appoint ban of severin and as such have the chief command of the fortify place build by the hungarian for the defense of the lower danube after that he become waywode of transylvanium the civil and military governor of the southeastern corner of the hungarian kingdom before however he have reach these dignity he have fight a succession of battle and skirmish with such success that for the fanatical turkish soldiery he form nay he very name be a object of terror it be hunyady alone whom they seek to slay on the field of battle well persuade that he once slay they would easily deal with the rest of hungary thus in 1442 a turkish leader name mezid bey burst into transylvanium at the head of eighty thousand man in pursuance of the sultan 's command with no other aim than to take hunyady dead or alive nor indeed do hunyady keep they wait for he he hurry at the head of he troops to attack the turkish leader who be lay siege to hermannstadt upon this mezid bey call he bravest soldier around he describe to they once more hunyady 's appearance he arm he dress he stature and he horse that they might certainly recognize he slay he only he exclaim and we shall easily deal with the rest of they we shall drive they like a flock of sheep into the presence of we August master on that occasion be see with what self-sacrificing enthusiasm he soldier love they heroic leader when they learn from they spy the purpose of the turk they take all possible measure to secure he precious life one of they number simon kemeny who bear a striking resemblance to hunyady determine to sacrifice himself for he leader he announce that he would put on hunyady 's clothes and armor the turk would then attack he under the belief that he be the celebrated chief and while they be thus engage the real hunyady would fall upon they unexpectedly and put they to flight at first hunyady would by no means consent to this plan as he do not wish to expose kemeny to such mortal danger but at last see the great military advantage likely to accrue from it he consent and so indeed it fall out as soon as the battle begin the turk perceive simon kemeny in the garb of hunyady direct all they force against he kemeny after a stout defense fall together with a great number of he follower and the turk see he fall set up a general cry of triumph and exultation just at this critical moment they be hotly attack in the flank by the genuine hunyady thus attack in the very moment when they imagine that they have already gain the day the turk be throw into confusion and take wildly to flight twenty thousand corpse be leave on the battlefield among they lay mezid bey himself together with he son fearful be the rage of the turkish sultan when he hear of the defeat and death of mezid bey and he at once despatch another army against hunyady which like the first number eighty thousand man this time however hunyady do not let they enter transylvanium but wait for they at the pass know as the iron gate among the high mountain on the southern boundary of hungary the hungarian army be not more than fifteen thousand man so that the turk be at least five time as strong but the military genius of hunyady make up for the small number of he follower he post they in a strong position in the rough pass and attack the enemy in place where it be impossible for he to make use of he strength thus more than half the turkish army perish miserably in the battle again they commander-in-chief fall on the field together with six subordinate commander while two hundred horse-tail standard fall into hunyady 's hand as trophy of he victory these two splendid victory fill all europe with joy and admiration christendom again breathe freely for she feel that a champion send by a special providence have appear who have both the courage and the ability to meet and to repel the haughty and formidable foe but hunyady be not content with do so much he think that by this time he might carry the war into the enemy 's country the plan of operation be exceptionally daring yet hunyady have not resolve on it without careful consideration in the mean time through hunyady 's exertion wladislaw iii the young king of poland have be elect king of hungary hunyady gain the new king over to he plan and by this mean secure the coöperation of the higher aristocracy and the armed band which they be bind to lead into the field at the king 's summons hunyady count besides on the assistance of europe in the first place on the pope who be zealous advocate of the war against the mahometan next on venice which as the first commercial city and state at that time have suffer severe loss owe to the spread of turkish dominion on the gallant pole whose king now wear the hungarian crown and lastly upon the people of christendom in general whose enthusiasm for a war against the infidel have be quicken by the report of hunyady 's victory and indeed at he request the pope send some small sum of money the pole furnish a auxiliary force while numerous volunteer from the rest of europe flock to serve under he banner although the assistance thus furnish be comparatively unimportant it nevertheless serve to increase he zeal for the daring undertaking he and he heroic companion be not only proud of defend they own native country but feel that they be the champion of all christendom against ottoman aggression and they religious enthusiasm keep pace with they patriotism if they do not get regiment send to they aid they feel that the eye of all europe be upon they ready to grieve at they possible ill-success while they victory would be celebrate with the _ te deum _ in the cathedral of every capital in europe the aggressive campaign be commence without delay hunyady 's resolve be at once translate into fact he would not allow the beaten foe time to recover breath he plan be to cross the danube and penetrate through the pass of the balkan to philippopoli at that time the capital of the sultan 's dominion where he keep the main body of he army about christmas a season in which the turk do not like to fight amid heavy snow and severe cold the hungarian army of about thirty thousand man press forward hunyady march in advance with the vanguard of twelve thousand pick man after he the king and the pope 's legate with the rest of the army the sultan however with a large body of man have occupy the pass of the balkan and prevent they further advance this impediment couple with the cold and severe weather depress the spirit of the troops wear out with fatigue hunyady however raise they spirit by gain a victory lighting one night upon a body of the enemy twenty thousand in number he attack they at once and after a few hour ' struggle succeed in disperse they later on he take two large town with they citadel and in three engagement triumph over three separate division of the enemy learning that a still larger body of turk be attempt to cut off he communication with the king 's army he attack that also and put it to flight after that he join he corps with the main army under the king and indeed none too soon sultan amurath suddenly arrive with the main body of he force which he strongly intrench in the narrowest pass of the balkan hunyady saw that these intrenchment could not be force and do all he could to entice he enemy down into the plain this he succeed in do in the battle that ensue the king too play a conspicuous part and receive a wound in the end however the hungarian gain the victory and the younger brother of the grand vizier be take prisoner so much success be sufficient for hunyady for the time especially as the natural obstacle have prove insurmountable the hungarian army return home in good order and the young king make a triumphal entry into he capital precede by a crowd of turkish prisoner and capture turkish ensign these last trophy of victory be deposit in the coronation church in the fortress of buda and now something happen which have hitherto be deem incredible : the sultan sue for peace -- a true believer and a sovereign from a unbelieving giaour the peace be conclude and hungary again become possess of those dependent -lrb- south slavonic -rrb- province which lay between the territory of the sultan and the kingdom of hungary in the narrower sense of the word in three short year hunyady have undo the work of year on the part of the turk the sultan however soon repent of what he have do and continually delay the fulfilment of he promise to evacuate certain frontier fortress for this cause the young king especially incite thereto by the pope determine to renew the war hunyady at first oppose the king 's resolution and wish to wait later on he be gain over to the king 's view and take up the matter with he whole soul the opportunity be invite for the sultan with he main army be engage somewhere in asia and the venetian promise to prevent with they fleet he return to europe across the narrow sea in the neighborhood of constantinople the hungarian army indeed set out -lrb- 1444 -rrb- on its expedition and continually expect the arrival of the troops of they ally -- the emperor of constantinople and the prince of albanium -- penetrate ever farther and farther into the hostile territory they be to be join by they ally at the town of varna on the shore of the black sea when however the hungarian have arrive at that town they find no trace of they expect ally but on the contrary learn with certainty that the sultan have succeed in elude the vigilance of the venetian have bring he army in small boat over into europe and be now follow fast on they track thus all hope of aid from ally be at a end the brave general and he small hungarian force have to rely on they own resource separate as they be by some week ' journey from they own country while the enemy would be soon upon they in number five time they own yet even so hunyady 's faith and courage do not desert he the proverb say if thy sword be short lengthen it by a step forward and hunyady boldly but yet with the caution that behoove a careful general take up he position before the sultan 's army both he and he hungarian fight with dauntless courage avail themselves of every advantage and beat back every assault already victory seem to be assure a few hour after the battle have begin both the turkish wing have be break and even the sultan and the brave janizary be think of flight when the young king the pole wladislaw whom hunyady have adjure by god to remain in a place of safety until the combat should be decide be persuade by he polish suite to fling himself with the small band in immediate attendance upon he right on the center of the janizary so that he too might have a share in the victory and not leave it all to hunyady the janizary waver for a moment under this new and unexpected attack but soon perceive that they have to do with the king of hungary they close round he band which have penetrate far into they rank the king 's horse be first hamstrung and as it fall the king 's head be sever from he body stick upon the point of a spear and expose to the view of both army the hungarian shock at the unexpected sight waver and feeling themselves lose begin to fly all the entreaty and exhortation of hunyady be in vain such be the confusion that he could be neither see nor hear and in a few minute the whole hungarian army be in headlong flight hunyady leave to himself have also to seek safety in flight alone desert by all he have to make he way from one place of concealment to another till after some week ' wander he arrive in hungary the bad news have precede he and in consequence everything be in confusion again arise that difficult question : who should be the new king under such difficult circumstance the sultan 's army have however suffer so much in the battle of varna that for the time he leave the hungarian unmolest the nation be dispose to choose for its king the child ladislaus son of king albert the predecessor of wladislaw the child however be in the power of the neighbor prince frederick the archduke of austrium who be not dispose to let he go out of he hand without a heavy ransom in these circumstance the more powerful noble in hungary take advantage of the confusion to strengthen each he own position at the expense of the nation at first the government of the country be intrust to a number of captain but this prove so evidently disastrous that the better sort of people succeed in have they abolish and hunyady establish as sole governor for all that however hunyady have a good deal of trouble with the chief aristocrat garay czilleus ujlakus who envy the parvenu he sudden promotion and despise he obscure origin take up arm to resist he authority thus hunyady instead of blunt the edge of he sword upon foreign foe have to bridle the insubordination of he own countryman luckily it do not take long to force the discontented to own the weight of he arm and he superiority as a military leader order be thus to some extent reestablish at home hunyady be again able to turn he attention to the turk he feel that he have in fact gain the battle of varna which be only lose through the jealous humor of a youthful king that it behoove he not to stop half way that it be he duty to continue offensive operation but in so do he have to rely upon he own proper force it be true that he be governor of the country but for the purpose of offensive warfare beyond the frontier he could not gain the consent of the great noble luckily he private property have enormously increase by this time the hungarian constitution require the king to bestow the estate of such nobleman as die without male heir or have be condemn for any offence on such nobleman as have approve themselves valiant defender of the country now where could be find a more worthy recipient of such estate than hunyady to whom the public treasury be besides a debtor on account of the sum he disburse for the constant warfare he maintain against the turk especially in the south of hungary a whole series of lordly estate many of they belong to the crown have come into hunyady 's hand either as pledge for the repayment of the money he have pay he soldier or as he own private property the yearly revenue arise from these vast estate be employ by hunyady not in personal expenditure but in the defense of he country he himself live as simply as any of he soldier and recognize no other use of money than as a weapon for the defense of christendom against islam in the early morning while all he suite sleep he pass hour in prayer before the altar in the dimly light church implore the help of the almighty for the attainment of he sole object in life -- the destruction of the turkish power at last 1448 he set out against the sultan with a army of twenty-four thousand of he most trusty soldier this time it be on the frontier of servium on the field of blackbird that hunyady encounter sultan amurath who have a army of one hundred and fifty thousand man -- again more than five time the number of the christian hunyady at first withdraw himself into he intrenched camp but in a few day feel himself strong enough to engage with the enemy on the open field the battle last without interruption for two day and a night hunyady himself be several time in deadly peril once he horse be shoot under he he be to be find wherever assistance support encouragement be need at last on the morning of the third day as the turk who have receive reinforcement be about to renew the attack the waywode of wallachium pass over to the side of the turk the waywode belong to the orthodox eastern church he have join hunyady on the way and he desertion transfer six thousand man from one side to the other and decide the battle in favor of the turk the hungarian wear out by fatigue fall into a discouragement while hunyady have no fresh troops to bring up to they support the battle come to a sudden end seventeen thousand hungarian corpse strew the field but the loss of the turk be more than thirty thousand man hunyady again leave to himself have again to make he escape at first he only dismiss he military suite afterward he separate from he faithful servant in the hope that separately they might more easily baffle they pursuer next he have to turn he horse adrift as the poor animal be incapable of continue he journey thus he make he way alone and on foot toward the frontier of he native land after a while look down from the top of a piece of elevated ground he perceive a large body of turk from whom he hide himself in a neighbor lake he thus escape this danger but only to encounter another at a turn of the road he come so suddenly upon a party of turkish plunderer as to be unable to escape from they and thus become they prisoner but the turk do not recognize he and leave he in the hand of two of they number the rest go on in search of more prey he two guard soon come to blow with one another about a heavy gold cross which they have find on the person of they captive and while they be thus quarrel hunyady suddenly wrench a sword out of the hand of one of the two turk and cut off he head upon which the other take to flight and hunyady be again free in the mean time however george the prince of servium who take part with the aristocratic malcontent and who although a christian out of pure hatred to hunyady have go over to the side of the turk have give strict order that all hungarian straggler be to be apprehend and bring before he in this way hunyady fall into the hand of some servian peasant who deliver he to they prince nor do he regain he liberty without the payment of a heavy ransom leave he son ladislaus as hostage in he stead he thus return home amid a thousand peril and with the painful experience that europe leave he to he own resource to fight as best he could against the ever-advancing turk the dependency of the hungarian crown servium and wallachium -- on whose recovery he have spend so much blood and treasure -- instead of support he as might be expect of christian country throw themselves in a suicidal manner into the arm of the turk they hope by they ready submission to find favor in the eye of the irresistible conqueror by whom however they be a little later devour after these event hunyady continue to act as governor or regent of hungary for five year more by which time the young ladislaus son of king albert attain he majority in 1453 hunyady finally lay down he dignity as governor and give over the power into the hand of the young king ladislaus v whom hunyady have first to liberate by force of arm from he uncle frederick of austrium before he could set he on the throne of hungary the young king of german origin have hardly become emancipate from he guardian when he fall under the influence of he other uncle ulric czilleus this czilleus be a great nobleman of styrium but be withal possess of large estate in hungary as a foreigner and as a relative of king sigismund he have long view with a evil eye hunyady 's elevation on one occasion hunyady have to inflict punishment on he he consequently now do everything he could to induce the young king he nephew to hate the great captain as he himself do he seek to infuse jealousy into he mind and to lead he to believe that hunyady aim at the crown he slander find the readier credence in the mind of the youthful sovereign as he be completely stupefy by a uninterrupted course of debauchery at last the king be bring to agree to a plan for ensnare the great man who so often jeopard he life and he substance in the defense of he country and religion they summon he in the king 's name to vienna where ladislaus as a austrian prince be then stay with the intention of waylay and murder he but hunyady get wind of the whole plot and when he arrive at the place of ambush it be at the head of two thousand pick hungarian warrior thus it be czilleus who fall into the snare wretched creature exclaim hunyady thou hast fall into the pit thou diggedst for I be it not that i regard the dignity of the king and my own humanity thou shouldst suffer a punishment proportion to thy crime as it be i let thee off this time but come no more into my sight or thou shalt pay for it with thy life such magnanimity however do not disarm the hostility of those who surround the king on the pretence of treason against the king hunyady be deprive of all he office and all he estate the document be still to be see in the hungarian state archive in which the king lead astray by the jealousy that prevail among he councillor represent every virtue of the hero as a crime and condemn he to exile fortunately czillei himself soon fall into disfavor the german themselves overthrow he and the king now better inform replace hunyady in the post of captain-general of the kingdom hunyady who meanwhile have be live retire in one of he castle now comply with the king 's wish without difficulty or hesitation and again assume the highest military command instead of seek how to revenge himself after the manner of ordinary man he only think of the great enemy of he country the turk and indeed as it be threaten cloud hang over the horizon in the southeast a new sultan have come to the throne mahomet ii one of the greatest sovereign of the house of othman he begin he reign with the occupation of constantinople 1453 and thus destroy the last refuge of the byzantine empire at the news of this event all europe burst into a chorus of lamentation the whole importance of the eastern question at once present itself before the nation of christendom it be at once understand that the new conqueror would not remain idle within the crumble wall of constantinople and indeed in no long time be publish the proud _ mot d'ordre _ as there be but one god in heaven so there shall be but one master upon earth hunyady look toward constantinople with heavy heart he foresee the outburst of the storm which would in the first place fall upon he own country threaten it with utter ruin hunyady so it seem be again leave alone in the defense of christendom the approach danger be delay for a few year but in 1456 mahomet have finally establish himself in constantinople set out with the intention of strike a fatal blow against hungary on the border of that country on the bank of the danube on what be properly speak servian territory stand the fortress of belgrad when the danger from the turk become imminent the king of hungary purchase the place from the despot of servium give they in exchange several extensive estate in hungary and have at great expense turn it into a vast fortress at that time suppose to be impregnable mahomet determine to take the place and to this end make the most extensive preparation he lead to the wall of belgrad a army of not less than one hundred and fifty thousand man the approach of this immense host so terrify the young king that he leave hungary and take refuge in vienna along with he uncle and counsellor czilleus hunyady alone remain at he post resolute like a lion attack the energy of the old leader -- he be now nearly sixty-eight -- be only steel by the greatness of the danger he forethought and he mental resource be but increase as he see that it would be impossible to do anything with a small army he send he friend john capistran a italian franciscan a man animated by a burning zeal akin to he own to preach a crusade against the enemy of christendom through the town and village of the great hungarian plain this the friar do to such effect that in a few week he have collect sixty thousand man ready to fight in defense of the cross this army of crusader -- the last in the history of the nation -- have for its gathering cry the bell of the church for its arm scythe and axis christ for its leader and john hunyady and john capistran for he lieutenant the two greatest leader in war of that day contend for the possession of belgrad the same army now surround that fortress which a few year before have storm constantinople repute impregnable the same hero defend it who have so often in the course of a single decade defeat the turkish foe in a offensive war and who now regardless of danger with a small but faithful band of follower be prepare to do all that courage resolution and prudence might effect many hundred large cannon begin to break down the stone rampart many hundred boat form a river flotilla cover the danube so as to cut off all communication between the fortress and hungary during this time hunyady 's son ladislaus and he brother-in-law michael szilagyus be in command in the fortress hunyady 's first daring plan be to force he way through the blockade flotilla and enter belgrad before the eye of the whole turkish army take with he he own soldier and capistran 's crusader the plan completely succeed with he own flotilla of boat he break through that of the turk and make he entrance into the fortress in triumph after this the struggle be continue with equal resolution and ability on both side such advantage as the christian derive from the protection afford by the fortification be fully compensate by the enormous superiority in number both of man and cannon on the part of the turk without example in the history of the storm of fortress be the stratagem practice by hunyady when he permit the pick troops of the enemy the janizary to penetrate within the fortification and there destroy they in the place they think they have take ten thousand janizary have already swarm into the town and be prepare to attack the bridge and gate of the citadel when hunyady order light fagot soak in pitch and sulphur and other combustible to be fling from the rampart into the midst of the crowded rank of the janizary the fire seize on they loose garment and in a short time the whole body be a sea of fire everyone seek to fly then it be that hunyady sally out with he pick band while capistran with a tall cross in he hand and the cry of jesus on he lip follow with he crowd of fanatic the cannon of the fortress play upon the turkish camp the sultan himself be wound and sweep along by the stream of fugitive forty thousand turk be leave dead upon the field four thousand be take prisoner and three thousand cannon be capture accord to the opinion of hunyady himself the turk have never suffer such a severe defeat its value as far as the hungarian be concern be heighten by the fact that the ambitious sultan be personally humiliate there be now great joy in europe at the news of the brilliant victory the _ te deum _ be sing in all the more important city throughout europe and the pope wish to compliment hunyady with a crown a crown of another character await he -- that of he redeemer in whose name he live fight and fall the exhalation from the vast number of unburied or imperfectly bury body fester in the heat of summer give rise to a epidemic in the christian camp and to this the great leader fall a victim hunyady die August 11 1456 in the sixty-eighth year of he age he die amid the intoxication of he greatest victory idolize by he follower have once more preserved he country from imminent ruin could he have desire a more glorious death he go to he last rest with the consciousness that he have fulfil he mission have design great thing and have accomplish they and the result of he lifelong effort survive he he great

be already cast its shadow before nichola stand calm in face of the inevitable event devote himself to the spiritual welfare of the church and to the interest of learning and the art but he be chiefly remember as the first pope to conceive a systematic plan for the reconstruction and permanent restoration of rome he die before that purpose could be execute in accordance with he great design but other enter into he labor carry he work to a fuller accomplishment it be to the center of ecclesiastical rome the shrine of the apostle the chief church of christendom and its adjacent building that the care of the builder-pope be first direct the leonine city of borgo as it be more familiarly call be that portion of rome which lie on the right side of the tiber and which extend from the castle of st angelo to the boundary of the vatican garden -- enclose the church of st peter the vatican palace with all its wealth and the great hospital of santo spirito surround and intersect by many little street and join to the other portion of the city by the bridge of st angelo behind the mass of picture-gallery museum and collection of all kind which now fill up the endless hall and corridor of the papal palace come a sweep of noble garden full of shade and shelter from the roman sun such a resort for the learnèd leisure which in trim garden take its pleasure as it would be difficult to surpass in this fine extent of wood and verdure the pope 's villa or casino now the only summer palace which the exist pontiff choose to permit himself stand as in a domain small yet perfect almost everything within these wall have be build or completely transform since the day of nichola but then as now here be the heart and center of christendom the supreme shrine of the catholic faith the home of the spiritual ruler whose sway reach over the whole earth when nichola begin he reign the old church of st peter be the church of the western world then as now classical in form a stately basilica without the picturesqueness and romantic variety and also as we think without the majesty and grandeur of a gothic cathedral yet more picturesque if less stupendous in size and construction than the present great edifice so majestic in its own grave and splendid way with which through all the agitation of the recent century the name of st peter have be identify the earlier church be full of riches and of great association to which the wonderful st peter 's we all know can lay claim only as its successor and supplanter with its flight of broad step its portico and colonnade façade crown with a great tower it dominate the square open and glowing in the sun without the shelter of the great exist colonnade or the sparkle of the fountain behind be the little palace begin by innocent iii to afford a shelter for the pope in dangerous time or on occasion to receive the foreign guest whose object be to visit the shrine of the apostle almost all the building then stand have be replace by greater yet the position be the same the shrine unchanged though everything else then exist have fade away except some portion of the old wall which enclose this sacred place in a special sanctity and security which be not however always respect the borgo be the holiest portion of all the sacred city it be there that the blood of the martyr have be shed and where from the earliest age of christianity they memory and tradition have be preserve it be not necessary for we to enter into the question whether st peter ever be in rome which many writer have laboriously contest so far as the record of the act of the apostle be concern there be no evidence at all for or against but tradition be all on the side of those who assert it the position take by signor lancianus on this point seem to we a very sensible one i write about the monument of ancient rome he say from a strictly archaeological point of view avoid question which pertain or be suppose to pertain to religious controversy for the archaeologist the presence and execution of ss peter and paul in rome be fact establish beyond a shadow of doubt by purely monumental evidence there be a time when person belong to different creed make it almost a case of conscience to affirm or deny _ a priori _ those fact accord to they acceptance or rejection of the tradition of any particular church this state of feeling be a matter of the past at least for those who have follow the progress of recent discovery and of critical literature there be no event of the imperial age and of imperial rome which be attest by so many noble structure all of which point to the same conclusion -- the presence and execution of the apostle in the capital of the empire when constantine raise the monumental basilica over they tomb on the via cornelium and the via ostiensis when eudoxium build the church ad vinculum when damascus put a memorial tablet in the platonium and catacombo when the house of puden and aquilum and prisca be turn into oratory when the name of nymphae sancti petrus be give to the spring in the catacomb of the via nomentana when the 29th of June be accept as the anniversary of st peter 's execution when sculptor painter medallist goldsmith worker in glass and enamel and engraver of precious stone all begin to reproduce in rome the likeness of the apostle at the beginning of the second century and continue to do so till the fall of the empire -- must we consider they as labor under a delusion or conspire in the commission of a gigantic fraud why be such proceedings accept without protest from whatever city whatever community -- if there be any other -- which claim to own the genuine tomb of ss peter and paul these argument gain more value from the fact that the evidence on the other side be purely negative this be one of those practical argument which be always more interesting than those which depend upon theory and opinion however there be many book on both side of the question which may be consult we be content to follow signor lancianus the special sanctity and importance of il borgo originate in this belief the shrine of the apostle be its center and glory it be this that bring pilgrim from the far corner of the earth before there be any masterpiece of art to visit or any of those priceless collection which now form the glory of the vatican the spot of the apostle ' execution be indicate by immemorial tradition as between the two goal -lrb- _ inter dua meta _ -rrb- of nero 's circus which spot signor lancianus tell we be exactly the site of the obelisk now stand in the piazza of st peter a little chapel call the chapel of the crucifixion stand there in the early age before any great basilica or splendid shrine be possible this sacred spot and the church build to commemorate it be naturally the center of all those religious tradition which separate rome from every other city it be to preserve they from assault in order that it should be less easy for the enemy to make depredation and burn the church of st peter as they have heretofore do that leo iv the first pope whom we find engage in any real work of construction build a wall round the mound of the vatican and colle vaticano -- little hill not so high as the seven hill of rome -- where against the strong wall of nero 's circus constantine have build he great basilica at that period -- in the middle of the ninth century -- there be nothing but the church and shrine -- no palace and no hospital the exist house be give to the corsus a family which have be drive out of they island accord to platina by the saracen who shortly before have make a incursion up to the very wall of rome whither the people of the coast -lrb- _ luoghus maritimus del mar terreno _ -rrb- from naple northward have apparently pursue the corsair and help the roman to beat they back one other humble building of some sort call burgus saxonum vicus saxonum scholum saxonum and simply saxium or sassium it be interesting to know exist close to the sacred center of the place a lodging build for himself by ina king of wessex in 727 thus the english have a national association of they own with the central shrine of christianity there be also a scholum francorum in the borgo the pilgrim must have build they hut and set up some sort of little oratory -- favor as be the case even in pope nichola ' day by the excellent quarry of the circus close at hand -- as near as possible to the great shrine and basilica which they have come so far to say they prayer in and attract too no doubt by the freedom of the lonely suburb between the green hill and the flow river leo iv build he wall round this little city and fortify it by tower in every part he put sculptor of marble and write a prayer say platina one of these gate lead to st pellegrino another be close to the castle of st angelo and be the gate by which one go forth to the open country the third lead to the school of the saxon and over each be a prayer inscribe these three prayer be all to the same effect -- that god would defend this new city which the pope have enclose with wall and call by he own name the leonine city from all assault of the enemy either by fraud or by force the greatest however of all the conception of pope nichola the very center of he great plan be the library of the vatican which he begin to build and to which he leave all the collection of he life vespasian give we a list of the principal among these five thousand volume the thing which he prize most which the pope bequeath to the church and to rome these cherish roll of parchment many of they translation make under he own eye be enclose in elaborate binding ornament with gold and silver we be not however inform whether any of the great treasure of the vatican library come from he hand -- the good vespasian take more interest in the work of he scribe than in codex he tell we of five hundred scudus give to lorenzo valle with a pretty speech that the price be below he merit but that eventually he should have more liberal pay of fifteen hundred scudus give to guerronus for a translation of the _ iliad _ and so forth it be like a bookseller of the present day vaunt he new edition to a collector in search of the earliest known but pope nichola like most other patron of he time know no greek nor probably ever expect that it would become a usual subject of study so that he translation be precious to he the chief way of make he treasure of any practical use the greater part alas of all he splendor have pass away one pure and perfect glory the little chapel of san lorenzo paint by the tender hand of fra angelico remain unharmed the only work of that grand painter to be find in rome if one could have choose a monument for the good pope the patron and friend of art in every form there could not have be a better than this fra angelico seem to have be bring to rome by pope eugenius but it be under nichola in two or three year of gentle labor that the work be do it be however impossible to enumerate all the undertaking of pope nichola he do something to reestablish or decorate almost all the great basilica it be fear -- but here we later historian speak with bated breath not like to bring such a accusation against the kind pope who love man of letter -- that the destruction of st peter 's afterward ruthlessly carry out by succeed pope be in he plan on the pretext so constantly employ and possibly believe in of the instability of the ancient building but there be no absolute certainty of evidence and at all event he might have repent for he certainly do not do that deed he begin the tribune however in the ancient church which may have be a preparation for the entire renewal of the edifice and he do much toward the decoration of another round church that of the madonna delle febbre a ill-omened name attach to the vatican he also build the belvedere in the garden and surround the whole with strong wall and tower -lrb- round -rrb- one of which accord to nibby still remain fifty year ago which very little of nichola ' building have do he great sin be one which he share with all he brother-pope that he boldly treat the antique ruin of the city as quarry for he new building not without protest and remonstrance from many yet with the calm of a mind preoccupy and see nothing so great and important as the work upon which he own heart be set this excellent pope die in 1455 soon after have receive the news of the downfall of constantinople which be say to have break he heart he have many ailment and be always a small and spare man of little strength of constitution but nothing transfix he heart so much as to hear that the turk have take constantinople and kill the european with many thousand of christian among they that same ` imperadore de gostantinopli ' whom he have see seat in state at the council of ferrara listen to he own and other argument only a few year before -- as well as the greater part no doubt of he own clerical opponent there when he be die ` be not the less of a strong spirit ' he call the cardinal round he bed and many prelate with they and make they a last address he pontificate have last a little more than eight year and to have carry out so little of he great plan must have be heavy on he heart but he die word be those of one to whom the holiness and unity of the church come before all no doubt the fear that the victorious turk might spread ruin over the whole of christendom be first in he mind at that solemn hour ` know my dearest brethren that i be approach the hour of my death i would for the great dignity and authority of the apostolic see make a serious and important testimony before you not commit to the memory of letter

mahomet succeed to the sultanate he be but twenty-one year old but have already give proof of great talent learn and ambition all guide by a judgment of remarkable maturity the first object of mahomet

threatening act of mahomet be the construction of a fortress on constantine 's territory at the narrowest part of the bosporus and within five mile of constantinople constantine be too weak to resent

they number breed up in peaceful occupation they probably possess neither the activity nor the habitual exercise which be require to move with ease under the weight of armor then in use so few be find disposed to fight for they country that not more than six thousand greek troops appear under arm during the whole siege the numerical weakness of the greek army render it incapable of defend so large a city as constantinople even with all the advantage to be derive from strong fortification the emperor be therefore anxious to obtain the assistance of the warlike citizen of the italian republic where good officer and experienced troops be then numerous as he have no money to engage mercenary he could only hope to succeed by papal influence a embassy be send to pope nichola v beg immediate

as he legate isidore have represent the russian church at the council of florence but on he return to russia he be imprison as a apostate and with difficulty escape to italy he be by birth a greek and be a man of learning and conciliatory manners it be expect that he would be favorably receive at constantinople the cardinal arrive at constantinople in November 1452 he be accompany by a small body of choose troops and bring some pecuniary aid which he employ in repair the most dilapidated part of the fortification both the emperor and the cardinal deceive themselves in suppose that the danger to which the greek nation and the christian church be expose would induce the orthodox to yield something of they ecclesiastical form and phrase it be evident that foreign aid could alone save constantinople and it be absurd to imagine that the latin would fight for those who treat they as heretic and who would not fight for themselves the crisis therefore compel the greek to choose between union with the church of rome or submission to the ottoman power they have to decide whether the preservation of the greek empire be worth the ecclesiastical sacrifice they be call upon to make in order to preserve they national independence in the mean time the emperor constantine celebrate he union with the papal church in the cathedral of st sophium on December 12 1452 the court and the great body of the dignified clergy ratify the act by they presence but the monk and the people repudiate the connection in they opinion the church of st sophium be polluted by the ceremony and from that day it be desert by the orthodox the historian duca declare that they look upon it as a haunt of demon and no better than a pagan shrine the monk the nun and the populace publicly proclaim they detestation of the union and they opposition be inflamed by the bigotry of a ambitious pedant who under the name of georgius scholarius act as a warm partisan of the union at the council of florence and under the ecclesiastical name of gennadius be know in history as the subservient patriarch of sultan mahomet ii on return from italy he make a great parade of he repentance for comply with the unionist at florence he shut himself up in the monastery of pantokrator where he assume the monastic habit and the name of gennadius under which he consummate the union between the greek church and the ottoman administration at the present crisis he step forward as the leader of the most bigoted party and excite he follower to the most furious opposition to measure which he have once advocate as salutary for the church and indispensable to the preservation of the state the unionist be now accuse of sacrifice true religion to the delusion of human policy of insulting god to serve the pope and of prefer the interest of they body to the care of they soul in place of exhort they countryman to aid the emperor who be strain every nerve to defend they country -- in place of infuse into they mind the spirit of patriotism and religion these teacher of the people be incessantly inveigh against the wickedness of the unionist and the apostasy of the emperor so completely do they bigotry extinguish every feeling of patriotism that the grand duke notara declare he would rather see constantinople subject to the turban of the sultan than to the tiara of the pope he wish be gratified but in die he must have feel how fearfully he have err in compare the effect of papal arrogance with the cruelty of mahometan tyranny the emperor constantine who feel the importance of the approach contest show great prudence and moderation in he difficult position the spirit of christian charity calm he temper and he determination not to survive the empire give a deliberate coolness to he military conduct though he greek subject often raise sedition and revile he in the street the emperor take no notice of they behavior to induce the orthodox to fight for they country by have a leader of they own party he leave the grand duke notara in office yet he well know that this bigot would never act cordially with the latin auxiliary who be the best troops in the city and the emperor have some reason to distrust the patriotism of notaras see that he hoard he immense wealth instead of expend a portion of it for he country the fortification be not find to be in a good state of repair two monk who have be intrust with a large sum for the purpose of repair they have execute they duty in a insufficient and it be generally say in a fraudulent manner the extreme dishonesty that prevail among the greek official explain the selection of monk as treasurer for military object and it must lessen we surprise at find man of they religious profession share in the general avarice or tolerate the habitual peculation of other cannon be begin to be use in siege but stone ball be use in the larger piece of artillery and the larger the gun the greater be the effect it be expect to produce even in constantinople there be some artillery too large to be of much use as the land wall have not be construct to admit of they recoil and the rampart be so weak as to be shake by they concussion constantine have also only a moderate supply of gunpowder the machine of a past epoch in military science but to the use of which the greek adhere with they conservative prejudice be bring from the storehouse and plant on the wall beside the modern artillery johann grant a german officer be the most experienced artilleryman and military engineer in the place a considerable number of italian hasten to constantinople as soon as they hear of its danger eager to defend so important a depot of eastern commerce the spirit of enterprise and the love of military renown have become as much a characteristic of the merchant noble of the commercial republic as they have be in a precede age distinction of the baron in feudal monarchy all the nation who then trade with constantinople furnished contingent to defend its wall a short time before the siege commence john justiniani arrive with two genoese galley and three hundred choose troops and the emperor value he service so highly that he be appoint general of the guard the resident bailo of the venetian furnish three large galease and a body of troops for the defense of the port the consul of catalan with he countryman and the aragonese undertake the defense of the great palace of bukoleon and the port of kontoskalion cardinal isidore with the papal troops defend the kynegesion and the angle of the city at the head of the port down to st demetrius the importance of the aid which be afford by the latin be prove by the fact that of twelve military division into which constantine divide the fortification the command of only two be intrust to the exclusive direction of greek officer in the other greek share the command with foreigner or alien alone conduct the defense when all constantine 's preparation for defense be complete he find himself oblige to man a line of wall on the land side of about five mile in length every point of which be expose to a direct attack the remainder of the wall toward the port and the proponti exceed nine mile in extent and he whole garrison hardly amount to nine thousand man he fleet consist of only twenty galley and three venetian galease but the entry of the port be close by a chain the end of which on the side of gala be secure in a strong fort of which the greek keep possession during the winter the emperor send out he fleet to ravage the coast of the proponti as far as cyzicus and the spirit of the greek be rouse by the booty they make in these expedition mahomet ii spend the winter at adrianople prepare everything necessary for commence the siege with vigor he whole mind be absorb by the glory of conquer the roman empire and gain possession of constantinople which for more than eleven hundred fifty year have be the capital of the east while the fever of ambition inflamed he soul he cooler judgment also warn he that the ottoman power rest on a perilous basis as long as constantinople the true capital of he empire remain in the hand of other mahomet could easily assemble a sufficient number of troops for he enterprise but it require all he activity and power to collect the requisite supplies of provision and store for the immense military and naval force he have order to assemble and to prepare the artillery and ammunition necessary to insure success early and late in he court and in he cabinet the young sultan could talk of nothing but the approach siege with the writing-reed and a scroll of paper in he hand he be often see trace plan of the fortification of constantinople and mark out position for he own battery every question relate to the extent and locality of the various magazine to be construct in order to maintain the troops be discuss in he presence he himself distribute the troops in they respective division and regulate the order of they march he issue the order relate to the equipment of the fleet and discuss the various method propose for breach mining and scale the wall he enthusiasm be the impulse of a hero but the immense superiority of he force would have secure he the victory with any ordinary degree of perseverance the ottoman be already familiar with the use of cannon amurath ii have employ they when he besiege constantinople in 1422 but mahomet now resolve on form a more powerful battering-train than have previously exist neither the greek nor turk possess the art of cast large gun both be oblige to employ foreigner a experienced artilleryman and founder name urban by birth a wallachian carry into execution the sultan 's wish he have pass some time in the greek service but even the moderate pay he be allow by the emperor have fall in arrear he resign he place and transfer he service to the sultan who know better how to value warlike knowledge he now give mahomet proof of he skill by cast the largest cannon which have ever be fabricate he have already place one of extraordinary size in the new castle of the bosporus which carry across the strait the gun destine for the siege of constantinople far exceed in size this monster and the diameter of its mouth must have be nearly two foot and a half other cannon of great size whose ball of stone weigh one hundred fifty pound be also cast as well as many gun of smaller calibre all these together with a number of ballista and other ancient engine still employ in siege be mount on carriage in order to transport they to constantinople the conveyance of this formidable train of artillery and of the immense quantity of ammunition require for its service be by no mean a trifling operation the first division of the ottoman army move from adrianople in February 1453 in the mean time a numerous corps of pioneer work constantly at the road in order to prepare it for the passage of the long train of artillery and baggage wagon temporary bridge capable of be take to piece be erect by the engineer over every ravine and water-course and the material for every siege advance steadily though slowly to they destination the extreme difficulty of move the monster cannon with its immense ball retard the sultan 's progress and it be the beginning of April before the whole battering-train reach constantinople though the distance from adrianople be barely a hundred mile the division of the army under karadja pacha have already reduce mesembrium and the castle of st stephanus selymbrium alone defend itself and the fortification be so strong that mahomet order it to be closely blockade and leave its fate to be determine by that of the capital on April 6th sultan mahomet ii encamp on the slope of the hill face the quarter of blachern a little beyond the ground occupy by the crusader in 1203 and immediately order the construction of line extend from the head of the port to the shore of the proponti these line be form of a mound of earth and they serve both to restrain the sortie of the besiege and to cover the troops from the fire of the enemy 's artillery and missile the battery be then form the principal be erect against the gate of charsia in the quarter of blachern and against the gate of st romanus near the center of the city wall it be against this last gate that the fire of the monster gun be direct and the chief attack be make the land force of the turk probably amount to about seventy thousand man of all arm and quality but the real strength of the army lay in the corps of janizary then the best infantry in europe and they number do not exceed twelve thousand at the same time twenty thousand cavalry mount on the finest horse of the turkoman breed and harden by long service be ready to fight either on horseback or on foot under the eye of they young sultan the fleet which have be collect along the asiatic coast from the port of the black sea to those of the aegean bring additional supplies of man provision and military store it consist of three hundred twenty vessel of various size and form the greater part be only half-decked coaster and even the largest be far inferior in size to the galley and galease of the greek and italian the fortification of constantinople toward the land side vary so little from a straight line that they afford great facility for attack the defence have be originally construct on a magnificent scale and with great skill accord to the ancient art of war even though they be partly ruin by time and weaken by careless reparation they still offer a formidable obstacle to the imperfect science of the engineer in mahomet 's army two line of wall each flank with its own tower rise one above the other overlook a broad and deep ditch the interval between these wall enable the defender to form in perfect security and facilitate they operation in clear the ditch and retard the preparation for assault the actual appearance of the low wall of constantinople with the ditch more than half fill up give only a incorrect picture of they former state mahomet have make he preparation for the siege with so much skill that he preliminary work advance with unexpected rapidity the numerical superiority of he army and the precaution he have adopt for strengthen he line render the sortie of the garrison useless the ultimate success of the defense depend on the arrival of assistance from abroad but the number of the ottoman fleet seem to render even this hope almost desperate a incident occur that show the immense advantage confer by skill when unite with courage over a apparently irresistible superiority of force in naval warfare four large ship laden with grain and store one of which bear the greek and the other the genoese flag have remain for some time wind-bound at chio and be anxiously expect at constantinople at daybreak these ship be perceive by the turkish watchman steering for constantinople with a strong breeze in they favor the war-galley of the sultan immediately get under way to capture they the sultan himself ride down to the point of tophane to witness a triumph which he consider certain and which he think would reduce he enemy to despair the greek crowd the wall of the city offer up prayer for they friend and tremble for they safety in the desperate struggle that await they the christian have several advantage which they nautical experience enable they to turn to good account the good size of they ship the strength of they construction they weight and they high bulwark be all powerful means of defense when aid by a stiff breeze blow directly in the tooth of they opponent the turk be compel to row they galley against this wind and the heavy sea it raise in vain they attack the christian with reckless valor fight under the eye of they fiery sovereign the skill of they enemy render all they attack abortive in vain one squadron attempt to impede the progress of the christian while another endeavor to run alongside and carry they by board every turkish galley that oppose they progress be crush under the weight of they heavy hull while those that endeavor to board have they oar shiver in the shock and drift helpless far astern the few that succeed for a moment in retain they place alongside be either sink by immense angular block of stone that be drop on they frail timber or be fill with flame and smoke by the greek fire that be pour upon they the rapidity with which the best galley be sink or disabled appal the bravest and at last the turk shrink from close combat on a element where they see that valor without experience be of no avail the christian ship in the mean time hold steadily on they course under all the canvas they mast could carry until they round the point of st demetrius and enter the port where the chain be joyfully lower to admit they the young sultan on see the defeat of he galley lose all command over he temper he could hardly be restrain from urge he horse into the sea and in he frantic passion heap every term of abuse and insult on he naval officer he even talk of order he admiral baltaoghlu to be impale on the spot but the janizary present compel even mahomet to restrain he vengeance this check reveal to mahomet the extent of the danger to which he naval force be expose should either the genoese or venetian send a powerful fleet to the assistance of the emperor constantine this naval discomfiture be also attend by some disaster on shore the monster cannon burst before it have produce any serious impression on the wall its loss however be soon replace but the ottoman army be repulse in a general attack a immense tower of timber mount on many wheel and construct on the model use in siege from the time of the ancient greek and roman be drag up to the edge of the ditch under its cover workman be incessantly employ throw material into the ditch to enable the tower itself to approach the wall while the fire of several gun and the operation of a corps of miner ruin the opposite tower of the city the progress of the besieger induce they to risk a assault in which they be repulse after a hard-fought struggle : and during the follow night john justinianus make a great sortie during which he workman clear the ditch and he soldier fill the tower with combustible material and burn it to the ground its exterior have be protect by a triple covering of buffalo-hide be find to be impervious even to greek fire in order to counteract the effect of these defeat which have depress the courage of the ottoman and raise the spirit of the greek the sultan resolve to adopt measure for place he fleet in security and facilitate the communication between the army before constantinople and the naval camp on the bosporus the venetian have recently transport a number of they galley from the river adige overland to the lake of garda this exploit which have be loudly celebrate at the time suggest to the sultan the idea of transport a number of vessel from the bosporus into the port of constantinople where the smooth water and the command of the shore would secure to he ship the mastery of the upper half of that extensive harbor the distance over which it be necessary to transport the galley be only five mile but a steep hill present a formidable obstacle to the undertaking mahomet nevertheless have witness the transport of he monster cannon over river and hill be persuade that he engineer would find no difficulty in move he ship overland a road be accordingly make and lay with strong plank and wooden rail which be plaster over with tallow it extend from the station occupy by the fleet at dolma baktshe to the summit of the ridge near the cemetery of pera on this inclined plane with the assistance of windlass and numerous yoke of ox the vessel be haul up one after the other to the summit of the hill from whence they descend with difficulty to the point beyond the present arsenal where they be launch into the port under the protection of battery prepare for they defense historian wish to give a dramatic character to they page have attribute marvellous difficulty to this daring exploit it be a well-conceived and well-executed undertaking for a division of the ottoman fleet be convey into the port in a single night where the greek at the dawn of day be amaze at behold the hostile ship safe under the protection of inexpugnable battery to establish a easy and rapid communication between the naval camp on the bosporus and the army before constantinople mahomet order a float bridge to be construct across the port from the point near the old foundry on the side of gala to that near the angle of the city wall near haivan serai the ancient amphitheatre the roadway of this bridge be support on the enormous jar use for store oil and wine number of which be easily collect in the suburb of gala these jar when bind together with they mouth invert in the water form admirable pontoon artillery be mount on this bridge and the galley be bring up to the city wall which be now assail from a quarter hitherto safe from attack the genoese under justinianus on one occasion and the venetian on another be defeat in they attempt to burn the turkish fleet and destroy the bridge the fire of the artillery render the attack of the italian abortive and they failure afford a decisive proof that the defense of the city be become desperate to avoid the admission of they inferiority in force the defeat party throw the blame on one another and they dissension become so violent that the emperor could hardly appease the quarrel during all the labor of the besieger in other quarter the approach be push vigorously forward against the land wall though the activity in other and more novel operation might attract greater attention the industry of those engage in fill up the ditch and the fire of the breach battery never relax though all attempt to cross the ditch at the gate of st romanus be long baffle by the greek and the mining operation at blachern be discover and defeat by johann grant still the superior number and indefatigable perseverance of the ottoman at last fill up the ditch and the fire of they gun ruin the wall a visible change in the state of the fortification encourage the assailant and show the besiege that the enemy be gradually gain a decide advantage at the commencement of the siege the ottoman engineer have display so little knowledge of the mode of use artillery to effect a breach that a hungarian envoy from john hunyady -lrb- 1 -rrb- who visit mahomet 's camp ridicule the idea of they produce any effect on the wall of constantinople this stranger be say to have teach the turk to fire in volley and to cut the wall in rectangular section in order to produce a practicable breach the battery at length effect a practicable breach at the gate of st romanus before issue he final order for the assault mahomet ii summon the emperor to surrender the city and offer he a considerable appanage as a vassal of the porte elsewhere constantine reject the insulting offer and the sultan prepare to take constantinople by storm four day be employ in the ottoman camp make all the arrangement necessary for a simultaneous attack by land and sea along the whole line of the fortification from the modern quarter of phanar to the golden gate the greek and latin within the wall be not less active in they exertion to meet the crisis the latin be sustain by they habit of military discipline and they experience of the chance of war the greek place great confidence in some popular prophecy which foretell the ultimate defeat of the turk they feel a pious conviction that the imperial and orthodox city would never fall into the hand of infidel but the emperor constantine be deceive by no vain hope he know that human prudence and valor could do no more than have be do to retard the progress of the besieger time have be gain but the greek show no disposition to fight for a heretical emperor and no succor arrive from the pope and the western prince constantine could now only hope to prolong the defense for a few hour and when the city fall to bring he own life to a glorious termination by die on the breach on the night before the assault the emperor ride round to all the post occupy by the garrison and encourage the troops to expect victory by he cheerful demeanor he then visit the church of st sophium already desert by the orthodox where with he attendant he partake of the holy sacrament accord to the latin form he return for a short time to the imperial palace and on quit it to take he station at the great breach he be so overcome by the certainty that he should never again behold those present that he turn to the member of he household many of whom have be the companion of he youth and solemnly ask they to pardon every offence he have ever give they tear burst from all present as constantine mount he horse and ride slowly forward to meet he fate the contrast between the city of the christian and the camp of the mahometan be not encouraging within the wall a emperor in the decline of life command a small and disunited force with twenty leader under he order each at the head of a almost independent band of greek genoese venetian or catalan soldier so slight be the tie which bind these various chief together that even when they be prepare for the final assault the emperor be oblige to use all he authority and personal influence to prevent justinianus and the grand duke notara from come to blow justinianus demand to be supply with some additional gun for the defense of the great breach but notara who have the official control over the artillery peremptorily refuse the demand in the turkish camp on the other hand perfect unity prevail and a young ardent and able sovereign concentrated in he hand the most despotic authority over a numerous and well-disciplined army to excite the energy of that army to the highest pitch of enthusiasm the sultan proclaim to he troops that he grant they the whole plunder of constantinople reserve to himself only the public building the day of the battle be regard as a religious festival in the ottoman camp and on the previous night lamp be hang out before every tent and fire be kindle on every eminence in or near the line thousand of lantern be suspend from the flagstaff of the battery and from the mast and yard of the ship and be reflect in the water of the proponti the golden horn and the bosporus the whole ottoman encampment be resplendent with the blaze of this illumination yet a deep silence prevail during the whole night except when the musical cadence of the solemn chant of the call to prayer show the greek the immense number and the strict discipline of the host before the dawn of day on the morning of may 29 1453 the signal be give for the attack column after column march forward and take up its ground before the portion of the wall it be order to assail the galley fit with tower and scaling-platform advance against the fortification of the port protect by the gun on the bridge but the principal attack be direct against the breach at the gate of st romanus where two flanking tower have fall into the ditch and open a passage into the interior of the city the gate of charsia and the quarter of blachern be also assail by choose regiment of janizary in overwhelming number the attack be make with daring courage but for more than two hour every point be successfully defend in the port the italian and greek ship oppose the turkish galley so effectually that the final result appear to favor the besiege but on the land side one column of troops follow the other in a incessant stream the moment a division fall back from the assault new battalion occupy its place the valor of the besiege be for some time successful but they be at last fatigue by they exertion and they scanty number be weaken by wound and death unfortunately justiniani the protostrator or marshal of the army and the ablest officer in the place receive a wound which induce he to retire on board he ship to have it dress until that moment he and the emperor have defend the great breach with advantage but after he retreat sagan pacha observe that the energy of the defender be relax excite the bravest of the janizary to mount to the assault a choose company lead by hasan of ulubad a man of gigantic frame first cross the ruin of the wall and they leader gain the summit of the dilapidated tower which flank the breach the defender head by the emperor constantine make a desperate resistance hasan and many of he follower be slay but the janizary have secure the vantage-ground and fresh troops pour in to they aid they surround the defender of the breach the emperor fall amid a heap of slay and a column of janizary rush into constantinople over he lifeless body about the same time another corps of the ottoman force a entrance into the city at the gate of the circus which have be leave almost without defense for the besiege be not sufficiently numerous to guard the whole line of the fortification and they best troops be draw to the point where the attack be fiercest the corps that force the gate of the circus take the defender of the gate of charsia in the rear and overpower all resistance in the quarter of blachern several gate be now throw open and the army enter constantinople at several point the cry that the enemy have storm the wall precede they march senator priest monk and nun man woman and child all rush to seek safety in st sophium 's a prediction current among the greek flatter they with the vain hope that a angel would descend from heaven and destroy the mahometan in order to reveal the extent of god 's love for the orthodox st sophium 's which for some time they have forsake as a spot profane by the emperor 's attempt at a union of the christian world be again revere as the sanctuary of orthodoxy and be crowd with the flower of the greek nation confident of a miraculous interposition in favor of they national pride and ecclesiastical prejudice the besieger when they first enter the city fear lest they might encounter serious resistance in the narrow street put every soul they encounter to the sword but as soon as they be fully aware of the small number of the garrison and the impossibility of any further opposition they begin to make prisoner at length they reach st sophium 's and rush into that magnificent temple which could with ease contain twenty thousand person they perform deed of plunder and violence not unlike the scene which the crusader have enact in the same spot in 1204 the man woman and child who have seek safety in the building be divide among the soldier as slave without any reference to they rank or respect for they tie of blood and hurry off to the camp or place under the guard of comrade who form a joint alliance for the security of they plunder the ecclesiastical ornament and church plate be poor indeed when compare with the immense riches of the byzantine cathedral in the time of the crusader but whatever be movable be immediately divide among the soldier with such celerity that the mighty temple soon present few trace of have be a christian church while one division of the victorious army be engage in plunder the southern side of the city from the gate of st romanus to the church of st sophium another turn to the port make itself master of the warehouse that be fill with merchandise and surround the greek troops under the grand duke notara the greek be easily subdue and notaras surrender himself a prisoner about midday the turk be in possession of the whole city and mahomet ii enter he new capital at the gate of st romanus ride triumphantly past the body of the emperor constantine which lay conceal among the slay in the breach he have defend the sultan ride straight to the church of st sophium where he give the necessary order for the preservation of all the public building even during the license of the sack the severe education and grave character of the ottoman exert a powerful influence on they conduct and on this occasion there be no example of the wanton destruction and wilful conflagration that have signalize the latin conquest to convince the greek that they orthodox empire be extinct mahomet order a mollah to ascend the bema and address a sermon to the mussulman announce that st sophium be now a mosque set apart for the prayer of the true believer to put a end to all doubt concern the death of the emperor he order constantine 's head to be bring and expose to the people of the capital from whence it be afterward send as a trophy

war of the rose death of richard iii at bosworth ad 1455-1485 david hume historian themselves declare that no part of english history since the norman conquest be so obscure and uncertain as that of the war of the rose all we can distinguish with certainty through the deep cloud which cover that period be a scene of horror and bloodshed savage manners arbitrary execution and treachery dishonorable conduct in all party these brutal aspect of that horrid drama of history run through more than the course of a full generation be depict for the mimic stage by shakespeare in _ henry vi and richard iii _ with a vividness that bring before we the ghastly reality of the historic theater itself and with such realization of the rude force at work as call for all the poet 's refining art to make they representation tolerable to modern spectator but the historian while consciously fail to discover the hidden motive of intrigue and treachery which throughout actuate the party to this fearful struggle of englishman with englishman have nevertheless record for we its main outline and lead episode with sufficient clearness we be enable to see england as she be in that great transition of she making -- in the throe of civil strife again to be endure two century later -- through which she must pass before she could become a land of settled government during the weak reign of henry vi france be deliver from english rule mainly through the heroism of jeanne d'arc in 1450 the common rise against king henry and the house of lancaster to which he belong and declare in favor of the house of york -- these house have already come into serious rivalry for the supreme power the disaster in france strengthen the yorkist and bring they representative richard duke of york to the front with armed force to support he claim in 1452 he march upon london demand the removal of the duke of somerset henry 's chief minister but a conflict be temporarily avert when in 1454 king henry

war which ensue -- the war of the rose begin with the first battle of st alban in 1455 and end with the death of richard iii at bosworth field in 1485 the war be signalize by twelve pitched battle they cost the life of about eighty prince of the blood and during they ravages the ancient nobility of england be almost annihilate yet in these fierce war comparatively little damage be do to the general population or to industry and trade the war derive they name from the fact that the partisan of the house of lancaster take the red rise as they badge and those of york choose the white rise the enemy of the duke of york soon find it in they power to make advantage of he excessive caution henry be so far recover from he distemper as to carry the appearance of exercise the royal power they

immediately proceed to the last extremity the nation be keep some time in suspense the vigor and spirit of queen margaret -lrb- 1 -rrb- support she small power still prove a balance to the great authority of richard which be check by he irresolute temper a parliament which be soon after assemble plainly discover by the contrariety of they proceedings the contrariety of the motive by which they be actuate they grant the yorkist a general indemnity and they restore the protectorship to the duke but at the same time they renew they oath of fealty to henry and fix the continuance of the protectorship to the majority of he son edward it be not find difficult to wrest power from hand so little tenacious as those of the duke of york margaret avail herself of that prince 's absence produce she husband before the house of lord and as he state of health permit he at that time to act he part with some tolerable decency he declare he intention of resume the government and of put a end to richard 's authority the house of lord assent to henry 's proposal and the king be declare to be reinstate even the duke of york acquiesce in this irregular act of the peer and no disturbance

after the battle of st alban and which as it give he the command of the only regular military force maintain by england be of the utmost importance in the present juncture still man of peaceable disposition and among the rest bourchier archbishop of canterbury think it not too late to interpose with they good office in order to prevent that effusion of blood with which the kingdom be threaten

be peaceably accommodate that each party watch only for a opportunity of subvert the other and that much blood must yet be spill ere the nation could be restore to perfect tranquillity or enjoy a settle and establish government even the smallest accident without any form design be sufficient in the present disposition of man 's mind to dissolve the seeming harmony between the party and have

effect of he vigorous measure in assume the crown as well as of he victory at touton by which he have secure it the parliament no longer hesitate between the two family or propose any of those ambiguous decision which could only serve to perpetuate and to inflame the animosity of party they recognize the title of edward by hereditary descent through the family of mortimer and declare that he be king by right from the death of he father who have also the same lawful title and that he be in possession of the crown from the day that he assume the government tender to he by the acclamation of the people they reinstate the king in all the possession which have belong to the crown at the pretended deposition of richard ii but the new establishment seem precarious and uncertain not only from the domestic discontent of the people but from the effort of foreign power loui the eleventh of the name have succeed to he father charle in 1460 and be lead from the obvious motive of national interest to feed the flame of civil discord among such dangerous neighbor by give support to the weaker party but the intriguing and politic genius of this prince be here check by itself : have attempt to subdue the independent spirit of he own vassal he have excite such a opposition at home as prevent he from make all the advantage which the opportunity afford of the dissension among the english he send however a small body to henry 's assistance under varenne seneschal of normandy 1462 who land in northumberland and get possession of the castle of alnwick but as the indefatigable margaret go in person to france where she solicit larger supplies and promise loui to deliver up calais if she family should by he means be restore to the throne of england he be induce to send along with she a body of two thousand man-at-arms which enable she to take the field and to make a inroad into england 1464 though reënforced by a numerous train of adventurer from scotland and by many partisan of the family of lancaster she receive a check at hedgeley moor from lord montacute or montagu brother to the earl of warwick and warden of the east march between scotland and england montagu

he obtain a complete victory over they the duke of somerset the lord roo and hungerford be take in the pursuit and immediately behead by martial law at hexham summary justice be in like manner execute at newcastle on sir humphrey nevil and several other gentleman all those who be spare in the field suffer on the scaffold and the utter extermination of they adversary be now become the plain object of the york party a conduct which receive but too plausible a apology from the precede practice of the lancastrian the fate of the unfortunate royal family after this defeat be singular margaret fly with she son into a forest where she endeavor to conceal herself be beset during the darkness of the night by robber who either ignorant or regardless of she quality despoil she of she ring and jewel and treat she with the utmost indignity the partition of this rich booty raise a quarrel among they and while they attention be thus engage she take the opportunity of make she escape with she son into the thickest of the forest where she wander for some time overspent with hunger and fatigue and sink with terror and affliction while in this wretched condition she see a robber approach with he naked sword and finding that she have no means of escape she suddenly embrace the resolution of trust entirely for protection to he faith and generosity she advance toward he and present to he the young prince call out to he here my friend i commit to you care the safety of you king 's son the man whose humanity and generous spirit have be obscure not entirely lose by he vicious course of life be strike with the singularity of the event be charm with the confidence repose in he and vow not only to abstain from all injury against the princess but to devote himself entirely to she service by he means she dwell some time conceal in the forest and be at last conduct to the sea-coast whence she make she escape into flander she pass thence into she father 's court where she live several year in privacy and retirement she husband be not so fortunate or so dexterous in find the means of escape some of he friend take he under they protection and convey he into lancashire where he remain conceal during a twelvemonth but he be at last detect deliver up to edward and throw into the tower the safety of he person be owe less to the generosity of he enemy than to the contempt which they have entertain of he courage and he understand the imprisonment of henry the expulsion of margaret the execution and confiscation of all the most eminent lancastrian seem to give full security to edward 's government but he amorous temper lead he into a snare which prove fatal to he repose and to the stability of he throne jaqueline of luxemburg duchess of bedford have after she husband 's death so far sacrifice she ambition to love that she espouse in second marriage sir richard woodeville a private gentleman to whom she bear several child and among the rest elizabeth who be remarkable for the grace and beauty of she person as well as for other amiable accomplishment this young lady have marry sir john gray of groby by whom she have child and she husband be slay in the second battle of st alban fight on the side of lancaster and he estate be for that reason confiscate he widow retire to live with she father at he seat of grafton in northamptonshire the king come accidentally to the house after a hunting party in order to pay a visit to the duchess of bedford and as the occasion seem favorable for obtain some grace from this gallant monarch the young widow fling herself at he foot and with many tear entreat he to take pity on she impoverished and distressed child the sight of so much beauty in affliction strongly affect the amorous edward love steal sensibly into he heart under the guise of compassion and she sorrow so become a virtuous matron make he esteem and regard quickly correspond to he affection he raise she from the ground with assurance of favor he find he passion increase every moment by the conversation of the amiable object and he be soon reduce in he turn to the posture and style of a supplicant at the foot of elizabeth but the lady either averse to dishonorable love from a sense of duty or perceive that the impression which she have make be so deep as to give she hope of obtain the highest elevation obstinately refuse to gratify he passion and all the endearment caress and importunity of the young and amiable edward prove fruitless against she rigid and inflexible virtue he passion irritated by opposition and increase by he veneration for such honorable sentiment carry he at last beyond all bound of reason and he offer to share he throne as well as he heart with the woman whose beauty of person and dignity of character seem so well to entitle she to both the marriage be privately celebrate at grafton the secret be carefully keep for some time no one suspect that so libertine a prince could sacrifice so much to a romantic passion and there be in particular strong reason which at that time render this step to the highest degree dangerous and imprudent the king desirous to secure he throne as well by the prospect of issue as by foreign alliance have a little before determine to make application to some neighboring princess and he have cast he eye on bona of savoy sister to the queen of france who he hope would by she marriage insure he the friendship of that power which be alone both able and inclined to give support and assistance to he rival to render the negotiation more successful the earl of warwick have be despatch to pari where the princess then reside he have demand bona in marriage for the king he proposal have be accept the treaty be fully conclude and nothing remain but the ratification of the term agree on and the bring over the princess to england but when the secret of edward 's marriage break out the haughty earl deem himself affront both by be employ in this fruitless negotiation and by be keep a stranger to the king 's intention who have owe everything to he friendship immediately return to england inflamed with rage and indignation the influence of passion over so young a man as edward might have serve as a excuse for he imprudent conduct have he deign to acknowledge he error or have plead he weakness as a apology but he faulty shame or pride prevent he from so much as mention the matter to warwick and that nobleman be allow to depart the court full of the same ill-humor and discontent which he have bring to it every incident now tend to widen the breach between the king and this powerful subject the queen who lose not she influence by marriage be equally solicitous to draw every grace and favor to she own friend and kindred and to exclude those of the earl whom she regard as she mortal enemy the earl of warwick could not suffer with patience the least diminution of that credit which he have long enjoy and which he think he have merit by such important service edward also jealous of that power which have support he be well pleased to raise up rival to the earl of warwick and he justify by this political view he extreme partiality to the queen 's kindred but the nobility of england envy the sudden growth of the woodeville be more inclined to take part with warwick 's discontent a extensive and dangerous combination be insensibly form against edward and he ministry while this cloud be gather at home edward endeavor to secure himself against he factious nobility by enter into foreign alliance but whatever ambitious scheme the king might have build on these alliance they be soon frustrate by intestine commotion which engross all he attention these disorder probably arise not immediately from the intrigue of the earl of warwick but from accident aid by the turbulent spirit of the age by the general humor of discontent which that popular nobleman have instil into the nation and perhaps by some remains of attachment to the house of lancaster the hospital of st leonard 's near york have receive from a ancient grant of king athelstane a right of levy a thrave of corn upon every ploughland in the county the country people complain that the revenue of the hospital be no longer expend for the relief of the poor but be secrete by the manager and employ to they private purpose after long repining at the contribution they refuse payment ecclesiastical and civil censure be issue against they they goods be distrain and they person throw into jail till as they ill-humor daily increase they rise in arm fall upon the officer of the hospital whom they put to the sword and proceed in a body fifteen thousand strong to the gate of york lord montagu who command in those part oppose himself to they progress and have be so fortunate in a skirmish as to seize robert hulderne they leader he order he immediately to be lead to execution accord to the practice of the time the rebel however still continue in arm and be soon head by man of greater distinction -- sir henry nevil son of lord latimer and sir john conier -- they advance southward and begin to appear formidable to the government herbert earl of pembroke be order by edward to march against they at the head of a body of welshman and he be join by five thousand archer under the command of stafford earl of devonshire but a trivial difference about quarter have beget a animosity between these two nobleman the earl of devonshire retire with he archer and leave pembroke alone to encounter the rebel the two army approach each other near banbury 1469 and pembroke have prevail in a skirmish and have take sir john nevil prisoner order he immediately to be put to death without any form of process this execution enrage without terrifying the rebel they attack the welsh army route they put they to the sword without mercy and have seize pembroke they take immediate revenge upon he for the death of they leader the king impute this misfortune to the earl of devonshire who have desert pembroke order he to be execute in a like summary manner soon after there break out another rebellion it arise in lincolnshire and be head by sir robert welle the army of the rebel amount to thirty thousand man the king fight a battle with the rebel defeat they take sir robert welle and sir thoma launde prisoner and order they immediately to be behead edward during these transaction have entertain so little jealousy of the earl of warwick or the duke of clarence that he send they with commission of array to levy force against the rebel but these malecontent as soon as they leave the court raise troops in they own name issue declaration against the government and complain of grievance oppression and bad minister the unexpected defeat of welle disconcert all they measure and they retire northward into lancashire where they expect to be join by lord stanley who have marry the earl of warwick 's sister but as that nobleman refuse all concurrence with they and as lord montagu also remain quiet in yorkshire they be oblige to disband they army and to fly into devonshire where they embark and make sail toward calai the king of france receive warwick with the greatest demonstration of regard and hope to make he he instrument in overturn the government of england and reestablish the house of lancaster no animosity be ever greater than that which have long prevail between that house and the earl of warwick but he present distress and the entreaty of loui make he hearken to term of accommodation and margaret be send for from anger where she then reside a agreement be soon conclude between they it be stipulate that warwick should espouse the cause of henry and endeavor to restore he to liberty and to reestablish he on the throne that the administration of the government during the minority of young edward henry 's son should be intrusted conjointly to the earl of warwick and the duke of clarence that prince edward should marry the lady anne second daughter of that nobleman and that the crown in case of the failure of male issue in that prince should descend to the duke of clarence to the entire exclusion of king edward and he posterity the marriage of prince edward with the lady anne be immediately celebrate in france edward foresee that it would be easy to dissolve a alliance compose of such discordant part for this purpose he send over a lady of great sagacity and address who belong to the train of the duchess of clarence and who under color of attend she mistress be empower to negotiate with the duke and to renew the connection of that prince with he own family she represent to clarence that he have unwarily to he own ruin become the instrument of warwick 's vengeance and have throw himself entirely in the power of he most inveterate enemy that the mortal injury which the one royal family have suffer from the other be now past all forgiveness and no imaginary union of interest could ever suffice to obliterate they that even if the leader be willing to forget past offence the animosity of they adherent would prevent a sincere coalition of party and would in spite of all temporary and verbal agreement preserve a eternal opposition of measure between they and that a prince who desert he own kindred and join the murderer of he father leave himself single without friend without protection and would not when misfortune inevitably fall upon he be so much as entitle to any pity or regard from the rest of mankind clarence be only one-and-twenty year of age and seem to have possess but a slender capacity yet could he easily see the force of these reason and upon the promise of forgiveness from he brother he secretly engage on a favorable opportunity to desert the earl of warwick and abandon the lancastrian party during this negotiation warwick be secretly carry on a correspondence of the same nature with he brother the marquis of montagu who be entirely trust by edward and like motive produce a like resolution in that nobleman the marquis also that he might render the project blow the more deadly and incurable resolve on he side to watch a favorable opportunity for commit he perfidy and still to maintain the appearance of be a zealous adherent to the house of york after these mutual snare be thus carefully lay the decision of the quarrel advanced apace loui prepare a fleet to escort the earl of warwick and grant he a supply of man and money the duke of burgundy on the other hand anxious to support the reign family in england fit out a larger fleet with which he guard the channel edward be not sensible of he danger he make no suitable preparation against the earl of warwick he even say that the duke might spare himself the trouble of guard the sea and that he wish for nothing more than to see warwick set foot on english ground the event soon happen of which edward seem so desirous a storm disperse the duke of burgundy 's navy and leave the sea open to warwick that nobleman seize the opportunity and set sail quickly land at dartmouth with the duke of clarence the earl of oxford and pembroke and a small body of troops while the king be in the north engage in suppress a insurrection which have be raise by lord fitz-hugh brother-in-law to warwick the scene which ensue resemble more the fiction of a poem or romance than a event in true history the prodigious popularity of warwick the zeal of the lancastrian party the spirit of discontent with which many be infected and the general instability of the english nation occasion by the late frequent revolution draw such multitude to he standard that in a very few day he army amount to sixty thousand man and be continually increase edward hasten southward to encounter he and the two army approach each other near nottingham where a decisive action be every hour expect the rapidity of warwick 's progress have incapacitate the duke of clarence from execute he plan of treachery and the marquis of montagu have here the opportunity of strike the first blow he communicate the design to he adherent who promise he they concurrence they take to arm in the night-time and hasten with loud acclamation to edward 's quarter the king be alarm at the noise and start from bed hear the cry of war usually employ by the lancastrian party lord hasting he chamberlain inform he of the danger and urge he to make he escape by speedy flight from a army where he have so many conceal enemy and where few seem zealously attach to he service he have just time to get on horseback and to hurry with a small retinue to lynne in norfolk where he luckily find some ship ready on board of which he instantly embark the earl of warwick in eleven day after he first landing be left entire master of the kingdom but edward 's danger do not end with he embarkation the easterling or hanse town be then at war both with france and england and some ship of these people hover on the english coast espy the king 's vessel and give chase to they nor be it without extreme difficulty that he make he escape into the port of alkmaar in holland immediately after edward 's flight have leave the kingdom at warwick 's disposal that nobleman hasten to london and take henry from he confinement in the tower into which he himself have be the chief cause of throw he he proclaim he king with great solemnity a parliament be summon in the name of that prince to meet at westminster the treaty with margaret be here fully execute henry be recognize as lawful king but he incapacity for government be avow the regency be intrust to warwick and clarence till the majority of prince edward and in default of that prince 's issue clarence be declare successor to the crown the rule party be more spare in they execution than be usual after any revolution during those violent time the only victim of distinction be john tibetot earl of worcester all the other considerable yorkist either flee beyond sea or take shelter in sanctuary where the ecclesiastical privilege afford they protection in london alone it be compute that no less than two thousand person save themselves in this manner and among the rest edward 's queen who be there deliver of a son call by he father 's name queen margaret have not yet appear in england but on receive intelligence of warwick 's success be prepare with prince edward for she journey all the banish lancastrian flock to she and among the rest the duke of somerset son of the duke behead after the battle of hexham this nobleman who have long be regard as the head of the party have flee into the low country on the discomfiture of he friend and as he conceal he name and quality he have there languish in extreme indigence but both somerset and margaret be detain by contrary wind from reach england till a new revolution in that kingdom no less sudden and surprising than the former throw they into greater misery than that from which they have just emerge the duke of burgundy equip four large vessel in the name of some private merchant at terveer in zealand and cause fourteen ship to be secretly hire from the easterling he deliver this small squadron to edward who receive also a sum of money from the duke immediately set sail for england 1471 edward impatient to take revenge on he enemy and to recover he lose authority make a attempt to land with he force which exceed not two thousand man on the coast of norfolk but be there repulse he sail northward and disembark at ravenspur in yorkshire finding that the new magistrate who have be appoint by the earl of warwick keep the people everywhere from join he he pretend and even make oath that he come not to challenge the crown but only the inheritance of the house of york which of right belong to he and that he do not intend to disturb the peace of the kingdom he partisan every moment flock to he standard he be admit into the city of york and he be soon in such a situation as give he hope of succeed in all he claim and pretension warwick assemble a army at leicester with a intention of meeting and of give battle to the enemy but edward by take another road pass he unmolested and present himself before the gate of london edward 's entrance into london make he master not only of that rich and powerful city but also of the person of henry who destine to be the perpetual sport of fortune thus fall again into the hand of he enemy it do not appear that warwick during he short administration which have continue only six month have be guilty of any unpopular act or have anywise deserve to lose that general favor with which he have so lately overwhelmed edward but this prince who be formerly on the defensive be now the aggressor everyone who have be disappoint in the hope which he have entertain from warwick 's elevation either become a cool friend or a open enemy to that nobleman and each malecontent from whatever cause prove a accession to edward 's army the king therefore find himself in a condition to face the earl of warwick who be reënforced by he son-in-law the duke of clarence and he brother the marquis of montagu take post at barnet in the neighborhood of london warwick be now too far advance to retreat and as he reject with disdain all term of peace offer he by edward and clarence he be oblige to hazard a general engagement the battle be fight with obstinacy on both side the two army in imitation of they leader display uncommon valor and the victory remain long undecided between they but a accident throw the balance to the side of the yorkist edward 's cognizance be a sun that of warwick a star with ray and the mistiness of the morning render it difficult to distinguish they the earl of oxford who fight on the side of the lancastrian be by mistake attack by he friend and chase off the field of battle warwick contrary to he more usual practice engage that day on foot resolve to show he army that he mean to share every fortune with they and he be slay in the thickest of the engagement and as edward have issue order not to give any quarter a great and undistinguished slaughter be make in the pursuit there fall about one thousand five hundred on the side of the victor the same day on which this decisive battle be fight queen margaret and she son now about eighteen year of age and a young prince of great hope land at weymouth support by a small body of french force when this princess receive intelligence of she husband 's captivity and of the defeat and death of the earl of warwick she courage which have support she under so many disastrous event here quite leave she and she immediately foresee all the dismal consequence of this calamity at first she take sanctuary in the abbey of beaulieu but be encourage by man of rank who exhort she still to hope for success she resume she former spirit and determine to defend to the utmost the ruin of she fall fortune she advance through the county of devon somerset and gloucester increase she army on each day 's march but be at last overtaken by the rapid and expeditious edward at tewkesbury on the bank of the severn the lancastrian be here totally defeat the earl of devonshire and lord wenlock be kill in the field the duke of somerset and about twenty other person of distinction have take shelter in a church be surround drag out and immediately behead about three thousand of they side fall in battle and the army be entirely disperse queen margaret and she son be take prisoner and bring to the king who ask the prince after a insulting manner how he dare to invade he dominion the young prince more mindful of he high birth than of he present fortune reply that he come thither to claim he just inheritance the ungenerous edward insensible to pity strike he on the face with he gauntlet and the duke of clarence and gloucester lord hasting and sir thoma gray take the blow as a signal for further violence hurry the prince into the next apartment and there despatch he with they dagger margaret be throw into the tower king henry expire in that confinement a few day after the battle of tewkesbury but whether he die a natural or violent death be uncertain it be pretended and be generally believe that the duke of gloucester kill he with he own hand but the universal odium which that prince have incur perhaps incline the nation to aggravate he crime without any sufficient authority all the hope of the house of lancaster seem now to be utterly extinguish every legitimate prince of that family be dead almost every great leader of the party have perish in battle or on the scaffold the earl of pembroke who be levying force in wale disband he army when he receive intelligence of the battle of tewkesbury and he flee into brittany with he nephew the young earl of richmond the bastard of falconberg who have levy some force and have advance to london during edward 's absence be repulse he man desert he he be take prisoner and immediately execute and peace be now fully restore to the nation a parliament be summon which ratify as usual all the act of the victor and recognize he legal authority this prince who have be so firm and active and intrepid during the course of adversity be still unable to resist the allurement of a prosperous fortune and he devote himself as before to pleasure and amusement after he become entirely master of he kingdom but while he be thus indulge himself in pleasure he be rouse from he lethargy by a prospect of foreign conquest he pass over to calais 1475 with a army of one thousand five hundred man-at-arms and fifteen thousand archer attend by all the chief nobility of england who prognosticate future success from the past be eager to appear on this great theater of honor but all they sanguine hope be damp when they find on enter the french territory that neither do the constable open he gate to they nor the duke of burgundy bring they the smallest assistance that prince transport by he ardent temper have carry all he army to a great distance and have employ they in war on the frontier of germany and against the duke of lorraine and though he come in person to edward and endeavor to apologize for this breach of treaty there be no prospect that they would be able this campaign to make a conjunction with the english this circumstance give great disgust to the king and inclined he to hearken to those advance which loui continually make he for a accommodation loui be sensible that the warlike genius of the people would soon render they excellent soldier and far from despise they for they present want of experience he employ all he art to detach they from the alliance of burgundy when edward send he a herald to claim the crown of france and to carry he a defiance in case of refusal so far from answer to this bravado in like haughty term he reply with great temper and even make the herald a considerable present he take afterward a opportunity of send a herald to the english camp and have give he direction to apply to lord stanley and howard who he hear be friend to peace he desire the good office of these nobleman in promote a accommodation with they master as edward be now fall into like disposition a truce be soon conclude on term more advantageous than honorable to loui he stipulate to pay edward immediately seventy-five thousand crown on condition that he should withdraw he army from france and promise to pay he fifty thousand crown a year during they joint life in order to ratify this treaty the two monarch agree to have a personal interview edward and loui confer privately together and have confirm they friendship and interchange many mutual civility they soon after part as the two army after the conclusion of the truce remain some time in the neighborhood of each other the english be not only admit freely into amien where loui reside but have also they charge defray and have wine and victuals furnish they in every inn without any payment be demand this treaty do very little honor to either of these monarch it discover the imprudence of edward who have take he measure so ill with he ally as to be oblige after such a expensive armament to return without make any acquisition adequate to it it show the want of dignity in loui who rather than run the hazard of a battle agree to subject he kingdom to a tribunal and thus acknowledge the superiority of a neighbor prince possess of less power and territory than himself but loui think that all the advantage of the treaty be on he side and that he have overreach edward by send he out of france on such easy term the most honorable part of loui ' treaty with edward be the stipulation for the liberty of queen margaret who though after the death of she husband and son she could no longer be formidable to government be still detain in custody by edward loui pay fifty thousand crown for she ransom and that princess who have be so active on the stage of the world and who have experience such a variety of fortune pass the remainder of she day in tranquillity and privacy till the year 1482 when she die a admirable princess but more illustrious by she undaunted spirit in adversity than by she moderation in prosperity she seem neither to have enjoy the virtue nor be subject to the weakness of she sex and be as much taint with the ferocity as endowed with the courage of that barbarous age in which she live the duke of clarence by all he service in desert warwick have never be able to regain the king 's friendship which he have forfeit by he former confederacy with that nobleman he be still regard at court as a man of a dangerous and a fickle character and the imprudent openness and violence of he temper though they render he much less dangerous tend extremely to multiply he enemy and to incense they against he among other he have have the misfortune to give displeasure to the queen herself as well as to he brother the duke of gloucester a prince of the deepest policy of the most unrelenting ambition and the least scrupulous in the means which he employ for the attainment of he end a combination between these potent adversary be secretly form against clarence it be determine to begin by attack he friend he be alarm when he find act of tyranny exercise on all around he but instead of secure he own life against the present danger by silence and reserve he be open and loud in justify the innocence of he friend and in exclaim against the iniquity of they prosecutor the king highly offend with he freedom or use that pretence against he commit he to the tower 1478 summon a parliament and try he for he life clarence be pronounced guilty by the peer the house of common be no less slavish and unjust they both petition for the execution of the duke and afterward pass a bill of attainder against he the only favor which the king grant he after he condemnation be to leave he the choice of he death and he be privately drown in a butt of malmsey in the tower -- a whimsical choice which imply that he have a extraordinary passion for that liquor the duke leave two child by the elder daughter of the earl of warwick : a son create a earl by he grandfather 's title and a daughter afterward countess of salisbury both this prince and princess be also unfortunate in they end and die violent death -- a fate which for many year attend almost all the descendant of the royal blood of england there prevail a report that a chief source of the violent prosecution of the duke of clarence whose name be george be a current prophecy that the king 's son should be murder by one the initial letter of whose name be g it be not impossible but in those ignorant time such a silly reason might have some influence but it be more probable that the whole story be the invention of a subsequent period and found on the murder of these child by the duke of gloucester all the glory of edward 's reign terminate with the civil war where he laurel too be extremely sully with blood violence and cruelty he spirit seem afterward to have be sink in indolence and pleasure or he measure be frustrate by imprudence and the want of foresight while he be make preparation for a french war he be seize with a distemper of which he expire 1483 in the forty-second year of he age and the twenty-third of he reign during the latter year of edward iv the nation have in a great measure forget the bloody feud between the two rose and peaceably acquiesce in the established government be agitate only by some court intrigue which be restrain by the authority of the king seem nowise to endanger the public tranquillity but edward know that though he himself have be able to overawe rival faction many disorder might arise from they contest during the minority of he son and he therefore take care in he last illness to summon together several of the leader on both side and by compose they ancient quarrel to provide as far as possible for the future tranquillity of the government after express he intention that he brother the duke of gloucester then absent in the north should be intrust with the regency he recommend to they peace and unanimity during the tender year of he son and engage they to embrace each other with all the appearance of the most cordial reconciliation but this temporary or feigned agreement last no longer than the king 's life he have no sooner expire than the jealousy of the party break out afresh and each of they apply by separate message to the duke of gloucester and endeavor to acquire he favor and friendship this prince during he brother 's reign have endeavor to live on good term with both party and he high birth he extensive ability and he great service have enable he to support himself without fall into a dependence on either but the new situation of affair when the supreme power be devolve upon he immediately change he measure and he secretly determine to preserve no longer that neutrality which he have hitherto maintain he exorbitant ambition unrestrained by any principle either of justice or humanity make he carry he view to the possession of the crown itself and as this object could not be attain without the ruin of the queen and she family he fall without hesitation into concert with the opposite party but be sensible that the most profound dissimulation be requisite for effect he criminal purpose he redouble he profession of zeal and attachment to that princess and he gain such credit with she as to influence she conduct in a point which as it be of the utmost importance be violently dispute between the opposite faction the young king at the time of he father 's death reside in the castle of ludlow on the border of wale whither he have be send that the influence of he presence might overawe the welsh and restore the tranquillity of that country which have be disturb by some late commotion the duke of gloucester be the nearest male of the royal family capable of exercise the government seem entitle by the custom of the realm to the office of protector and the council not wait for the consent of parliament make no scruple of invest he with that high dignity the general prejudice entertain by the nobility against the queen and she kindred occasion this precipitation and irregularity and no one foresee any danger to the succession much less to the life of the young prince from a measure so obvious and so natural besides that the duke have hitherto be able to cover by the most profound dissimulation he fierce and savage nature the numerous issue of edward together with the two child of clarence seem to be a eternal obstacle to he ambition and it appear equally impracticable for he to destroy so many person possess of a preferable title and imprudent to exclude they but a man who have abandon all principle of honor and humanity be soon carry by he predominant passion beyond the reach of fear or precaution and gloucester have so far succeed in he view no longer hesitate in remove the other obstruction which lay between he and the throne the death of the earl of river -lrb- 2 -rrb- and of other prisoner detain in pomfret be first determine and he easily obtain the consent of the duke of buckingham as well as of lord hasting to this violent and sanguinary measure order be accordingly issue to sir richard ratcliffe a proper instrument in the hand of this tyrant to cut off the head of the prisoner the protector then assail the fidelity of buckingham by all the argument capable of sway a vicious mind and he easily obtain from he a promise of support he in all he enterprise the duke of gloucester know the importance of gain lord hasting sound at a distance he sentiment but find he impregnable in he allegiance and fidelity to the child of edward who have ever honor he with he friendship he see therefore that there be no longer any measure to be keep with he and he determine to ruin utterly the man whom he despair of engage to concur in he usurpation on the very day when river gray and vaughan be execute or rather murder at pomfret by the advice of hasting the protector summon a council in the tower whither that nobleman suspect no design against he repair without hesitation the duke of gloucester be capable of commit the most bloody and treacherous murder with the utmost coolness and indifference on take he place at the council table he appear in the easiest and most jovial humor imaginable he seem to indulge himself in familiar conversation with the councillor before they should enter on business and have pay some compliment to morton bishop of ely on the good and early strawberry which he raise in he garden at holborn he beg the favor of have a dish of they which that prelate immediately despatch a servant to bring to he the protector leave the council as if call away by some other business but soon after return with a angry and inflamed countenance he ask they what punishment those deserve that have plot against _ he _ life who be so nearly related to the king and be intrust with the administration of government hasting reply that they merit the punishment of traitor these traitor cry the protector be the sorceress my brother 's wife and jane shore he mistress with other they associate see to what a condition they have reduce I by they incantation and witchcraft upon which he lay bare he arm all shrivel and decayed but the councillor who know that this infirmity have attend he from he birth look on each other with amazement and above all lord hasting who as he have since edward 's death engage in a intrigue with jane shore be naturally anxious concern the issue of these extraordinary proceedings certainly my lord say he if they be guilty of these crime they deserve the severest punishment and do you reply to I exclaim the protector with you _ if _ and you _ and _ you be the chief abettor of that witch shore you be yourself a traitor and i swear by st paul that i will not dine before you head be bring I he strike the table with he hand arm man rush in at the signal the councillor be throw into the utmost consternation and one of the guard as if by accident or mistake aim a blow with a pole-axe at lord stanley who aware of the danger slunk under the table and though he save he life he receive a severe wound in the protector 's presence hasting be seize and instantly behead on a timber-log which lay in the court of the tower lord stanley the archbishop of york the bishop of ely and other councillor be commit prisoner in different chamber of the tower these act of violence exercise against the nearest connection of the late king prognosticate the severest fate to he defenceless child and after the murder of hasting the protector no longer make a secret of he intention to usurp the crown the licentious life of edward afford a pretence for declare he marriage with the queen invalid and all he posterity illegitimate it be also maintain that the act of attainder pass against the duke of clarence have virtually incapacitate he child from succeed to the crown and these two family be set aside the protector remain the only true and legitimate heir of the house of york the protector resolve to make use of another plea still more shameful and scandalous he partisan be teach to maintain that both edward iv and the duke of clarence be illegitimate and that the duke of gloucester alone appear to be the true offspring of the duke of york in a few day the duke of buckingham go to baynard 's castle where the protector then reside to make he a tender of the crown richard refuse to appear and pretend to be apprehensive for he personal safety a circumstance take notice of by buckingham who observe that the prince be ignorant of the whole design at last he be persuade to step forth but he still keep at some distance and he ask the meaning of the intrusion and importunity buckingham tell he that the nation be resolve to have he for king the protector declare he purpose of maintain he loyalty to the present sovereign he be tell that the people have determine to have another prince and if he reject they unanimous voice they must look out for one who would be more compliant this argument be too powerful to be resist he be prevail on to accept of the crown and he thenceforth act as legitimate and rightful sovereign this ridiculous farce be soon after follow by a scene truly tragical -- the murder of the two young prince richard give order to sir robert brakenbury constable of the tower to put he nephew to death but this gentleman who have sentiment of honor refuse to have any hand in the infamous office the tyrant then send for sir jame tyrrel who promise obedience and he order brakenbury to resign to this gentleman the key and government of the tower for one night tyrrel choose three associate slater dighton and forest come in the night-time to the door of the chamber where the prince be lodge and send in the assassin he bid they execute they commission while he himself stay without they find the young prince in bed and fall into a profound sleep after suffocate they with the bolster and pillow they show they naked body to tyrrel who order they to be bury at the foot of the stair deep in the ground under a heap of stone 1483 these circumstance be all confess by the actor in the follow reign they be never punish for the crime probably because henry whose maxim of government be extremely arbitrary desire to establish it as a principle that the command of the reign sovereign ought to justify every enormity in those who pay obedience to they but there be one circumstance not so easy to be account for : it be pretend that richard displeased with the indecent manner of bury he nephew whom he have murder give he chaplain order to dig up the body and to inter they in consecrate ground and as the man die soon after the place of they burial remain unknown and the body could never be find by any search which henry could make for they yet in the reign of charle ii when there be occasion to remove some stone and to dig in the very spot which be mention as the place of they first interment the bone of two person be there find which by they size exactly correspond to the age of edward and he brother they be conclude with certainty to be the remains of those prince and be inter under a marble monument by order of king charle the first act of richard 's administration be to bestow reward on those who have assist he in usurp the crown and to gain by favor those who he think be best able to support he future government but the person who both from the greatness of he service and the power and splendor of he family be best entitle to favor under the new government be the duke of buckingham and richard seem determine to spare no pain or bounty in secure he to he interest but it be impossible that friendship could long remain inviolate between two man of such corrupt mind as richard and the duke of buckingham the duke soon after richard 's accession begin to form a conspiracy against the government and attempt to overthrow that usurpation which he himself have so zealously contribute to establish never be there in any country a usurpation more flagrant than that of richard or more repugnant to every principle of justice and public interest to endure such a bloody usurper seem to draw disgrace upon the nation and to be attend with immediate danger to every individual who be distinguish by birth merit or service such be become the general voice of the people all party be unite in the same sentiment and the lancastrian so long oppressed and of late so much discredited feel they blast hope again revive and anxiously expect the consequence of these extraordinary event the duke of buckingham whose family have be devote to that interest and who by he mother a daughter of edmund duke of somerset be ally to the house of lancaster be easily induce to espouse the cause of this party and to endeavor the restore of it to its ancient superiority morton bishop of ely a zealous lancastrian whom the king have imprison and have afterward commit to the custody of buckingham encourage these sentiment and by he exhortation the duke cast he eye toward the young earl of richmond as the only person who could free the nation from the tyranny of the present usurper henry earl of richmond be at this time detain in a kind of honorable custody by the duke of brittany and he descent which seem to give he some pretension to the crown have be a great object of jealousy both in the late and in the present reign symptom of continued jealousy in the reign family of england seem to give some authority to henry 's pretension and make he the object of general favor and compassion on account of danger and persecution to which he be expose the universal detestation of richard 's conduct turn still more the attention of the nation toward henry and as all the descendant of the house of york be either woman or minor he seem to be the only person from whom the nation could expect the expulsion of the odious and bloody tyrant but notwithstanding these circumstance which be so favorable to he buckingham and the bishop of ely well know that there would still lie many obstacle in he way to the throne it be therefore suggest by morton and readily assent to by the duke that the only means of overturn the present usurpation be to unite the opposite faction by contract a marriage between the earl of richmond and the princess elizabeth eldest daughter of king edward and thereby blend together the opposite pretension of they family the plan be lay upon the solid foundation of good sense and sound policy it be secretly communicate to the principal person of both party in all the county of england and a wonderful alacrity appear in every order of man to forward its success and completion but it be impossible that so extensive a conspiracy could be conduct in so secret a manner as entirely to escape the jealous and vigilant eye of richard and he soon receive intelligence that he enemy head by the duke of buckingham be form some design against he authority he immediately put himself in a posture of defense by levy troops in the north and he summon the duke to appear at court in such term as seem to promise he a renewal of they former amity but that nobleman well acquaint with the barbarity and treachery of richard reply only by take arm in wale and give the signal to he accomplice for a general insurrection in all part of england but at that very time there happen to fall such heavy rain so incessant and continue as exceed any know in the memory of man and the severn with the other river in that neighborhood swell to a height which render they impassable and prevent buckingham from march into the heart of england to join he associate the welshman partly move by superstition at this extraordinary event partly distressed by famine in they camp fall off from he and buckingham finding himself desert by he follower put on a disguise and take shelter in the house of banister a old servant of he family but be detect in he retreat he be bring to the king at salisbury and be instantly execute accord to the summary method practice in that age the other conspirator who take arm in four different place at exeter at salisbury at newbury and at maidstone hearing of the duke of buckingham 's misfortune despair of success and immediately disperse themselves the king everywhere triumphant and fortify by this unsuccessful attempt to dethrone he venture at last to summon a parliament -- a measure which he crime and flagrant usurpation have induce he hitherto to decline he enemy be now at he foot the parliament have no choice leave but to recognize he authority and acknowledge he right to the crown he only son edward then a youth of twelve year of age be create prince of wale sensible that the only circumstance which could give he security be to gain the confidence of the yorkist richard pay court to the queen dowager with such art and address make such earnest protestation of he sincere good-will and friendship that this princess venture to put herself and she daughter into the hand of the tyrant he now think it in he power to remove the chief peril which threaten he government the earl of richmond he know could never be formidable but from he project marriage with the princess elizabeth the true heir of the crown and he therefore intend to espouse himself this princess and thus to unite in he own family they contend title he flatter himself that the english nation see all danger remove of a dispute succession would then acquiesce under the dominion of a prince who be of mature year of great ability and of a genius qualify for government and that they would forgive he all the crime which he have commit in pave he way to the throne but the crime of richard be so horrid and so shocking to humanity that every person of probity and honor be earnest to prevent the sceptre from be any longer polluted by that bloody and faithless hand which hold it all the exile flock to the earl of richmond in brittany and exhort he to hasten he attempt for a new invasion and to prevent the marriage of the princess elizabeth which must prove fatal to all he hope the earl set sail from harfleur in normandy with a small army of about two thousand man and after a navigation of six day he arrive at milford haven in wale where he land without opposition he direct he course to that part of the kingdom in hope that the welsh who regard he as they countryman and who have be already prepossess in favor of he cause by means of the duke of buckingham would join he standard and enable he to make head against the established government richard who know not in what quarter he might expect the invader have take post at nottingham in the center of the kingdom and have give commission to different person in the several county whom he empower to oppose he enemy he purpose in person to fly on the first alarm to the place expose to danger henry advance toward shrewsbury receive every day some reënforcement from he partisan the two rival at last approach each other at bosworth near leicester henry at the head of six thousand man richard with a army of above double the number and a decisive action be every hour expect between they stanley who command above seven thousand man take care to post himself at atherstone not far from the hostile camp and he make such a disposition as enable he on occasion to join either party the van of richmond 's army consist of archer be command by the earl of oxford sir gilbert talbot lead the right wing sir john savage the leave the earl himself accompany by he uncle the earl of pembroke place himself in the main body richard also take post in _ he _ main body and intrust the command of he van to the duke of norfolk as he wing be never engage we have not learn the name of the several commander soon after the battle begin lord stanley whose conduct in this whole affair discover great precaution and ability appear in the field and declare for the earl of richmond this measure which be unexpected to the man though not to they leader have a proportional effect on both army : it inspire unusual courage into henry 's soldier it throw richard 's into dismay and confusion the intrepid tyrant sensible of he desperate situation cast he eye around the field and descry he rival at no great distance he drive against he with fury in hope that either henry 's death or he own would decide the victory between they he kill with he own hand sir william brandon standard-bearer to the earl he dismount sir john cheyney he be now within reach of richmond himself who decline not the combat when sir william stanley -lrb- 3 -rrb- break in with he troops surround richard who fight bravely to the last moment be overwhelm by number and perish by a fate too mild and honorable for he multiply and detestable enormity he man everywhere seek safety by flight there fall in this battle about four thousand of the vanquish the loss be inconsiderable on the side of the victor sir william catesby a great instrument of richard 's crime be take and soon after behead with some other at leicester the body of richard be find in the field cover with dead enemy and all besmear with blood it be throw carelessly across a horse be carry to leicester amid the shout of the insulting spectator and be inter in the gray friar ' church of that place the historian who favor richard -- for even this tyrant have meet with partisan among the later writer -- maintain that he be well qualify for government have he legally obtain it and that he commit no crime but such as be necessary to procure he possession of the crown but this be a poor apology when it be confess that he be ready to commit the most horrid crime which appear necessary for that purpose and it be certain that all he courage and capacity -- quality in which he really seem not to have be deficient -- would never have make compensation to the people for the danger of the precedent and for the contagious example of vice and murder exalt upon the throne this prince be of a small stature hump-backed and

independent and the throne supreme be the lead feature of he policy he pursue he plan with undeviating consistency but that policy be not to be accomplish by open and responsible act the whole character of ivan be tinge with the duplicity of the churchman who hold a high place in he council he proceedings be neither direct nor at first apparently conducive to the interest of the empire but the great cause be secretly advance against all impediment while he forbear to risk he advantage he leave a opportunity for disunion among he enemy by which he be certain to gain in the end he never commit himself to a position of the security of which he be not sure and he carry this spirit of caution to such a extremity that many of the early year of he reign present a succession of timid and vacillate movement that more nearly resemble the subterfuge of a coward than the crafty artifice of a despot the object of which he never lose sight be to free himself from enemy abroad and to convert the princedom at home into a autocracy so extensive a design could not have be effect by mere force of arm for he have so many domestic and foreign foe to meet at once and so many point of attack and defense to cover that it be impossible to conduct so grand a project by military means alone that which he could not effect therefore by the sword he endeavor to perform by diplomatic intrigue and thus between the occasional victory of he army and the still more powerful influence of he subtle policy he reduce he foe and raise himself to a eminence to which none of he most ambitious predecessor have aspire the power against whom he have to wage this double war of arm and diplomacy be the tartar and lithuanian beyond the frontier and the independent republic of novgorod vyatka and pskof and the prince of the yet unsettled appanage within the means he have at he command be fully sufficient to have enable he to subdue those prince of the blood who exhibit faint sign of discontent in they appanage and who could have be easily reach through the widely diffused agency of the boyar but the obstinate republic of the north be more difficult of access they stand boldly upon they independence and every attempt to reduce they be follow by as fierce a resistance and by such a lavish outlay of the wealth which they commercial advantage have enable they to amass that the task be one of extraordinary difficulty kazan the first and greatest of the tartar city too claim a sovereignty over the republic which ivan be afraid to contest lest that which be but a vague and empty claim might end in confirm authority it be better to permit the insolent republican to maintain they entire freedom than to hazard by indiscretion they transferrence to the hand of those tartar who be loosen from the parent stock he first act therefore be to acknowledge directly or indirectly accord to the nature of they different tenure the rights of all he foe within and without he appear to admit the justice of thing as he find they betray he foreign enemy into a confidential reliance upon he acquiescence in they exaction and even yield without a murmur to a abuse of those pretension to which he affect to submit but which he be secretly resolve to annihilate this plausible conformity procure he time to prepare and mature he design and so insidiously do he pursue he purpose that he extend that time by a servility which nearly forfeit the attachment of the people the immediate object of consideration be obviously the golden horde because all the prince and republic and even the pole and lithuanian be interested in any movement that be calculate to embarrass the common enemy ivan 's policy be to unite as many of he enemy as he could against a single one and finally to subdue they all by the aid of each other have he venture upon any less certain course he must have risk a similar combination against himself he begin by withhold the ordinary tribute from the khan but without exhibit any symptom of inallegiance he merely evade the tax while he acknowledge the right and he dissimulation succeed in blind the tartar who still believe that he hold the grand prince as a tributary although he do not receive he tribute the khan completely deceive not only permit this recusancy to escape with impunity but be further prevail upon to withdraw the tartar resident and they retinue and the tartar merchant who dwell in moscow and who infested with the haughty bearing of master even the avenue of the kremlin this latter concession be purchase by bribery for ivan condescend to buy the interference of a tartar princess so slavish and degrading be he outward seem that he wife a noble and spirited lady the daughter of the emperor of byzantium could with difficulty prevail upon he to forego the humiliating usage which have hitherto attend the reception of the mongol envoy it have be customary on the part of the grand prince to go forward to meet the tartar minister to spread a carpet of fur under he horse 's foot to hear the khan 's letter read upon they knee to present to the envoy a cup of koumiss and to lick from the mane of the horse the drop which have fall from the lip of the negotiator : and these disagreeable custom ivan would have comply with but for the successful remonstrance of the princess kazan present the most alluring point of actual attack the horde that have establish that city subsist by predatory excursion and even the other band of the barbarian be not unwilling to witness the descent of the russian upon one of they own tribe that have acquire so much power the project be favor by so many circumstance that although he policy be evidently at this period to preserve peace as long as he could he be tempt to make a general levy and to assemble the whole flower of the population for the purpose of drive out of he dominion the bold invader who have intrench themselves within the wall of a fortified town this be about 1468 at that very time the army of the golden horde inspire by some sudden impulse be advance into russium it appear however that the multitude assemble by ivan be so numerous that the khan 's troops retire upon the mere rumor of they approach so that the display of he resource have all the effect he desire and he win a signal victory without strike a blow the old russian annalist dwell with some pomp of word upon this bloodless triumph and in the true vein of hyperbole say that the russian army shone like the wave of the sea illuminate by the sunbeam we take the expression for all it be worth when we estimate the force as have be more numerous than that of the tartar it do not appear that ivan be yet prepare even with this great armament to risk he future object by any hostile collision so long as such a extremity could be avert by intrigue for in the following year when the anticipate march against kazan be at last commence he suddenly pause in the midst of he course although the result be almost certain be it of much consequence it would not be easy to decide the cause of this strange and abrupt proceeding but it be evident that the soldiery be resolve not to return home without spoil they rush onward to the city and even the general who be instruct by ivan to countermand the attack in vain attempt to restrain they with a leader of they own choose they fall upon kazan and utterly route the inhabitant the grand prince perceive that the enemy be powerless now no longer hesitate but engage all the prince in he service and throw he own guard into the rank he despatch he colossal force to reduce the already dismember hold of the tartar of kazan the event be a complete victory but ivan remain safe at moscow to watch the issue of a undertaking which he could not reasonably have fear the subjugation of kazan leave the field clear for he design upon the three domestic republic vyatka insolent in its own strength declare itself neutral between moscow and kazan and on the fall of the latter city novgorod apprehensive that ivan would turn he arm immediately against she call upon the people of pskof for aid express she determination to march at once against the grand prince in order to anticipate and avert he intention the novgorodian be the more determine upon this bold measure by the personal pusillanimity which ivan betray in a war where the advantage lay entirely at he own side they calculate upon the terror they should inspire and judge that if they could not succeed in vanquish the grand prince they should at all event be enable to secure they own term marpha a rich and influential woman the widow of a _ posadnik _ and who be enamoured of a lithuanian chief conceive the romantic design of bestow she country as a marriage dower upon she lover exert all she power to kindle the enthusiasm and assist the project of the citizen she hospitality be unbounded she throw open she palace to the people lavish she wealth among they in sumptuous entertainment and exhibition and cause the _ vetchoous kolokol _ -lrb- assembling-bell -rrb- which summon the popular meeting to the market-place to be ring as the signal of these orgy of licentiousness the great bell in novgorod be the type of the republican independence of the citizen and represent the excess into which they be not unwilling to plunge whenever it be necessary to testify they sense of that wild liberty which they have establish among themselves it be toll on all occasion of a public nature and the people gather in multitude at the well-known call if any individual be accuse of a crime against the republic or of any offence against the law the judge appear at the sound of the bell to hold a summary court of justice and the citizen surround the trial-seat prepare to execute the sentence every citizen with he son attend carry each two stone under he arm and if the accuse be find guilty lapidation instantly follow the house of the culprit be also immediately plunder cast down confiscate and sell for the benefit of the corporation except in china where a law still more sanguinary and destructive prevail in case of murder there be hardly a similar instance of deliberate legal severity to be find among nation elevated above barbarism inspire by the revelry of the ambitious marpha and the patriotic association she awaken the novgorodian expel the officer of the grand prince possess themselves of some land that belong to he in right of he fief and to confirm they revolt against he authority submit themselves by treaty to casimir prince of lithuanium in this position of affair ivan wisely resolve to leave vyatka to its own course confine he attention solely to novgorod and seek to win over pskof and its twelve tributary city so that he might combine they against the turbulent republic the fall of novgorod accomplish the conquest of the other obstinate city be easily effect the polite cool and persevere means he bring into operation against the refractory republic be admirably second by the machinery of communication which have be previously establish in the person of the boyar whose local influence be of the first consequence on this occasion as the tide of these numerous negotiation change ivan assume the humility or the pride the generosity or the severity adapt to the immediate purpose and work upon the character of the individual as well as they interest he succeed in gain a great moral lever before he unsheathe a sword he make ally of all the class and prince that lay in he way to the heart of the independent corporation he represent to the noble the anomalous nature and usurpation of the democratic institution of novgorod and he rouse they pride into resentment he gain over the few prince who still hold tremble appanage by paint to they in strong color the enormous opulence and commercial monopoly of the republic and he fill the whole population with revenge against the fate city by exaggerated account of its treasonable design against the internal security of the empire thus by artful insinuation of the personal advantage and general benefit that be to spring from the overthrow of novgorod he succeed in neutralize all the opposition he have any reason to apprehend and in exciting increase enthusiasm on the part of the people have make these subtle preparation to facilitate he proceedings he send a ambassador to the citizen call upon they to acknowledge he authority and only await they decisive refusal which he anticipate as a excuse for immediate hostility the novgorodian return a answer couch in term of scorn and defiance he reply be carry by three formidable army which break in on the novgorodian territory on three different side prostrate the hope of the citizen by overwhelming mass against which they gallant resistance be of no avail in this brief and desperate struggle ivan possess extraordinary superiority by the recent acquisition of firearm and cannon the use of which he have learn from aristotle of bologna a italian whom he have take into he service as a architect mintmaster and founder the triumph of the arm of the grand prince be rapidly follow by the incursion of swarm of the peasantry who secretly urge forward by ivan rush upon the route enemy and complete the work of devastation this licentious exhibition of popular feeling ivan affect to repress and avail himself of the opportunity it afford to assume toward the novgorodian a moderation he do not feel he pretend to protect they against any greater violence than be merely necessary to establish he right to the recovery of the domain of which they have despoil he and the payment of the ransom that be customary under such circumstance here he deep and crafty genius have room for appropriate display he do not consider it prudent to seize upon the republic at once as in that event he be bind to partition it among he kinsman by whose aid extend upon special promise he have overthrow it so he contented himself with a rich ransom have already beggar it by suffer lawless follower to plunder it uninterruptedly before he interfere and by demand a act of submission but in this act he contrived to insert some word of ambiguous tendency under the shelter of which he might when he own time arrive leap upon he prey with impunity the confusion into which the novgorodian be throw and the great reduction of strength which they suffer in the contest enable ivan to deprive they of some of they tributary under the pretence of render they a service so that they exhaustion be seize upon as a fresh source of injustice the permian have offer some indignity to the republic ivan interfere and transfer the commerce of that people with germany to moscow and on another occasion when the livoman knight attempt a aggression ivan send he ambassador and troops to force a negotiation in he own name thus actually deprive both novgorod and pskof they be mutually concern of the right of make peace and war in they own behalf by insidious measure like these he continue to oppress and absorb the once independent city that claim and keep so tower a ascendency but not satisfy with such means of accumulate the supreme power he sow dissension between the rich class and the poor and after foment fictitious grievance terminate in open quarrel he succeed in have all complaint lay before he for decision then go among they he impoverish the wealthy by the lavish present he visit demand and captivate the imagination of the multitude by the dazzling splendor of he retinue and the flexible quality of he justice the time be now approach for a more explicit declaration of he view on pretence of these disagreement he load some of the principal citizen the oligarch of the republic with chain and send they to moscow it be so arrange that these noble be denounce by the mob and ivan in accede to they demand for vengeance secure the allegiance of the great bulk of the population the stratagem succeed and with each new violation of justice he gain a accession of popular favor the progress of the scheme against the liberty of novgorod be slow but inevitable the inhabitant gradually refer all they dispute to the grand prince and he profit by the grow desire to erect he into the sole judge of they domestic grievance at length summon the citizen to appear before he at moscow the demand be as unexpected as it be extraordinary never before have the novgorodian go out from they own wall to sue or receive judgment but so seductive and treacherous be the profession of ivan that unsuspicious of he design they consent to appear before he throne throughout the whole of these encroachment on the ancient usage in which the rights of the people reside he appear to be lift above all personal or tyrannical view marpha the ambitious widow who have stir up the revolt and seek to attach novgorod to lithuanium have never be molest and even the principal person who be most conspicuous in resist he authority at the outset be suffer to remain unharmed these instance of magnanimity as they be believe to be lull the distrust of the citizen and seduce they by degree to abandon they old custom one by one at he bidding for seven year he continue with unwearied perseverance to wean they from all those distinctive habit that mark they original character and separate they from the rest of the empire and at last when he think that he have succeed in obliterate they attachment to the republican form of government he advance he claim to the absolute sovereignty which be now sanction by numberless act of submission and by traitorous voice of assent within the council of the citizen at a audience to which he admit a envoy that officer either wilfully or by accident address he by the name of sovereign and ivan instantly seize upon the inadvertency claim all the privilege of a absolute master he require that the republic should surrender its expire rights into he hand and take a solemn oath of allegiance that he boyar should be receive within its gate with full authority to exercise they almost irresponsible control over the city that the palace of yaroslaff the temple of novgorodian liberty should be give up to he viceroy that the forum should be abolish and that the popular assembly and all the corresponding immunity of the people should be abrogate forever the veil be drop too suddenly the citizen be not prepare for so abrupt and uncompromise a assertion of authority hitherto they have admit the innovation of the grand prince but it be of they own free will they do not expect that he would grind any right of sovereignty upon they voluntary acquiescence in he character of arbitrator and ally and the news of he despotic claim fill they with despair and indignation the great bell which have formerly be the emblem of they citizenship now toll for the last time they assemble in the market-place in tumultuous crowd and summon the treacherous or imprudent envoy before they they try he by a clamorous and summary process and before the sentence be complete tear he limb from limb believe that some of the noble be accessory to the surrender of they freedom they fall upon those they suspect and murder they in the street thus hasten and confirm by they intemperance the final alienation of the wealthy class from they cause and have by these act of unbridled desperation give the last demonstration of they independence they once more throw themselves into the arm of lithuanium which be open to receive they but ivan be prepare for this demonstration of passion he measure be too deeply take to suffer surprise by any course which the novgorodian in they righteous hatred of oppression might think fit to adopt when he learn the reception they give to he mandate he affect the most painful astonishment he declare that he alone be the party aggrieve that he alone be deceive that they have lay snare for he counsel and countenance and that even when yield to they universal requisition he have consent to take upon he the toil of government they have the audacity to confront he with a imposition in the face of russium to shed the blood of they fellow-men and to insult heaven and the empire by call into the sacred limit the soldier of a adverse religion and a foreign power these ingenious remonstrance be address to the priest the noble and the people and have the desire effect the bishop embark zealously in the crusade and the people enter willingly into the delusion the dependent republic of pskof and the principality of twer paralyze in the convulsion appear to waver but ivan resolve to deprive novgorod of any help they might ultimately be tempt to offer draw out they military strength under the form of a contingency and leave they powerless yet although strongly reënforced on all side he still avoid a contest with a mingled exhibition of revenge and attachment he threaten and propitiate in the same breath i will reign supreme at novgorod he exclaim as i do at moscow you must surrender all to I you posadnik and the bell that call you national council together and at the same time he profess he determination to respect those very liberty which by these demand be to be sacrifice forever the novgorodian terrify by the immense force ivan have collect which it seem he only use to menace and not to destroy attempt to capitulate but he be insensible to all they representation and even while he promise they they freedom he refuse to grant it the armament mighty as it be which he have prepare be keep aloof to threaten and not to strike he act as if he fear to risk the issue of a contest with any of he enemy or as if he be unwilling to suffer the loss consequent even upon victory he want to overbear by terror rather than by arm so that the fearful agency of he name might do the work of conquest more powerfully and at less cost than he army which must have be thin by battle and might have be subdue by fortune so long as he could preserve he terrible ascendency by the force of the fear which he inspire he be secure but the single defeat or the doubtful issue of a solitary struggle might reduce the potent charm of he unvanquished power in this way he draw the chain tighter and in the agony of the protracted and narrowing pressure novgorod unable to resist die in agony of despair the surrender of the liberty of the republic be complete on take possession of the city ivan seize upon the person of the popular marpha and send she and seven of the principal citizen as prisoner to moscow confiscate they property in the name of the state the national assembly and municipal privilege cease January 15 1478 on which day the people take the oath of servitude and on the 18th the boyar and they immediate follower and the wealthy and the influential class of the inhabitant voluntarily come forward and enter into the service of the grand prince the revenue of the clergy which be by the act of submission transfer to the treasury of ivan be immediately devote by he to the service of three hundred thousand follower of boyar through whose intermediate agency he intend to assert and maintain he unlimited and supreme authority over the fall city but not alone do he possess himself of the private property of some of the principal person who have render themselves prominent in the recent declaration of independence but he demand a surrender of a great part of the territory that belong by charter to the public he also further enriched himself and impoverish the novgorodian by seize upon all the gold and valuable to which he could with any show of propriety lay claim he be say to have convey to moscow no less than three hundred cart-load of gold silver and precious stone besides fur cloth and merchandise to a considerable amount the settlement of he power in novgorod have scarcely be conclude when intelligence be receive that the tartar of the golden horde be prepare for a third invasion the enormous physical force that be at ivan 's disposal the late accession of strength and increase of domain by which he means be not only improve but the number and means of he opponent be reduce and the general state of the country which be in all respects favorable to the object of he ambition deprive such a movement of its wonted terror ivan have nothing to fear from the approach of the enemy he be surround by the prince of the blood who have warmly embark in the common cause he have a immense army at he command panting for new field of spoil and glory he have break up he domestic enemy in the north and dismembered or attach the insurgent republic he have leave lithuanium to the rapacious guardianship of the khan of the crimea who be sufficiently formidable to neutralize the incursion of the duchy upon the frontier and on every side he find a ardent population impatient to expel the invader yet encouraging as these circumstance be and although they seem to present the fortunate opportunity for carry into execution he cherish plan of autocracy ivan hold back he alone of all russium be intimidate he project of empire be so lofty and comprehensive that he appear to shrink from any collision that could even remotely peril its ultimate success he be so dismayed that he force the princess to fly from moscow and seek a temporary shelter in the north terror-struck and unmanned he desert the army and shut himself up in the capital for security and when the armed population pour forth from all quarter and animated by one spirit of resistance have advance as far as the oka to meet the tartar he recall he son to the capital as if he apprehend the consummation of some evil either in he own person or that of he heir but the voice of the general indignation reach he in he retreat and even he son refuse to leave he post in the army the murmur of a disappointed people rise into clamor which he could not affect to misunderstand they reproach he with have burden they with tax without have pay the khan he tribute and that now the tartar have come into russium to demand restitution he flee from vindication of he own act and leave the people to extricate themselves from a dilemma into which he have bring they in this difficulty ivan have no choice leave but to submit to the will of the country he accordingly convoke a meeting of the bishop and boyar for the purpose of ask they advice but they counsel be even still more conclusive and the reluctant prince be compel to rejoin the army the fear by which he be move however could not be conceal and it gradually infect the rank of the soldiery he have no sooner take he station at the head of the army than he become spellbound a river the lugra divide he from the enemy he could not summon courage to attempt it but stand gaze in disastrous terror upon the foe with whom he open negotiation to beg for term in the mean time the news of he indecision spread and the people at moscow grow turbulent the primate perceive the disaffection that be spring up address the prince in the language of despair he represent to he the state of the public mind and the inglorious procedure of sue for a peace where he could insure a victory and dictate he own term would you exclaim the primate give up russium to fire and sword and the church to plunder whither would you fly can you soar upward like the eagle can you make you nest amid the star the lord will cast you down from even that asylum no you will not desert we you would blush at the name of fugitive and traitor to you country ivan be surround by two hundred thousand soldier reënforcements be throng constantly to he side the enemy be cut off from all assistance from he ally of lithuanium and one word of encouragement would have set all these advantage into action the troops only await the signal to rush upon the invader but ivan amid these flattering and animated circumstance be dispirited even the voice of the church address he in vain he be utterly paralyzed and cowardice have so completely take possession of he mind that when the early winter have set in and freeze the river so as to obliterate the obstacle that separate he from the troops of the khan he be seize with consternation and flee in the wildest disorder from he position he be so alarmed that he could not even preserve any regularity on the retreat and all be confusion and panic so disgraceful a abandonment of he duty which in other time must have cost he he throne if not he life be not visit with that rigor by the russian which so glare a defection deserve the sovereign prince be remove to too great a distance from the people to be judge of with precision or promptitude the motive of he act be not accessible to the multitude who accustom to despotism have not yet learn to question the wisdom of they ruler the rapid advance that have be make toward the concentration of the govern power in the autocratical form limit still more the means of popular observation and the vigor of the popular check upon the supreme authority the grand prince stand so much aloof from he subject surround by special adviser and court favorite that even the language of remonstrance which sometimes reach he ear be so soften in its progress that its harshness be that of subservient admonition and he be as little shake by the smother discontent of the people as they be rouse by a open sacrifice of they interest but not alone be this reverence for the autocracy so great as to protect the autocrat from violent reprisal on the part of he subject but the national veneration for the descendant of st vladimir and the stock of rurik be sufficient to absorb all the indignation which the weakness or the wickedness of the prince might have arouse ivan however independently of those act of prejudice and ignorance which preserve he from the wrath which he have so wantonly provoke be destine to find all the unfavorable circumstance of he position change into the most extraordinary and unexpected advantage in the crisis of he despair the fortune of the day turn to he favor while he hang behind the lugra seek a base and humiliating compromise at the hand of the enemy he lieutenant of svenigorod and he ally the khan of the crimea advance upon the golden horde and push they victorious arm into the very den of the tartar at the time that the tartar force be draw off in the invasion of russium speedy intelligence of this disaster have reach the enemy he make a precipitate retreat in the hope of reach he fastness on the frontier in time to avert the destruction that threaten he but the russian have be too rapid in they movement and the work of devastation begin by they be complete by a band of maraud tartar who enter soon after they retire and carry away the woman and the remnant of the treasure leave behind reduce the city of the golden horde to ash before the distant army could accomplish its retrograde march nor be this all the triumph that ivan be call upon to share without any participation in the danger the return of the tartar be arrest midway by a hetman of the cossack and the mirza of the nogai who fall upon the confused and disorderly rank on they ill-conducted flight homeward cut they in piece and leave scarcely a living vestige on the field of the ancient and implacable enemy of the country the extinction of the tartar be final the golden horde be annihilate and the scourge of russium and she prince be no more in a better educate state of society these event so sudden and so important must have be attribute to proximate and obvious cause -- the combination of operation over which ivan have no control and the dismay into which the tartar be surprised follow up quickly by overwhelming mass who possess the superiority in number and in plan ivan who could lay no claim to the honor of the enterprise would not have be associate in its result have the people be instruct in the respect which be due to themselves but the russian profoundly venerate the person of the grand prince and accustom to consider he as the depository of a wisdom refine above the sphere of ordinary mortality do not hesitate to ascribe this transcendent exploit to the genius of the reluctant autocrat they look back upon he pusillanimity with awe and extract from he apparent fear the subtle element of a second providence he be no longer the coward and the waverer he have see the body of the future before its extreme shadow have darken other man 's vision and the whole course of he timid bearing even include he flight from the lugra be interpret into a prudent and prophetic policy wonderful in its progress and sublime in its consequence without risk a life or spilling a drop of blood and merely by a evasive diversion of he means he have vanquish the asiatic spoiler and at the very moment that the people be dispose to doubt he skill and he courage he have actually destroy the giant by turn the arm of he own nation against he such be the unanimous feeling of russium transfer the glory of they signal deliverance from those who have achieve it to he who have evade the responsibility of the attempt they worship in the grand prince the incarnation of the new-born liberty culmination of the power of burgundy treaty of péronne ad 1468 p f willert from the planting of the burgundian branch of the house of valoi in 1364 arise a formidable rival of the royal power in france during the next hundred year the duke of burgundy play prominent part in french history and then appear one of the line who advance he house to its loftiest eminence this be charle surname the bold son of philip misnamed the good charle be bear in 1433 and become duke of burgundy in 1467 he hold the rank of one of the first prince in europe without be a king and without possess a inch of ground for which he do not owe service to some superior lord some of he territory be hold of the holy roman empire and some of the french crown and he be at once a vassal of france and of the emperor he dominion contain many prosperous and wealthy city but the possession of charle lack unity alike in territorial compactness political distinction and local rule and in national characteristic language and law he peculiar position expose he to the jealous rivalry of loui xi of france the king 's object be the consolidation of he monarchy while charle aim to extend he duchy at the expense of loui ' territory thus the two rival become deadly enemy charle conceive the design of restore the old kingdom of burgundy in 1467 have secure alliance with brittany and england he prepare for a campaign of conquest but loui offer he advantageous term of peace and invite he to a conference while charle hesitate loui stir to revolt the duke 's subject in liege with whom burgundy have lately be at war the negotiation between loui and charle and the event which follow form the subject of willert 's narrative many messenger come and go yet charle hesitate to accept peace even on term so greatly to he advantage the king if he could but see the duke feel sure he might end this uncertainty perhaps even obtain more favorable concession when once the idea of a personal interview have possess he he be deaf to the warning and entreaty of he more prudent or honest adviser charle do not seem anxious to meet the king and when at length he yield to the representation of the king 's envoy he send a safe-conduct in the most explicit term : sir if it be you pleasure to visit this town of péronne to confer with we i swear to you and promise by my faith and on my honor that you may come stay and return at you good pleasure without let or harm notwithstanding any cause that may now be or hereafter may arise after receive this assurance loui might fairly suppose that he have nothing to fear he have before trust himself safely to charle ' honor nor have he himself abuse the chance which once deliver he rival into he hand unprotect by promise or oath he therefore set out at once for péronne accompany only by some eighty archer of he scotch guard and by he personal attendant he be meet at the frontier by a burgundian escort under philip de crèvecoeur and he find charle himself wait to receive he at the bank of a little river not far from péronne the prince greet each other with respect on the one side and with hearty affection on the other they enter the town side by side the king 's arm rest on he kinsman 's shoulder the castle of péronne be small and inconvenient the king be therefore lodge in the house of one of the richest citizen he have scarcely reach he quarter when the marshal of burgundy join charle ' army with the force he command with he come philip of savoy and two of he brother antony de châteauneuf and other man who have share largely in the king 's favor but who have flee from he resentment after betray he confidence these he enemy might consider the occasion favorable for a bold stroke if they act without the connivance of charle he might be grateful to those who satisfy he enmity without irretrievably compromise he honor loui therefore ask to be allow to move into the castle where he archer could at any rate defend he against a surprise on the next day the conference begin all that he could demand be offer to charle if only he would abandon the alliance of brittany and england but he be determine not to give way and be insensible to the blandishments of he guest who may have be torment by painful misgiving as he look from he prison-like room at a gloomy tower in which charle the simple have be confine and it be say murder by a rebellious vassal at the first suggestion of the interview with the king charle have object that he could scarcely believe in he sincere desire for peace while he envoy be encouraging rebel cardinal balue reply that when the people of liège learn that the king and duke have meet they would not venture upon any hostile movement but the french agent be not inform of they master 's intended visit to péronne and do not attempt to discourage a premature attack it be indeed doubtful whether they could in any case have change the course of event the first rumor of what have happen in a popular outbreak at liège reach péronne on the night of October 10th as be natural they be greatly exaggerated tongre have be sack the garrison put to the sword humbercourt the burgundian governor and the bishop murder the king 's envoy have be see lead and encourage the assailant charle break into cry of rage : the traitor king so he be only come to cheat I by a false pretence of peace by st george he and those villain of liège shall pay dearly for this he do not pause to consider whether it be likely that loui have be simple enough to provoke a catastrophe fatal to he hope and dangerous to he safety if comine the duke 's chamberlain and another favorite attendant who be with they master at the time have not do they best to soothe he it be probable that the donjon of péronne would once more have close upon a captive king charle be at little pain to conceal he rage and when loui be tell that the gate of town and castle be guard to prevent the escape of a thief who have steal a casket of jewel he know that he be a prisoner yet however bitter he self-reproach however gloomy he foreboding he do not lose he presence of mind he attendant be allow free access to the castle he have bring with he fifteen thousand gold crown and these he anxiously employ to secure the good office of charle ' adviser for three night the angry agitation and perplexity of charle be so great that he do not undress he would throw himself on he bed for a time and then start up and pace about he room utter threat and invective against the king nothing be do or decide on the first day October 11 1468 on the second a council be hold which sit late into the night a minority of the council the enemy of loui or those who be only anxious to flatter the passion of they master advise he to use to the full the opportunity which chance and the foolhardiness and duplicity of he adversary have place in he hand they urge he to keep the king in secure confinement after provide for the virtual partition of the kingdom among the great feudatory the majority those who have some regard for the honor of the house of burgundy the lawyer who respect the letter if not the spirit of a agreement perhaps also the more far-sighted politician be of a different opinion the fame of the duke would suffer irreparable injury by so flagrant a violation of he plighted word the advantage moreover to be gain by the captivity the deposition perhaps the death of the king be uncertain the heir to the throne be entirely in the hand of the breton and be not likely to be eager to advance the interest of burgundy a large and well-disciplined army command by experienced captain be assemble on the frontier if they could not rescue they master they would at least endeavor to avenge he while the new king could acquire a easy popularity by execrate a crime of which he and franci of brittany would reap all the advantage it be a wiser course to accept the term which the king in he alarm proffer -- the settlement in favor of burgundy of all the dispute question which have arise out of the treaty of arras and conflan -- and it might be possible to humiliate and disgrace loui by compelling he to take part in the punishment of he ally the citizen of liège who by they trust in he have be lure to destruction charle leave the council apparently undecided and pass the night in as great a storm of passion as the two precede the conflict within he doubtless fan he wrath comine who share he room endeavor to calm he and to persuade he to embrace the course most consistent with he interest and the king 's safety for so great a prince if once a captive might scarcely hope to leave he prison alive toward morning charle determine to content himself with insist that loui should sign a peace on such term as he should dictate and accompany he against liege the king say comine have a friend who inform he that he would be safe if he agree to these condition but that otherwise he peril would be extreme this friend be comine himself and loui never forget so timely a service the two day during which he fate be be decide have be pass by he in the greatest agony of mind though he have be allow to communicate freely with the french noble and he own attendant he have be ominously neglect by the burgundian courtier as soon as the duke have determine what condition he intend to impose he hasten to the castle to visit he captive the memorable interview be describe by two eye-witness -- comine and olivier de la marche charle enter the king 's presence with a lowly obeisance but he gesture and he unsteady voice betray he suppress passion the king could not conceal he fear my brother he ask be i not safe in you dominion yes sire so safe that if i see a cross-bow point at you i would throw myself before you to shield you from the bolt he

of st laud charle have insist that loui should swear on the relic a fragment of the true cross once keep in the church of st laud at anger which the king always carry with he esteem it highly because he believe that whoever forswear himself on it would surely die within the year the duke at the same time promise to do homage for the fief he hold of the crown of france but the execution of this promise be evade on the 15th the duke with a army of forty thousand man and the king with he slender escort and some three hundred man-at-arms who join he by the way begin they march on liège loui be not less anxious than he companion that dammartin should not attempt a forcible rescue victory or defeat would have be alike dangerous to he safety twice at charle ' request order be send to disband or at least remove the french army from the frontier the king 's letter be deliver by he messenger in the persistent presence of a burgundian who prevent the possibility of any private communication loui ' crafty old soldier dammartin pay little attention to such order he send word to the duke that unless he master soon return all france would come to fetch he the first division of the burgundian army reach liège October 22d the citizen whose wall have be destroy and artillery confiscate be in no position to resist a army which might have conquer a emperor at the suggestion of the legate they release they bishop beg he to intercede on they behalf and offer to surrender they goods to the duke 's discretion if only he would spare they life charle would not listen to they overture he swear that he would have town and inhabitant at he discretion or that he and he army should perish in the attempt the townsman with the boldness of despair sally forth to meet the advance guard of they enemy they be drive back with great loss four day later the 26th the duke and main body of the army have not come up the troops who have repulse the sally on the 22d have as yet meet with little resistance and think themselves strong enough to occupy a open town defend only by ill-armed trader and mechanic the weather be cold and rainy the temptation of secure comfortable quarter and the undivided profit of the sack irresistible the assailant occupy one of the suburb but they advance be check by some hastily construct defence at nightfall the citizen come out through the breach of they wall they be enable by they knowledge of the rough and precipitous ground to fall unobserved upon the rear of the enemy eight hundred burgundian be kill and the rout would have be complete have not the duke with the main body of he army push forward to the assistance of a division which be still hold its ground on the next day the king arrive and soon after take up he quarter close to those of the duke he show himself to the man who have place they trust in he wear the st andrew 's cross the badge of burgundy and reply _ vive bourgogne _ to they cry of _ vive france _ that night there be a great and sudden alarm the duke of burgundy though brave be sometimes want in presence of mind and on this occasion appear more trouble in the king 's presence than pleased he friend loui take the command give he order with great coolness and prudence even as a general he gain by comparison with he rival he be indeed not less anxious than charle that the burgundian army should suffer no reverse he fear everything that might arouse the ready suspicion and ungovernable temper of the duke on the evening of the 29th a few hundred man collier and miner from the mountainous district of franchemont lead by the owner of the house in which the king and duke be sleep make a desperate attempt to surprise the prince in they bed they would have succeed have they not delay to attack a barn in which three hundred burgundian man-at-arms be post only a few follow they guide straight to the quarter of the sovereign they be unable therefore to overcome the resistance of the guard before the noise of the conflict have arouse the camp the assailant be overwhelm by number and fall fight to the last the assault have be order for the next day but this bold and unexpected attack so surprised and disconcert the burgundian that the king think he might be able to persuade the duke to agree to a capitulation or at least to postpone the assault he only obtain a contemptuous request that he should consult he own safety by retire to namur this reflection on he courage stimulate he to greater ostentation of zeal he could scarcely be restrain from lead the assault the citizen be wear out by guard a open town against a powerful army for more than a week they imagine that as it be a Sunday they would not be attack till the morrow the assailant enter the town with little or no resistance yet the fury and license of the soldiery could not have be greater have they passion be excite by a obstinate and bloody struggle the horror of the sack of dinant -lrb- 1 -rrb- be surpass although many of the citizen be able to escape across the meuse the deliberate vengeance of the duke be more search and not less cruel than the lust and rapine of he army all prisoner who would not pay a heavy ransom be drown although the cold be so intense that wine freeze and that he man lose finger and toe from frost-bite charle do not shrink from the labor of hunting down those who have flee to the mountain and burn the village in which they have seek a refuge he have previously take leave of the king four or five day after the occupation of liège loui have express a wish to depart if he could be of any further use he brother might command he service but he be anxious to see that they treaty be register by the parliament of pari without which it could not be valid the duke seem unwilling to let he prey escape but could find no pretence for he detention next year say the king he would come again and spend a month pleasantly with he dear brother in festivity and good cheer the treaty now draw up in its final shape by the burgundian lawyer be read over to loui in order that he might object to any article of which he disapprove but he readily ratify all that he have promise at pèronne it have seem useless to require he to bestow normandy on charle of france nor be the question of he appanage mention in the treaty itself but the king be compel to promise to invest he brother with champagne and brie these province lie between burgundy and the low country would in the hand of a ally serve to consolidate the duke 's dominion and could be easily defend in case the king attempt to resume he concession just before the prince depart loui say as if the thought have suddenly occur : what do you wish I to do if my brother be not content with the appanage i offer he for you sake charle answer carelessly : if he will not take it i leave the matter to you two to settle only let he be satisfy the king consider the thoughtless admission into which he have trick he rival most important since he fancy that it release he so far as he brother 's appanage be concern from the fearful obligation of he oath but notwithstanding this last advantage we can not doubt that loui feel bitterly disappointed and ashamed although all song caricature and writings reflect on the perfidy of the duke of burgundy and by implication on the folly of the king be forbid under severe penalty and even all manner of talk bird which might be teach the hateful word peronne have be seize by the royal officer he have not the heart to visit paris the parliament be summon to meet he at senlis he order it to register the treaty without comment and hasten southward to hide he mortification in he favorite castle of touraine -lrb- footnote 1 : by burgundian in 1466 -rrb- lorenzo de ' medici rule in

which have make posterity eternally they debtor conjointly with he younger brother giuliano lorenzo on the death of he father piero in 1469 succeed to the vast wealth and political power of the family in 1478 the death of giuliano leave lorenzo sole ruler of florence to few man have either the power or the opportunity be give to influence they epoch intellectually and politically to a degree so marked as be the lot of lorenzo de ' medici one of the most marvellously many-sided of the many-sided man who adorn the italy of the fifteenth century he do more to place florence in the forefront of the world 's culture than any other citizen who claim val d'arno -lrb- 1 -rrb- as he birthplace he influence be great because he be in sympathy so catholic with all the varied life of he age and circle while during the one hour he would be find learnedly discuss the rival claim of the platonic and aristotelian philosopher with ficino and landino the next might witness he the foremost reveller in the florentine carnival crown with flower and with the winecup in he hand gayly carol the _ ballate _ he have compose for the occasion while the third might behold he surround by the lead painter and sculptor of tuscany discourse profoundly on the aim and mission of art truly a unique personality at one and the same time the glorious creation and the splendid epitome of the spirit of the renaissance when lorenzo de ' medici consent to assume the position occupy by he father piero and he grandfather cosmo he be not the raw youth he immature year would lead one to suppose although intellectual maturity be reach at a earlier age in the sunny south than in the fog-haunted land of northern europe lorenzo have enjoy a long apprenticeship before be call to undertake the duty devolve on he as the uncrowned king of florence from he thirteenth year he have be the companion and share the counsel first of he grandfather and father and subsequently of he father alone from the former especially he learn many important lesson in statecraft the matter be open to question however if any advice have more far-reaching result or be lay more carefully to heart than this which be contain in more than one of cosmo 's letter : never stint you favor to the cause of learning and cultivate sedulously the friendship of scholar and humanist toward such a course lorenzo 's inclination as well as he interest point and during he life florence be the athen not only of italy but of europe as a whole here among many other be to be find such epoch-maker as poliziano ficino and landino pico della mirandola leo battista alberti michelangelo luigi pulci -- man who glorify they age by crowning it with the nimbus of they genius the literary and artistic greatness of florence be not due however to the comparative intellectual poverty of the other state in italy florence be only _ primus inter pare _ -- greatest among many that be great when the fact be recall that such contemporary as pomponius laetus bartolommeo sacchus molza alessandro farnese -lrb- paul iii -rrb- platina sabellicus at rome pontanus sannazaro and porcello in naple and pomponasso and boiardo at ferrara be then at or near they prime the position of florence as the acknowledged center of european culture be concede by sense of right alone than this nothing prove more emphatically the stride learn have be make it be no longer the prerogative of the few but the privilege of the many from the first lorenzo recognize what a strong card he hold in the affection and respect of the italian as well as of the florentine humanist the great secret of lorenzo 's preëminence in european and italian as well as in tuscan politics lie in the fact that he be able to unite the source of administrative legislative and judicial power in himself all the public office in florence be hold by he dependent and so entirely be the state machinery control by he that we find such man as loui xi and the emperor maximilian alfonso of naple and pope innocent viii recognize he authority and appeal to he personally in place of to the seigniory to effect the end they desire such power enable he to avoid the risk he grandfather cosmo have be compel to run to maintain he authority the medicean faction be better in hand than in he grandfather 's day and lorenzo therefore in play the _ rôle _ of the peacemaker of italy at the time when he hold the balance of power through he treaty with milan naple and ferrara could speak with a decision that carry weight when he find it necessary to threaten a restless despot with a political combination that might depose he lorenzo 's service to learning be inspire by feeling infinitely more noble than those actuate he political plan a patriotism as lofty as it be beneficent lead he to desire that he country should be in the van of italian progress in renaissance study he sagacious prevision enable he to proportion the nature and extent of the benefit he confer to the need it be intend to supply many statesman do more harm than good by fail to appreciate this law of supply and demand they grant more than be require and that which should have be a boon become a burden charle v at the time of the reformation on more than one occasion commit this error as also do wolsey and mazarin lorenzo like richelieu recognize the value of moderation in give and cause every favor to be regard as a possible earnest of other to come the earlier year of he power be associate with many stir event which exercise no inconsiderable influence on the state of learn for example he skilful playing off of duke galeazzo marium sforza of milan against ferrante king of naple lead to greater attention be direct by the florentine to neapolitan and milanese affair with the result that humanist and artist from both these place pay frequent visit to florence where they be welcome by lorenzo as he guest then when the revolt of the small city of volterra from florentine rule be suppress by lorenzo 's agent with a rigorous severity that cast a stain on they master 's name owe to many unoffending scholar have suffer to the extent of lose they all lorenzo make noble amends not only do he generously assist the inhabitant to repair they loss not only do he make grant to the local scholar and send they copy of many of the codex in he own library to supply the loss of they book which have be burn by the soldiery but he purchase large estate in the neighborhood that the citizen might benefit by he residence among they in this way too he bring the volterran scholar into more intimate relation with the florentine humanist and thus contribute to the further diffusion of the benefit of the renaissance all be not plain sailing however as regard the progress of the new learning despite he effort lorenzo could not prevent its development be check during the papal-neapolitan quarrel with florence that war originate in a dispute with pope sixtus iv who keep italy in a ferment during the whole duration of he pontificate 1471-1484 be no other proof forthcoming of lorenzo 's marvellous diplomatic genius than this one fact that he checkmate the political scheme of sixtus and finally so neutralize he influence as to render he wellnigh impotent for evil-do such a achievement be sufficient to stamp he one of the greatest master of statecraft europe have know in any estimate of he ability we must take into account the unsatisfactory character of many of the instrument wherewith he have to achieve he purpose and also the fact that he have neither a great army at he back with which to enforce the fulfilment of treaty obligation -- for florence never be a city of soldier -- nor have he the prestige of a official position to lend weight to he word to all intent and purpose he be a private citizen of the florentine republic yet such be the dynamic power of the man 's marvellous personality and the reputation he have earn even in he early year for supreme prescience and far-reaching diplomatic subtlety that far and wide he be regard as the greatest force in italian politics sixtus sallied forth to crush he return to the vatican a crushed and a discredited man to die of sheer chagrin over he defeat by lorenzo in he design upon ferrara then follow the memorable dispute in 1472-1473 over the bishopric of pisa when the pope 's nominee francesco salviatus be refuse possession of he see pisa be one of the tuscan town under the control of florence to this sixtus retaliate by seek the friendship of ferrante of naple a move lorenzo anticipate by form the league between florence milan and venice this league thoroughly alarm both the pope and ferrante and on the latter visit rome in 1475 a papal-neapolitan alliance be form even then hostility might not have break out have the young duke of milan not be assassinate in 1476 leave a infant heir this entail a long minority with all its danger and the apprehension regard these be not fanciful inasmuch as lodovico sforza uncle of the baby duke usurp the position under pretext of act as regent these crime be plainly responsible for the pazzus conspiracy in 1478 against the medicus themselves a conspiracy which result in giuliano the younger brother of lorenzo be murder in the cathedral during mass on the Sunday before ascension while lorenzo himself be slightly wound that sixtus and he nephew be accessory before the fact be now regard as unquestionable the vengeance take by the enraged florentine on the conspirator they relative friend and property be terrible the innocent alas be sacrifice indiscriminately with the guilty the archbishop of pisa francesco salviatus have enter eagerly into the scheme and although he sacred office prevent he from actually assist in the deed he be present in the cathedral until the signal be give for the perpetration of the deed when he leave the building to secure the palazzo publico he be therefore summarily hang with the other from the window of the civic building sixtus make the execution or the murder as he call it of salviatus he pretext for call on he ally to make war on florence when he see however that this action be only throw the city more completely than ever into the arm of the medicus he change he tactic and say he have no quarrel with he well-beloved child of florence but only with that son of iniquity and child of perdition lorenzo de ' medicus and those who have aid and abet he among whom the humanist be expressly mention against lorenzo and he associate a brief of excommunication be launch and the city be urge to regain the papal favor by surrender the offender the result might have be predict the brief only tend to knit the bond of association closer between lorenzo and the city of the flower while the humanist to a man rally round they patron even the choleric filelfo now a very old man who have be on anything but friendly term with the medicus address two bitter satire to sixtus in which the pope be style the real aggressor while the great humanist offer to write a history of the whole transaction that posterity might know the true fact the only power which give its adhesion to sixtus be naple while venice ferrara and milan declare for florence thus commence that tedious war which not only ruin so many florentine merchant but retard the cause of learn so materially when the people be groan under heavy tax when all coin which lorenzo could scrape together have to be pour out to pay the _ condottierus _ or soldier of fortune by whom the battle of florence be fight there be of course but short common for the humanist who have make florence they home many of those adapt themselves to circumstance but other to whom money be they god leave the bank of the arno for those southern city where the pinch of scarcity do not prevail in this campaign the florentine gain but little prestige the larger share of the cost be quietly suffer by they ally to fall on the city of banker the milanese be occupy with they own affair owe to the _ coup d'état _ accomplish by lodovico sforza the duke of ferrara withdraw owe to some disagreement with the condottierus engage by lorenzo the venetian only despatch a small contingent under carlo montone and diefebo d'anguillari accordingly in the end the whole burden of the struggle fall on florence the magnifico 's position gradually become precarious inasmuch as many person declare the war to be in reality a personal quarrel between pope sixtus and the medicus complaint begin to be hear that the public treasury be exhaust and the commerce of the city ruin while the citizen be burden with oppressive tax lorenzo have the mortification of be tell that sufficient blood have be shed and that it would be expedient for he rather to devise some means of effect a peace than of make further preparation for the war in these circumstance and confront by one of the most dangerous crisis of he whole life lorenzo rise to the occasion and effect a solution of the difficulty by daring to perform what be undoubtedly one of the bravest act ever achieve by a diplomatist by some statesman it might be condemn as foolhardy by other as quixotic its very foolhardiness and quixotry fascinate the man it be intend to influence the blood-thirsty cruel and pitiless ferrante of naple who be restrain from crime by the fear neither of god nor man and who have actually slay the condottiere piccinino when he visit he under a safe-conduct from the monarch 's best ally but the renaissance annals be fill with the record of man and woman whose nature be marvellous study of contrast and contradictory trait such be the neapolitan tyrant while a monster in much he have he vulnerable point he be ambitious to pose as a friend of the new learning and he know that lorenzo be not only the most munificent patron but also one of the most illustrious exponent of the renaissance principle although he enemy ferrante receive lorenzo with every demonstration of respect and satisfaction he lose sight of the hostile diplomatist in the great humanist two neapolitan galley be send to conduct he to naple and he be welcome on landing with much pomp never do lorenzo 's supreme diplomatic genius never do he versatile power as a statesman as a scholar as a patron of letter and as a brilliant man of the world blaze forth in more splendid effulgence than during he three-month ' stay in naple though oppose by all the papal authority and resource though sixtus by turn threaten cajole entreated promise in order to prevent lorenzo have any success the successor of st peter be beat all along the line and the magnifico carry away with he a treaty sign and seal which practically mean that henceforth naple and the papacy would be in antagonistic camp it be the renaissance card which win the trick with startling boldness yet with consummate art lorenzo play the game of flattering ferrante no ordinary adulation however would have have success with the neapolitan phaleri he be too strong-minded a man for anything of that kind but to be hail by the great renaissance patron of the period by one also who be himself one of the lead humanist as a brother-humanist and a fellow-patron of learning be a delicate incense to he vanity which he could not resist he like to be consult on matter of literary moment and when he blunder lorenzo be too shrewd a student of human nature to correct he another fact in lorenzo 's favor be that he have the warm support not only of the beautiful ippolyta marium daughter of cosmo 's friend francesco sforza of milan and now wife of alfonso duke of calabrium king ferrante 's heir as well as of don federigo the monarch 's younger son who along with ippolyta be a friend to the new learning but he also have the whole body of neapolitan humanist on he side scarce one of whom but have experience in some form or another the medicean bounty such powerful advocacy be not without its influence in bring about the result while ferrante more and more realize that if the florentine medicus be crush he would have no ally to whom to look for help when the inevitable shuffle of the political card take place on the death of sixtus in February 1480 therefore lorenzo return in triumph to florence to be receive with rapture by he fellow-citizen have he delay a few month longer he visit and he _ ad-miseri-cordiam _ appeal would not have be need in August of that year keduk achm one of the turkish sultan 's -lrb- mahomet ii -rrb- ablest general besiege and take the city of otranto in face of the common danger to all italy sixtus be compel to accept the treaty make by ferrante with lorenzo and a general peace ensue the decade accordingly close with a absolution for all offence grant by the pope to florence conditional on the tuscan republic contribute its share to the expense of the military preparation to resist the invasion of the turk notwithstanding the war the progress of the renaissance during the first decade of lorenzo 's rule be very marked to the rapid diffusion of printing this be largely due lorenzo have not imbibe the prejudice against the new art entertain by cosmo and federigo of montefeltro he look at the practical not the sentimental side of the question as regard the new invention have see that the press could throw off in a few day score of copy of any work of which it take a amanuensis month to produce one also that the scholar of all italy could be furnish almost immediately and at a low price with the text of any manuscript they desire while they have to wait month for a limited number of copy whose cost be wellnigh prohibitive he support the new invention from the outset have resolve to further he father 's effort to establish printing in florence he stimulate the local goldsmith bernardo cenninus to turn he attention to type-casting in metal and even agree to pay he a annual grant from the year 1471 until he have fairly settle himself in business nor do he confine he favor to he john of mainz and nichola of breslau who arrive in florence the former in 1472 and the latter in 1477 also participate in he open-hearted liberality printing strike its root deep into the tuscan community and flourish excellently though the florentine craft never attain the reputation of the venetian aldus and asolanus the giuntus of rome the soncinus of fano the stephanus of pari and froben of basel it have the name for a time at least of be one of the most accurate of all press to lorenzo it owe this celebrity at a early date he perceive that the new art would be of little value if there be not careful press reader he be therefore among the first to induce scholar of distinction to engage in this task for example he enlist the aid of cristoforo landino who in he _ disputatione camaldunens _ have really inaugurate the science of textual criticism by urge that a careful comparison of the various codex should constitute the preliminary step in any reproduction of the classic landino 's work on vergil and horace merit the warmest praise lorenzo also impressed poliziano into the work whose labor in mark the various reading in add _ scholium _ and note illustrative of the text of catullus propertius ovid etc be of the utmost value to lorenzo and to he younger brother giuliano another great humanist giorgio merulum of milan dedicated he _ plautus _ publish in venice in 1472 show at how early a age the magnifico have take he place among the recognize patron of the italian renaissance we ought not moreover to omit mention of another achievement of lorenzo though perform in a sphere of effort lie outside of the strict limit of we renaissance survey see it be the revival of letter however which induce the revival of the cultivation of the vernacular italian literature surely it be not out of place to refer to it here early in life lorenzo become imbue with the conviction that he native tongue be unsurpassed as a medium for the expression of noble thought in noble number not only do he encourage other to study dante petrarch and boccaccio but by follow out he own precept he become one of the great italian poet he _ selve d'amore _ he _ corinto _ he _ ambra _ he _ la nencia da barberino _ he _ laude _ he _ sonettus _ he _ cansonus _ etc be all poem that live in the italian literature of to-day not as a man ashamed of the vernacular and force to use it because he can command no better do lorenzo write he be sure of the justice of he cause and determine by precept and example and by the prestige of he princely rank to bring the literature he love into repute again but of these poem we can not here take further note by the scholar of the renaissance such work be look askance at if they do produce any of these trifle as they be call they almost blush to own they and be ashamed to communicate they to each other that he dare to be natural say much for lorenzo and it be largely due to he encouragement that cristoforo landino undertake he great work on dante to which we owe so much to-day in conjunction with he patronage of printing there be no line of effort in which lorenzo do more real good than in collect manuscript and antiquity and in make they practically public property on this account he be style by niccolo leonicino lorenzo de ' medici the great patron of learn in this age whose messenger be disperse through every part of the earth for the purpose of collect book on every science and who have spare no expense in procure for you use and that of other who may devote themselves to similar study the material necessary for you purpose the agent he employ travel through italy greece europe and the east -- hieronymo donato ermolao barbaro and paolo cortesus be the name of some of he most trust commissioner but the coadjutor whose aid he principally rely on to whom he commit the care and arrangement of he vast museum and great library be poliziano who himself make frequent excursion throughout europe asia and northern africa to discover and purchase such remains of antiquity as suit the purpose of he patron another successful agent though at a later date be giovanni lascari who twice journey into the east in search of manuscript and curio in the second of these he bring back upward of two hundred copy of valuable codex from the monastery on mount atho to still another service render by lorenzo to the cause of the renaissance attention must be call -- the founding of the florentine academy for the study of greek this institution distinct be it remember from the _ uffizialus dello studio _ -lrb- or high-school -rrb- exercise a marvellous influence on the progress of the new learning accordingly as roscoe say succeed scholar have be profuse in they acknowledgment to lorenzo who first form the establishment from which to use they own classical figure as from the trojan horse so many illustrious champion have spring and by means of which the knowledge of the greek tongue be extend not only throughout italy but throughout europe as well from all the country of which numerous pupil flock to florence -- pupil who afterward carry the learn they have receive to they native land of this institution the first public professor be joannes argyropoulo who have enjoy the patronage of cosmo and piero and direct the education of lorenzo be select by the latter as the fittest person to be the earliest occupant of the chair during he tenure of it he send out such pupil as poliziano donato acciaiuolus janus pannonius and the famous german humanist reuchlin argyropoulo do not hold the appointment long he death take place at rome in 1471 and he be succeed first by theodore of gaza and then by chalcondyla poliziano certainly discharge the duty of the office frequently but at first only as _ locum tenen _ he be then almost incessantly engage in travel for he patron in greece and asia minor and be too valuable a coadjutor to be tie down to the routine of teaching until he have complete he work during the next decade he become the professor and discharge the duty with a genius and a adaptability to circumstance that win for he the admiration and love of all he student this decade be also remarkable for the commencement of the devotion to the cultivation of literary style a pursuit yet to reach its culmination in poliziano in florence and in bembo and sadoleto in rome originality gradually give place to conventionality until man actually come to prefer the absurdity of ciceronianism and a cold colorless adherence to hard-and-fast rule of composition to a work throb with the pulsation of virile life humanism be begin to take flight from italy to find a home and a welcome beyond the alp the final decade of lorenzo 's life constitute the midsummer bloom of the tuscan renaissance the meridian of the intellectual and artistic supremacy of florence in lorenzo it find its fullest expression he be typical of its spiritual as well as of its moral meaning typical too of that mental unrest which seek escape from the press problem of a enigmatic present by revert to the study of a classic past whose ethical social and political difficulty be rarely of a complex character but concerned themselves principally with what may be term the elementary verity of man 's relation to the deity and to he fellow lorenzo 's amazing versatility have be pronounce a fault by some who believe they detect in he the potential capacity of rival dante petrarch and ariosto on they own ground have he only conserve he energy this be a foolish supposition lorenzo 's many-sidedness be but the reflection in himself as the most accurate mirror of the time of all that wondrous susceptibility to beauty that eager craving after the realization of the -lrb- greek : to kalon -rrb- -lrb- the good -rrb- so characteristic of the best hellenic genius whether we study it in the drama of sophocle or the _ republic _ of plato or in the statesmanship of pericle if lorenzo have resemble he grandfather and concentrate he energy upon finance and politics there might have be a line of reign medicean prince in florence half a century earlier than actually be the case but europe would have be distinctly the loser by the absence of the greatest personal force make for culture which characterize the renaissance this last decade of lorenzo 's life -- from he thirty-first to he forty-second year -- be memorable in many respects in the year 1481 he be again expose to the danger of assassination battista frescobaldus and two assistant in the church of the carmelus and again on ascension day make a attempt to stab he but be frustrate by the vigilance of lorenzo 's friend there be no doubt that this second attempt be also instigate by girolamo riario the nephew of sixtus iv thereafter lorenzo never move out without a strong bodyguard of friend and adherent -- a precaution render necessary by the repeat plot that be be hatch against he by he enemy no sooner have the presence of the turk at otranto in the extreme southeast of italy be render a thing of the past by the surrender of the moslem garrison to the duke of calabrium in September 1481 than the peninsula be again range in oppose camp by the attempt of the venetian assist by sixtus and he nephew to dispossess ercole d'este duke of ferrara of he dominion the duke have marry the daughter of ferdinand king of naple a alliance which by strengthen he give on that account great offence to the venetian they therefore seek to provoke he by insist on they monopoly of the manufacture of salt in north italy and by build a fortress on a part of the ferrarese territory which they pretend be within the limit of they own when he remonstrate they decline to remove it in vain he appeal to sixtus the latter be one of the wolf wait to devour he he then turn to lorenzo to the inexpressible chagrin of venice and of sixtus the magnifico promptly espouse he cause form a alliance with ferdinand and other state and before the pope and the venetian be aware he have move they find themselves confront by naple florence milan bologna mantua and faenza the ally be command by federigo of montefeltro duke of urbino while the venetian-papal troops be place under ruberto malatesta of riminus in this campaign however lorenzo be really the master-spirit although success be win on both side a more than usually tragic complexion be give to the war by the death of the two commander of the opposing force they have be friend from youth and such a trifle as the fact that they be hire to fight against each other never disturb the tenor of they mutual regard armstrong say no more than the truth when he remark : it be a pathetic coincidence the two rival general have bequeath to each other the care of they child and estate a characteristic illustration of the easy good-fellowship in this game of italian war the war drag on with vary result until lorenzo play he reserve card he induce the slavic archbishop of carniolum who visit rome as the emperor frederick 's envoy have be shock by the shameless immorality of the pope 's life to begin a agitation for a general council in this he be support by several of the ruler in northern italy and eastern europe the move be so far successful the pope become alarmed and hurriedly break off he alliance with venice on the plea that the prevention of fresh schism in the church must take precedence of every other consideration the real fact of the matter be he dread the fate of pope john xxiii for he know the action of he nephew girolamo riario would not stand conciliar examination moreover he other nephew giuliano dellum rovere afterward pope julius ii a bitter enemy to girolamo and lorenzo 's warm friend have during the disgrace of he cousin gain the pope 's ear and tell he some plain but wholesome truth regard the unpleasant consequence of a permanent rupture with lorenzo all these consideration induce sixtus to yield and leave venice to prosecute the war alone this it do against a quadruple alliance for the pope when the haughty republic of the lagoon refuse to disgorge its ferrarese prey at he order promptly change side and be as keen against the aggressor as he have previously be favorable to it the venetian sustain two severe defeat while they fleet be almost shatter by a storm the pecuniary strain be beyond they resource longer to maintain they therefore resort to the customary project of induce some other power to intervene in this case they take the step of invite the duke of orlean to lay claim to the dukedom of milan and the duke of lorraine to the throne of naple the move be successful as regard ludovico of milan he withdraw from the alliance and much against the wish of the other ally the peace of bagnolo be conclude in August 1484 to sixtus the news come as the knell of he dearest hope he give way to one wild outburst of passion in which he curse all who have be engage in make peace then apoplexy supervened and within a few hour he be a corpse he be succeed by cardinal cybo a warm friend toward the medicus and one who have such a profound admiration for the genius of lorenzo in statecraft that he seldom take any step without consult he though unfortunately he do not always follow the magnifico 's advice if no one else reap honor and glory from this ferrarese war lorenzo undoubtedly do so by both side the fact be admit that he have act throughout as a far-seeing sagacious diplomatist who while give preeminence as be natural to the welfare of he own state have seek to conserve the cause of letter even amid the turmoil incident upon the collision of political interest he have prove the friend even of the enemy of he own country when once they have pass from the scene of conflict as for example when he dare girolamo riario to raise a finger in the direction of dispossess the son of the pope 's general ruberto malatesta of he riminus estate he be the friend of the oppressed everywhere and in more case than one he powerful protection save the child of he friend from be rob by powerful relative this connection between florence naple milan rome and ferrara tend to the promotion of intellectual intercourse between they as printing be now be briskly prosecute all over northern and central italy the interchange of literature go on ceaselessly among they this however be lorenzo 's last great war true he be implicate in the prolonged quarrel between the papacy and king ferrante of naple yet it be more as a mediator between the two antagonist than as the ally of the last-named that he take part in it although as armstrong point out he pay for the service of trivulsio and four hundred cross-bowman that by enable the neapolitan to check san severino the leader of the papal-venetian troops he might induce innocent viii to lose heart and retire from the struggle lorenzo during the last six year of he life or to speak more definitely after the peace of bagnolo have become in italian as he be rapidly become in european politics the master-spirit that inspire the move on the diplomatic chess-board in the mind of the historical student whose attention be direct to this period admiration and wonder go hand-in-hand as we contemplate the marvellous sagacity and prevision of the man together with the skill wherewith he make florence -- the weakest from a military point of view of the five greater italian power -- the one which exercise the most preponderating influence upon the affair of the peninsula he supreme genius conceive and consummate the great scheme for ensure the peace of italy by a triple alliance of the three larger state -- florence milan and naple -- against the other two venice and the papacy as show how entirely it be dependent upon he the alliance be operative only so long as he be alive to bind the antagonistic force of naple and milan together by the link of he own personal influence he in a word be the subtle acid holding in chemical combination many mutually repellent substance when he influence be withdraw by death within a few month they have all fall apart the triple alliance be forget and italy be doom even by those with whom he be nominally at war he be resort to for advice he it be that keep innocent viii from take up a position that would have render the papacy ridiculous in the eye of europe when he seek to threaten naple with consequence he be powerless to inflict many writer have accuse lorenzo of cowardice of pusillanimity of want of political resolution on account of this very course of action namely that he assist the enemy of florence to extricate themselves from they dilemma such criticism fail entirely to understand both the aim and the scope of he policy he desire to keep italy for the italian he clear-sighted sagacity see nothing but danger in the plan of ludovico of milan to invite the french king into italy or in those of venice to encourage the duke of lorraine to press he claim upon milan the intervention of either france or spain in italy be in he idea fraught only with dire disaster fain would he have patch up the quarrel between naple and the papacy by mutual concession because he foresee what would happen if the colossal northern power have they cupidity arouse regard italy and learn how defenceless she really be because he foresee so clearly the horror of the invasion of 1494 and 1527 he act as he do even toward those who be enemy of florence he alarm appear in the letter date July 1489 which he address to he ambassador in rome : i dislike these ultramontane and barbarian begin to interfere in italy we be so disunited and so deceitful that i believe that nothing but shame and loss would be we lot recent experience may serve to foretell the future how true a prophet he be the subsequent course of italian history reveal anxious though the situation be crucial though many of the problem he have to solve undoubtedly be yet the statement may be accept as approximately true that the last three or four year of lorenzo 's life be spend amid profound peace -- at least as far as florence be concerned roscoe 's picture be highly color but not overcolor : at this period the city of florence be at its highest degree of prosperity the vigilance of lorenzo have secure it from all apprehension of external attack and he acknowledged disinterestedness and moderation have almost extinguish that spirit of dissension for which it have be so long remarkable the florentine glory in they illustrious citizen and be gratify by numbering in they body a man who wield in he hand the fate of nation and attract the respect and admiration of all europe the administration of justice engage he constant attention and he carefully avoid give rise to a idea that he be himself above the control of the law and guicciardinus add : this season of tranquillity be prosperous beyond any that italy have experience during the long course of a thousand year abound in man eminent in the administration of public affair skilled in every honorable science and every useful art it stand high in the estimation of foreign nation which extraordinary felicity acquire at many different opportunity several circumstance contribute to preserve but among the rest no small share of it be by general consent ascribe to the industry and the virtue of lorenzo de ' medicus a citizen who rise so far above the mediocrity of a private station that he regulate by he counsel the affair of florence then more important by its situation by the genius of its inhabitant and the promptitude of its resource than by the extent of its dominion and who have obtain the implicit confidence of the roman pontiff innocent viii render he name great and he authority important in the affair of italy though he have never allow the demand of civic affair to interfere with he interest in the progress of the renaissance war-time as we have say be not favorable to the cultivation of letter while the connection between the state during the course of hostility undoubtedly promote the increase of mutual interest in each other 's intellectual development the fact that the magnifico have to disburse enormous sum for the prosecution of the campaign necessarily limit he ability to extend the same princely patronage to the cause of learning but with the conclusion of peace he resume the original scale of he benefaction and the last four year of he life be perhaps the most fruitful of all in sterling good achieve in the foster of the renaissance he encourage the printer to double they output he munificently assist such undertaking as the first edition of homer edit by the famous scholar demetrius chalcondyle and demetrius cretensis as well as other edition of the classic prepare by poliziano marullus and other in the final estimate of he influence upon he age we hope to show that he aim be as pure as the prosecution of its realization be determine he encourage foreigner to come to florence to study greek and when they fund fail they in many case he generously entertain they at he own expense grocyn and linacre as well as reuchlin testify to the wise generosity of the great magnifico and all three declare that to he more than to any other man the renaissance owe not only its development but even the character it assume in italy in the second last decade of the fifteenth century the end come when he be literally in he prime only forty-two year of age he might reasonably have look forward to many year of active work and the enjoyment of he honor but lorenzo although not a vicious be a pleasure-loving man and he have drain the cup of enjoyment to the very lee he constitution be undermine by worry and late vigil by the very intensity of interest wherewith he have devote himself to the pleasure of the moment accordingly late in 1491 he begin to feel the gout from which he have suffer for some year become so troublesome that he be unable for the duty devolve on he he have lose he wife clarice orsinus in July 1487 at a time when he be absent at the sulphur bath of filetta strive to obtain relief from pain therefore he last year be lonely indeed life have lose its relish to the die magnifico the only thing over which he show a flash of the old interest be in march 1492 when he son giovannus -lrb- afterward leo x -rrb- on be make a cardinal by innocent viii be invest with the _ insignia _ in the abbey church of fiesole although then within a month of he end although moreover so weak that he be unable to attend the investiture mass or to head he table at the banquet which follow he cause himself to be carry in a litter into the hall where he publicly pay reverence to he son as a prince of the church he then embrace he as a father and give he he paternal blessing that do and after address a few word of welcome to he guest collectively he be slowly bear back to he chamber to die nevermore be he see in public he ruling passion be however strong in death in place of surround himself with clergy he last hour be spend with the humanist and scholar he have love so well to he beautiful villa of careggus and to that room face the south which he call he own he retire and summon ficino poliziano and pico dellum mirandolum to bear he company until he dip he foot in the river of death they discuss many thing but principally the consolation afford by philosophy then they revert to the subject of the classic and to the valuable codex which lascari be bring back from greece but hope at last burned low and the physician have to confess that the case be beyond they skill how rudimentary as regard medical science that skill be may be judge from the fact that the staple remedy prescribe by the great milanese doctor lazaro da ficino who have be call in to consult with lorenzo 's own medical man pier leonus of spoleto be a potion compound of crushed pearl and jewel as might have be expect such a treatment accelerate rather than retard the disease the last hour of lorenzo and particularly he historic interview with savonarolum have often be describe and be to this day the subject of debate there be two side to every story and this one of the last visit of the haughty prior of san marco 's to the die magnifico be no exception poliziano relate the incident in one form the follower of savonarolum in another but neither report be absolutely authentic suffice it for we that benedetto write a week after the magnifico 's death say of the matter : we dear friend and master die so nobly with all the patience the reverence the recognition of god which the best of holy man and a soul divine could show with word upon he lip so kind that he seem a new st jerome perhaps the most reasonable attitude to assume toward the problem be that lorenzo die as he live feeling that strange restless curiosity as to what be sum up in the idea of a future life which he have manifest all he day : if i believe aught implicitly he be report to have say in earlier year to alberti i believe in plato 's doctrine of immortality in the _ phaedo _ for religion be too much a matter of temperament for we to lay down hard-and-fast rule about it lorenzo outwardly conform in he die hour to the rite of the catholic church he receive the _ viaticum _ kneel he repeat the response in a earnest and fervent tone and then when he feel that the grain in the hour-glass of life be run out he press a crucifix to he lip and so pass within the veil as a humanist he have be rear as a humanist he have live and labor as a humanist he die maintain to the very last he interest in those study which it have be he life 's passion to pursue the sun of the florentine renaissance have set forever -lrb- footnote 1 : by permission of selmar hess -rrb- death of charle the bold loui xi unite burgundy with the crown of france ad 1477 philippe de comine during the greater part of he rule as duke of burgundy charle the bold be at war with loui xi of france notwithstanding the treaty of péronne 1468 which the french monarch accept under duress meanwhile it be the constant aim of charle to enlarge he dukedom and when in 1475 he have make another peace with loui the duke turn anew to he scheme of conquest charle soon make himself master of lorraine which he have long coveted and then 1476 invade switzerland it be reserve for a small people already celebrate for they heroic valor and they love of liberty to beat this powerful man cross the jura charle besiege the little town of granson and after its capitulation he hang or drown all the defender when the news of this barbarity have spread through switzerland the eight canton arise and almost under the wall of granson the swiss inflict upon charle a crush defeat in June 1476 the duke see he second army destroy by the swiss and the lorrainer whom comine call german in the follow winter charle assemble a third army and march against nancy the capital of lorraine which be then hold by the same ally they be command by the duke of lorraine who go to the relief of the garrison at nancy from st nichola six mile away comine whose account be give below be a french statesman and historian who after be for a time in the service of charle the bold go over to loui and become he personal counsellor he be therefore intimately verse in the history of these time the duke of lorraine and he army of german break up from st nichola and advance toward the duke of burgundy with a resolution to give he battle the count of campobasso join they that very day and carry off with he about eightscore man-at-arms and it grieve he much that he could do he master no greater mischief the garrison of nancy have intelligence of he design which in some measure encourage they to hold out besides another person have get over the work and assure they of relief otherwise they be just upon surrender and would have capitulate in a little time have it not be for the treachery of this count but god have determine to finish this mystery the duke of burgundy have intelligence of the approach of the duke of lorraine 's army call a kind of council contrary to he custom for generally he follow he own will it be the opinion of most of he officer that he best way would be to retire to pont-à-mousson which be not far off and dispose he army in the town about nancy affirm that as soon as the german have throw a supply of man and provision into nancy they would march off again and the duke of lorraine be in great want of money it would be a great while before he would be able to assemble such a army again and that they supplies of provision could not be so great but before half the winter be over they would be in the same strait as they be now and that in the mean time the duke might raise more force and recruit himself for i have be tell by those who ought to know best that the duke of burgundy 's army do not then consist of full four thousand man and of that number not above one thousand two hundred be in a condition to fight money he do not want for in the castle of luxembourg -- which be not far off -- there be in ready cash four hundred fifty thousand crown which would have raise man enough but god be not so merciful to he as to permit he to take this wise counsel or discern the vast multitude of enemy who on every side surround he therefore he choose the worst plan and like a rash and inconsiderate madman resolve to try he fortune and engage the enemy with he weak and shattered army notwithstanding the duke of lorraine have a numerous force of german and the king 's army be not far off as soon as the count of campobasso arrive in the duke of lorraine 's army the german send he word to leave the camp immediately for they would not entertain such traitor among they upon which message he retire with he party to condé a castle and pass not far off where he fortify himself with cart and other thing as well as he could in hope that if the duke of burgundy be route he might have a opportunity of come in for a share of the plunder as he do afterward nor be this practice with the duke of lorraine the most execrable action that campobasso be guilty of but before he leave the army he conspire with several other officer -- find it be impracticable to attempt anything against the duke of burgundy 's person -- to leave he just as they come to the charge for at that time he suppose it would put the army into the greatest terror and consternation and if the duke flee he be sure he could not escape alive for he have order thirteen or fourteen sure man some to run as soon as the german come up to charge they and other to watch the duke of burgundy and kill he in the rout which be well enough contrived for i myself have see two or three of those who be thus employ to kill the duke have thus settle he conspiracy at home he go over to the duke of lorraine upon the approach of the german army but find they would not entertain he he retire to condé as i say before the german army march forward and with they a considerable body of french horse whom the king have give leave to be present in that action several party lay in ambush not far off that if the duke of burgundy be route they might surprise some person of quality or take some considerable booty by this everyone may see into what a deplorable condition this poor duke have bring himself by he contempt of good counsel both army be join the duke of burgundy 's force which have be twice beat before and be weak and ill-provided besides be quickly break and entirely defeat many save themselves by flight the rest be either take or kill and among they the duke of burgundy himself be kill on the spot not have be in the battle myself i will say nothing of the manner of he death but i be tell by some that they see he beat down but be prisoner themselves be not able to assist he yet while they be in sight he be not kill but a great body of man come that way afterward they kill and strip he in the throng not know who he be this battle be fight on January 5 1476 upon the eve of twelfth-day the king have establish post in all part of he kingdom -- which before never have be do -- it be not long ere he receive the news of the duke of burgundy 's defeat and he be in hourly expectation of the report for letter of advice have reach he before import that the german army be advance toward the duke of burgundy 's and that a battle be expect between they upon which many person keep they ear open for the news in order to carry it to the king for he custom be to reward liberally any person who bring he the first tiding of any news of importance and to remember the messenger besides he majesty also take great delight in talking of it before it arrive and would say i will give so much to any man who first bring I such and such news the lord du bouchage and i be together happen to receive the first news of the battle of morat and we go with it to the king who give each of we two hundred mark of silver the lord du lude who lay without the plessis have the first news of the arrival of the courier with the letter concern the battle of nancy he command the courier to deliver he the packet and as he be a great favorite of the king 's he dare not refuse he by break of day the next morning the lord du lude knock at the door next to the king 's chamber and it be open he deliver in the packet from the lord of craon and other officer but none of the first letter give any certainty of the duke 's death they only state that he be see to run away and that it be suppose he have make he escape the king be at first so transport with joy at the news he scarce know how to behave himself however he majesty be still in some perplexity on one hand he be afraid that if the duke should be take prisoner by the german by means of he money of which he have great store he would make some composition with they on the other he be doubtful if the duke have make he escape though defeat for the third time whether he should seize upon he town in burgundy or not which he judge not very difficult to do since most of the brave man of that country have be slay in those three battle as to this last point he come to this resolution -- which i believe few be acquaint with but myself -- that if the duke be alive and well he would command the army which lay ready in champagne and barroi to march immediately into burgundy and seize upon the whole country while it be in that state of terror and consternation and when he be in possession of it he would inform the duke that the seizure he have make be only to preserve it for he and secure it against the german because it be hold under the sovereignty of the crown of france and therefore he be unwilling it should fall into they hand and whatever he have take should be faithfully restore and truly i be of opinion he majesty would have do it though many people who be ignorant of the motive that guide the king will not easily believe it but this resolution be alter as soon as he be certain of the duke of burgundy 's death upon the king 's receive the above-mentioned first letter -- which give no account of the duke 's death -- he immediately send to tour to summon all he captain and other great personage to attend he upon they arrival he communicate he letter to they they all pretend great joy but to such as more narrowly observe they behavior it be easy to be discern that most of they do but feign it and notwithstanding all they outward dissimulation they have be better pleased if the duke of burgundy have be successful the reason of this might be because the king be greatly fear and now if he should find himself clear and secure from he enemy they be afraid they would be reduce or at least they office and pension retrench for there be several present who have be engage against he with he brother the duke of guienne in the confederacy call the public good after he majesty have discourse with they for some time he go to mass and then order dinner to be lay in he chamber and make they all dine with he there be with he he chancellor and some other lord of he council the king 's discourse at dinner-time be about this affair and i well remember that myself and other take particular notice how those who be present dine but to speak truth -- whether for joy or sorrow i can not tell -- there be not one of they that half fill he belly and certainly it could not have be from modesty or bashfulness before the king for there be not one among they but have dine with he majesty many time before as soon as the king rise from table he retire and distribute to some person certain land belong to the duke of burgundy as though he have be dead he despatch the bastard of bourbon admiral of france and myself into those part with full power to receive the homage of all such as be willing to submit and become he subject he order we to set out immediately and give we commission to open all he letter and packet which we might meet by the way that thereby we might ascertain whether the duke be dead or alive we depart with all speed though it be the coldest weather i ever feel in my life we have not ride above half a day 's journey when we meet a courier and command he to deliver he letter we learn by they that the duke of burgundy be slay and that he body have be find among the dead and recognize by a italian page that attend he and by one monsieur louppe a portuguese who be he physician and who assure the lord of craon that it be the duke he master and the lord of craon notify the same at once to the king upon receive this news we ride directly to the suburb of abbeville and be the first that announce the intelligence to the duke 's adherent in those part we find the inhabitant of the town in treaty with the lord of torcy for whom they have hold a great affection for a long time the soldier and officer of the duke of burgundy negotiate with we by means of a messenger whom he have send to they beforehand and in confidence of success they dismiss four hundred fleming who be then quarter in the town the citizen lay hold of this opportunity open the gate immediately to the lord of torcy to the great prejudice and disadvantage of the captain and officer of the garrison -- for there be seven or eight of they to whom by virtue of the king 's authority we have promise money and pension for life but they never enjoy the benefit of that promise because the town be not surrender by they abbeville be one of the town that charle vii deliver up by the treaty of arras in the year 1435 which town be to return to the crown of france upon default of issue male so that they admit we so easily be not so much to be wonder at from thence we march to dourlan and send a summons to arra the chief town in artoi and formerly part of the patrimony of the earl of flander which for want of heir male always descend to the daughter the lord of ravestein and the lord des cordes who be in the town of arras offer to enter into a treaty with we at mount st eloy and to bring some of the chief citizen with they it be conclude that i and some other should meet they in the king 's behalf but the admiral refuse to go himself because he presume they would not consent to grant all we demand i have not be long at the place of appointment when the two above-mentioned lord of ravestein and des cordes arrive attend by several person of quality and by certain commissioner on the part of the city one of whom be they pensionary name monsieur john de la vaquerie whom they appoint to be they spokesman and who since that time have be make first president of the parliament of pari we demand in the king 's name to have the gate immediately open and to be receive into the town for both the town and the whole country belong to the king by right of confiscation and if they refuse to obey this summons they would be in danger of be besiege and compel to submit by force since they duke be defeat and he dominion utterly unprovided with means of defense upon account of they irrecoverable loss in the three late battle the lord return answer by they speaker monsieur john de la vaquerie that the county of artoi belong to the lady of burgundy daughter of duke charle and descend to she in a right line from margaret countess of flander artoi burgundy never and rethel who be marry to philip i duke of burgundy son of king john of france and younger brother to king charle v wherefore they humbly entreat the king that he would observe and continue the truce that have exist between he and the late duke of burgundy she father we conference be but short for we expect to receive this answer but the chief design of my go thither be to have a private conference with some person that be thereto try if i could bring they over to the king 's interest i make overture to some of they who soon afterward do he majesty signal service we find the whole country in a state of very great consternation and not without cause for in eight day ' time they would scarce have be able to raise eight man-at-arms and for other soldier there be not in the whole country above one thousand five hundred -- reckon horse and foot together -- that have escape from the battle in which the duke of burgundy be slay and they be quarter about namur and hainault they former haughty language be much alter now and they speak with more submission and humility not that i would upbraid they with excessive arrogance in time past but to speak impartially in my time they think themselves so powerful that they speak neither of nor to the king with the same respect as they have do since and if people be wise they would always use such moderate language in they day of prosperity that in the time of adversity they would not need to change it i return to the admiral to give he a account of we conference and there i be inform that the king be come toward we and that upon receive the news of the duke 's death he immediately set out have despatch several letter in he own and he officer ' name to send after he what force could presently be assemble with which he hope to reduce the province i have just mention to he obedience the king be overjoy to see himself rid of all those whom he hate and who be he chief enemy on some of they he have be personally revenge as on the constable of france the duke of nemor and several other he brother the duke of guienne be dead and he majesty come to the succession of the duchy the whole house of anjou be extinct -- rené king of sicily john and nichola duke of calabrium and since they they cousin the count du maine afterward make count of provence the count d'armagnac have be kill at lestore and the king have get the estate and movable of all of they but the house of burgundy be greater and more powerful than the rest have maintain war with charle vii we master 's father for two-and-thirty year together without any cessation by the assistance of the english and have they dominion border upon the king 's and they subject always inclinable to invade he kingdom the king have reason to be more than ordinarily please at the death of that duke and he triumph more in he ruin than in that of all the rest of he enemy as he think that nobody for the future either of he own subject or he neighbor would be able to oppose he or disturb the tranquillity of he reign he be at peace with england and make it he chief business to continue so yet though he be free in this manner from all he apprehension god do not permit he to take such course in the management of he affair as be most proper to promote he own interest and design and certainly although god almighty have show and do still show that he determination be to punish the family of burgundy severely not only in the person of the duke but in its subject and estate yet i think the king we master do not take right measure to gain he end for if he have act prudently instead of pretend to conquer they he should rather have endeavor to annex all those large territory to which he have no just title to the crown of france by some treaty of marriage or to have gain the heart and affection of the people and so have bring they over to he interest which he might without any great difficulty have effect consider how they late affliction have impoverish and deject they if he have act after that manner he would not only have prevent they ruin and destruction but extend and strengthen he own kingdom and establish they all in a firm and lasting peace he might by this means have ease he own country of its intolerable grievance and particularly of the march and counter-march of he troops which be command continually up and down from one end of the kingdom to the other sometimes upon very slight occasion in the duke of burgundy 's lifetime the king often talk with I about this affair and tell I what he would do if he should outlive the duke and he discourse at that time be very rational and wise he tell I he would propose a match between he son and the duke of burgundy 's daughter and if she would not consent to that on the ground that the dauphin be too young he would then endeavor to marry she to some young prince of he kingdom by which mean he might keep she and she subject in amity and obtain without war what he intend to lay claim to for himself and this be he resolution not more than a week before he hear of the duke of burgundy 's death but the very day he receive that news he mind begin to change and this wise counsel be lay aside when the admiral and i be despatch into those province however the king speak little of what he intend to do -- only to some few that be about he he promise sundry of the duke 's lordship and possession as the king be upon the road toward we he receive from all part the welcome news of the deliver up the castle of han and bohain and that the inhabitant of st quentin have secure that town for themselves and open they gate to they neighbor the lord of mouy he be certain of peronne which be command by master william bische and by the overture that we and several other person have make he he be in great hope that the lord des cordes would strike in with he interest to ghent he send he barber master oliver -lrb- 1 -rrb- bear in a small village not far off and other agent he send to other place with great expectation from all of they and most of they promise he very fair but perform nothing upon the king 's arrival near peronne i go to wait on he majesty and at the same time william bische and other bring he the surrender of the town of péronne with which he be extremely pleased the king stay there that day and i dine with he accord to my usual custom for it be he humor to have seven or eight always with he at table and sometimes many more after dinner he withdraw and seem not to be at all pleased with the admiral 's little exploit and mine he tell we he have send he barber master oliver to ghent and he doubt not but he would persuade that town to submit to he and robinet dodenfort to st omer as he have great interest there and these he majesty extol as fit person to manage such affair to receive the key of great town and to put garrison of he troops into they he also mention other whom he have employ in the same negotiation in other place while the king be busy in subdue town and place in the march of picardy he army be in burgundy under the command apparently of the prince of orange a native and subject of the county of burgundy but one who have recently for the second time become a enemy of duke charle so that the king make use of he because he be a powerful noble in both the county and duchy of burgundy and be likewise well connect and greatly beloved but the lord of craon be the king 's lieutenant and have the real charge of the army and

twelfth century the church authority have be content with define heresy while the treatment of heretic be leave to secular magistrate but the spread of heresy at the end of the twelfth century cause the episcopal authority to look for some occasion for enlarge they prerogative in 1204 pope innocent iii appoint a papal delegate with authority to judge and punish misbeliever from this germ spring the holy office commonly know as the inquisition this papal act meet with some opposition from the bishop upon whose prerogative it encroach and it provoke rebellion among those against whom it be direct the albigens of southern france whose doctrine be spread into italy in 1208 innocent begin a crusade against they which be lead by arnold of citeaux and simon de montfort and prove a bloody war

be soon feel throughout southern europe and later in the netherland the order of st dominic at first furnish its principal agent but later the inquisition enter upon another stage under spanish direction through a specific organization practically independent of papal or royal control though act under the sanction of both church and state it become the most formidable of irresponsible engine in the annals of religious institution two point of view -- protestant and catholic -- be here present of the spanish history of the holy office william h rule better and happier luck for spain -- i translate the word of mariana -- be the establishment in castile which take place about this time of a new and holy tribunal of severe and grave judge for the purpose of make inquest and chastise heretical pravity and apostasy judge other than the bishop on whose charge and authority this office be anciently incumbent for this intent the roman pontiff give they authority and order be give that the prince should help they with they favor and arm these judge be call ` inquisitor ' because of the office which they exercise of hunting out and make inquest a custom now very general in italy france germany and also in the kingdom of aragon castile henceforth would not suffer any nation to go beyond she in the desire which she always have to punish such enormous and wicked excess we find mention before this of some inquisitor who discharge this function but not in the manner and force of those who follow they the chief author and instrument of this salutary grant be the cardinal of spain -lrb- mendoza -rrb- who have see that in consequence of the great liberty of past year and from the mingling of moor and jew with christian in all sort of conversation and trade many thing go out of order in the kingdom with that liberty it be impossible that some of the christian should not be infect many more leave the religion which they have voluntarily embrace as convert from judaism again apostatize and return to they old superstition -- a evil which prevail more in seville than in any other part in that city therefore secret search be first make and they severely punish those whom they find guilty if they delinquency be considerable after have keep they long time imprison and after have torment they they burn they if it be light they punish the offender with the perpetual dishonor of they family of not a few they confiscate the goods and condemn they to imprisonment for life on most of they they put a _ sambenito _ which be a sort of scapulary of yellow color with a red st andrew 's cross that they might go marked among they neighbor and bear a signal that should affright and scare by the greatness of the punishment and of the disgrace a plan which experience have show to be very salutary although at first it seem very grievous to the native cardinal mendoza might have be a instrument of establish the new tribunal in spain but no author be want for that work pope gregory ix fit successor of innocent iii have complete in spain as in the county of toulouse and kingdom of france the scheme which he uncle innocent begin by a bull date may 26 1232 he appoint dominican friar inquisitor in aragon and forthwith proceed to confer the same benefit on the kingdom of navarre castile and portugal granada be in possession of the moor ten year later in a council at tarragona the chief technicality of the spanish inquisition be settle at the invitation of peter archbishop of tarragona raymund of peñaforte the pope 's penitentiary preside the definition of the council be notable for the determination they evidence to conduct the affair of the tribunal with entire legal precision and formality the vocabulary be now settle and one have only to turn to the _ act _ of the council of tarragona to find the exact meaning of heretic believer suspect simple vehement most vehement favorer concealer receiver receptacle defender abettor relapse as everyone may well know no inconsiderable part of the spanish population consist of jew many of whose ancestor have take refuge in that country or have settle there for purpose of commerce age before the birth of we lord and they number have be increase from time to time in consequence of imperial edict which drive they from italy or by the attraction of honor and wealth in spain they be the most industrious and therefore the most wealthy people in those kingdom and have possess great influence they learn man occupy important station as physician agent of government and even officer of state while the new christian or jew professedly convert to christianity be intermarry with the highest family in spain and all this have take place in spite of the enmity of the clergy popular bigotry and the adverse legislation of _ corte _ or parliament but the wealth which procure jew and new christian so much worldly influence become the occasion of great suffer the old christian be less industrious and therefore less affluent be frequently they debtor and although usury be check by legislator who dread its pressure on themselves and debt be often repudiate the jew maintain they position of creditor and as the _ cartillum _ say creditor be often unreasonable person or at least be consider to be such christian of pure blood therefore find themselves involve in long reckoning become increasingly impatient and under a cloak of zeal for the catholic religion be incessantly embroil they with the magistracy or stir up the populace against they llorente estimate the number of jew who perish under the fury of mob in the year 1391 at upward of one hundred thousand to evade persecution multitude submit to be baptize more than a million have change name at the end of the fourteenth century after those tumult controversial preacher such as san vicente ferrer declaim for popery against judaism and in the first ten year of the fifteenth century a second multitude of forced convert throw themselves into the bosom of the romish church to the discouragement of they brethern and to they own confusion at last they be set under the keenest vigilance of the inquisitor without be able even to counterfeit any attachment to the church whose most grievous yoke they have put on but which in heart they hate now the church glory over the declension of judaism in presence of benedict xiii antipope a spaniard wander in spain because in rome they would not own he a formal disputation be carry on for sixty-nine day between jerome of santa fé and other convert -- or as the jew not improperly call they apostate -- on the one side and a company of rabbi on the other such a controversy carry on even in the presence of a half-pope could only come to the prescribe conclusion and after see all persuasion and corruption exhaust to bring over the hebrew to he sect but without much success benedict close the debate pronounce the jew vanquish and give they notice of severer

convert to note the newness of they christianity other confess to tell that they have confess the falseness of judaism sometimes they be brand as marano from the word _ maran atha _ which the priest in they ignorance take to mean accursed the whole be speak of as a generation of marano or worst of all in the imagination of a papist jew goad by the cowardly persecution the proselyte groan after deliverance a few even dare to renounce the profession of a faith they never hold and many resume the practice of jewish rite in private this open a new field to the zeal of the inquisitor but the labor of suppress a revolt so widely spread so rapidly extend and even infect the romish family with whom the imperfect convert be unite be more than the inquisitor could undertake without a more powerfully organize system of they own i believe that the fear of the bible and the hatred of the jew of spain first imprint in the page of history by the council of illiberi in the beginning of the fourth century be in course of time much aggravate by the earnest love of the spanish jew for the original scripture of the old testament it be not until the eleventh century that rabbinical tradition gain much hold in the jewish mind in spain but from the first christian have curse jew in sincere but blind zeal against the descendant as they think of those who crucify we lord in jerusalem yet the sephardim in spain could have have no knowledge of the crucifixion until some week at soonest after it have take place and perhaps never know of the hostility of the jew in jerusalem against the savior until the dispersion of the eastern college in the eleventh century no great rabbi come into spain with pretension of authority to enforce talmudical tradition when zealot of the sort do come they find a community of hebrew far superior to the jew of palestine no assyrian have bribe they to worship the god of nineveh they neighbor the carthaginian so long as carthage stand have persist in worship the baal and the ashtaroth that recreant israelite in samarium and jew in jerusalem worship for age but while those god have altar in sidon and in carthage we do not hear of any altar be raise to they in the captivity of jerusalem which be in sepharad or spain -lrb- obadiah 20 -rrb- neither do we hear that those jew betray any ambition to make a hedge to protect god 's law instead of take care to keep it but the first propagator of traditionism in spain come from the east on the break up of the great school of babylonium by the persian ancient or karaite synagogue remain in spain until the expulsion of jew at the close of the fifteenth century and yet much later in the province that be not annex to the unite kingdom of castillum and leon under ferdinand and isabellum some of the strongest feature of biblical learning impart to the literature of the reformation in its earlier stage proceed from the convert jew of spain about the year 1470 when the persecution of both jew and mahometan be at its height -- except in the kingdom of granada -- and when the testimony quote from the old testament against worship of image must have be extremely galling to the worshipper the priest think it necessary to enforce the prohibition of vernacular version of the bible such version we know be then circulate more freely in france spain and portugal in spain one of the chief translator be rabbi mose of toledo to put a stop to bible-read a appeal be make to pope paul ii who prohibit the translation of the holy scripture into the language of the nation this authority be quote in the council of trent by cardinal pacheco in justification of the practice of the church of rome in he day but another cardinal madruccus argue against he reply with cut calmness that paul of pope the second or any other pope might be easily deceive in judge of the fitness or unfitness of a law but not so paul the apostle who teach that god 's word should never depart from the mouth of the faithful during the persecution of the fifteenth century while ferdinand and isabellum make progress in reconquere the kingdom of granada from the moor and mahometanism like judaism be decline the morisco a middle class resemble the new christian and not less dangerous to romanism also challenge the power of the inquisition no other country in popedom be at that time more deeply imbue with disaffection of the doctrine and worship of the church of rome then in 1477 one brother philip de ' barberus a sicilian inquisitor come to the court of ferdinand and isabellum who be sovereign of sicily to solicit the confirmation of some privilege recently grant to the holy office in that island and have observe the peril of the church within the enlarged and united dominion of the catholic king under whose rule nearly all spain be comprehend advise the creation of one undivided court of inquisition like that of sicily as the only means of defense against the marano morisco jew and mussulman the advice be quickly take first of all the dominican and after they the dignitary of the secular clergy crowd round the throne to pray for a reformation of the inquisition after the sicilian model they appeal to the greed of king ferdinand by offer he the proceeds of a confiscation which might be rapidly effect in pursuance of law of the church to that intent provide they appeal to the piety of queen isabellum and be careful that tale of jewish murder and jewish desecration should be pour incessantly into the royal ear ferdinand have no scruple he sincerely pray the pope to sanction such a measure and swiftly as courier could bring it come the desire bull isabellum could not blame the zeal of priest and monk for she too be a zealot she could not gainsay the urgency of the nuncio she could not quench in she husband 's bosom the thirst of gold but she have bring half the kingdom as she dower and therefore some deference be due to she conscience and judgment and both in conscience and judgment she desire gentler measure during two or three year she orator and confessor write book and preacher be permit to publish argument and disputant to enter into conference for the conviction of the jew at she majesty 's request cardinal mendoza issue a constitution in seville in 1478 contain the form that should be observe with a christian from the day of he birth as well in the sacrament of baptism as in all other sacrament which he ought to receive and of what he should be teach and ought to do and believe as a faithful christian every day and at all time of he life until the day of he death and he order this to be publish in all the church of the city and put in table in each parish as a settle constitution he also publish a summary of what curate and clerk should teach they parishioner and what the parishioner should observe and show to they child thus do hernando del pulgar in he _ chronicle of the catholic sovereign _ describe what some too hastily call a catechism it be merely a standard of thing to be believe and do set forth by authority the king and queen also _ not the cardinal _ command some friar clerk and other religious person to teach the people but no true jew would let himself be teach that idolatry be not damnable and even the less discouraging issue of controversy with the vacillate or the ignorant be not honestly report the constitution of cardinal mendoza and the harangue of the friar be ineffectual as well they might be for the jew know that the christian have a sacred book say to be write by divine inspiration as well as the law of mose and if that book be not put into they hand they could scarcely be expect to believe a religion whose chief write authority be keep out of sight that it be indeed keep out of sight be undeniable and the notorious alfonso de castro chaplain of philip ii boast in he book against heresy that there be a edict of the most illustrious and catholic sovereign of spain ferdinand and isabellum in which under the severest penalty they forbid anyone to translate the holy scripture into a vulgar language or to have any such version in he possession for they be afraid lest any occasion of error should be give to the people over whom god have make they governor the clergy maintain that conversion to the truth by argument be impossible and at they instance the bull be no longer keep in reserve but be publish in 1480 the queen 's trial of humanity be end but a question of policy remain the king and queen remember that they have a interest in spain as well as the pope but they scarcely know how that interest could be guard if the inquisitor be allow absolute power over the person and property of they subject to have propose lay assessor and open court would have provoke a quarrel with the pope then powerful enough to raise europe in arm against they therefore they modestly request no more than that some priest nominate by the king should be associate with some other nominate by the pope or that the king should name all and the pope confirm he nomination the catholic sovereign calculate that nominee of rome would of course prefer the rights of the church to those of the crown but they fancy or they wish to fancy that priest of they own choice would prefer they interest to those of a stranger this be a illusion and therefore rome make little difficulty and after due correspondence and some change the supreme council of the spanish inquisition be constitute thus : inquisitor-general -- friar thomas de torquemada of whom llorente say that it be hardly possible that there could have be another man so capable of fulfil the intention of king ferdinand by multiply confiscation those of the court of rome by propagate they jurisdictional and pecuniary maxim and those of the projector of the inquisition by infuse terror into the people by public execution two assessor -- juan gutierrez de chabe and tristan de medina jurisconsult three king 's counsellor -- don alonso carillo a bishop-elect with sancho valasquez de cuellar and poncio de valencium doctor of civil law in matter relate to royal power they be to have a definite vote but in affair of spiritual jurisdiction they could only be suffer to offer a opinion inasmuch as a spiritual power reside in the chief inquisitor alone under the jurisdiction of the supreme council be four subordinate tribunal and eventually several other be add while some inquisitor hitherto hold special power from the pope be strip of they independence that the court of rome might have one uniform action throughout spain as the holy office advance in labor and experience the supreme council be enlarged and at last it consist of a president -- inquisitor-general for the time be six counsellor with the title of apostolic a fiscal a secretary of the chamber two secretary of the council a alguazil-in-chief or sheriff one receiver two reporter four apparitor one solicitor and as many consulter as circumstance might require of course these be all maintain in a style worthy of they office the inquisitor-general or president of the council exert a absolute power over every spanish subject so that he almost cease to be himself a subject he alone consult with the king concern the appointment of inquisitor to preside over all the provincial tribunal each of those inferior inquisition be manage by three inquisitor two secretary one under-sheriff one receiver and a certain number of trier and consulter they function be considerably restricted leave all capital case and ultimate decision in the hand of the madrid supreme but while ferdinand isabellum torquemada and the nuncio be concert they plan and prepare death for heretic what say spain to it neither be clergy nor laity content after the bull of sixtus iv empower the king to name inquisitor furnish with absolute authority and to remove they at pleasure have arrive but lay unpublished in consequence of the queen 's repugnance a provincial synod sit at seville where the regal court then be 1478 have the clergy of castile desire the inquisition the synod would have say so but so far be they from approve of such a tribunal to which every bishop would be subject but where no bishop would any longer have a voice that they pass over the affair of heresy in silence not consent to accept the inquisition yet not presume to remonstrate against it then would have be the time for the clergy to add they power to that of the throne for the suppression of false doctrine believe as they do believe that forcible suppression be not only lawful but meritorious in the sight of god and so they would probably have do if inquisitor and bishop be to have have coördinate jurisdiction as in the first inquisition of toulouse and in the early italian inquisition but they see with alarm that the episcopate be to be despoil of its authority at a stroke a few month before the publication of the bull but long after every person in spain know the purport of its contents and in the certainty that it would be carry into execution the corte of toledo meet but instead of avoid any act that would interfere with the new jurisdiction then to be introduce they make several provision for separate jew and christian by the enclosure of jewry in the town and for compelling the former to wear a peculiar garb and abstain from exercise the vocation of surgeon or physician or innkeeper or barber or apothecary among christian the parliament plainly ignore the inquisition in make this enactment on they own authority and what say the magistracy and the people seville represent the general state of feeling at the time there when a company of inquisitor present themselves conduct into the city by man and horse which have be impress for the purpose by royal order the civil authority refuse to help they notwithstanding the injunction of the bull the obligation of canon law and a mandate from the crown the new inquisitor find themselves unable to act for want of help meanwhile the object of they mission forsake the city and find shelter in the neighbor district and ferdinand have to issue specific order to overpower the hostility of all the class of the people and to compel the magistrate to assist the new set of officer ecclesiastic these order be most reluctantly obey thus fortify the inquisitor take up they abode in the dominican convent of st paul and issue they first mandate January 2 1481 they say that they be aware of the flight of the new christian and command the marquis of cadiz the count of arco and all the duke marquis count gentleman rich man and other of the kingdom of castile to arrest the fugitive and send they to seville within a fortnight sequestrate they property all who fail to do this be excommunicate as abettor of heresy depose from they dignity and deprive of they estate and they subject be to be absolved from homage and obedience crowd of fugitive be drive back into seville bind like felon the dungeon and apartment of the convent overflow with prisoner and the king assign the castle of triana on the opposite bank of the guadalquiver to the new and holy tribunal to be a place of safe custody there the inquisitor elate with triumph over the reluctant magistrate and panic-stricken people shortly afterward erect a tablet with a inscription in memory of the first establishment of the modern inquisition in western europe the conclude sentence of the inscription be : god grant that for the protection and augmentation of the faith it may abide unto the end of time -- arise o lord judge thy cause -- catch ye the fox they second edict be one of grace it summon all who have apostatize to present themselves before the inquisitor within a term appoint promise that all who do so with true contrition and purpose of amendment should be exempt from confiscation of they property -- it be understand that they should be punish in some other way -- but threaten that if they allow that term to pass over without repentance they should be deal with accord to the utmost rigor of the law many run to the convent of st paul hope to merit some small measure of indulgence but the inquisitor would not absolve they until they have disclose the name call residence and give a description of all other whom they have see hear or understand to have apostatize in like manner after get this information they bind the terrify informer to secrecy this first object be accomplish they send out a third monition require all who know any that have apostatize into the jewish heresy to inform against they within six day under the usual penalty but they have already mark the very man and those suspect convert suddenly see the apparitor inside they house and be drag away to the dungeon new christian who have preserve any of the familiar usage of they forefather such as put on clean clothes on Saturday who strip the fat from beef or mutton who kill poultry with a sharp knife cover the blood and mutter a few hebrew word who have eat flesh in lend bless they child lay hand on they head who observe any peculiarity of diet or distinction of feast or fast mourn for the dead after they ancient manner or whose friend have presume to turn the face toward a wall when in the agony of death all such be vehemently suspect of apostasy be to be punish accordingly thirty-six elaborate article be furnished whereby everyone be instruct how to ensnare he neighbor but what shall we say of a faith that could only hope to be keep alive in the world by the extinction of charity honor pity and humanity llorente describe the immediate issue : such opportune measure for multiply victim could not but produce the desire effect hence on January 6 1481 there be burn six unhappy person sixteen on march 26th many on April 21st and by November 4th two hundred ninety-eight in all besides these the inquisitor condemn seventy-nine to perpetual imprisonment and all this in the city of seville only since as regard the territory of this archbishopric and of the bishopric of cadiz juan de mariana say that in the single year of 1481 two thousand judaizer be burn in person and very many in effigy of whom the number be not know besides seventeen thousand subject to cruel penance among those burn be many principal person and rich inhabitant whose property go into the treasury as so many person be to be put to death by fire the governor of seville cause a permanent raise pavement or platform of masonry to be construct outside the city which have last to we time -lrb- until the french invasion if not later -rrb- retain its name of _ quemadero _ -lrb- ` burning-place ' -rrb- and at the four corner four large hollow statue of limestone within which they use to place the impenitent alive that they might die by slow heat i leave my reader to consider whether this punishment of a error of the understanding be consistent or not with the doctrine of the gospel fear cause a immense multitude of other of the same class of new christian to emigrate to france portugal and even africa but many other whose effigy have be burn appeal to rome complain of the injustice of those proceedings in consequence of which appeal the pope write on January 29 1482 to ferdinand and isabellum say that there be innumerable complaint against the inquisitor fray miguel morillo and fray juan de san martin especially because they have not confine themselves to canon law but declare many to be heretic that be not he holiness say that but for the royal nomination he would have deprive they of they office but that he revoke the power he have give to the sovereign to nominate other suppose that fit person would be find among those nominate by the general or the provincial of the dominican to whom the privilege belong and in prejudice of whose privilege the former nomination by ferdinand and isabellum have be allow so adroitly do the pope take the absolute control of the inquisition into he own hand under pretence of impartial justice and leave the weaker tyrant to eat the fruit of he doings but since that time pope and king have be again unite in the management of the holy office the latter however in abject subservience to the former neither in the appeal nor in the brief be there anything that could divert torquemada from the prosecution of he purpose and therefore he hasten to bring aragon under he jurisdiction ferdinand convene the corte of that kingdom in the city of tarragona April 1484 in that assembly appoint a junta to prepare measure for the establishment of another tribunal and then torquemada in pursuance of the latest pontifical decision create friar caspar inglar a preacher of the dominican community and pedro arbue de epila a canon of the metropolitan church inquisitor the king give a mandate to the civil authority -- a firman it might be call -- compelling they to lend aid to the new officer and on September 13th follow the grand justice of aragon with he five lieutenant of the long robe and various other magistrate swear upon the holy gospel that they would give man and arm to defend and to enforce the authority of the holy inquisition and as they swear thus the king 's chief secretary for aragon the prothonotary the vice-chancellor the royal treasurer -- whose own father and grandfather be jew and persecute by the old inquisitor -- together with a multitude of person of high rank and office in whose vein flow jewish blood and whose descendant be now among the first family in spain look on with dismay and send a deputation to rome bear remonstrance against the newly create inquisition and deputed other to present they appeal to the same effect at the court of ferdinand and isabellum all these deputy be afterward proceed against as hinderer of the holy office and meanwhile the inquisitor in contempt of opposition set themselves to work without delay in the month of may and June 1485 two act of faith be celebrate in saragossa capital of aragon and a large number of new christian burn alive the public be enraged certainly but helpless yet not so helpless but that many awake to a conviction that since the inquisitor have resort to terror for the conservation of the faith they ought to be restrain by terror in they turn in the night of September 14 1485 one of the inquisitor pedro arbue cover as usual with a coat of mail under he robe and wear a steel skull-cap under he hat -- for he be every moment conscious of guilt and apprehensive of retribution -- take a lantern in one hand and a bludgeon in the other and like a sturdy soldier of he peculiar church walk from he house to the cathedral of that same saragossa to join in matins he kneel down by one of the pillar set he lantern on the pavement he right hand hold the weapon of defense yet stealthily half cover with the cloak the canon in they place be chant hymn two man come and kneel down near he they understand as most spaniard do how most effectually to attack a man and how to kill he quickest therefore one of they suddenly disable he on one side by a blow on the left arm the other swing he cudgel at the back of he head just below the edge of the steel cap and lay he prone he never speak again but expire in a few hour this murder as might be expect be well make use of by the priest serve they to plead the necessity of a inquisition to repress violence and the inhabitant of the city be instantly overawe by a display of high judicial authority which they have no power to resist queen isabellum horrify at the murder of she confessor -- for confessor of the king be a honorary dignity confer on each inquisitor in spain -- erect a monument to he memory at she own expense and when the murder perpetrate by arbue himself have somewhat fade out of public memory he be beatify at rome and a chapel be construct for he veneration in the church where he have fall therein he remains be lay and over the spot where he receive the mortal blow a stone be place with the inscription : _ siste viator _ etc stay traveller thou adorest the place -lrb- _ locum adoras _ -rrb- where the bless pedro de arbue be lay low by two missile epila give he birth this city give he a canonry the apostolic see elect he to be the first father inquisitor of the faith because of he zeal he become hateful to the jew by whom slay he fall here a martyr in the year 1485 the most serene ferdinand and isabellum rear a marble mausoleum where he become famous for miracle alexander vii pontifex maximus write he into the number of holy and bless martyr on the 17th day of April in the year 1664 the tomb have be open the sacred ash be translate and place under the altar of the chapel -lrb- build by the chapter with the material of the tomb in the space of sixty-five day -rrb- with solemn rite and veneration on the 23d day of September in the year 1664 the intelligence of that murder throw all aragon into commotion the power ecclesiastical and royal pant for vengeance and the murderer be put to a most painful death the jews and new christian tremble with terror and rage the inhabitant of many town teruel valencium lerida and barcelona include compel the inquisitor to cease from inquest and it be only by means of military force after edict and bull have fail that the king and pope together could quash two year ' public resistance in saragossa where the murder have be contrived by a party of chief inhabitant a consciousness of guilt weaken they hand and they endeavor to save themselves by flight thousand of people desert the city although they have no participation in the deed and be everywhere treat as rebel and in that migration incident occur which might throw a tinge of horrible romance on we history let I briefly mention two a inhabitant of saragossa find he way to tudelum and there beg for shelter and concealment in the house of don jaime infante of navarre legitimate son of the queen of navarre and nephew of king ferdinand himself the infante could not refuse asylum and hospitality to a innocent fugitive he allow the man to hide himself for a few day and then pass on to france for this act of humanity don jaime be arrest by the inquisitor throw into prison as a impeder of the holy office bring thence to saragossa a place quite beyond the jurisdiction of navarre and there make to do open penance in the cathedral in presence of a great congregation at high mass and what penance the archbishop of saragossa preside but this archbishop be a boy of seventeen a illegitimate son of the king and he it be that command two priest to flog he father 's lawful nephew the infante of navarre with rod they whip don jaime around the church accordingly the other case be diabolical gaspar de santa cruz escape to toulouse where he die and be bury after he effigy have be burn in saragossa in this city live a son of he who in duty bind have help he to make good he retreat this son be delate as a impeder of the holy office arrest bring out at a act of faith make to read a condemnation of he deceased father and then send to the inquisitor at toulouse who take he to he father 's grave and compel he to dig up the corpse and burn it with he own hand whether the inquisitor be most barbarous or the young man most vile it may be difficult to say but it be a most infamous glory of the inquisition that for satisfaction of its own requirement the express law of god and man and the first instinct of humanity be equally set at naught the arch-inquisitor of spain shortly after he accession to the office summon the subaltern from they station to meet he at seville and frame with they a set of instruction for uniform administration they be publish twenty-eight in number on October 29 1484 on January 9 1485 eleven more be add the spirit of these instruction pervade the _ directory _ of eymeric into which they be incorporate by he commentator it be only important to mention here that on the present occasion a agent be appoint to represent this inquisition at rome and there to defend the inquisitor on occasion of appeal from the subject of inquisitorial violence or from they friend or they survivor and this be in spite of a bull send into spain two year before appoint the archbishop of seville sole judge of such appeal but that bull be a mere feint for conciliation and never act on at rome we must not fail to mark this point in the history forasmuch as here begin the practically juridical relation between the court of rome as supreme and the province of the roman church as subordinate in matter concern inquisition jame balme as to the spanish inquisition which be only a extension of that which be establish in other country we must divide it with respect to its duration into three great period we omit the time of its existence in the kingdom of aragon before its introduction into castile the first of these comprehend the time when the inquisition be principally direct against the relapse jew and moor from the day of its installation under the catholic sovereign till the middle of the reign of charle v the second extend from the time when it begin to concentrate its effort to prevent the introduction of protestantism into spain until that danger entirely cease that be from the middle of the reign of charle v till the come of the bourbon the third and last period be that when the inquisition be limit to repress infamous crime and exclude the philosophy of voltaire this period be continue until its abolition in the beginning of the nineteenth century it be clear that the institution be successively modify accord to circumstance at these different epoch -- although it always remain fundamentally the same -- the commencement and termination of each of these three period which we have point out can not be precisely marked nevertheless these three period really exist in its history and present we with very different character everyone know the peculiar circumstance in which the inquisition be establish in the time of the catholic sovereign yet it be worthy of remark that the bull of establishment be solicit by queen isabellum that be by one of the most distinguished sovereign in we history -- by that queen who still after three century preserve the respect and admiration of all spaniard isabellum far from oppose the will of the people in this measure only realize the national wish the inquisition be establish chiefly against the jew before the inquisition publish its first edict date seville in 1481 the corte of toledo in 1480 have adopt severe measure on the subject to prevent the injury which the intercourse between jew and christian might occasion to the catholic faith the corte have order that unbaptized israelite should be oblige to wear a distinctive mark dwell in separate quarter call _ juivery _ and return there before night ancient regulation against they be renew the profession of doctor surgeon shopkeeper barber and tavern-keeper be forbid they intolerance be therefore popular at that time if the inquisition be justify in the eye of friend to monarchy by conformity with the will of king it have a equal claim to be so in the eye of lover of democracy no doubt the heart be grieve at read the excessive severity exercise at that time against the jew but must there not have be very grave cause to provoke such excess the danger which the spanish monarchy not yet well establish would have incur if the jew then very powerful on account of they riches and they alliance with the most influential family have be allow to act without restraint have be point out as one of the most important of these cause it be greatly to be fear that they would league with the moor against the christian the respective position of the three nation render this league natural this be the reason why it be look upon as necessary to break a power which be capable of compromise anew the independence of the christian it be necessary also to observe that at the time when the inquisition be establish the war of eight hundred year against the moor be not yet finish the inquisition be project before 1474 it be establish in 1480 and the conquest of granada do not take place till 1492 thus it be found at the time when the obstinate struggle be about to be decide it be yet to be know whether the christian would remain master of the whole peninsula or whether the moor should retain possession of one of the most fertile and beautiful province whether these enemy shut up in granada should preserve a position excellent for they communication with africa and a means for all the attempt which at a later period the crescent might be dispose to make against we now the power of the crescent be very great as be clearly show by its enterprise against the rest of europe in the next century in such emergency after age of fight and at the moment which be to decide the victory forever have combatant ever be know to conduct themselves with moderation and mildness it can not be deny that the system of repression pursue in spain with respect to the jew and the moor be inspire in great measure by the instinct of self-preservation : we can easily believe that the catholic prince have this motive before they when they decide on ask for the establishment of the inquisition in they dominion the danger be not imaginary it be perfectly real in order to form a idea of the turn which thing might have take if some precaution have not be adopt it be enough to recollect the insurrection of the last moor in later time yet it would be wrong in this affair to attribute all to the policy of royalty and it be necessary here to avoid exalt too much the foresight and design of man for my part i be incline to think that ferdinand and isabellum naturally follow the generality of the nation in whose eye the jew be odious when they persevere in they creed and suspect when they embrace the christian religion two cause contribute to this hatred and animadversion : first the excited state of religious feeling then general in all europe and especially in spain second the conduct by which the jew have draw upon themselves the public indignation the necessity of restrain the cupidity of the jew for the sake of the independence of the christian be of ancient date in spain : the old assembly of toledo have attempt it in the follow century the evil reach its height a great part of the riches of the peninsula have pass into the hand of the jew and almost all the christian find themselves they debtor thence the hatred of the people against the jew thence the frequent trouble which agitate some town of the peninsula thence the tumult which more than once be fatal to the jew and in which they blood flow in abundance it be difficult for a people accustom for age to set themselves free by force of arm to resign themselves peacefully and tranquilly to the lot prepare for they by the artifice and exaction of a strange race whose name moreover bear the recollection of a terrible malediction in later time a immense number of jew be convert to the christian religion but the hatred of the people be not extinguish thereby and mistrust follow these convert into they new state it be very probable that a great number of these conversion be hardly sincere as they be partly cause by the sad position in which the jew who continue in judaism be place in default of conjecture found on reason in this respect we will regard as a sufficient corroboration of we opinion the multitude of judaize christian who be discover as soon as care be take to find out those who have be guilty of apostasy however this may be it be certain that the distinction between new and old christian be introduce the latter denomination be a title of honor and the former a mark of ignominy the convert jew be contemptuously call _ marano _ -lrb- impure man pig -rrb- with more or less foundation they be accuse of horrible crime in they dark assembly they commit it be say atrocity which could hardly be believe for the honor of humanity for example it be say that to revenge themselves on the christian and in contempt of religion they crucify christian child take care to choose for the purpose the greatest day among christian solemnity there be the often-repeated history of the knight of the house of guzman who be hide one night in the house of a jew whose daughter he love see a child crucify at the time when the christian celebrate the institution of the sacrifice of the eucharist besides infanticide there be attribute to the jew sacrilege poisoning conspiracy and other crime that these rumor be generally believe by the people be prove by the fact that the jew be forbid by law to exercise the profession of doctor surgeon barber and tavern-keeper this show what degree of confidence be place in they morality it be useless to stay to examine the foundation for these sinister accusation we be not ignorant how far popular credulity will go above all when it be under the influence of excite feeling which make it view all thing in the same light it be enough for we to know that these rumor circulate everywhere and with credit to understand what must have be the public indignation against the jew and consequently how natural it be that authority yield to the impulse of the general mind should be urge to treat they with excessive rigor the situation in which the jew be place be sufficient to show that they might have attempt to act in concert to resist the christian what they do after the death of st peter arbue show what they be capable of do on other occasion the fund necessary for the accomplishment of the murder -- the pay of the assassin and the other expense require for the plot -- be collect by means of voluntary contribution impose on themselves by all the jew of aragon do not this show a advanced state of organization which might have become fatal if it have not be watch in allude to the death of st peter arbue i wish to make a observation on what have be say on this subject as prove the unpopularity of the establishment of the inquisition in spain what more evident proof we shall be tell can you have than the assassination of the inquisitor be it not a sure sign that the indignation of the people be at its height and that they be quite oppose to the inquisition would they otherwise have be hurry into such excess if by the people you mean the jew and they descendant i will not deny that the establishment of the inquisition be indeed very odious to they but it be not so with the rest of the nation the event we be speak of give rise to a circumstance which prove just the reverse when the report of the death of the inquisitor be spread through the town they go in crowd in pursuit of the new christian so that a bloody catastrophe would have ensue have not the young archbishop of saragossa alphonsus of aragon present himself to the people on horseback and calm they by the assurance that all the rigor of the law should fall on the head of the guilty be the inquisition as unpopular as it have be represent and will it be say that its adversary be the majority of the people why then could not the tumult of saragossa have be avoid in spite of all the precaution which be no doubt take by the conspirator at that time very powerful by they riches and influence at the time of the greatest rigor against the judaize christian there be a fact worthy of attention person accuse or threaten with the pursuit of the inquisition take every means to escape the action of that tribunal : they leave the soil of spain and go to rome would those who imagine that rome have always be the hot-bed of intolerance the firebrand of persecution have imagine this the number of cause commence by the inquisition and summon from spain to rome be countless during the first fifty year of the existence of that tribunal and it must be add that rome always incline to the side of indulgence i do not know that it would be possible to cite one accuse person who by appeal to rome do not ameliorate he condition the history of the inquisition at that time be full of contest between the king and pope and we constantly find on the part of the holy see a desire to restrain the inquisition within the bound of justice and humanity the line of conduct prescribe by the court of rome be not always follow as it ought to have be thus we see the pope compel to receive a multitude of appeal and mitigate the lot that would have befall the appellant if they cause have be definitely decide in spain we also see the pope name the judge of appeal at the solicitation of the catholic sovereign who desire that cause should be finally decide in spain : the first of these judge be inigo manrique archbishop of seville nevertheless at the end of a short time the same pope in a bull of August 2 1483 say that he have receive new appeal make by a great number of the spaniard of seville who have not dare to address themselves to the judge of appeal for fear of be arrest such be then the excitement of the public mind such be at that time the necessity of prevent injustice or measure of undue severity the pope add that some of those who have have recourse to he justice have already receive the absolution of the apostolical penitentiary and that other be about to receive it he afterward complain that indulgence grant to diver accuse person have not be sufficiently respect at seville in fine after several other admonition he observe to ferdinand and isabellum that mercy toward the guilty be more please to god than the severity which it be desire to use and he give the example of the good shepherd follow the wander sheep he end by exhort the sovereign to treat with mildness those who voluntarily confess they fault desire they to allow they to reside at seville or in some other place they might choose and to allow they the enjoyment of they property as if they have not be guilty of the crime of heresy moreover it be not to be suppose that the appeal admit at rome and by virtue of which the lot of the accuse be improve be found on error of form and injustice commit in the application of the law if the accuse have recourse to rome it be not always to demand reparation for a injustice but because they be sure of find indulgence we have a proof of this in the considerable number of spanish refugee convict at rome of have fall into judaism two hundred fifty of they be find at one time yet there be not one capital execution some penance be impose on they and when they be absolved they be free to return home without the least mark of ignominy this take place at rome in 1498 it be a remarkable thing that the roman inquisition be never know to pronounce the execution of capital punishment although the apostolic see be occupy during that time by pope of extreme rigor and severity in all that relate to the civil administration we find in all part of europe scaffold prepare to punish crime against religion scene which sadden the soul be everywhere witness rome be a exception to the rule -- rome which it have be attempt to represent as a monster of intolerance and cruelty it be true that the pope have not preach like protestant universal toleration but fact show the difference between pope and protestant the pope arm with a tribunal of intolerance have not spill a drop of blood protestant and philosopher have shed torrent what advantage be it to the victim to hear he executioner proclaim toleration it be add the bitterness of sarcasm to he punishment the conduct of rome in the use which she make of the inquisition be the best apology of catholicity against those who attempt to stigmatize she as barbarous and sanguinary in truth what be there in common between catholicity and the excessive severity employ in this place or that in the extraordinary situation in which many rival race be place in the presence of danger which menace one of they or in the interest which the king have in maintain the tranquillity of they state and secure they conquest from all danger i will not enter into a detailed examination of the conduct of the spanish inquisition with respect to judaize christian and i be far from think that the rigor which it employ against they be preferable to the mildness recommend and display by the pope what i wish to show here be that rigor be the result of extraordinary circumstance -- the effect of the national spirit and of the severity of custom in europe at that time catholicity can not be reproach with excess commit for these different reason still more if we pay attention to the spirit which prevail in all the instruction of the pope relate to the inquisition if we observe they manifest inclination to range themselves on the side of mildness and to suppress the mark of ignominy with which the guilty as well as they family be stigmatize we have a right to suppose that if the pope have not fear to displease the king too much and to excite division which might have be fatal they measure would have be carry still further if we recollect the negotiation which take place with respect to the noisy affair of the claim of the corte of aragon we shall see to which side the court of rome lean as we be speak of intolerance with regard to the judaizer let we say a few word as to the disposition of luther toward the jew do it not seem that the pretended reformer the founder of independence of think the furious declaimer against the oppression and tyranny of the pope should have be animated with the most humane sentiment toward that people no doubt the eulogist of this chieftain of protestantism ought to think thus also i be sorry for they but history will not allow we to partake of this delusion accord to all appearance if the apostate monk have find himself in the place of torquemada the judaizer would not have be in a better position what then be the system advise by luther accord to seckendorff one of he apologist they synagogue ought to be destroy they house pull down they prayer-book the _ talmud _ and even the book of the old testament to be take from they they rabbi ought to be forbid to teach and be compel to gain they livelihood by hard labor the inquisition at least do not proceed against the jew but against the judaizer that be against those who after be convert to christianity relapse into they error and add sacrilege to they apostasy by the external profession of a creed which they detest in secret and which they profane by the exercise of they old religion but luther extend he severity to the jew themselves so that accord to he doctrine no reproach can be make against the sovereign who expel the jew from they dominion the moor and the morisco no less occupy the attention of the inquisition at that time and all that have be say on the subject of the jew may be apply to they with some modification they be also a abhorred race -- a race which have be contend with for eight century when they retain they religion the moor inspire hatred when they abjure it mistrust the pope interested themselves in they favor also in a peculiar manner we ought to remark a bull issue in 1530 which be express in language quite evangelical : it be there say that the ignorance of these nation be one of the principal cause of they fault and error the first thing to be do to render they conversion solid and sincere be accord to the recommendation contain in this bull to endeavor to enlighten they mind with sound doctrine it will be say that the pope grant to charle v the bull which release he from the oath take in the corte of saragossa in the year 1519 a oath by which he have engage not to make any change with respect to the moor whereby it be say the emperor be enable to complete they expulsion but we must observe that the pope for a long time resist that concession and that if he at length comply with the wish of the emperor it be only because he think that the expulsion of the moor be indispensable to secure the tranquillity of the kingdom whether this be true or not the emperor and not the pope be the better judge the latter place at a great distance could not know the real state of thing in detail moreover it be not the spanish monarch alone who think so it be related that franci i when a prisoner at madrid one day converse with charle v tell he that tranquillity would never be establish in spain if the moor and morisco be not expel murder of the prince in the tower ad 1483 jame gairdner the brief reign of richard iii 1483-1485 leave for historian one subject of dispute which even to we own day have not be finally determine -- he alleged murder of he nephew king edward v and richard duke of york son of edward iv these prince at the suppose time of they death be about thirteen and nine year of age respectively before he usurpation richard iii last of the plantagenet line be know as the duke of gloucester he serve in the war of the rose and on the death of edward iv April 1483 he seize the young edward v and cause himself to be proclaimed protector he then cause he parliament to set the two prince aside as illegitimate and they be imprison in the tower of london on June 26 1483 richard assume the crown and soon after the death of the prince be publicly announce in gairdner 's discussion we have the result of the best historical inquiry concern this most important question of richard 's career a great amount of public anxiety prevail touch the two young prince in the tower they be virtually prisoner and they confinement create great dissatisfaction a movement in they behalf be get up in the south of england while richard be away in kent sussex and essex in hampshire wiltshire and dorset even as far west as devonshire cabal be form for they liberation which all appear to have be part of one great conspiracy organize in secret by the duke of buckingham by the beginning of October some disturbance have actually take place and the follow letter be write in consequence by the duke of norfolk to one of he dependent in norfolk : _ to my right well-beloved friend john paston be this deliver in haste _ right well-beloved friend i commend I to you it be so that the kentish man be up in the weald and say that they will come and rob the city which i shall let -lrb- _ i e _ prevent -rrb- if i may therefore i pray you that with all diligence you make you ready and come hither and bring with you six tall fellow in harness and ye shall not lose you labor that knoweth god who have you in he keep write at london the 10th day of October you friend j norfolk the rumor of the project movement in behalf of the prince be speedily follow by the report that they be no more of course they have be remove by violence regard the time and manner of the deed no news could then be obtain but the news that the depose king and he brother have be assassinate be spread with horror and amazement through the land among all the inhumanity of the late civil war there have be nothing so unnatural as this to many the tale seem too cruel to be true they believe that the prince must have be send abroad to defeat the intrigue of they friend but time pass away and they never appear again after many year indeed a impostor counterfeit the younger but even he to give credit to he pretension expressly admit the murder of he elder brother nevertheless there have be writer in modern day who have show plausible grounds for doubt that the murder really take place two contemporary writer they say mention the fact only as a report a third certainly state it incorrectly at least in point of time and sir thoma more who be the only one remain relate it with certain detail which it do seem difficult to accept as credible more 's account however must bear some resemblance to the truth it be mainly found upon the confession of two of the murderer and be give by the writer as the most trustworthy report he have meet with if therefore the murder be not itself a fiction and the confession as have be surmise a forgery we should expect the account give by sir thoma more to be in the main true clear and consistent though horace walpole and other have maintain that it be not so the substance of the story be as follow : richard some time after he have set out on he progress send a special messenger and confidant by name john green to sir robert brackenbury the constable of the tower command he to put the two prince to death brackenbury refuse to obey the order and green return to he master at warwick the king be bitterly disappointed whom shall a man trust he say when those who i think would most surely serve I at my command will do nothing for I the word be speak to a private attendant or page who tell he in reply that there be one man lie on a pallet in the outer chamber who would hardly scruple to undertake anything whatever to please he this be sir jame tyrell who be describe by more as a ambitious aspire man jealous of the ascendency of sir richard ratcliffe and sir william catesby richard at once act upon the hint and call tyrell before he communicate he mind to he and give he a commission for the execution of he murderous purpose tyrell go to london with a warrant authorize brackenbury to deliver up to he for one night all the key of the tower arm with this document he take possession of the place and proceed to the work of death by the instrumentality of mile forest one of the four jailer in whose custody the prince be and john dighton he own groom when the young prince be asleep these man enter they chamber and take up the pillow press they hard down upon they mouth till they die by suffocation then have cause sir jame to see the body they bury they at the foot of a staircase but it be rumor say more that the king disapprove of they be bury in so vile a corner whereupon they say that a priest of sir robert brackenbury 's take up the body again and secretly inter they in such place as by the occasion of he death could never come to light sir jame have fulfil he mission return to the king from whom he receive great thanks and who sir thoma inform we as some say there make he a knight it have be maintain that this story will not bear criticism what could have induce richard to time he cruel policy so ill and to arrange it so badly the order for the destruction of the child could have be much more easily safely and secretly execute when he be in london than when he be at gloucester or warwick fewer message would have suffice and neither warrant nor letter would have be necessary be it a sudden idea which occur to he upon he progress if so he might surely have wait for a better opportunity if not he might at least have take care to sift brackenbury before leave london so as to be sure of the two he intend to employ be it likely that richard would have give order for the commission of a crime without have good reason to rely upon he intended agent 's boldness and depravity but have try sir robert 's scruple and find they somewhat stronger than he anticipate what follow it might have be expect that sir robert 's respect for he master if he have any would have be diminish that the favor of he sovereign would have be withdraw from he and perhaps that the tyrant have see a instance of the untrustworthiness of man in matter criminal and dangerous would have learn to become a little more circumspect but the fact be quite otherwise sir robert continue long after in the good grace of he sovereign always remain faithful to he even when many other desert he and finally fall in battle bravely fight in he cause richard do not become more cautious but on the contrary more imprudent than ever he complain loudly of he disappointment even in the presence of a page this page be nameless in the story but he serve to introduce to the king not less a person than sir jame tyrell who be represent as willing to do anything to obtain favor and envious of the influence possess by other he undertake and execute the task which brackenbury have refuse and for this service we be tell he be knight all this greatly misrepresent sir jame ' position and influence if not he character he not only be a knight long before this but have be in the preceding year create by richard himself a knight banneret for he distinguished service during the scotch campaign he have be during edward iv 's reign a commissioner for execute the office of lord high constable he be then master of the king 's henchman or page he be also master of the horse if he mere position in the world do not make he disdain to be a hire assassin he at least do not require to be recommend through the medium of that nameless page moreover it appear that the fact of the prince have be murder be hold in great doubt for a long time afterward even more himself write about thirty year later be oblige to acknowledge that the thing have so far come in question that some remain long in doubt whether they be in richard 's day destroy or no this be certainly remarkable when it be consider that it be of the utmost importance for henry vii to terminate all controversy upon the question yet sir thoma tell we that these doubt arise not only from the uncertainty man be in whether perkin warbeck be the true duke of york but for that also that all thing be so covertly demean one thing pretend and another mean that there be nothing so plain and openly prove but that yet for the common custom of close and covert deal man have it ever inwardly suspect all this it be urge may very well suggest that the doubt be reasonable and that the prince in reality be not destroy in the day of richard iii and indeed when we consider how many person accord to more 's account take part in the murder or have some knowledge of it it do appear not a little strange that there should have be any difficulty in establish it on the clearest evidence for besides tyrell dighton and forest the chief actor there be brackenbury green the page one black will or will slaughter who guard the prince and the priest who bury they all fully aware of the circumstance of the crime in henry vii 's time brackenbury be dead and so it be say be the priest forest too have end he day miserably in a sanctuary but it do not appear what have become of either green or the page tyrell and dighton be the only person say to have be examine and though we be tell that they both confess yet there be a circumstance that make the confession look exceedingly suspicious tyrell be detain in prison and afterward execute for a totally different offence while as bacon tell we john dighton _ who it seemeth spake best for the king _ be forthwith set at liberty take bacon 's view of the circumstance of the disclosure as if it be infallible the sceptic here find matter of very grave suspicion in truth say walpole every step of this pretended discovery as it stand in lord bacon warn we to give no heed to it dighton and tyrell agree both in a tale _ as the king give out _ they confession therefore be not publicly make and as sir jame tyrell too be suffer to live but be shut up in the tower and put to death afterward for we know not what treason what can we believe but that dighton be some low mercenary wretch hire to assume the guilt of a crime he have not commit and that sir jame tyrell never do never would confess what he have not do and be therefore put out of the way on a fictitious imputation it must be observe too that no inquiry be make into the murder on the accession of henry vii -- the natural time for it when the passion of man be heat and when the duke of norfolk lord lovel catesby ratcliffe and the real abettor or accomplice of richard be attaint and execute no mention of such a murder be make in the very act of parliament that attaint richard himself and which would have be the most heinous aggravation of he crime and no prosecution of the suppose assassin be ever think of till eleven year afterward on the appearance of perkin warbeck such be the striking argument by which it have be seek to cast a doubt upon the murder and particularly more 's account of it to all which it may be reply in the first place that it be by no means necessary to suppose more 's narrative though it appear to he the most credible account he have hear absolutely correct in all its detail especially in those which he mention as mere report he authority be evidently the allege confession of tyrell and dighton obtain second-hand this though true in the main may not have be absolutely correct even as it be first deliver and may have be somewhat less accurate as it be report to sir thoma who perhaps add from hearsay a few error of he own like that about sir jame tyrell 's knighthood secondly the argument with regard to richard 's imprudence in pursue the course ascribe to he go but little way to discredit the fact unless it can be show that caution and foresight be part of he ordinary character the prevail notion of richard iii indeed be of a cold deeply politic scheming and calculate villain but i confess i be not satisfy of the justice of such a view not only richard but all he family appear to I to have be headstrong and reckless as to consequence he father lose he life by a chivalrous and quixotic impetuosity he brother edward lose he kingdom once by pure carelessness he brother clarence fall no less by lack of wisdom than by lack of honesty and he himself at bosworth throw away he life by he eagerness to terminate the contest in a personal engagement have richard fully intend to murder he nephew at the time he determine upon dethrone the elder i have very little doubt that he would have keep he northern force in london to preserve order in the city till after the deed be do i for my part do not believe that such be he intention from the first how much more probable indeed that after he have leave london the contemplated rise in favor of the prince suggest to he a action which cost he he peace of mind during the whole of he after-life thirdly the doubt of contemporary do not appear to have be very general the expression of sir thoma more be only that some remain in doubt and more be not a writer who would have gloss over a fact to please the court as to perkin warbeck who pretend to be the younger of the prince henry vii 's neglect to confute he pretension may have arise from other cause than a suspicion that he be the true duke of york there be no reason to suppose that he follower in england be numerous the belief in the murder appear to have be general it be mention as a fact by the chancellor of france in address the estates-general which meet at tour in the follow January it be acknowledge to be true in part by warbeck himself who it have be show since walpole 's time in personate the duke of york admit that he brother edward have be murder though he assert that he himself have providentially escape it be evident that no one dream in those day that the story of the murder be altogether a fiction the utmost that any well-informed person could doubt be whether it have be successfully accomplish as to both the victim with regard to the confession of tyrell and dighton bacon have certainly speak without warrant in state that they be examine at the time of warbeck 's appearance the time when they be examine be state by sir thoma more to have be when tyrell be confine in the tower for treason against henry vii which be in 1502 three year after warbeck 's execution before that date there be no ground for believe that tyrell 's guilt in regard to the murder be generally know before that date indeed the world seem to have have no conception in what manner the crime be commit and the common story seem to have be that richard have put he nephew to the sword but the confession of tyrell at once put a end to this surmise and we hear of it no longer henry vii assuredly do not for a long time treat he as a criminal for not only do he hold under henry the office of captain of guisne but he be employ by the king in a expedition against flander nay even after warbeck have be take and confess he imposture tyrell be employ on a important embassy to maximilian king of the roman it be quite clear therefore that he be never question about the murder in consequence of warbeck 's pretension but be afterward condemn to death on a charge of treason -- not a unknown charge as walpole imagine but a charge of have treasonably aid the escape of the earl of suffolk -- he be then as more say examine about it in the tower have probably make a voluntary confession of guilt to ease he conscience before he execution no doubt after all the murder rest upon the testimony of only a very few original authority but this be simply owe to the scantiness of contemporary historian it be true also that of these there be two who only mention it as a report but it must be observe that neither of they express the smallest doubt of its truth and one of they more than hint that he believe it as a fact how indeed could there possibly be two opinion about a rumor of this kind see that it be never contradict by the king himself assuredly from this time the conduct both of richard and he enemy be distinctly govern by the belief that he nephew be no longer alive moreover the truth of the story seem to be corroborate by a discovery which take place in the reign of charle ii in the process of alter the staircase lead to the chapel in the white tower the skeleton of two young lad whose apparent age agree with those of the unfortunate prince be find bury under a heap of stone they place of sepulture correspond with the situation mention in the confession of the murderer so that the report allude to by more of the removal of the body seem to have be a mistake the antiquary of the day have no doubt they be the remains of young edward v and he brother and king charle cause they to be fittingly inter in henry vii 's chapel at westminster a latin inscription mark the spot and tell of the discovery we have no doubt therefore that the dreadful deed be do it be do indeed in profound secrecy the fact i suspect remain some little time unknown and for year after there be no certainty as to the way it be perform year elapse even before the world suspect the foul blot upon tyrell 's knighthood and he enjoy the favor both of richard and of he successor but at last the truth come out as to the other agent in the business various entry in the patent roll and in the docket book of king richard 's grant show that they do not pass unrewarded before the murder green have be appoint comptroller of the custom at boston and have also be employ to provide horse meat and litter for the king 's stable afterward if we may trust a note by strype -- but i own i can not find he authority -- he be advance to be receiver of the isle of wight and of the castle and lordship of portchester to dighton be grant the office of bailiff of ayton in staffordshire forest die soon after and it appear he be keeper of the wardrobe at barnard castle but whether appoint before or after the murder there be no evidence to show brackenbury receive several important grant some of which be of land of the late lord river and yet hitherto richard 's life though not unmarked by violence have be free from violence to he own flesh and blood even he most unjustifiable measure be somewhat in the nature of self-defence or if in any case he have stain he hand with the blood of person absolutely innocent it be not in he own interest but in that of he brother edward iv the rough and illegal retribution which he deal out to river vaughan hawte lord richard gray and lord hasting be not more severe than perhaps law itself might have authorize the disorder of civil war have accustom the nation to see justice sometimes execute without the due formality and he neglect of those formality have not hitherto make he unpopular but the license of unchecked power be dangerous no less to those who wield than to those who suffer it and it be peculiarly so to one of richard 's violent and impatient

wall there be no longer any daring sally from they gate for a time they flatter themselves with hope that the late conflagration of the camp would discourage the besieger that as in former year they invasion would end with the summer and that they would again withdraw before the autumnal rain the measure of ferdinand and isabellum soon crush these hope they give order to build a regular city upon the site of they camp to convince the moor that the siege be to endure until the surrender of granada nine of the principal city of spain be charge with the stupendous undertaking and they emulate

greatly increase by the crusade and this together with the spread of commerce have quicken the desire of western people for still further exploration of the world during the first half of the fifteenth century the portuguese be most enterprising in the work of discovery and before 1500 they have search the western coast of africa pass the equator and see the cape of good hope which vasco

pontificate of alexander vi -rrb- because my undertaking have attain success i know that it will be please to you these i have determine to relate so that you may be make acquaint with everything do and discover in this we voyage on the thirty-third day after i depart from cadiz -lrb- 5 -rrb- i come to the indian sea where i find many island inhabit by man without number of all which i take possession for we most fortunate king with proclaim herald and fly standard no one object to the first of these i give the name of the bless savior -lrb- 6 -rrb- on whose aid rely i have reach this as well as the other island but the indian call it guanahanus i also call each one of the other by a new name for i order one island to be call santa marium of the conception -lrb- 7 -rrb- another fernandina -lrb- 8 -rrb- another isabellum -lrb- 9 -rrb- another juana -lrb- 10 -rrb- and so on with the rest as soon as we have arrive at that island which i have just now say be call juana i proceed along its coast toward the west for some distance i find it so large and without perceptible end that i believe it to be not a island but the continental country of cathay -lrb- 11 -rrb- see however no town or city situate on the sea-coast but only some village and rude farm with whose inhabitant i be unable to converse because as soon as they see we they take flight i proceed farther think that i would discover some city or large residence at length perceive that we have go far enough that nothing new appear and that this way be lead we to the north which i wish to avoid because it be winter on the land and it be my intention to go to the south moreover the wind be become violent i therefore determine that no other plan be practicable and so go back i return to a certain bay that i have notice from which i send two of we man to the land that they might find out whether there be a king in this country or any city these man travel for three day and they find people and house without number but they be small and without any government therefore they return now in the mean time i have learn from certain indian whom i have seize there that this country be indeed a island and therefore i proceed toward the east keep all the time near the coast for three hundred twenty-two mile to the extreme end of this island from this place i see another island to the east distant from this juana fifty-four mile which i call forthwith hispana -lrb- 12 -rrb- and i sail to it and i steer along the northern coast as at juana toward the east five hundred sixty-four mile and the say juana and the other island there appear very fertile this island be surround by many very safe and wide harbor not excel by any other that i have ever see many great and salubrious river flow through it there be also many very high mountain there all these island be very beautiful and distinguish by various quality they be accessible and full of a great variety of tree stretch up to the star the leaf of which i believe be never shed for i see they as green and flourishing as they be usually in spain in the month of may some of they be blossom some be bear fruit some be in other condition each one be thrive in its own way the nightingale and various other bird without number be singing in the month of November when i be explore they there be besides in the say island juana seven or eight kind of palm-tree which far excel ours in height and beauty just as all the other tree herb and fruit do there be also excellent pine-tree vast plain and meadow a variety of bird a variety of honey and a variety of metal except iron in the one which be call hispana as we say above there be great and beautiful mountain vast field grove fertile plain very suitable for plant and cultivate and for the building of house the convenience of the harbor in this island and the remarkable number of river contribute to the healthfulness of man exceed belief unless one have see they the tree pasturage and fruit of this island differ greatly from those of juana this hispana moreover abound in different kind of spice in gold and in metal on this island indeed and on all the other which i have see and of which i have knowledge the inhabitant of both sex go always naked just as they come into the world except some of the woman who use a covering of a leaf or some foliage or a cotton cloth which they make themselves for that purpose all these people lack as i say above every kind of iron they be also without weapon which indeed be unknown nor be they competent to use they not on account of deformity of body for they be well form but because they be timid and full of fear they carry for weapon however reed baked in the sun on the lower end of which they fasten some shaft of dry wood rub down to a point and indeed they do not venture to use these always for it frequently happen when i send two or three of my man to some of the village that they might speak with the native a compact troop of the indian would march out and as soon as they see we man approach they would quickly take flight child be push aside by they father and father by they child and this be not because any hurt or injury have be inflict on any one of they for to everyone whom i visit and with whom i be able to converse i distribute whatever i have cloth and many other thing no return be make to I but they be by nature fearful and timid yet when they perceive that they be safe put aside all fear they be of simple manners and trustworthy and very liberal with everything they have refuse no one who ask for anything they may possess and even themselves invite we to ask for thing they show greater love for all other than for themselves they give valuable thing for trifle be satisfy even with a very small return or with nothing however i forbid that thing so small and of no value should be give to they such as piece of plate dish and glass likewise key and shoe-strap although if they be able to obtain these it seem to they like get the most beautiful jewel in the world it happen indeed that a certain sailor obtain in exchange for a shoe-strap as much worth of gold as would equal three golden coin and likewise other thing for article of very little value especially for new silver coin and for some gold coin to obtain which they give whatever the seller desire as for instance a ounce and a half and two ounce of gold or thirty and forty pound of cotton with which they be already acquaint they also trade cotton and gold for piece of bow bottle jug and jar like person without reason which i forbid because it be very wrong and i give to they many beautiful and please thing that i have bring with I no value be take in exchange in order that i might the more easily make they friendly to I that they might be make worshipper of christ and that they might be full of love toward we king queen and prince and the whole spanish nation also that they might be zealous to search out and collect and deliver to we those thing of which they have plenty and which we greatly need these people practice no kind of idolatry on the contrary they firmly believe that all strength and power and in fact all good thing be in heaven and that i have come down from thence with these ship and sailor and in this belief i be receive there after they have put aside fear nor be they slow or unskilled but of excellent and acute understanding and the man who have navigate that sea give a account of everything in a admirable manner but they never see people clothe nor these kind of ship as soon as i reach that sea i seize by force several indian on the first island in order that they might learn from we and in like manner tell we about those thing in these land of which they themselves have knowledge and the plan succeed for in a short time we understand they and they we sometimes by gesture and sign sometimes by word and it be a great advantage to we they be come with I now yet always believe that i descend from heaven although they have be live with we for a long time and be live with we today and these man be the first who announce it wherever we land continually proclaim to the other in a loud voice come come and you will see the celestial people whereupon both woman and man both child and adult both young man and old man lay aside the fear cause a little before visit we eagerly fill the road with a great crowd some bring food and some drink with great love and extraordinary good-will on every island there be many canoe of a single piece of wood and though narrow yet in length and shape similar to we row-boat but swifter in movement they steer only by oar some of these boat be large some small some of medium size yet they row many of the larger row-boat with eighteen cross-bench with which they cross to all those island which be innumerable and with these boat they perform they trading and carry on commerce among they i see some of these row-boat or canoe which be carry seventy and eighty rower in all these island there be no difference in the appearance of the people nor in the manners and language but all understand each other mutually a fact that be very important for the end which i suppose to be earnestly desire by we most illustrious king that be they conversion to the holy religion of christ to which in truth as far as i can perceive they be very ready and favorably inclined i say before how i proceed along the island juana in a straight line from west to east three hundred twenty-two mile accord to which course and the length of the way i be able to say that this juana be larger than england and scotland together for besides the say three hundred twenty-two thousand pace there be two more province in that part which lie toward the west which i do not visit one of these the indian call anan whose inhabitant be bear with tail they extend to one hundred eighty mile in length as i have learn from those indian i have with I who be all acquaint with these island but the circumference of hispana be still greater than all spain from colonia to fontarabium -lrb- 13 -rrb- this be easily prove because its fourth side which i myself pass along in a straight line from west to east extend five hundred forty mile this island be to be desire and be very desirable and not to be despise in which although as i have say i solemnly take possession of all the other for we most invincible king and they government be entirely commit to the say king yet i especially take possession of a certain large town in a very convenient location and adapt to all kind of gain and commerce to which we give the name of we lord of the nativity and i command a fort to be build there forthwith which must be complete by this time in which i leave as many man as seem necessary with all kind of arm and plenty of food for more than a year likewise one caravel and for the construction of other man skilled in this trade and in other profession and also the extraordinary good-will and friendship of the king of this island toward we for those people be very amiable and kind to such a degree that the say king glory in call I he brother and if they should change they mind and should wish to hurt those who remain in the fort they would not be able because they lack weapon they go naked and be too cowardly for that reason those who hold the say fort be at least able to resist easily this whole island without any imminent danger to themselves so long as they do not transgress the regulation and command which we give in all these island as i have understand each man be content with only one wife except the prince or king who be permit to have twenty the woman appear to work more than the man i be not able to find out surely whether they have individual property for i see that one man have the duty of distribute to the other especially refreshment food and thing of that kind i find no monstrosity among they as very many suppose but man of great reverence and friendly nor be they black like the ethiopian they have straight hair hang down they do not remain where the solar ray send out the heat for the strength of the sun be very great here because it be distant from the equinoctial line as it seem only twenty-six degree on the top of the mountain too the cold be severe but the indian however moderate it partly by be accustom to the place and partly by the help of very hot victuals of which they eat frequently and immoderately and so i do not see any monstrosity nor do i have knowledge of they anywhere except a certain island name chari -lrb- 14 -rrb- which be the second in pass from hispana to india this island be inhabit by a certain people who be consider very warlike by they neighbor these eat human flesh the say people have many kind of row-boat in which they cross over to all the other indian island and seize and carry away everything that they can they differ in no way from the other only that they wear long hair like the woman they use bow and dart make of reed with sharpened shaft fasten to the larger end as we have describe on this account they be consider warlike wherefore the other indian be afflict with continual fear but i regard they as of no more account than the other these be the people who visit certain woman who alone inhabit the island mateunin -lrb- 15 -rrb- which be the first in pass from hispana to india these woman moreover perform no kind of work of they sex for they use bow and dart like those i have describe of they husband they protect themselves with sheet of copper of which there be great abundance among they they tell I of another island greater than the aforesaid hispana whose inhabitant be without hair and which abound in gold above all the other i be bring with I man of this island and of the other that i have see who give proof of the thing that i have describe finally that i may compress in few word the brief account of we departure and quick return and the gain i promise this that if i be support by we most invincible sovereign with a little of they help as much gold can be supply as they will need indeed as much of spice of cotton of chewing-gum -lrb- which be only find in chio -rrb- also as much of aloes-wood and as many slave for the navy as they majesty will wish to demand likewise rhubarb and other kind of spice which i suppose these man whom i leave in the say fort have already find and will continue to find since i remain in no place longer than the wind force I except in the town of the nativity while i provide for the building of the fort and for the safety of all which thing although they be very great and remarkable yet they would have be much greater if i have be aid by as many ship as the occasion require truly great and wonderful be this and not correspond to we merit but to the holy christian religion and to the piety and religion of we sovereign because what the human understanding could not attain that the divine will have grant to human effort for god be wont to listen to he servant who love he precept even in impossibility as have happen to we on the present occasion who have attain that which hitherto mortal man have never reach for if anyone have write or say anything about these island it be all with obscurity and conjecture no one claim that he have see they from which they seem like fable therefore let the king and queen the prince and they most fortunate kingdom and all other country of christendom give thanks to we lord and savior jesus christ who have bestow upon we so great a victory and gift let religious procession be solemnize let sacred festival be give let the church be cover with festive garland let christ rejoice on earth as he rejoice in heaven when he foresee come to salvation so many soul of people hitherto lose let we be glad also as well on account of the exaltation of we faith as on account of the increase of we temporal affair of which not only spain but universal christendom will be partaker these thing that have be do be thus briefly related farewell lisbon the day before the ides of march -lrb- 16 -rrb- christopher columbus admiral of the ocean fleet epigram of r l de corbarium bishop of monte peloso to the most invincible king of spain no region now can add to spain 's great deed : to such man all the world be yet too small a orient land find far beyond the wave will add great betica to thy renown then to columbus the true finder give due thanks but greater still to god on high who make new kingdom for himself and thee : both firm and pious let thy conduct be ferdinand columbus all the condition which the admiral demand be concede by they catholic majesty he set out from granada on may 21 1492 for palo where he be to fit out the ship for he intended expedition that town be bind to serve the crown for three month with two caravel which be order to be give to columbus and he fit out these and a third vessel with all care and diligence the ship in which he personally embark be call the santa marium the second vessel name the pinta be command by martin alonso pinzon and the third name the nina which have square sail be under the command of vincent yanez pinzon the brother of alonso both of whom be inhabitant of palo be furnish with all necessaries and have ninety man to navigate the three vessel columbus set sail from palo on August 3 1492 shape he course directly for the canary during this voyage and indeed in all the _ four _ voyage which he make from spain to the west indy the admiral be very careful to keep a exact journal of every occurrence which take place always specify what wind blow how far he sail with each particular wind what current be find and everything that be see by the way whether bird fish or any other thing although to note all these particulars with a minute relation of everything that happen show what impression and effect answer to the course and aspect of the star and the difference between the sea which he sail and those of we country might all be useful yet as i conceive that the relation of these particulars might now be tiresome to the reader i shall only give a account of what appear to I necessary and convenient to be know on Saturday August 4th the next day after sailing from palo the rudder of the pinta break loose the admiral strongly suspect that it be occasion by the contrivance of the master on purpose to avoid proceeding on the voyage which he have endeavor to do before they leave spain and he therefore range up alongside of the disabled vessel to give every assistance in he power but the wind blow so hard that he be unable to afford any aid pinzon however be a experienced seaman soon make a temporary repair by means of rope and they proceed on they voyage but on the follow Tuesday the weather become rough and boisterous the fastening give way and the squadron be oblige to lay to for some time to renew the repair from this misfortune of twice break the rudder a superstitious person might have forebode the future disobedience of pinzon to the admiral as through he malice the pinta twice separate from the squadron as shall be afterward related have apply the best remedy they could to the disabled state of the rudder the squadron continue its voyage and come in sight of the canary at daybreak of Thursday August 9th but owe to contrary wind they be unable to come to anchor at gran canarium until the 12th the admiral left pinzon at gran canarium to endeavor to procure another vessel instead of that which be disabled and go himself with the niña on the same errand to gomera the admiral arrive at gomera on Sunday August 12th and send a boat on shore to inquire if any vessel could be procure there for he purpose the boat return next morning and bring intelligence that no vessel be then at that island but that doña beatrix de bobadilla the proprietrix of the island be then at gran canarium in a hire vessel of forty ton belong to one gradeuna of seville which would probably suit he purpose and might perhaps be get he therefore determine to await the arrival of that vessel at gomera believe that pinzon might have secure a vessel for himself at gran canaria if he have not be able to repair he own after wait two day he despatch one of he people in a bark which be bind from gomera to gran canarium to acquaint pinzon where he lay and to assist he in repair and fix the rudder have wait a considerable time for a answer to he letter he sail with the two vessel from gomera on August 23d for gran canarium and fall in with the bark on the follow day which have be detain all that time on its voyage by contrary wind he now take he man from the bark and sailing in the night past the island of teneriffe the people be much astonished at observe flame burst out of the lofty mountain call el pico -lrb- or the peak of teneriffe -rrb- on this occasion the admiral be at great pain to explain the nature of this phenomenon to the people by instance the example of aetna and several other known volcano pass by teneriffe they arrive at gran canarium on Saturday August 25th and find that pinzon have only get in there the day before from he the admiral be inform that doña beatrix have sail for gomera on the 20th with the vessel which he be so anxious to obtain he officer be much trouble at the disappointment but he who always endeavor to make the best of every occurrence observe to they that since it have not pleased god that they should get this vessel it be perhaps better for they as they might have encounter much opposition in press it into the service and might have lose a great deal of time in shipping and unshipp the goods wherefore lest he might again miss it if he return to gomera he resolve to make a new rudder for the pinta at gran canarium and order the square sail of the nina to be change to _ round _ one like those of the other two vessel that she might be able to accompany they with less danger and agitation the vessel be all refit the admiral weigh anchor from gran canaria on Saturday September 1st and arrive next day at gomera where four day be employ in complete they store of provision and of wood and water on the morning of Thursday September 6 1492 the admiral take he departure from gomera and commence he great undertaking by stand directly westward but make very slow progress at first on account of calm on Sunday September 9th about daybreak they be nine league west of the island of ferro now lose sight of land and stretch out into utterly unknown sea many of the people express they anxiety and fear that it might be long before they should see land again but the admiral use every endeavor to comfort they with the assurance of soon find the land he be in search of and raise they hope of acquire wealth and honor by the discovery to lessen the fear which they entertain of the length of way they have to sail he give out that they have only proceed fifteen league that day when the actual distance sail be eighteen and to induce the people to believe that they be not so far from spain as they really be he resolve to keep considerably short in he reckoning during the whole voyage though he carefully record the true reckoning every day in private on Wednesday September 12th have get to about one hundred fifty league west of ferro they discover a large trunk of a tree sufficient to have be the mast of a vessel of one hundred twenty ton and which seem to have be a long time in the water at this distance from ferro and for somewhat farther on the current be find to set strongly to the northeast next day when they have run fifty league farther westward the needle be observe to vary half a point to the eastward of north and next morning the variation be a whole point east this variation of the compass have never be before observe and therefore the admiral be much surprised at the phenomenon and conclude that the needle do not actually point toward the polar star but to some other fixed point three day afterward when almost one hundred league farther west he be still more astonished at the irregularity of the variation for have observe the needle to vary a whole point to the eastward at night it point directly northward in the morning on the night of Saturday September isth be then almost three hundred league west of ferro they see a prodigious flash of light or fire-ball drop from the sky into the sea at four or five league ' distance from the ship toward the southwest the weather be then quite fair and serene like April the sea perfectly calm the wind favorable from the northeast and the current setting to the northeast the people in the nina tell the admiral that they have see the day before a heron and another bird which they call _ rabo-de-junco _ these be the first bird which have be see during the voyage and be consider as indication of approach land but they be more agreeably surprised next day Sunday September 16th by see great abundance of yellowish green sea-weed which appear as if newly wash away from some rock or island next day the seaweed be see in much greater quantity and a small live lobster be observe among the weed from this circumstance many affirm that they be certainly near the land the sea-water be afterward notice to be only half so salt as before and great number of tunny-fish be see swim about some of which come so near the vessel that one be kill by a bearded iron be now three hundred sixty league west from ferro another of the bird call rabo-de-junco be see on Tuesday September 18th martin alonso pinzon who have go ahead of the admiral in the pinta which be a excellent sailer lay to for the admiral to come up and tell he that he have see a great number of bird fly away westward for which reason he be in great hope to see land that night pinzon even think that he see land that night about fifteen league distant to the northward which appear very black and cover with cloud all the people would have persuade the admiral to try for land in that direction but be certainly assure that it be not land and have not yet reach the distance at which he expect to find the land he would not consent to lose time in alter he course in that direction but as the wind now freshen he give order to take in the topsail at night have now sail eleven day before the wind due westward with all they sail up all the people in the squadron be utterly unacquainted with the sea they now traverse fearful of they danger at such unusual distance from any relief and see nothing around but sky and water begin to mutter among themselves and anxiously observe every appearance on September 19th a kind of sea-gull call _ alcatras _ fly over the admiral 's ship and several other be see in the afternoon of that day and as the admiral conceive that these bird would not fly far from land he entertain hope of soon see what he be in quest of he therefore order a line of two hundred fathom to be try but without find any bottom the current be now find to set to the southwest on Thursday September 20th two alcatrase come near the ship about two hour before noon and soon afterward a third on this day likewise they take a bird resemble a heron of a black color with a white tuft on its head and have web foot like a duck abundance of weed be see float in the sea and one small fish be take about evening three land bird settle on the rigging of the ship and begin to sing these fly away at daybreak which be consider a strong indication of approach the land as these little bird could not have come from any far distant country whereas the other large fowl be use to water might much better go far from land the same day a alcatra be see Friday the 21st another alcatra and a rabo-de-junco be see and vast quantity of weed as far as the eye could carry toward the north these appearance be sometimes a comfort to the people give they hope of near the wished-for land while at other time the weed be so thick as in some measure to impede the progress of the vessel and to occasion terror lest what be fabulously report of st amaro in the frozen sea might happen to they that they might be so envelop in the weed as to be unable to move backward or forward wherefore they steer away from those shoal of weed as much as they could next day be Saturday September 22d they see a whale and several small bird the wind now veer to the southwest sometimes more and sometimes less to the westward and though this be adverse to the direction of they propose voyage the admiral to comfort the people allege that this be a favorable circumstance because among other cause of fear they have formerly say they should never have a wind to carry they back to spain as it have always blow from the east ever since they leave ferro they still continue however to murmur allege that this southwest wind be by no mean a settle one and as it never blow strong enough to swell the sea it would not serve to carry they back again through so great a extent of sea as they have now pass over in spite of every argument use by the admiral assure they that the alteration in the wind be occasion by the vicinity of the land by which likewise the wave be prevent from rise to any height they be still dissatisfied and terrify on Sunday September 23d a brisk gale spring up west-northwest with a rolling sea such as the people have wish for three hour before noon a turtle-dove be observe to fly over the ship toward evening a alcatras a river fowl and several white bird be see fly about and some crab be observe among the weed next day another alcatra be see and several small bird which come from the west number of small fish be see swim about some of which be strike with harpoon as they would not bite at the hook the more that the token mention above be observe and find not to be follow by the so anxiously looked-for land the more the people become fearful of the event and enter into cabal against the admiral who they say be desirous to make himself a great lord at the expense of they danger they represent that they have already sufficiently perform they duty in adventuring farther from land and all possibility of succor than have ever be do before and that they ought not to proceed on the voyage to they manifest destruction if they do they would soon have reason to repent they temerity as provision would soon fall short the ship be already faulty and would soon fail and it would be extremely difficult to get back so far as they have already go none could condemn they in they own opinion for now turn back but all must consider they as brave man for have go upon such a enterprise and venture so far that the admiral be a foreigner who have no favor at court and as so many wise and learn man have already condemn he opinion and enterprise as visionary and impossible there would be none to favor or defend he and they be sure to find more credit if they accuse he of ignorance and mismanagement than he would do whatsoever he might now say for himself against they some even proceed so far as to propose in case the admiral should refuse to acquiesce in they proposal that they might make a short end of all dispute by throw he overboard after which they could give out that he have fall over while make he observation and no one would ever think of inquire into the truth they thus go on day after day mutter complain and consult together and though the admiral be not fully aware of the extent of they cabal he be not entirely without apprehension of they inconstancy in the present try situation and of they evil intention toward he he therefore exert himself to the utmost to quiet they apprehension and to suppress they evil design sometimes use fair word and at other time fully resolve to expose he life rather than abandon the enterprise he put they in mind of the due punishment they would subject themselves to if they obstruct the voyage to confirm they hope he recapitulate all the favorable sign and indication which have be lately observe assure they that they might soon expect to see the land but they who be ever attentive to these token think every hour a year in they anxiety to see the wished-for land on Tuesday September 25th near sunset as the admiral be discourse with pinzon whose ship be then very near pinzon suddenly call out land land sir let not my good news miscarry and point out a large mass in the southwest about twenty-five league distant which seem very like a island this be so please to the people that they return thanks to god for the please discovery and although the admiral be by no means satisfied of the truth of pinzon 's observation yet to please the man and that they might not obstruct the voyage he alter he course and stand in that direction a great part of the night next morning the 26th they have the mortification to find the supposed land be only compose of cloud which often put on the appearance of distant land and to they great dissatisfaction the stem of the ship be again turn directly westward as they always be unless when hinder by the wind continue they course and still attentively watch for sign of land they see this day a alcatras a rabo-de-junco and other bird as formerly mention on Thursday September 27th they see another alcatras come from the westward and fly toward the east and great number of fish be see with gilt back one of which they strike with a harpoon a rabo-de-junco likewise fly past the current for some of the last day be not so regular as before but change with the tide and the weed be not nearly so abundant on Friday the 28th all the vessel take some of the fish with gilt back and on Saturday the 29th they see a rabo-de-junco which although a sea-fowl never rest on the wave but always fly in the air pursue the alcatrase many of these bird be say to frequent the cape de verd island they soon afterward see two other alcatrase and great number of flying-fish these last be about a span long and have two little membranous wing like those of a bat by means of which they fly about a pike-length high from the water and a musket-shot in length and sometimes drop upon the ship in the afternoon of this day they see abundance of weed lie in length north and south and three alcatrase pursue by a rabo-de-junco on the morning of Sunday September 30th four rabo-de-junco come to the ship and from so many of they come together it be think the land could not be far distant especially as four alcatrase follow soon afterward great quantity of weed be see in a line stretch from west-north-west to east-north-east and a great number of the fish which be call _ emperadore _ which have a very hard skin and be not fit to eat though the admiral pay every attention to these indication he never neglect those in the heaven and carefully observe the course of the star he be now greatly surprise to notice at this time that charle ' wain or the ursa major constellation appear at night in the west and be north-east in the morning he thence conclude that they whole night 's course be only nine hour or so many part in twenty four of a great circle and this he observe to be the case regularly every night it be likewise notice that the compass vary a whole point to the northwest at nightfall and come due north every morning at daybreak as this unheard-of circumstance confound and perplex the pilot who apprehend danger in these strange region and at such unusual distance from home the admiral endeavor to calm they fear by assign a cause for this wonderful phenomenon he allege that it be occasion by the polar star make a circuit round the pole by which they be not a little satisfied soon after sunrise on Monday October 1st a alcatra come to the ship and two more about ten in the morning and long stream of weed float from east to west that morning the pilot of the admiral 's ship say that they be now five hundred seventy-eight league west from the island of ferro in he public account the admiral say they be five hundred eighty-four league to the west but in he private journal he make the real distance seven hundred seven league or one hundred twenty-nine more than be reckon by the pilot the other two ship differ much in they computation from each other and from the admiral 's pilot the pilot of the nina in the afternoon of the Wednesday follow say they have only sail five hundred forty league and the pilot of the pinta reckon six hundred thirty-four thus they be all much short of the truth but the admiral wink at the gross mistake that the man not think themselves so far from home might be the less deject the next day be Tuesday October 2d they see abundance of fish catch one small tunny and see a white bird with many other small bird and the weed appear much withered and almost fall to powder next day see no bird they suspect that they have pass between some island on both hand and have slip through without see they as they guess that the many bird which they have see might have be pass from one island to another on this account they be very earnest to have the course alter one way or the other in quest of these imaginary land but the admiral unwilling to lose the advantage of the fair wind which carry he due west which he account he surest course and afraid to lessen he reputation by deviate from course to course in search of land which he always affirm that he well know where to find refuse he consent to any change on this the people be again ready to mutiny and resume they murmur and cabal against he but it pleased god to aid he authority by fresh indication of land on Thursday October 4th in the afternoon above forty sparrow together and two alcatrase fly so near the ship that a seaman kill one of they with a stone several other bird be see at this time and many flying-fish fall into the ship next day there come a rabo-de-junco and a alcatras from the westward and many sparrow be see about sunrise on Sunday October 7th some sign of land appear to the westward but be imperfect no person would mention the circumstance this be owe to fear of lose the reward of thirty crown yearly for life which have be promise by they catholic majesty to whoever should first discover land and to prevent they from call out land land at every turn without just cause it be make a condition that whoever say he see land should lose the reward if it be not make out in three day even if he should afterward actually prove the first discoverer all on board the admiral 's ship be thus forewarn be exceedingly careful not to cry out land on uncertain token but those in the niña which sail better and always keep ahead believe that they certainly see land fire a gun and hang out they color in token of the discovery but the farther they sail the more the joyful appearance lessen till at last it vanish away but they soon afterward derive much comfort by observe great flight of large fowl and other of small bird go from the west toward the southwest be now at a vast distance from spain and well assure that such small bird would not go far from land the admiral now altered he course from due west which have be hitherto and steer to the southwest he assign as a reason for now change he course although deviate little from he original design that he follow the example of the portuguese who have discover most of they island by attend to the flight of bird and because these they now see fly almost uniformly in one direction he say likewise that he have always expect to discover land about the situation in which they now be have often tell they that he must not look to find land until they should get seven hundred fifty league to the westward of the canary about which distance he expect to fall in with hispaniolum which he then call cipango -lrb- 17 -rrb- and there be no doubt that he would have find this island by he direct course if it have not be that it be report to extend from north to south owe therefore to he not have incline more to the south he have miss that and other of the caribbee island whither those bird be now bend they flight and which have be for some time upon he larboard hand it be from be so near the land that they continually see such great number of bird and on Monday October 8th twelve singing bird of various color come to the ship and after fly round it for a short time hold on they way many other bird be see from the ship fly toward the southwest and that same night great number of large fowl be see and flock of small bird proceed from the northward and all go to the southwest in the morning a jay be see with a alcatras several duck and many small bird all fly the same way with the other and the air be perceive to be fresh and odoriferous as it be at seville in the month of April but the people be now so eager to see land and have be so often disappointed that they cease to give faith to these continual indication insomuch that on Wednesday the 10th although abundance of bird be continually pass both by day and night they never cease to complain the admiral upbraid they want of resolution and declare that they must persist in they endeavor to discover the indy for which he and they have be send out by they catholic majesty it would have be impossible for the admiral to have much longer withstand the number which now oppose he but it pleased god that in the afternoon of Thursday October 11th such manifest token of be near the land appear that the man take courage and rejoice at they good-fortune as much as they have be before distressed from the admiral 's ship a green rush be see to float past and one of those green fish which never go far from the rock the people in the pinta see a cane and a staff in the water and take up another staff very curiously carve and a small board and great plenty of weed be see which seem to have be recently tear from the rock those of the niña besides similar sign of land see a branch of a thorn full of red berry which seem to have be newly tear from the tree from all these indication the admiral be convince that he now draw near to the land and after the evening prayer he make a speech to the man in which he remind they of the mercy of god in have bring they so long a voyage with such favorable weather and in comforting they with so many token of a successful issue to they enterprise which be now every day become plainer and less equivocal he beseech they to be exceedingly watchful during the night as they well know that in the first article of the instruction which he have give to all the three ship before leave the canary they be enjoin when they should have sail seven hundred league west without discover land to lay to every night from midnight till daybreak and as he have very confident hope of discover land that night he require every one to keep watch at they quarter and besides the gratuity of thirty crown a year for life which have be graciously promise by they sovereign to he that first see the land he engage to give the fortunate discoverer a velvet doublet from himself after this as the admiral be in he cabin about ten o'clock at night he see a light on shore but it be so unsteady that he could not certainly affirm that it come from land he call to one pedro gutierrez and desire he to try if he could perceive the same light who say he do but one rodrigo sanchez of segovium on be desire to look the same way could not see it because he be not up time enough as neither the admiral nor gutierrez could see it again above once or twice for a short space which make they judge it to proceed from a candle or torch belong to some fisherman or traveller who lift it up occasionally and lower it again or perhaps from people go from one house to another because it appear and vanish again so suddenly be now very much on they guard they still hold on they course until about two in the morning of Friday October 12th when the pinta which be always far ahead owe to she superior sailing make the signal of see land which be first discover by rodrigo de triana at about two league from the ship but the thirty crown a year be afterward grant to the admiral who have see the light in the midst of darkness a type of the spiritual light which he be the happy means of spread in these dark region of error be now so near land all the ship lay to everyone think it long till daylight that they might enjoy the sight they have so long and anxiously desire when daylight appear the newly discover land be perceive to consist of a flat island fifteen league in length without any hill all cover with tree and have a great lake in the middle the island be inhabit by great abundance of people who run down to the shore fill with wonder and admiration at the sight of the ship which they conceive to be some unknown animal the christian be not less curious to know what kind of people they have fall in with and the curiosity on both side be soon satisfy as the ship soon come to anchor the admiral go on shore with he boat well armed and have the royal standard of castile and leon display accompany by the commander of the other two vessel each in he own boat carry the particular color which have be allot for the enterprise which be white with a green cross and the letter f on one side and on the other the name of ferdinand and isabellum crown the whole company kneel on the shore and kiss the ground for joy return god thanks for the great mercy they have experience during they long voyage through sea hitherto unpassed and they now happy discovery of a unknown land the admiral then stand up and take formal possession in the usual word for they catholic majesty of this island to which he give the name of san salvador all the christian present admit columbus to the authority and dignity of admiral and viceroy pursuant to the commission which he have receive to that effect and all make oath to obey he as the legitimate representative of they catholic majesty with such expression of joy and acknowledgment as become they mighty success and they all implore he forgiveness of the many affront he have receive from they through they fear and want of confidence number of the indian or native of the island be present at these ceremony and perceive they to be peaceable quiet and simple people the admiral distribute several present among they to some he give red cap and to other string of glass bead which they hang about they neck and various other thing of small value which they value as if they have be jewel of high price after the ceremony the admiral go off in he boat and the indian follow he even to the ship some by swimming and other in they canoe carry parrot clew of spin cotton yarn javelin and other such trifling article to barter for glass bead bell and other thing of small value like people in the original simplicity of nature they be all naked and even a woman who be among they be entirely destitute of clothing most of they be young seemingly not above thirty year of age of a good stature with very thick black lank hair mostly cut short above they ear though some have it down to they shoulder tie up with a string about they head like woman 's tress they countenance be mild and agreeable and they feature good but they forehead be too high which give they rather a wild appearance they be of a middle stature plump and well shaped but of a olive complexion like the inhabitant of the canary or sunburnt peasant some be paint with black other with white and other again with red in some the whole body be paint in other only the face and some only the nose and eye they have no weapon like those of europe neither have they any knowledge of such for when we people show they a naked sword they ignorantly grasp it by the edge neither have they any knowledge of iron as they javelin be merely construct of wood have they point harden in the fire and arm with a piece of fish-bone some of they have scar of wound on different part and be ask by sign how these have be get they answer by sign that people from other island come to take they away and that they have be wound in they own defense they seem ingenious and of a voluble tongue as they readily repeat such word as they once hear there be no kind of animal among they except parrot which they carry to barter with the christian among the article already mention and in this trade they continue on board the ship till night when they all return to the shore in the morning of the next day be October 13th many of the native return on board the ship in they boat or canoe which be all of one piece hollow like a tray from the trunk of a tree some of these be so large as to contain forty or forty-five man while other be so small as only to hold one person with many intermediate size between these extreme these they work along with paddle form like a baker 's peel or the implement which be use in dress hemp these oar or paddle be not fix by pin to the side of the canoe like ours but be dip into the water and pull backward as if digging they canoe be so light and artfully construct that if overset they soon turn they right again by swimming and they empty out the water by throw they from side to side like a weaver 's shuttle and when half empty they ladle out the rest with dry calabash cut in two which they carry for that purpose this second day the native as say before bring various article to barter for such small thing as they could procure in exchange jewel or metal of any kind be not see among they except some small plate of gold which hang from they nostril and on be question from whence they procure the gold they answer by sign that they have it from the south where there be a king who possess abundance of piece and vessel of gold and they make we people to understand that there be many other island and large country to the south and southwest they be very covetous to get possession of anything which belong to the christian and be themselves very poor with nothing of value to give in exchange as soon as they get on board if they could lay hold of anything which strike they fancy though it be only a piece of a broken glaze earthen dish or porringer they leap with it into the sea and swam on shore with they prize if they bring anything on board they would barter it for anything whatever belong to we people even for a piece of broken glass insomuch that some give sixteen large clew of well-spun cotton yarn weigh twenty-five pound for three small piece of portuguese brass coin not worth a farthe they liberality in deal do not proceed from they put any great value on the thing themselves which they receive from we people in return but because they value they as belong to the christian whom they believe certainly to have come down from heaven and they therefore earnestly desire to have something from they as a memorial in this

name peterkin or perkin for as for the name of warbeck it be give he when they do but guess at it before examination have be take but yet he have be so much talk of by that name as it stick by he after he true name of osbeck be know while he be a young child he parent return with he to tournai there he be place in the house of a kinsman of he call john stenbeck at antwerp and so rove up and down between antwerp and tournaus and other town of flander for a good time live much in english company and have the english tongue perfect in which time be grow a comely youth he be bring by some of the espial of the lady margaret into she presence who view he well and see that he have a face and personage that would bear a noble fortune and find he otherwise of a fine spirit and win behavior think she have now find a curious piece of marble to carve out a image of a duke of york she keep he by she a great while but with extreme secrecy the while she instruct he by many cabinet conference first in princely behavior and gesture teaching he how he should keep state and yet with a modest sense of he misfortune then she inform he of all the circumstance and particulars that concern the person of richard duke of york which he be to act describe unto he the personage lineament and feature of the king and queen he pretended parent and of he brother and sister and diver other that be nearest he in he childhood together with all passage some secret some common that be fit for a child 's memory until the death of king edward then she add the particulars of the time from the king 's death until he and he brother be commit to the tower as well during the time he be abroad as while he be in sanctuary as for the time while he be in the tower and the manner of he brother 's death and he own escape she know they be thing that a very few could control and therefore she teach he only to tell a smooth and likely tale of those matter warn he not to vary from it it be agree likewise between they what account he should give of he peregrination abroad intermix many thing which be true and such as they know other could testify for the credit of the rest but still make they to hang together with the part he be to play she teach he likewise how to avoid sundry captious and tempting question which be like to be ask of he but this she find he so nimble and shift as she trust much to he own wit and readiness and therefore labor the less in it lastly she raise he thought with some present reward and further promise set before he chiefly the glory and fortune of a crown if thing go well and a sure refuge to she court if the worst should fall after such time as she think he be perfect in he lesson she begin to cast with herself from what coast this blaze star should first appear and at what time it must be upon the horizon of ireland for there have the like meteor strong influence before the time of the apparition to be when the king should be engage in a war with france but well she know that whatsoever should come from she would be hold suspect and therefore if he should go out of flander immediately into ireland she might be think to have some hand in it and besides the time be not yet ripe for that the two king be then upon term of peace therefore she wheel about and to put all suspicion afar off and loath to keep he any longer by she for that she know secret be not long-lived she send he unknown into portugal with the lady brampton a english lady that embark for portugal at that time with some _ privado _ of she own to have a eye upon he and there he be to remain and to expect she further direction in the mean time she omit not to prepare thing for he better welcome and accept not only in the kingdom of ireland but in the court of france he continue in portugal about a year and by that time the king of england call he parliament and declare open war against france now do the sign reign and the constellation be come under which perkin should appear and therefore he be straight send unto by the duchess to go for ireland accord to the first designment in ireland he do arrive at the town of cork when he be thither come he own tale be when he make he confession afterward that the irishman find he in some good clothes come flock about he and bare he down that he be the duke of clarence that have be there before and after that he be the base son of richard iii and lastly that he be richard duke of york second son to edward iv but that he for he part renounce all these thing and offer to swear upon the holy evangelist that he be no such man till at last they force it upon he and bid he fear nothing and so forth but the truth be that immediately upon he come into ireland he take upon he the say person of the duke of york and draw unto he complice and partaker by all the means he could devise insomuch as he write he letter unto the earl of desmond and kildare to come in to he aid and be of he party the original of which letter be yet extant somewhat before this time the duchess have also gain unto she a near servant of king henry 's own one stephen frion he secretary for the french tongue a active man but turbulent and discontented this frion have flee over to charle the french king and put himself into he service at such time as he begin to be in open enmity with the king now king charle when he understand of the person and attempt of perkin ready of himself to embrace all advantage against the king of england instigate by frion and formerly prepare by the lady margaret forthwith despatch one luca and this frion in the nature of ambassador to perkin to advertise he of the king 's good inclination to he and that he be resolve to aid he to recover he right against king henry a usurper of england and a enemy of france and wish he to come over unto he at paris perkin think himself in heaven now that he be invite by so great a king in so honorable a manner and impart unto he friend in ireland for they encouragement how fortune call he and what great hope he have sail presently into france when he be come to the court of france the king receive he with great honor salute and style he by the name of the duke of york lodge he and accommodate he in great state and the better to give he the representation and the countenance of a prince assign he a guard for he person whereof lord congresall be captain the courtier likewise though it be ill mock with the french apply themselves to they king 's bent see there be reason of state for it at the same time there repair unto perkin diver englishman of quality -- sir george neville sir john taylor and about one hundred more -- and among the rest this stephen frion of whom we speak who follow he fortune both then and for a long time after and be indeed he principal counsellor and instrument in all he proceedings but all this on the french king 's part be but a trick the better to bow king henry to peace and therefore upon the first grain of incense that be sacrifice upon the altar of peace at boulogne perkin be smoke away yet would not the french king deliver he up to king henry as he be labor to do for he honor 's sake but warn he away and dismiss he and perkin on he part be ready to be go doubt he might be catch up underhand he therefore take he way into flander unto the duchess of burgundy pretend that have be variously toss by fortune he direct he course thither as to a safe harbor noway take knowledge that he have ever be there before but as if that have be he first address the duchess on the other part make it as new strange to see he pretend at the first that she be teach and make wise by the example of lambert simnel how she do admit of any counterfeit stuff though even in that she say she be not fully satisfied she pretend at the first and that be ever in the presence of other to pose he and sift he thereby to try whether he be indeed the very duke of york or no but seem to receive full satisfaction by he answer she then feign herself to be transport with a kind of astonishment mixed of joy and wonder at he miraculous deliverance receive he as if he be rise from death to life and infer that god who have in such wonderful manner preserve he from death do likewise reserve he for some great and prosperous fortune as for he dismission out of france they interpret it not as if he be detect or neglect for a counterfeit deceiver but contrariwise that it do show manifestly unto the world that he be some great matter for that it be he abandon that in effect make the peace be no more but the sacrifice of a poor distressed prince unto the utility and ambition of two mighty monarch neither be perkin for he part want to himself either in gracious or princely behavior or in ready or apposite answer or in content and caress those that do apply themselves unto he or in petty scorn and disdain to those that seem to doubt of he but in all thing do notably acquit himself insomuch as it be generally believe as well among great person as among the vulgar that he be indeed duke richard nay himself with long and continued counterfeiting and with oft tell a lie be turn by habit almost into the thing he seem to be and from a liar to a believer the duchess therefore as in a case out of doubt do he all princely honor call he always by the name of she nephew and give the delicate title of the white rose of england and appoint he a guard of thirty person halberdier clothe in a party-colored livery of murrey and blue to attend he person she court likewise and generally the dutch and stranger in they usage toward he express no less respect the news hereof come blaze and thunder over into england that the duke of york be sure alive as for the name of perkin warbeck it be not at that time come to light but all the news run upon the duke of york that he have be entertain in ireland buy and sell in france and be now plainly avowed and in great honor in flander these fame take hold of diver in some upon discontent in some upon ambition in some upon levity and desire of change and in some few upon conscience and belief but in most upon simplicity and in diver out of dependence upon some of the better sort who do in secret favor and nourish these bruit and it be not long ere these rumor of novelty have beget other of scandal and murmur against the king and he government tax he for a great taxer of he people and discountenancer of he nobility the loss of britain and the peace with france be not forget but chiefly they fall upon the wrong that he do he queen in that he do not reign in she right wherefore they say that god have now bring to light a masculine branch of the house of york that would not be at he courtesy howsoever he do depress he poor lady and yet as it fareth with thing which be current with the multitude and which they affect these fame grow so general as the author be lose in the generality of the speaker they be like run weed that have no certain root or like footing up and down impossible to be trace but after a while these ill-humor draw to a head and settle secretly in some eminent person which be sir william stanley lord chamberlain of the king 's household the lord fitzwater sir simon montfort and sir thoma thwaite these enter into a secret conspiracy to favor duke richard 's title nevertheless none engage they fortune in this business openly but two sir robert clifford and master william barley who sail over into flander send indeed from the party of the conspirator here to understand the truth of those thing that pass there and not without some help of money from hence provisionally to be deliver if they find and be satisfy that there be truth in these pretence the person of sir robert clifford be a gentleman of fame and family be extremely welcome to the lady margaret who after she have conference with he bring he to the sight of perkin with whom he have often speech and discourse so that in the end win either by the duchess to affect or by perkin to believe he write back into england that he know the person of richard duke of york as well as he know he own and that this young man be undoubtedly he by this mean all thing grow prepare to revolt and sedition here and the conspiracy come to have a correspondence between flander and england the king on he part be not asleep but to arm or levy force yet he think would but show fear and do this idol too much worship nevertheless the port he do shut up or at least keep a watch on they that none should pass to or fro that be suspect but for the rest he choose to work by counter-mine he purpose be two -- the one to lay open the abuse the other to break the knot of the conspirator to detect the abuse there be but two way -- the first to make it manifest to the world that the duke of york be indeed murder the other to prove that be he dead or alive yet perkin be a counterfeit for the first thus it stand there be but four person that could speak upon knowledge to the murder of the duke of york -- sir jame tyrell the employ man from king richard john dighton and mile forest he servant the two butcher or tormentor and the priest of the tower that bury they of which four mile forest and the priest be dead and there remain alive only sir jame tyrell and john dighton these two the king cause to be commit to the tower and examine touch the manner of the death of the two innocent prince they agree both in a tale as the king give out to this effect : that king richard have direct he warrant for the put of they to death to brackenbury the lieutenant of the tower be by he refuse whereupon the king direct he warrant to sir jame tyrell to receive the key of the tower from the lieutenant for the space of a night for the king 's special service that sir jame tyrell accordingly repair to the tower by night attend by he two servant aforename whom he have choose for that purpose that himself stand at the stair-foot and send these two villain to execute the murder that they smother they in they bed and that do call up they master to see they naked dead body which they have lay forth that they be bury under the stair and some stone cast upon they that when the report be make to king richard that he will be do he give sir jame tyrell great thanks but take exception to the place of they burial be too base for they that be king 's child whereupon another night by the king 's warrant renew they body be remove by the priest of the tower and bury by he in some place which by means of the priest 's death soon after could not be know thus much be then deliver abroad to be the effect of those examination but the king nevertheless make no use of they in any of he declaration whereby as it seem those examination leave the business somewhat perplexed and as for sir jame tyrell he be soon after behead in the tower-yard for other matter of treason but john dighton who it seemeth spake best for the king be forthwith set at liberty and be the principal means of divulge this tradition therefore this kind of proof be leave so naked the king use the more diligence in the latter for the trace of perkin to this purpose he send abroad into several part and especially into flander diver secret and nimble scout and spy some feign themselves to fly over unto perkin and to adhere to he and some under other pretence to learn search and discover all the circumstance and particulars of perkin 's parent birth person travel up and down and in brief to have a journal as it be of he life and doings other he employ in a more special nature and trust to be he pioneer in the main counter-mine the king of scotland -- jame iv -- have espouse the cause of warbeck and attend he upon a invasion of england though he would not formally retract he judgment of perkin wherein he have engage himself so far yet in he private opinion upon often speech with the englishman and diverse other advertisement begin to suspect he for a counterfeit wherefore in a noble fashion he call he unto he and recount the benefit and favor that he have do he in make he he ally and in provoke a mighty and opulent king by a offensive war in he quarrel for the space of two year together nay more that he have refuse a honorable peace whereof he have a fair offer if he would have deliver he and that to keep he promise with he he have deeply offended both he noble and people whom he might not hold in any long discontent and therefore require he to think of he own fortune and to choose out some fitter place for he exile tell he withal that he could not say but that the english have forsake he before the scottish for that upon two several trial none have declare themselves on he side but nevertheless he would make good what he say to he at he first receiving which be that he should not repent he for put himself into he hand for that he would not cast he off but help he with shipping and mean to transport he where he should desire perkin not descend at all from he stage-like greatness answer the king in few word that he see he time be not yet come but whatsoever he fortune be he should both think and speak honor of the king take he leave he would not think on flander doubt it be but hollow ground for he since the treaty of the archduke conclude the year before but take he lady and such follower as would not leave he and sail over into ireland when perkin hear of the late cornwall insurrection he begin to take heart again and advise upon it with he council which be principally three -- herne a mercer that flee for debt skelton a tailor and astley a scrivener for secretary frion be go these tell he that he be mightily oversee both when he go into kent and when he go into scotland -- the one be a place so near london and under the king 's nose and the other a nation so distasted with the people of england that if they have love he ever so well yet they could never have take he part in that company but if he have be so happy as to have be in cornwall at the first when the people begin to take arm there he have be crown at westminster before this time for these king as he have now experience would sell poor prince for shoe but he must rely wholly upon people and therefore advise he to sail over with all possible speed into cornwall which accordingly he do have in he company four small bark with some sixscore or sevenscore fighting man he arrive in September at whitsand bay and forthwith come to bodmin the blacksmith 's town where they assemble unto he to the number of three thousand man of the rude people there he set forth a new proclamation stroke the people with fair promise and humor they with invective against the king and he government and as it fareth with smoke that never loseth itself till it be at the highest he do now before he end raise he style entitle himself no more richard duke of york but richard iv king of england he council advise he by all means to make himself master of some good walled town as well to make he man find the sweetness of rich spoil and to allure to he all loose and lose people by like hope of booty as to be a sure retreat to he force in case they should have any ill day or unlucky chance of the field wherefore they take heart to they and go on and besiege the city of exeter the principal town for strength and wealth in those part perkin hear the thunder of arm and preparation against he from so many part raise he siege and march to taunton begin already to squint one eye upon the crown and another upon the sanctuary though the cornish man be become like metal often fire and quench churlish and that would sooner break than bow swearing and vow not to leave he till the uttermost drop of they blood be spill he be at he rise from exeter between six and seven thousand strong many have come unto he after he be set before exeter upon fame of so great a enterprise and to partake of the spoil though upon the raising of he siege some do slip away when he be come near taunton he dissemble all fear and seem all the day to use diligence in prepare all thing ready to fight but about midnight he flee with threescore horse to bewdley -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the new forest where he and diver of he company register themselves sanctuary-men leave he cornish man to the four wind but yet thereby ease they of they vow and use he wonted compassion not to be by when he subject ' blood should be spill the king as soon as he hear of perkin 's flight send presently five hundred horse to pursue and apprehend he before he should get either to the sea or to that same little island call a sanctuary but they come too late for the latter of these therefore all they could do be to beset the sanctuary and to maintain a strong watch about it till the king 's pleasure be further know perkin have at length give himself up be bring into the king 's court but not to the king 's presence though the king to satisfy he curiosity see he sometimes out of a window or in passage he be in show at liberty but guard with all care and watch that be possible and will to follow the king to london but from he first appearance upon the stage in he new person of a sycophant or juggler instead of he former person of a prince all man may think how he be expose to the derision not only of the courtier but also of the common people who flock about he as he go along that one might know afar off where the owl be by the flight of bird some mock some wonder some cursing some prying and pick matter out of he countenance and gesture to talk of so that the false honor and respects which he have so long enjoy be plentifully repay in scorn and contempt as soon as he be come to london the king give also the city the solace of this may-game for he be convey leisurely on horseback but not in any ignominious fashion through cheapside and cornhill to the tower and from thence back again unto westminster with the churme of a thousand taunt and reproach but to amend the show there follow a little distance of perkin a inward counsellor of he one that have be sergeant farrier to the king this fellow when perkin take sanctuary choose rather to take a holy habit than a holy place and clad himself like a hermit and in that weed wander about the country till he be discover and take but this man be bind hand and foot upon the horse and come not back with perkin but be leave at the tower and within few day after execute soon after now that perkin could tell better what himself be he be diligently examine and after he confession take a extract be make of such part of it as be think fit to be divulge which be print and disperse abroad wherein the king do himself no right for as there be a labored tale of particulars of perkin 's father and mother and grandsire and grandmother and uncle and cousin by name and surname and from what place he travel up and down so there be little or nothing to purpose of anything concern he design or any practice that have be hold with he nor the duchess of burgundy herself that all the world do take knowledge of as the person that have put life and be into the whole business so much as name or point at so that man miss of that they look for look about for they know not what and be in more doubt than before but the king choose rather not to satisfy than to kindle coal it be not long but perkin who be make of quicksilver which be hard to hold or imprison begin to stir for deceive he keeper he take he to he heel and make speed to the sea-coast but presently all corner be lay for he and such diligent pursuit and search make as he be fain to turn back and get he to the house of bethlehem call the priory of sheen -lrb- which have the privilege of sanctuary -rrb- and put himself into the hand of the prior of that monastery the prior be think a holy man and much reverence in those day he come to the king and besought the king for perkin 's life only leave he otherwise to the king 's discretion many about the king be again more hot than ever to have the king take he forth and hang he but the king that have a high stomach and could not hate any that he despise bid take he forth and set the knave in the stock and so promise the prior he life he cause he to be bring forth and within two or three day after upon a scaffold set up in the palace court at westminster he be fetter and set in the stock for the whole day and the next day after the like be do by he at the cross in cheapside and in both place he read he confession of which we make mention before and be from cheapside convey and lay up in the tower but it be ordain that this winding-ivy of a plantagenet should kill the true tree itself for perkin after he have be a while in the tower begin to insinuate himself into the favor and kindness of he keeper servant of the lieutenant of the tower sir john digby be four in number -- strangeway blewet astwood and long roger these varlet with mountain of promise he seek to corrupt to obtain he escape but know well that he own fortune be make so contemptible as he could feed no man 's hope and by hope he must work for reward he have none he have contrived with himself a vast and tragical plot which be to draw into he company edward plantagenet earl of warwick then prisoner in the tower whom the weary life of a long imprisonment and the often and renew fear of be put to death have soften to take any impression of counsel for he liberty this young prince he think these servant would look upon though not upon himself and therefore after that by some message by one or two of they he have taste of the earl 's consent it be agree that these four should murder they master the lieutenant secretly in the night and make they best of such money and portable goods of he as they should find ready at hand and get the key of the tower and presently let forth perkin and the earl but this conspiracy be reveal in time before it could be execute and in this again the opinion of the king 's great wisdom do surcharge he with a sinister fame that perkin be but he bait to entrap the earl of warwick and in the very instant while this conspiracy be in work as if that also have be the king 's industry it be fate that there should break forth a counterfeit earl of warwick a cordwainer 's son whose name be ralph wilford a young man teach and set on by a augustin friar call patrick they both from the part from suffolk come forward into kent where they do not only privily and underhand give out that this wilford be the true earl of warwick but also the friar find some light credence in the people take the boldness in the pulpit to declare as much and to incite the people to come in to he aid whereupon they be both presently apprehend and the young fellow execute and the friar condemn to perpetual imprisonment this also happen so opportunely to represent the danger to the king 's estate from the earl of warwick and thereby to color the king 's severity that follow together with the madness of the friar so vainly and desperately to divulge a treason before it have get any manner of strength and the saving of the friar 's life which nevertheless be indeed but the privilege of he order and the pity in the common people which if it run in a strong stream doth ever cast up scandal and envy make it generally rather talk than believe that all be but the king 's device but howsoever it be hereupon perkin that have offend against grace now the third time be at last proceed with and by commissioner of oyer and determiner arraign at westminster upon diver treason commit and perpetrate after he come on land within this kingdom for so the judge advise for that he be a foreigner and condemn and a few day after execute at tyburn where he do again openly read he confession and take it upon he death to be true this be the end of this little cockatrice of a king that be able to destroy those that do not espy he first it be one of the longest play of that kind that have be in memory and might perhaps have have another end if he have not meet with a king wise stout and fortunate -lrb- footnote 1 : sister to edward iv and widow of charle _ le

time he apply to italy the prophetic language of the apocalypse he predict the restoration of the church in italy through severe divine viistation he power in the pulpit be overwhelming and the fame of he preach be spread abroad many regard he as a inspired prophet in he denunciation he spare neither wealth nor position laity nor clergy and he exhort the people to order they life by the simple rule of scripture savonarolum refuse to pay the customary homage of he office to the ruler of florence who at this time be lorenzo de ' medici he own office the preacher declare be receive not from lorenzo but from god overlook the slight lorenzo try by all means to win savonarolum 's favor but the reformer persist in denounce he when a committee ask the preacher to desist from he denunciation

unexpected almost incredible news of the surrender of fortress which have cost the republic prolonged siege and enormous expense and form the key of the whole tuscan territory instantly raise a tumult among the people and the general fury be increase by letter receive from the french camp and the account of the return envoy for they tell with what ease honorable term might have be wrest from the king with what a mixture of cowardice and self-assertion piero de ' medicus have place the whole republic at the mercy of charle viii all give free vent to they indignation and the people begin to gather in the street and square some of the crowd be see to be arm with old weapon which have be hide away for more than half a century and from the wool and silk manufactory strong broad-set dark-visaged man pour forth on that day it seem as though the florentine have leap back a century and that after patient endurance of sixty year ' tyranny they be now decide to reconquer they liberty by violence and bloodshed nevertheless in the midst of this general excitement man 's mind be daunt by a equally general feeling of uncertainty and distrust it be true that the medicus have leave no soldier in florence and that the people could at any moment make themselves master of the whole city but they know not whom to trust nor whom to choose as they leader the old champion of liberty have nearly all perish during the last sixty year either at the block or in persecution and exile the few man at all familiar with state affair be those who have always bask in the favor of the medicus and the multitude just free from slavery would inevitably recur to license if leave to themselves this therefore be one of those terrible moment when no one could foretell what excess and what atrocity might not be commit all day the people stream aimlessly through the street like a impetuous torrent they cast covetous glance on the house of the citizen who have amass wealth by act of oppression but they have no one to lead they only at the hour of savonarolum 's sermon they all flock instinctively to the duomo never have so dense a throng be gather within its wall all be too closely packed to be able to move and when at last savonarolum mount the pulpit he look down upon a solid and motionless mass of upturned face unusual sternness and excitement be depict on every countenance and he could see steel corselet flash here and there in the cloak crowd the friar be now the only man have any influence over the people who seem to hang on he word and look for safety to he alone one hasty word from he mouth would have suffice to cause all the house of the principal citizen to be sack to revive past scene of civil warfare and lead to torrent of blood for the people have be cruelly trample on and be now pant for a cruel revenge he therefore carefully abstain from all allusion to politics he heart be overflow with pity he bent forward with outstretched arm from the pulpit and in tone which echo throughout the building proclaim the law of peace and charity and union behold the sword have come upon you the prophecy be fulfil the scourge begin behold these host be lead by the lord o

love of we and for we sin forgive forgive o lord the florentine people that would fain be thy people in this strain he continue to exhort he hearer to charity faith and concord with such succeed earnestness and fervor that he be exhaust and almost ill for several day after these sermon be less eloquent than some of the other since he be too deeply move for reflection or for study effect but the tenderness with which he speak dominate and soothe the people who fresh from the tumult without enter this place of peace to hear the word of the gospel so magical be the power of savonarolum 's voice in those day that in all this great stir of public excitement not a single excess be commit and the revolution that seem on the point of be effect by violence on the piazza be quietly and peacefully accomplish within the wall of the palace and this miracle unprecedented in florentine history be unanimously attribute by the historian of the time to savonarolum 's beneficial ascendency over the mind of the people on November 4th the seigniory call a special meeting of the council of seventy in order to decide what course to adopt all the member be adherent and nominee of the medicus but be so enraged by the cowardly surrender of the fortress that they already have the air of a republican assembly accord to the old florentine law and custom no one be allow to speak unless invite to do so by the seigniory and be then only expect to support the measure which they have propose but in moment of public excitement neither this nor any other law be observe in florence on this day there be great agitation in the council the safety of the country be at stake the seigniory ask everyone for advice and all wish to speak yet so much be man 's mind daunt by the long habit of slavery that when messer luca corsinus break through the old rule and rise to he foot uninvited begin to remark that thing be go badly the city fall into a state of anarchy and that some strong remedy be require everyone feel amaze some of he colleague begin to murmur other to cough and at last he begin to falter and become so confused that he could not go on with he speech however the debate be soon reopen by jacopo di tanai de ' nerli a youth of considerable spirit who warmly second corsini 's word but he too presently begin to hesitate and he father rise in great confusion seek to excuse he in the eye of the assembly by say that he be young and foolish lastly piero di gino capponus rise to he foot with he finely proportioned form white hair fiery glance and a certain air of buoyant courage like that of a war-horse at sound of trumpet he attract universal attention and reduce all to silence he be know to be a man of few but resolute word and of still more resolute deed he now speak plainly and say : piero de ' medicus be no longer fit to rule the state the republic must provide for itself _ the moment have come to shake off this baby government _ let ambassador be send to king charle and should they meet piero by the way let they pass he without salutation and let they explain that he have cause all the evil and that the city be well disposed to the french let honorable man be choose to give a fitting welcome to the king but at the same time let all the captain and soldiery be summon in from the country and hide away in cloister and other secret place and besides the soldiery let all man be prepare to fight in case of need so that when we shall have do we best to act honestly toward this most christian monarch and to satisfy with money the avarice of the french we may be ready to face he and show we tooth if he should try we beyond we patience either by word or deed and above all he say in conclusion it must not be forget to send father girolamo savonarolum as one of the ambassador for he have gain the entire love of the people he might have add : because he have the entire respect of the king for charle have conceive a almost religious veneration for the man who have so long foretell he come and declare it to be ordain by the lord the new ambassador be elect on November 5th and consist of pandolfo rocellaus giovannus cavalcanti piero capponus tanai de ' nerlus and savonarolum the latter allow the other to precede he to lucca where they hope to meet the king while he follow on foot accord to he usual custom accompany by two of he brethren but before start he again address the people and preach a sermon end with these word : the lord have grant thy prayer and work a great revolution by peaceful means he alone come to rescue the city when it be forsake of all wait and thou shalt see the disaster which will happen elsewhere therefore be steadfast in good work o people of florence be steadfast in peace if thou wouldst have the lord steadfast in mercy be thou merciful toward thy brethren thy friend and thy enemy otherwise thou too shalt be smite by the scourge prepare for the rest of italy ' _ misericordiam volo _ ' crieth the lord unto ye woe to he that obeyeth not he command after deliver this discourse he start for pisa where the other ambassador and also the king speedily arrive meanwhile disturbance go on increase and the populace seem already intoxicate with license the dwelling of giovannus guidus notary and chancellor of the riformagionus and of antonio miniatus manager of the monte be put to the sack for both these man have be faithful tool of the medicus and they subtle counsellor in the art of burden the people with insupportable tax be object of general hatred the house of cardinal giovannus de ' medicus be also pillage together with the garden by st mark 's in which so many treasure of art have be collect by lorenzo so far with the exception of a few dagger-thrust no blood have be shed but many be eager for conflict and it would have certainly begin have not savonarolum 's partisan do they best to keep the peace and have not the friar be hourly expect from pisa whither he have repair on the 13th day of the month with a second embassy the seigniory also endeavor to quell the disturbance by means of edict of the severest kind but the popular discontent be now heighten by the arrival of other envoy from pisa with very unsatisfactory tiding they have inform the king that florence be friendly to he and already prepare to welcome he with all the honor due to he royalty they only ask that be receive as a friend he should bear himself in that light and deign to name he term at once so that free vent might be give to the public joy but the only reply charle condescend to give be that once in the great town all should be arrange and it be evident from he majesty 's coldness that the solicitation of piero de ' medici he earnest prayer lavish promise of money and submissive obedience have turn he not in he favor consequently the ambassador have to leave without any definite answer and could only say that the monarch be by no means well dispose to the republic but when the foiled envoy have leave pisa savonarolum repair to the french camp and pass through that great host of armed man make he way to the king 's presence charle who be surround by he general receive he very kindly and thereupon without waste much time in preliminary the friar in sonorous and almost commanding accent address he with a short exhortation beginning as follow : o most christian king thou art a instrument in the hand of the lord who sendeth thee to relieve the woe of italy as for many year i have foretell and he sendeth thee to reform the church which now lieth prostrate in the dust but if thou be not just and merciful if thou shouldst fail to respect the city of florence its woman its citizen and its liberty if thou shouldst forget the task the lord have send thee to perform then will he choose another to fulfil it he hand shall smite thee and chastise thee with terrible scourge these thing say i unto you in the name of the lord the king and he general seem much impress by savonarolum 's menacing word and to have full belief in they in fact it be the general feeling of the french that they be divinely guide to fulfil the lord 's work and charle feel a strong veneration for the man who have prophesy he come and foretell the success of he expedition consequently the friar 's exhortation inspire he with real terror and also decide he to behave more honorably to the florentine thus when savonarolum return to the city shortly after the other ambassador he be the bearer of more satisfactory intelligence as the king 's intention be still unknown fresh relay of ambassador be send out to he but meanwhile french officer and man pass the gate in little band of fifteen or so at a time and be see rove about the town unarmed jaunty and gallant bearing piece of chalk in they hand to mark the house on which they troops be to be billet while affect a air of contemptuous indifference they be unable to hide they amazement at the sight of so many splendid building and at every turn be confound by the novel scene present to they gaze but what strike they most of all be the grim severity of the palace which appear to be impregnable stronghold and the town still scar with the mark of fierce and sanguinary faction fight then on November 15th they witness a sight that send a thrill of fear to they soul whether by accident or design a rumor suddenly spread through the town that piero de ' medicus be near the gate instantly the bell of the seigniory clang the alarm the street swarm with a furious mob arm man spring as by magic from the earth and rush toward the piazza palace door be bar tower bristle with defender stockade begin to be build across the street and on that day the french take they first lesson in the art of barricade it be soon ascertain that the rumor be false and the tumult subside as quickly as it have rise but the foreign soldier be force to acknowledge that they tactic and stout battalion would be almost powerless hem in those street against this new and unknown mode of warfare in fact the florentine look on the frenchman with a certain pert assurance as if they would say we shall see for have now regain its liberty this people think itself master of the world and almost believe that there be nothing leave for it to fear meanwhile splendid preparation be be make in the medicus palace for the reception of king charle he officer be to be lodge in the house of the principal citizen and the street through which he be to pass be cover with awning and drape with hanging and tapestry on November 17th the seigniory assemble on a platform erect by the san frediano gate and number of young florentine noble go forth to meet the king who make he state entry at the twenty-first hour of the day the member of the seigniory then rise and advance toward he to pay they respects while messer luca corsinus be depute to that office stand forth to read a write address but just at that moment rain begin to fall the horse grow restless and hustle against one another and the whole ceremony be throw into confusion only messer francesco gaddus one of the officer of the palace have sufficient presence of mind to press he way through the throng and make a short speech suit to the occasion in french after which the king move forward under a rich canopy the monarch 's appearance be in strange contrast with that of the numerous and powerful army behind he he seem almost a monster with he enormous head long nose wide gaping mouth big white purblind eye very diminutive body extraordinarily thin leg and misshapen foot he be clothe in black velvet and a mantle of gold brocade bestride a tall and very beautiful charger and enter the city ride with he lance level -- a martial attitude then consider as a sign of conquest all this render the meanness of he person the more grotesquely conspicuous by he side ride the haughty cardinal of st piero in vincolus the cardinal of st malo and a few marshal at they heel come the royal bodyguard of one hundred bowman compose of the finest young man in france and then two hundred french knight march on foot with splendid dress and equipment these be follow by the swiss vanguard resplendent and party-colored bearing halberd of burnish steel and with rich wave plume on they officer ' helmet the face of these man express the mountaineer spirit of daring and the proud consciousness of be the first infantry in europe while the greater part of they have scornfully throw aside the cuirass prefer to fight with they chest bare the center consist of gascon infantry small light agile man whose number seem to multiply as the army advance but the grandest sight be the cavalry comprise the flower of the french aristocracy and display finely work weapon mantle of gorgeous brocade velvet banner embroider with gold chain of gold and other precious ornament the cuirassier have a terrible aspect for they horse seem like monster with they crop tail and ear the archer be man of extraordinary height arm with very long wooden bow they come from scotland and other northern country and in the word of a contemporary historian seem to be beast-like man _ -lrb- parevano uominus bestialus -rrb- _ this well-ordered and disciplined army compose of so many different nationality with such varied attire and strange weapon be as new and amazing a sight to florence as to almost all italy where no standing army be as yet in existence and mercenary the only soldiery know it be impossible to give the number of the force accompany the king to florence for he artillery be march toward rome by another route he have leave garrison in many stronghold and send on another body of man by romagna gaddus who witness the entrance of the french say that they number amount to twelve thousand rinuccinus who be also present estimate they at a lower figure other at a higher in any case the city and suburb be cram with they the procession march over the ponte vecchio -lrb- old bridge -rrb- which be gay with festive decoration and sound of music wound across the piazza amid a crowd of triumphal car statue etc and pass the canto dei pazzi make the tour of the cathedral square and halt before the great door of the church the people shout the name of france with cry of applause but the king only smile inanely and stammer some inappropriate word in italian enter the duomo he be meet by the seigniory who to avoid the pressure of the armed host have be oblige to come around by the back street after join in prayer with they royal guest they escort he to the sumptuous palace of the medicus and the soldier disperse to they quarter that night and the next the whole city be a blaze of illuminations the intervene day be devote to feast and amusement and then the term of the treaty begin to be discuss the term of the treaty stand as follow : that there should be a good and faithful friendship between the republic and the king that they subject should have reciprocal protection that the king should receive the title of restorer and protector of the liberty of florence that he should be pay one hundred twenty thousand florin in three instalment that he be not to retain the fortress for more than two year and if the neapolitan expedition finish before that date he be then to give they up without delay that the pisan be to receive pardon as soon as they should resume they allegiance to florence it be also stipulate that the decree put a price on the head of the medicus should be revoke but that the state of giuliano and cardinal giovannus be to remain confiscate until all piero 's debt have be pay and that the say piero be to remain banish to a distance of two hundred mile and he brother of one hundred from the tuscan border after the agreement have be draw up in regular official form the contracting party meet in the duomo to swear to the observance of all its clause and in the evening there be a general illumination of the city although the people give no sign of they previous good-will toward the king but no sooner be one difficulty dispose of than another arise when all be conclude charle relapse into he normal state of inertia and show no disposition to depart the city be throng by the french quarter in the house and the italian soldiery hide on all side the shop be shut up and all traffic suspend everything be in a state of uncertainty and disorder and the continual quarrel between the native and the foreigner might at any moment provoke the most serious complication there be perpetual robbery and murder by night -- a most unusual state of thing for florence and the people seem to be on the verge of revolt at the least provocation thus matter go on from day to day and consequently all honest citizen vainly do they utmost to hasten the king 's departure and the universal suspense be heighten by the impossibility of find any way of force he to a decision at last another appeal be make to savonarolum who be exert all he influence to keep the people quiet and whose peaceful admonition during this period of danger and confusion have be no less efficacious than the heroic defiance of piero capponi the friar 's sermon at this time be always direct to the general welfare he exhort the citizen to lay aside they animosity and ambition to attend the council at the palace in a righteous spirit and with a view not to they personal interest but to the general good and with the firm resolve to promote the unity and concord of they city then indeed would they be acceptable in the lord 's sight he address himself to every class of the people in turn prove to all that it would be to they own advantage both in this life and the next to labor for the defense of liberty and the establishment of unity and concord when ask to seek the king and endeavor to persuade he to leave he cheerfully undertake the task and hasten to the royal abode the officer and lord in attendance be at first inclined to refuse he admittance fear that he visit might defeat they plan of pillage the treasure of this sumptuous palace but remember the veneration in which the friar be hold by the king they dare not refuse he demand and allow he to pass charle surround by he baron receive he very graciously and savonarolum go straight to the point by say : most christian prince thy stay here be cause great injury both to we own city and thy enterprise thou losest time forgetful of the duty impose on thee by providence and to the serious hurt of thy spiritual welfare and worldly fame hearken now to the voice of god 's servant pursue thy journey without delay seek not to bring ruin on this city and thereby rouse the anger of the lord against thee so at last on November 28th at the twenty-second hour of the day the king depart with he army leave the people of florence very badly disposed toward he among they many just cause of complaint be the sack of the splendid palace in which he have be so liberally and trustfully entertain nor be common soldier and inferior officer alone concern in this robbery the hand of general and baron be equally busy and the king himself carry off object of the greatest value among other thing a precious intaglio represent a unicorn estimate by comine to be worth about seven thousand ducat with such a example set by they sovereign it may be easily imagine how the other behave and comine himself tell we that they shamelessly take possession of everything that tempt they greed thus the rich and marvellous collection form by the medicus be all lose except what have be place in safety at st mark 's for the few thing leave behind by the french be so much damage that they have to be sell nevertheless the inhabitant be so rejoice to be finally rid of they dangerous guest that no one mourn over these theft on the contrary public thanksgiving be offer up in the church the people go about the street with they old gayety and lightheartedness and the authority begin to take measure to pro vide for the urgent necessity of the new republic during this interval the aspect of florentine affair have entirely change the partisan of the medicus have disappear from the city as if by magic the popular party rule over everything and savonarolum rule the will of the whole population he be unanimously declare to have be a prophet of all that have occur the only man that have succeed in control the king 's conduct on he entry into florence the only man who have induce he to depart accordingly all hang on savonarolum 's lip for counsel aid and direction as to they future proceedings and as though the man of the old state see the need of efface themselves to make way for new blood several prominent representative and friend of the medici house die during this period angelo poliziano have pass away this year on September 24th load with as much infamy and public opprobrium as a man could well bear he be accuse of numberless vice and unlimited profligacy but the chief cause of all the hatred lavish on he be the general detestation already feel for piero de ' medici the approach of he downfall and that of all he adherent nor be the public rancor at all soften by the knowledge that the last utterance of the illustrious poet and learn scholar have be the word of a penitent christian he have request that he body should be clothe in the dominican habit and inter in the church of st mark and there he ash repose beside the remains of giovannus picodellum mirandolum who expire on the very day of charle viii 's entry into florence pico have long entertain a desire to join the fraternity of st mark 's but delay too long to carry out he intent be surprise by death at the early age of thirty-two year on he death-bed he too have besought savonarolum to allow he to be bury in the robe he have yearn to wear the end of these two celebrated italian recall to mind the last hour and last confession of lorenzo the magnificent and be by many regard as a sign that the medicean adherent have be unwilling to pass away without acknowledge they crime without ask pardon from the people whom they have so deeply oppressed and from the friar who be as it be the people 's best representative it be certainly remarkable that all these man should turn to the convent of st mark whence have issue the first cry of liberty and the first sign of war against the tyranny of the medicus jean c l sismondus at the moment that florence expel the medicus the republic be divide among three different party the first be that of the enthusiast direct by girolamo savonarolum who promise the miraculous protection of the divinity for the reform of the church and establishment of liberty these demand a democratic constitution they be call the piagnonus the second consist of man who have share power with the medicus but who have separate from they who wish to possess alone the power and profit of government and who endeavor to amuse the people by dissipation and pleasure in order to establish at they ease a aristocracy these be call the arabbiatus the third party be compose of man who remain faithful to the medicus but not daring to declare themselves live in retirement they be call bigus these three party be so equally balance in the _ balium _ name by the parliament on December 2 1494 that it soon become impossible to carry on the government girolamo savonarolum take advantage of this state of affair to urge that the people have never delegate they power to a balium which do not abuse the trust the people he say would do much better to reserve this power to themselves and exercise it by a council into which all the citizen should be admit he proposition be agree to more than one thousand eight hundred florentine furnished proof that either they they father or they grandfather have sit in the magistracy they be consequently acknowledged citizen and admit to sit in the general council this council be declare sovereign on July 1 1495 it be invest with the election of magistrate hitherto choose by lot and a general amnesty be proclaim to bury in oblivion all the ancient dissension of the florentine republic so important a modification of the constitution seem to promise this republic a happier futurity the friar savonarolum who have exercise such influence in the council evince at the same time a ardent love of mankind deep respect for the rights of all great sensibility and a elevated mind though a zealous reformer of the church and in this respect a precursor of luther who be destine to begin he mission twenty year later he do not quit the pale of orthodoxy he do not assume the right of examine doctrine he limit he effort to the restoration of discipline the reformation of the moral of the clergy and the recall of priest as well as other citizen to the practice of the gospel precept but he zeal be mix with enthusiasm he believe himself under the immediate inspiration of providence he take he own impulse for prophetic revelation by which he direct the politics of he disciple the piagnonus he have predict to the florentine the come of the french into italy he have represent to they charle viii as a instrument by which the divinity design to chastise the crime of the nation he have counsel they to remain faithful to they alliance with that king the instrument of providence even though he conduct especially in reference to the affair of pisa have be highly culpable this alliance however range the florentine among the enemy of pope alexander vi one of the founder of the league which have drive the french out of italy he accuse they of be traitor to the church and to they country for they attachment to a foreign prince alexander equally offend by the project of reform and by the politics of savonarolum denounce he to the church as a heretic and interdict he from preach the monk at first obey and procure the appointment of he friend and disciple the dominican friar buonvicino of pescium as he successor in the church of st mark but on christmas day 1497 he declare from the pulpit that god have reveal to he that he ought not to submit to a corrupt tribunal he then openly take the sacrament with the monk of st mark and afterward continue to preach in the course of he sermon he more than once hold up to reprobation the scandalous conduct of the pope whom the public voice accuse of every vice and every crime to be expect in a libertine so depraved -- a man so ambitious perfidious and cruel -- a monarch and a priest intoxicate with absolute power in the mean time the rivalry encourage by the court of rome between the religious order soon procure the pope a champion eager to combat savonarolum he be a dominican -- the general of the augustine that order whence martin luther be soon to issue friar mariano di ghinazzano signalize himself by he zeal in oppose savonarolum he present to the pope friar franci of apulium of the order of minor observantine who be send to florence to preach against the florentine monk in the church of santa croce this preacher declare to he audience that he know savonarola pretend to support he doctrine by a miracle for I say he i be a sinner i have not the presumption to perform miracle nevertheless let a fire be light and i be ready to enter it with he i be certain of perish but christian charity teach I not to withhold my life if in sacrifice it i might precipitate into hell a heresiarch who have already draw into it so many soul this strange proposition be reject by savonarolum but he friend and disciple friar dominic buonvicino eagerly accept it franci of apulium declare that he would risk he life against savonarolum only meanwhile a crowd of monk of the dominican and franciscan order rival each other in they offer to prove by the ordeal of fire on one side the truth on the other the falsehood of the new doctrine enthusiasm spread beyond the two convent many priest and secular and even woman and child more especially on the side of savonarolum earnestly request to be admit to the proof the pope warmly testify he gratitude to the franciscan for they devotion the seigniory of florence consent that two monk only should devote themselves for they respective order and direct the pile to be prepare the whole population of the town and country to which a signal miracle be promise receive the announcement with transport of joy on April 17 1498 a scaffold dreadful to look on be erect in the public square of florence two pile of large piece of wood mix with fagot and broom which should quickly take fire extend each eighty foot long four foot thick and five foot high they be separate by a narrow space of two foot to serve as a passage by which the two priest be to enter and pass the whole length of the pile during the fire every window be full every roof be cover with spectator almost the whole population of the republic be collect round the place the portico call the loggia dei lanzi divide in two by a partition be assign to the two order of monk the dominican arrive at they station chant canticle and bear the holy sacrament the franciscan immediately declare that they would not permit the host to be carry amid flame they insist that the friar buonvicino should enter the fire as they own champion be prepare to do without this divine safeguard the dominican answer that they would not separate themselves from they god at the moment when they implore he aid the dispute upon this point grow warm several hour pass away the multitude which have wait long and begin to feel hunger and thirst lose patience a deluge of rain suddenly fall upon the city and descend in torrent from the roof of the house all present be drench the pile be so wet that they could no longer be light and the crowd disappointed of a miracle so impatiently look for separate with the notion of have be unworthily trifle with savonarolum lose all he credit he be henceforth rather look on as a impostor next day he convent be besiege by the arabbiatus eager to profit by the inconstancy of the multitude he be arrest with he two friend domenico buonvicino and silvestro marruffus and lead to prison the piagnonus he partisan be expose to every outrage from the populace two of they be kill they rival and old enemy exciting the general ferment for they destruction even in the seigniory the majority be against they and yield to the press demand of the pope the three imprison monk be subject to a criminal prosecution alexander vi despatch judge from rome with order to condemn the accuse to death conformably with the law of the church the trial open with the torture savonarolum be too weak and nervous to support it he vow in he agony all that be imputed to he and with he two disciple be condemn to death the three monk be burn alive may 23 1498 in the same square where six week before a pile have be raise to prepare they a triumph discovery of the mainland of north america by the cabot ad 1497 samuel edward dawson newfoundland pride herself on be the oldest colony of the english crown by virtue of john cabot 's discovery in ad 1497 she also claim the honor of be the first portion of the new-world continent to be discover and make know by european this be fourteen month before columbus on he third expedition behold the american mainland at the close of the fifteenth century the impel motive of discovery among the old-world nation and they adventurous mariner be the hope of find a short western passage to the riches of the east indy this be the chief lure of the period add to the ambition of old-world monarch to extend they territorial possession and bring they within the embrace of they individual flag henry vii of england aid the cabot father and son to fit out two expedition from bristol to explore the coast of the new world and extend the search for hitherto unknown country the result of these enterprise be the discovery of newfoundland and labrador as well as other land and england 's claim to the possession of the greater portion of the north american continent probably no question in the history of this continent have be the subject of so much discussion as the life and voyage of the two cabot they personal character they nationality the number of voyage they make and the extent and direction of they discovery have be and still be keenly dispute over the share moreover of each in the credit due for the discovery make be a very battle-ground for historian some learn writer attribute everything to john cabot other would put he aside and award all the credit to he second son sebastian the date even of the voyage be dispute and very learn professor of history in portugal do not hesitate to declare that the voyage be apocryphal the discovery pretend and the whole question a mystification nevertheless solely upon the discovery of the cabot have always rest the original claim of the english race to a foothold upon this continent in the publish annals of england however no contemporary record of they exist nor be there for sixty year in english literature any recognition of they achievement the english claim rest almost solely upon second-hand evidence from spanish and italian author upon contemporary report of spanish and italian envoy at the english court upon record of the two letters-patent issue and upon two or three entry lately discover in the account of disbursement from the privy purse of king henry vii these be we title-deed to this continent the evidence be doubtless conclusive but the whole subject of western discovery be undervalue and neglect by england for so long a period that it be no wonder if portuguese savant deny the reality of those voyage see that they nation have be supplant by a race which can show so little original evidence of its claim it be not my intention to wander over all the debatable ground of the cabot voyage where every circumstance bristle with conflict theory the original authority be few and scanty but mountain of hypothesis have be build upon they and too often the supposition of one writer have be the fact of a succeed one step by step the learn student before allude to have establish certain proposition which appear to I to be true and which i shall accept without further discussion among these i count the following : 1 that john cabot be a venetian of genoese birth naturalized at venice on march 28 1476 after the customary fifteen year of residence and that he subsequently settle in england with all he family 2 that sebastian he second son be bear in venice and when very young be take by he father to england with the rest of the family 3 that on petition of john cabot and he three son lewi sebastian and sancio letters-patent of king henry vii be issue under date march 5 1496 empower they at they own expense to discover and take possession for england of new land not before find by any christian nation 4 that john cabot accompany perhaps by he son sebastian sail from bristol early in may 1497 he discover and land upon some part of america between cape cod in massachusett and cape chidley in labrador that he return to bristol before the end of July of the same year that whatever might have be the number of vessel which start the discovery be make by john cabot 's own vessel the matthew of bristol with a crew of eighteen man 5 that thereupon and in consideration of this discovery make by john cabot king henry vii grant new letters-patent draw solely to john cabot authorize a second expedition on a more extended scale and with fuller royal authority which letters-patent be date February 3 1498 that this expedition sail in the spring of 1498 and have not return in October it consist of several ship and about three hundred man that john and sebastian cabot sail on this voyage when it return be not know from the time of sailing of this expedition john cabot vanish into the unknowable and from thenceforth sebastian alone appear in the historic record these point be now fully support by satisfactory evidence mostly documentary and contemporary as for john cabot sebastian say he die which be one of the few undisputed fact in the discussion but if sebastian be correctly report in ramusio to have say that he die at the time when the news of columbus ' discovery reach england then sebastian cabot tell a untruth because the letters-patent of 1498 be address to john cabot alone the son have a gift of reticence concern other include he father and brother which in these latter day have be the cause of much wearisome research to scholar to avoid further discussion of the precede point be however a great gain from among the numerous opinion concern the landfall of john cabot three theory emerge which may be seriously entertain all three be support by evidence of much weight : 1 that it be in newfoundland 2 that it be on the labrador coast 3 that it be on the island of cape breton until a comparatively recent period it be universally hold by english writer that newfoundland be the part of north america first see by cabot the name newfoundland lend itself to this view for in the letters-patent of 1498 the expression londe and ile of late founde and the wording of the award record in the king 's privy-purse account August 10 1497 to hym that founde the new ile # i0 seem naturally to suggest the island of newfoundland of we day and this impression be strengthen by read the old author who spell it as richard whitbourne in 1588 new-found-land in three word with connect hyphen and often with the definite article the newe-found-land a cursory reading of the whole literature of american discovery before 1831 would suggest that idea and some writer of the present day still maintain it author of other nationality have however always dispute it and have push the english discovery far north to labrador and even to greenland champlain who read and study everything relate to he profession concede to the english the coast of labrador north of 56 ° and the region about davi strait and the map which for a long period with a few notable exception be make only by spaniard portuguese and italian bear out champlain 's remonstrance it seem moreover on a cursory consideration of the map probable that a vessel on a westerly course pass south of ireland should strike somewhere on the coast of newfoundland about cape bonavista and cabot be a italian that very place suggest itself by its name as he probable landfall the english who for the most part have have they greatness thrust upon they by circumstance neglect cabot 's discovery for fifty year and during that time the french and portuguese take possession of the whole region and name all the coast then when the troubled reign of henry viii be over the english people begin to wake up and in fact rediscover cabot and he voyage a careful study however of the subject will be likely to lead to the rejection of the newfoundland landfall plausible as it may at first sight appear in the year 1831 richard biddle a lawyer of pittsburg pennsylvanium publish a memoir of sebastian cabot which lead the way to a almost universal change of opinion he advance the theory that labrador be the cabot landfall in 1497 he book be one of great research and though confuse in its arrangement be write with much vigor and ability but biddle lose the historian in the advocate he book be a passionate brief for sebastian cabot for he strangely conceive the son to have be wrong by the ascription to john cabot of any portion of the merit of the discovery of america not only would he suppress the elder cabot but he cover the well-meaning hakluyt with opprobrium and undermine he character by insinuation much as a criminal lawyer might be suppose to do to a adverse witness in a jury trial valuable as the work be there be a singular heat pervade it fatal to the true historic spirit hakluyt be the pioneer of the literature of english discovery and adventure -- at once the recorder and inspirer of noble effort he be more than a translator he spare no pain nor expense to obtain from the lip of seaman they own version of they voyage and if discrepancy be meet with in a collection so voluminous it be not surprising and need not be ascribe to a set purpose for hakluyt 's sole object in life seem to have be to record all he know or could ascertain of the maritime achievement of the age biddle 's book mark a epoch in the controversy in truth he seem to be the first who give minute study to the original authority and break away from the tradition of newfoundland he fix the landfall on the coast of labrador and humboldt and kohl add the weight of they great learning to he theory harrisse who in he _ john and sebastian cabot _ have write in favor of cape breton have in he latest book _ the discovery of america _ go back to labrador as he faith in the celebrated map of 1544 gradually wane and he esteem for the character of sebastian cabot fade away such change of view not only in this but in other matter render mr harrisse 's book somewhat confusing although the student of american history can never be sufficiently thankful for he untiring research the discovery in germany by von martius in 1843 of a engrave _ mappemonde _ bearing date of 1544 and purport to be issue under the authority of sebastian cabot soon cause a general current of opinion in favor of a landfall in cape breton the map be unique and be now in the national library at paris it bear no name of publisher nor place of publication around it for forty year controversy have wax warm kohl do not accept the map as authentic d'avezac on the contrary give it full credence the tide of opinion have set of late in favor of it and in consequence in favor of the cape breton landfall because it bear plainly inscribe upon that island the word _ prima tierra vista _ and the legend which be around the map identify beyond question that as the landfall of the first voyage dr deane in _ winter 's narrative and critical history _ support this view markham in he introduction to the volume of the hakluyt society for 1893 also accept it and we own honorary secretary -lrb- the late sir john bourinot -rrb- in he learn and exhaustive monograph on cape breton incline to the same theory i do not propose here to discuss the difficult problem of this map for many year under the influence of current tradition and cursory reading i believe the landfall of john cabot to have be in newfoundland but a closer study of the original authority have lead I to concur in the view which place it somewhere on the island of cape breton at the threshold of a inquiry into the _ prima tierra vista _ or landfall of 1497 it be before all thing necessary to distinguish sharply in every record detail between the first and second voyage i venture to think that if this have always be do much confusion and controversy would have be avoid it be not do by the older writer and the writer of later year have follow they without sufficiently observe that the authority they be build upon be refer almost solely to the second voyage even when some occasional detail of the first voyage be introduce the circumstance of the second voyage be interwoven and become dominant in the narrative so that the impression of one voyage only remain upon the mind we must therefore always remember the antithesis which exist between they thus the first voyage be make in one small vessel with a crew of eighteen man the second with five ship and three hundred man the first voyage be undertake with john cabot 's own resource the second with the royal authority to take six ship and they outfit on the same condition as if for the king 's service the first voyage be a private venture the second a official expedition the first voyage extend over three month and be provision for that period only the second be victual for twelve month and extend over six month at least for how much longer be not know the course of the first voyage be south of ireland then for a while north and afterward west with the pole star on the right hand the course of the second until land be see be north into northern sea toward the north pole in the direction of iceland to the cape of labrador at 58 ° north latitude on the first voyage no ice be report on the second the lead feature be berg and floe of ice and long day of arctic summer on the first voyage cabot see no man on the second he find people clothe with beaste skynne during the whole of the first voyage john cabot be the commander on the second voyage he sail in command but who bring the expedition home and when it return be not record it be not know how or when john cabot die and although the letters-patent for the second voyage be address to he alone he son sebastian during forty-five year take the whole credit in every subsequent mention of the discovery of america without any allusion to he father this antithesis may throw light upon the suppression of he father 's name in all the statement attribute to or make by sebastian cabot he may always have have the second voyage in he mind he father may have die on the voyage he be marvellously reticent about he father the only mention which occur be on the map see by hakluyt and on the map of 1544 suppose somewhat rashly to be a transcript of it there the discovery be attribute to john cabot and to sebastian he son and that have reference to the first voyage from these consideration it would appear that those who place the landfall at labrador be right but it be the landfall of the second voyage -- the voyage sebastian be always talk about -- not the landfall of john cabot in 1497 if sebastian cabot have not be so much wrap up in he own vainglory we might have have a full record of the eventful voyage which reveal to europe the shore of we canadian dominion first of all the land on the continent of the western hemisphere fortunately however there reside in london at that time a most intelligent italian raimondo di soncino envoy of the duke of milan ludovico sforza one of those despot of the renaissance who almost atone for they treachery and cruelty by they thirst for knowledge and love of art he soncino keep inform of all matter go on at london and especially concern matter of cosmography to which the duke be much devote from he letter we be enable to retrace the momentous voyage of the little matthew of bristol across the western ocean -- not the sunny region of steady trade-wind by whose favor influence columbus be waft to he destination but the boisterous reach of the northern atlantic -- over that still vex sea which share with one or two other the reputation of be the most storm-tossed region in the world of ocean that the land discover be suppose to be a part of asia appear very clearly from the same letter it be in the territory of the grand cam the land be good and the climate temperate and cabot intend on he next voyage after occupy that place to proceed farther westward until he should arrive at the longitude of japan which island he evidently think to be south of he landfall and near the equator it should be carefully note that in all the circumstance on record which be indisputably referable to this first voyage nothing have be say of ice or of any notable extension of daylight these be the mark of the second voyage for if anything unusual have exist in the length of the day it would have be at its maximum on midsummer 's day June 24th the day he make land nothing be report in these letter which indicate a high latitude now labrador be a cold waste region of rock swamp and mountain even inside the strait of belle-isle it be so barren and forbid as to call forth cartier 's oft-cited remark that it be like the land god give to cain the coast of labrador be not the place to invite a second voyage if it be once see but the climate of cape breton be very pleasant in early summer and the country be well wood from the contemporary document relate specially to the first voyage it be beyond question that cabot see no human be on the coast though he bring back evidence of they presence at some previous time it be beyond doubt also on the same authority that the voyage last not longer than three month and that provision give out so that he have not time to land on the return voyage it be in fact a reconnoitr expedition to prepare the way for a greater effort and establish confidence in the existence of land across the ocean easily reach from england the distance sail be give by soncino at four hundred league but pasqualigo write to venice give it at seven hundred league equivalent to two thousand two hundred twenty-six mile which be very nearly the distance between bristol and cape breton as now estimate all these circumstance concern the first voyage be derive from john cabot 's own report and be extract from document date previous to the return of the second expedition and therefore be of necessity free from admixture with extraneous incident antonio galvano a experienced portuguese sailor and cosmographer writing in 1563 like the other know of one voyage only which he fix in 1496 he interweave like they in he narrative many circumstance of the second voyage but it be important to note that from some independent source be give the landfall at 45 ° the latitude very nearly of cape breton on the island of cape breton another point be also record in the letter that on the return voyage cabot pass two island to the right which the shortness of he provision prevent he from examine this note should not be consider identical with the statement record by soncino in he first letter for this last writer evidently mean to indicate the land which cabot find and examine he say that cabot discover two large and fertile island but the two island of pasqualigo be pass without examination they be probably the island of st pierre and miquelon but that john cabot have no idea of a northward voyage at that time in he mind would appear from he intention to sail farther to the east on he next voyage until he reach the longitude of cipango moreover the reward record in the king 's privy-purse account to hym that founde the new ile and the wording thrice repeat of the second letters-patent the land and isle of late find by the say john indicate that it be not at that time known whether the mainland of cathay have be reach or as in the discovery of columbus island upon the coast of asia from the precede narrative base solely upon document write within twelve month of the event -- which document be record of statement take from the lip of john cabot the chief actor at the very time of he return from the first voyage -- it will i trust appear that in 1497 at a time of year when the ice be not clear from the coast of labrador he discover a part of america in a temperate climate and that this be do without the name of sebastian cabot once come to the surface excepting when it appear in the patent of 1496 together with the name of lewi and sancio he brother while the circumstance record be incompatible with a landfall at labrador they do not exclude the possibility of a landfall on the eastern coast of newfoundland which be so varied in its character as to correspond with almost any condition likely to be find in a landfall on the american coast but inasmuch as from other reason it will i think appear that the landfall be at cape breton it will be a shorter process to prove by a positive argument where it be than to show by a negative argument where it be not i might here borrow the quaint phrase of herodotus and say now i have do speaking of john cabot he have beyond doubt discover the eastern coast of this we canada and he have organize a second expedition and he have sail in command forthwith upon such sailing he vanish utterly and he second son sebastian both of he brother have in some unknown way also vanish emerge and from henceforth become the whole cabot family it behoove we therefore if we wish to grasp the whole subject to inquire what manner of man he be sebastian cabot be bear in venice and when still very young be take to england with the rest of he family by he father he be then however old enough to have learn the humanities and the property of the sphere and to this latter knowledge he become so addict that he early in life form fix idea he be probably entitle to the merit of have urge the practical application of the truth that the shortest course from point to point upon the globe lie upon a great circle and also that the great circle unite western europe with cathay pass over the north pole this fix idea of the younger cabot pervade all he life and show in all he report conversation he adhere to it with the pertinacity of a columbus and in he later life after he return to england he effort which in youth be direct to a northwest passage go out toward a northeast passage to cathay john cabot 's genius be more practical as the second letter of raimondo di soncino show he intention be to occupy on the second voyage the landfall he have make and then push on to the east -lrb- west as we call it now -rrb- and south the diversion of that expedition to the coast of labrador would indicate that the death of the elder cabot and the assumption of command by he son occur early in the voyage sebastian cabot seem to have be not so much a great sailor as a great nautical theorizer gomara say he discover nothing for spain and beyond doubt he expedition to la pla can not be consider successful for it be intend to reach the molucca one fix idea of he life be the course to cathay by the north that idea he monopolize to himself he overvalue its importance and think to be the columbus of a new highway to the east hence he may have underrate he father 's achievement as he brood over what he consider to be he own great secret he theorize on the sphere and he theorize on the variation of the compass and he theorize on a method of find longitude by the variation of the needle so that even richard eden who greatly admire he write as follow : sebastian cabot on he death-bed tell I that he have the knowledge thereof -lrb- longitude by variation -rrb- by divine revelation yet so that he might not teach any man but i thinke that the goode olde man in that extreme age somewhat dote and have not yet even in the article of death utterly shake off all worldlye vaine glorie these word would seem to contain the solution of most of the mystery of the suppression of john cabot 's name in the narrative of peter martyr ramusio gomara and all the other writer who derive they information from sebastian cabot during he long residence in spain and now we may pass on to the consideration of the second voyage and first among the writer in order of time as also in order of importance be peter martyr of anghiera who publish he _ decade of the new world _ in 1516 sebastian cabot have then be in spain for four year high in office and in royal favor peter martyr be he familiar friend and comrade and tell the pope to whom these _ decade _ be address as letter that he write from information derive from cabot 's own lip here i venture to think many of the writer on this subject have go astray for the whole question change martyr know of only one voyage and that be beyond doubt the voyage of 1498 he know of only one discoverer and that the man from whose lip he write the narrative the landfall be far north in a region of ice and perpetual daylight at the very outset the subject be state to be those northern sea and then peter martyr go on to say that sebastian cabot furnish two ship at he own charge and that with three hundred man he sail toward the north pole where he see land and that then he be compel to turn westward and after that he coast to the south until he reach the latitude of gibraltar and that he be west of the longitude of cuba in other word he strike land far in the north and from that point he sail south along the coast as far as cape hattera that labrador be the landfall seem clear for he meet large mass of ice in the month of July these be not merely the berg of the western ocean but mass of field-ice which compel he to change he course from north to west and finally to turn southward the same writer state that cabot himself name a portion of the great land he coast baccalao because of the quantity of fish which be so great that they hinder the sailing of he ship and that these fish be call baccalao by the native this statement have give rise to much dispute as to the quantity of fish all succeed writer concur that it be immense beyond conception and probably the swarming of the salmon up the river of we pacific coast may afford a parallel but that cabot do not so name the country be abundantly clear a very exhaustive note on the word will be find at page 131 of dr bourinot 's _ cape breton _ bearing in mind the precede consideration the study of the early map will become profitable and i would now direct attention to they to ascertain what light they may throw upon the landfall of john cabot and the island of st john opposite to it it must be remember that john cabot take the time to go on shore at he landfall and plant the banner of england and st mark there at that time of year and in that latitude it be light at half-past three but it be five when he see land and he have to reach it and perform the ceremony appropriate for such occasion so the island opposite could not be far away the island then will be useful to identify the landfall if we find it occur frequently on the succeed map don pedro de ayala joint spanish ambassador at london write on July 25 1498 to he sovereign that he have procure and would send a copy of john cabot 's chart of he first voyage this map of juan de la cosa be evidence that ayalum fulfil he promise it be a manuscript map make at the end of the year 1500 by the eminent biscayan pilot who if not the equal of columbus in nautical and cosmographical knowledge be easily the second to he upon it there be a continuous coast line from labrador to florida show that the claim make by sebastian cabot of have coast from a region of ice and snow to the latitude of gibraltar be accept as true by la cosa whatever later spanish writer may have say recent writer of authority have arrive at the conclusion that immediately after columbus and cabot have open the way many independent adventurer visit the western sea for there be a number of geographical fact record on the earliest chart not easy to account for on any other hypothesis dr justin winsor show that la cosa and other of the great sailor of the earliest year of discovery soon recognize that they have encounter a veritable barrier to asia consist of island or a island of continental size through which they have to find a passage to the golden east they view be not however generally accept that la cosa base the northern part of he map upon cabot 's discovery be demonstrate by the english flag mark along the coast and the legend _ mar descubierto por ingleses _ because no english but the cabot expedition have be there and what be evidently intend for cape race be call cavo de ynglaterra the english flag mark off the coast from that cape to what may be consider as cape hattera cabot as before state confidently expect to reach cathay he sail for that as he objective point and he be look for a broad western ocean so that narrow opening be to he simply bay of greater or less depth the sailor of those early voyage coast from headland to headland as plainly appear from many of the map upon which the recess of the sinuosity of the coast be not complete line and it must be bear in mind that in sailing between newfoundland and cape breton the bold and peculiar contour of both can be see at the same time this be possible in anything like clear weather but in the bright weather of midsummer day cape ray would necessarily have be see from st paul 's and the opening might well have be take for a deep indentation of the coast between cavo descubierto and cavo st jorge such a indentation be show on the map but the line be close show that cabot do not sail through cavo descubierto -lrb- the discover cape -rrb- and close to it _ mar descubierto por ingleses _ what can be more evident than that the spot where european first touch the american continent be thus indicate why otherwise should it especially be call the discover cape if not because this cape be first discover it be state elsewhere that on the same day opposite the land a island be also discover and in fact upon the madrid fac-simile two small island be find one of which be near cavo descubierto the name the discover cape at the extreme end of a series of name tell its own story cabot overran cape race and go south of st pierre and miquelon without see they and continue on a westerly course hit cape breton at its most easterly point a apt illustration occur in a voyage make by the ship bonaventure in 1591 record in hakluyt she overshoot cape race without know it and come to the sounding on the bank south of st peter 's where they find twenty fathom and then the course be set northwest by north for cape ray the course be sharply alter toward a definite and known point but if he do not see cape race not know what be before he cabot would have have no object in abruptly alter he course but continue he westerly course would strike the east point of cape breton that point then and not cape north would be the discover cape -- the _ prima vista _ -- and there not far off over against the land opposite the land -lrb- _ exadverso _ -rrb- he would find scatari island which would be the island of st john so continually attendant on cape breton upon the succeed map if this theory be accept all become clear and the little matthew have achieve success have demonstrate the existence of cathay within easy reach of england return home notice and name the salient feature of the south coast of newfoundland she have not too much time to do it for she be back in bristol in thirty-four day at most this theory be further confirm by the circumstance record by pasqualigo that as cabot return he see two island on the right which he have not time to examine be short of provision these island would be st pierre and miquelon for there be two and only two important island possible to be see at the right on the south coast of newfoundland on the homeward course la cosa beside the two small island above note have mark on he map three larger island i de la trinidad s grigor and i verde but they be not lay down on the map in the place of st pierre and miquelon nor be there any island exist in the position show i de la trinidad be doubtless the peninsula of burin as would appear by its position almost in contact with the land and its very peculiar shape in coast along it would appear as a island for the isthmus be very narrow and st pierre and miquelon would be clearly see as island on the right as for the bearing of the coast it will appear by a comparison with champlain 's large map that they be compass bearing for they be the same on both i have dwell at length upon the map of la cosa because for we northern coast it be in effect john cabot 's map after the return of the second expedition the english make a few voyage but soon fall back into the old rut of they iceland trade the expedition be beyond question a commercial failure and therefore like the practical people they be they neglect that new continent which be destine to become the chief theater for the expansion of they race they fisherman be for many year to be find in small number only on the coast and as before they supply of codfish be draw from iceland where they could sell goods in exchange meantime the breton and norman and the basque of france and spain and the portuguese grasp that which england practically abandon that landfall which cabot give she in 1497 cost much blood and treasure to win back in 1758 the french fisherman be on the coast as early as 1504 and the name on la cosa 's map be displace by french name still survive on the south coast and on what be call the french shore of newfoundland robert thorne in 1527 -- and no doubt other unrecorded -- in vain urge upon the english government to vindicate its right accord to the papal bull and the treaty of tordesilla the new land be portuguese east of a meridian three hundred seventy league west of the cape de verd island and spanish to the west of it baccalao and labrador be consider to be portuguese and upon the map when any mention be make of english discovery they be accordingly relegate to greenland or the far north of labrador the whole claim of england go by abandonment and default the portuguese as the rev dr patterson have show name all the east coast of newfoundland and they trace be even yet find on the coast of nova scotium and of cape breton therefore it be that the map we have now to refer to be not so much spanish as portuguese they will tell we nothing of the english nor of cabot but we shall be able to follow he island of st john -- the only one of he name which survive the outline of some very early map be give by kunstmann kretschmer and winsor but until 1505 they have no bearing upon we problem in that year reinel 's map be make and although newfoundland form part of _ terra firma _ the opening north and south of it be plainly indicate by unclosed line cape race have receive its permanent name _ raso _ and although only the east coast of newfoundland be name there be no possibility of mistake the easternmost point of cape breton just opposite _ -lrb- ex adverso _ -rrb- be lay down and name the island of sam joha in latitude 46 ° the precise latitude of scatarus island here then in 1505 be in this island of st john a independent testimony to the landfall of 1497 -- not off cape north which do not yet appear nor inside the gulf for it be not even indicate -- but in the atlantic ocean at the cape of cape breton -- the cavo descubierto of la cosa i have not consider it necessary to prove that if cabot 's landfall be cape north he could not have discover the low lie shore of prince edward island on the same day i have prefer to show that prince edward island be not know as a island and do not appear on any map for one hundred year after john cabot 's death if cabot have possess a modern map and have be look for prince edward island and have push on without landing at the north cape of cape breton and have shape he course southward he might have see it in a long midsummer day but cabot do not press on he land and examine the country and find close to it st john 's island which he also examine upon that easternmost point of this nova scotian land of we common country john cabot plant the banner of st george on June 24 1497 more than one year before columbus set foot upon the main continent of america and now after four hundred year despite all the chance and change of this western world that banner be float there a witness to we exist union with we distant mother-land across the ocean the sea route to indium vasco da gama sail around africa ad 1498 caspar correa -lrb- 1 -rrb- the same goal which attract the spaniard westward draw the portuguese south the desire to find a sea route to indium and thus garner the enormous profit of the trade in spice and other indian wealth in the early year of the fifteenth century the portuguese overshadow by the spanish kingdom which almost enclose they country realize that they could extend they territory only by colonize beyond sea they begin therefore to send out expedition and in 1410 discover the island of madeira soon afterward discovery be undertake by prince henry call the navigator whose whole life be give to these enterprise before he death 1460 he portuguese mariner in successive voyage have work they way well down the western coast of africa in 1462 a expedition reach sierra leone almost half way down the continent nine year later the equator be pass and in 1486 bartholomew dia sail around the southern point of africa which he have be send to discover on he return voyage 1487 he find the cape of good hope have before double it without know that he have do so -lrb- 2 -rrb- to portuguese navigator the way to indium by this route be soon make clear in 1497 vasco da gama be place by king emanuel i of portugal in command of a expedition of three small ship send to discover such a route he sail from lisbon in July of that year in November double the cape of good hope arrive at calicut on the malabar coast of indium in may 1498 and in September 1499 return to lisbon he be accompany by he brother paulo who with other of the celebrated navigator 's companion appear in the follow account of this great achievement the quaint narrative be write by the chronicler who accompany the expedition in person the ship be equip and ready one Sunday the king go with queen dona marium to hear mass which be say pontifically by the bishop calcadilha who also make a discourse in praise of the voyage and holy design of the king in regard to the new discovery which he be command to be make and he call upon the people to pray to the lord that the voyage might be for he holy service and for the exalting of he holy faith and for the increase of the good and honor of the kingdom of portugal at the mass the good brother da gama and they associate be present richly dress and the king show they great honor and favor as they stand close to the curtain where also be the principal lord of the realm and gentleman of the court mass be over the king come out from the curtain and speak to the captain who place themselves on they knee before he and they speak to he say : sire the honor we be receive from you highness be so great that with a hundred body and life which we might expend in you service we never could repay the least part of it since greater honor be never show by a sovereign to he vassal than you have show we as the great prince king and lord that you be with such magnanimity and honor that if at this very moment we should die we lineage should remain in the highest degree of honor which be possible only because you highness have choose and send we for this work while you have so many and such noble vassal to whom to commit it for which we be already recompense before render this service and until we end we life in perform it for this we beg of the mercy of the lord that he direct we and we may perform such work that he the lord and you highness also may be serve in some measure in this so great favor that have be show we as he know that such be we desire and should we not be deserving to serve he in this voyage and so holy undertaking may the lord be pleased though we may pay with we life for we shortcoming in the work we promise you highness that we life will be the matter of least moment that we shall adventure in this so great favor that have be show we and that we will not return before you highness with we life in we body without bring some certain information of that which you highness desire and they all again kiss the hand of the king and of the queen then the king come forth from the cathedral and go to he palace which then be in the residence of the alcazar in the castle there go before he the captain and before they the standard which be carry by they ensign in whom they trust and on arrive at the palace the king dismiss they and they again kiss he and the queen 's hand vasco da gama on a horse with all the man of the fleet on foot richly dress in livery and accompany by all the gentleman of the court go down to the wharf on the bank and embark in they boat and the standard go in that of paulo da gama then take leave of the gentleman they go to the ship and on they arrival they fire all they artillery and the ship be dress out gayly with standard and flag and many ornament and the royal standard be at once place at the top of the mast of paulo da gama for so vasco da gama command discharge all they artillery they loosen the sail and go beat to windward on the river of lisbon tack until they come to anchor at belen where they remain three day wait for a wind to go out there they make a muster of the crew and the king be there all the time in the monastery where all confess and communicate the king command that they should write down in a book all the man of each ship by name with the name of they father mother and wife of the married man and the place of which they be native and the king order that this book should be preserve in the house of the mine in order that the payment which be due should be make upon they return the king also order that a hundred _ crusado _ should be pay to each of the married man for they to leave it to they wife and forty crusado to each of the single man for they to fit themselves out with certain thing for as to provision they have not get to lay they in for the ship be full of they to the two brother be pay a gratification of two thousand crusado to each of they and a thousand to nicola coelho when it be the day of we lady of march -lrb- the 25 1497 -rrb- all hear mass they then embark and loosen the sail and go forth from the river the king come out to accompany they in he boat and address they all with blessing and good wish when he take leave of they he boat lay on its oar until they disappear as be show in the painting of he city of lisbon vasco da gama go in the ship são rafael and paulo da gama in the são gabriel and nicola coelho in the other ship são miguel in each ship there be as many as eighty man officer and seaman and the other of the leader 's family servant and relation all fill with the desire to undertake the labor that be fitting for each and with great trust in the favor which they hope for from the king on they return to portugal paulo da gama as he go out with the lisbon river haul down the royal standard from the masthead but at the great supplication of he brother who give he good reason why it be fitting that he should carry it he again hoist it the two companion stand out to sea as i have say make they way toward cape verd and for that purpose they stand well out to sea to make the coast which they know they would find as it advance much to seaward as they learn from the sailor who have be in the caravel of janinfante they run as far as they could to sea in the direction of the wind to double the land without difficulty and thus they navigate until they make the coast and have reconnoitr it they tack and stand out to sea haul on the bowline as much as they could as so they run for many day and as it seem to they that now they could double the land they again tack toward the coast also on the bowline against the wind until they again see the coast much farther on than where the caravel have reach which the master know from the sounding which they get write down from the voyage of janinfante and the day which they find to have less sun by the clock have well ascertain this they stand out again to sea thus force the ship to windward they go so far out to the sea toward the south that there be almost not six hour of sunlight in the day and the wind be very powerful so that the sea be very fearful to see without ever be smooth either by day or night but they always meet with storm so that the crew suffer much hardship after a month that they have run on this tack they stand into shore and go as long as they could all pray to the lord that they might have double beyond the land but when they again see it they be very sad though they find themselves much advance by the sign of the sounding which the pilot take and they see land of another shape which they have not before see see that the coast run out to sea the master and pilot be in great confusion and doubtful of stand out again to sea say that the land go across the sea and have no end to it this be hear of by vasco da gama -- accord as it be presume to the information he have from the jew zacuto -- he tell the pilot that they should not imagine such a thing and that without doubt they would find the end of that land and beyond it much sea and land to run by and he say to they : i assure you that the cape be very near and with another tack stand out to sea when you return you will find the cape double this vasco da gama say to encourage they because he see that they be much dishearten and with the inclination to wish to put back to portugal so he order they to put the ship about to sea which they do much against they will for which reason vasco da gama determine to stand on this tack so long as to be able to double the end of the land and besought all not to take account of they labor since for that purpose they have venture upon they and that they should put they trust in the lord that they would double the cape thus he give they great encouragement without ever sleep or take repose but always take part with they in hardship come up at the boatswain 's pipe as they all do so they go on stand out to sea till they find it all break up with the storm with enormous wave and darkness as the day be very short it always seem night the mast and shroud be stay because with the fury of the sea the ship seem every moment to be go to piece the crew grow sick with fear and hardship because also they could not prepare they food and all clamor for put back to portugal and that they do not choose to die like stupid people who seek death with they own hand thus they make clamor and lamentation of which there be much more in other ship but the captain excuse themselves say that they would do nothing except what vasco da gama do and he and he companion undergo great labor as he be a very choleric man at time with angry word he make they be silent although he well see how much reason they have at every moment to despair of they life and they have be go for about two month on that tack and the master and pilot cry out to he to take another tack but the captain-major do not choose though the ship be now let in much water by which they labor be double because the day be short and the night long which cause they increase fear of death and at this time they meet with such cold rain that the man could not move all cry out to god for mercy upon they soul for now they no longer take heed of they life it now seem to vasco da gama that the time be come for make another tack and he comfort himself very angrily swearing that if they do not double the cape he would stand out to sea again as many time until the cape be double or there should happen whatever should please god for which reason from fear of this the master take much more trouble to advance as much as they could and they take more heart on near the land and escape from the tempest of the sea and all call upon god for mercy and to give they guidance when they see themselves out of such great danger thus approach the land they find they labor less and the sea calmer so they go on run for a long time steer so as to make the land and to ease the ship which they be better able to do at night when the captain sleep which the other ship do also as they follow the lantern which vasco da gama carry at night the ship show light to one another so as not to part company see how much they have run and do not find the land they sail larger so as to make it and as they do not find it and as the sea and wind be moderate they know they have double the cape on which great joy fall among they and they give great praise to the lord on see themselves deliver from death the pilot continue to sail more free spreading all the sail and run in this manner one morning they sight some mountain peak which seem to touch the cloud at which they pleasure be so great that all weep with joy and all devoutly on they knee say the _ salve _ after run all day till night they be not able to reach it and discover great mountain ridge so as it be night they run along the coast which lay from east to west and they take in all the sail only run under large sail for these be the order of the captain-major the next day at dawn they again set all the sail and run to the land so that at midday they see a beach which be all rocky and run along it they see deep creek and such large bay that they could not see the land at the end of they they also find the mouth of great river from which water come forth to the sea with a powerful current here also near the land they find many fish which they kill with fish-spear the watchman in the top be always on the lookout to see if there be shoal ahead the crew grow sick with fever from the fish which they eat on which account they eat no more the pilot on heave the lead find no bottom so they run on for three day and at night they keep away from the land and shorten sail sailing in this manner they fall in with the mouth of a large river and the captain-major order a boat to be lower and the pilot to sound the entrance of the river and he say it be superfluous because if there be a shoal it would be burst through then they take in the sail except the great one with which they enter the river which be very large and they go up it the boat go before and sound and approach land where they find twelve fathom they anchor there they find very good fish for the river be of fresh water but in the whole of the river they find no beach for there be nothing but rock and crag then vasco da gama go to see he brother and so do nicolas coelho and they all dine with great satisfaction talking of the hardship they have go through when they have finish dining vasco da gama order nicola coelho to go in he boat up the river to see if he find any village he go up more than five league without find anything besides many stream which come from between the mountain to pour into the river there be no wood in the country nothing but stone on both side of the river upon which he return to the captain-major then the follow day before the morning vasco da gama again order nicolas coelho to go in a boat with sail and oar and with provision to eat and tell he to go as far as the head of the river to see if he could find anyone to speak to to learn what country they be in he go up the river a distance of more than twenty league and return without have find anything then they decide on go out again and they take in water and wood of the dry tree which it seem the river bring down when it come from the mountain on that account the captain-major wish himself in person to discover the river up to its head to see whence could come those tree which they find there dry but the master say this would be a labor without profit and that they ought to go out of the river and make for the country which they wish to seek and they would find it this seem good to the captain-major and they come out of the river with much labor as the wind be contrary and enter the mouth of the river the strong current of the river which go out to sea alone assist they and with it they go outside without sail only tow with the boat which guide they when the ship return to sea they run along the coast with great precaution and a good lookout not to run upon any shoal and they enter other great river and bay and they explore everywhere and search without ever be able to meet with people nor boat in the sea for all the country be uninhabited and in enter and leave the river they endure much fatigue and be much vex at not be able to learn in what country they be with these detention and delay they waste much time and spend all the summer of that country so they have to run along the coast because wind be favorable for go ahead for they be westerly and because they find everything desolate without people by land or sea they agree unanimously not to enter any more river but to run ahead and thus they do for by day they run under full sail draw so near to the land as possible to see if they could make out any village or beach which as yet they have not see and by night they stand away to sea and run under shorten sail navigate in this manner the wind begin to moderate and fall calm altogether which happen in November when they have to struggle with another wind with which they stand out to sea fear some contrary storm might arise then take in all sail they lay wait for the spring up of another wind so they go increase they distance from the land till they lose sight of it for the wind increase continually and the sea rise greatly for then the winter of that country be set in the master see that the weather be freshen take counsel as to return to land and put into some river until meeting with a change of weather this they do and put about to the land the wind increase so much that they be afraid of not find a river in which to shelter and of be lose on which account they again stand out to sea and make ready the ship to meet the storm which they see rise every moment so that the water should not come in with rope make fast to the mast and with the shroud pass over the yard so that the mast should remain more secure and they take away all the pannel from the top and the sail so as not to hold the wind the small sail and the lower sail all strike and with the foresail only they prepare to weather the storm see the weather in this state the pilot and master tell the captain-major that they have great fear on account of the weather because it be become a tempest and the ship be weak and that they think they ought to put in to land and run along the coast and return to seek the great river into which they have first enter because the wind be blow that way and they could enter it for all that there be a storm but when the captain-major hear of turn backward he answer they that they should not speak such word because as he be go out of the bar at lisbon he have promise to god in he heart not to turn back a single span 's breadth of the way which he have make that on that account they should not speak in that wise as he would throw into the sea whomsoever speak such thing at which the crew in despair abandon themselves to the chance of the sea which be break up with the increase of the tempest and rise of the gale which many time chop round and blow from all part and at time fall so that the ship be in great peril from they great labor in the wave which run very high then the storm would again break with such fury that the sea rise toward the sky and fall back in heavy shower which flood the ship the storm rage thus violently the danger be double for suddenly the wind die out so that the ship lay dead between the wave lurch so heavily that they take in water on both side and the man make themselves fast not to fall from one side to the other and everything in the ship be break up so that all cry to god for mercy before long the sea come in with more violence which increase they misfortune with the great difficulty of work the pump for they be take in much water which enter both above and below so they have no repose for either soul or body and the crew begin to sicken and die of they great hardship at this the pilot and master and all the people pour out cry and lamentation to the captain urgently require they to put back and seek a escape from death which they be certain of meeting with by they own will if they do not put about to which the captain give no other reply than that they would do no such thing unless the captain-major do it the captain-major see the clamor of he crew answer they with brave word say that he have already tell they that backward he would not go even though he see a hundred death before he eye thus he have vow to god and let they look to it that it be not reasonable that they should lose all the labor which they have go through up to this time that the lord who have deliver they until now would have mercy upon they they should remember that they have already double the cape of storm and be in the region which they have come to seek to discover indium on accomplish which and return to portugal they would gain such great honor and recompense from the king of portugal for they child and they should put they trust in god who be merciful and who from one hour to another would come with he mercy and give they fair weather and that they should not talk like people who distrust the mercy of god but although the captain-major always speak to they these and other word of great encouragement they do not cease from they loud clamor and protestation that he would give a account to god of they death of which he would be the cause and of the leave desolate they wife and child all this accompany by weep and cry and call to god for mercy while they go on this way with they soul in they mouth the sea begin to go down a little and the wind also so that the ship could approach to speak one another and all clamor with loud cry that they should put about to seek some place where they could refit the ship as they could not keep they afloat with the pump the crew of the other ship speak with more audacity say that the captain-major be but one man and they be many and they fear death while the captain do not fear it nor take any account of lose they life the captain-major choose that the two other ship should know he design and he say and swear by the life of the king he sovereign that from the spot where he then be he have not to turn back one span 's breadth even though the ship be laden with gold unless he get information of that which they have come to seek and that even if he have near there a very good port he would not go ashore lest some of they should retire to a certain death on shore allow themselves to remain there rather than go on with the ship trust to the mercy of god in which they have such small reliance that they make such exclamation from the weakness of they heart as if they be not portuguese on which account he would undeceive they all for to portugal they would not return unless they bring word to the king of that which he have so strongly commend to they and that he take the same account of death as do any one of they while they be at this point a sudden wind arise with so great a concussion of thunder and darkness and a stronger blast than they have yet experienced and the sea rise so much that the ship could not see one another except when they be upheave by the sea when they seem to be among the cloud they hang out light so as not to part company for the anxiety and fear which the captain-major feel be the lose one of the ship from he company so that the seaman would put back to portugal by force as indeed they have very much such a desire in they heart but the captain take very great care of this because vasco da gama before go out to lisbon when converse alone with the jew zacuto in the monastery have receive from he much information as to what he should do during he voyage and especially recommendation of great watchfulness never to let the ship part company because if they separate it would be the certain destruction of all of they vasco da gama take great care of this personally and by means of he servant and relation in whom he trust and this they attend to with much greater solicitude after they hear the sailor say that they be many and the captain only a few single man and in fact they have in they mind such a intention of rise up against the captain and by force put back to portugal and they think that if it become necessary to arrest they for this and bring they before the king he would have mercy upon they and should they not find mercy they prefer rather to die there where they wife and child and father be and in they native country and not in the sea to be eat by the fish with such thought they all speak to one another secretly determine to carry it out and trust that the king would not hang they all for the good reason which they would give he or else to secure they life they would go to castile until they be pardon this be the greatest insolence they be guilty of and so they decide upon execute they plan in take this decision they do not perceive the danger of death into which they be go more than ever in the ship of nicola coelho there be a sailor who have a brother who live with nicola coelho and be foster-brother of a son of he and the sailor brother tell this boy of what they have all determine to do this boy be very discreet say to he brother that they should all preserve great secrecy so as not to be find out for it be a case of treason and he warn he brother not to tell anyone that he have mention such a thing to he the boy on account of the affection which he have for he master nicola coelho discover the matter to he in secret and he at once give the boy a serious warning to be very discreet in this matter that they should not perceive that he have tell he anything of the kind with the firm determination which nicola coelho at once form to die sooner than allow himself to be seize upon he become very vigilant both by day and night and warn the boy to try to learn with much dissimulation all that they want to do and by what mean the boy tell he that they would not do it unless they could first concert with the other ship so that they all should mutiny at that nicola coelho remain more at ease but be always very much on he guard for himself as the storm do not abate but rather seem to increase and as the cry and clamor of the people be very great beseech he to put back nicola coelho dissemble with they say : brother let we strive to save ourselves from this storm for i promise you that as soon as i can get speech with the captain-major i will require he to put back and you will see how i will require it of he with this they remain satisfied some day have pass thus with heavy storm the lord be please to assuage the tempest a little and the sea grow calm so that the ship could speak one another and nicola coelho come up to speak shout to the captain-major that it would be well to put about since every moment they have death before they eye and so many man who go in they company be so piteously beg with tear and cry to put back the ship and if we do not choose to do so it would be well if the man should kill or arrest we and then they would put back or go where it be convenient to save they life which we also ought to do if we do not do it let each one look out for himself for thus i do for my part and for my conscience ' sake for i would not have to give a account of it to the lord paulo da gama who also have come up within speak distance hear all this when they have hear these word of nicola coelho who on end he speech at once begin to move away the captain-major answer he that he would hold a consultation with the pilot and he crew and that whatever he determine to do he would make a signal to he of he resolution during this time they lay hove to in the smooth water because the wind never change from its former point vasco da gama as he be very quick-witted at once understand what nicola coelho 's word mean and call together all the crew and say to they that he be not so valiant as not to have the fear of death like themselves neither be he so cruel as not to feel grieve at heart at see they tear and lamentation but that he do not wish to have to give account to god for they life and for that reason he beg they to labor for they safety because if the bad weather come again he have determine to put back but to disculpate himself with the king it be incumbent upon he to draw up a document of the reason for put back with they signature at this they all raise they hand to heaven say that its mercy be already descend upon they since it be soften the heart of the captain-major and incline he to put back and they say they all would sign the great service which he would render to god and to the king by put back then the captain-major say that there be no need of the signature of all but only of those who best understand the business of the sea then the pilot and master name they and they be three seaman upon this the captain-major retire to he cabin and tell he servant to stand at the door of the cabin and put inside the clerk to draw up the document and order the three seaman to enter and dissemble he make inquiry as to return to port and all be write down and they sign it he then order they to go down below to another cabin which he have beneath he own for a store-cabin and he order the clerk to go down also with they and he summon the master and pilot and order they below also tell they to go and sign as the clerk be there then he call up the seaman one by one and order they to be put in iron by he servant in he cabin and heavy iron for the master and pilot all be well ironed and bind the captain-major turn they out and call all the man order the master and pilot at once to give up to he all the article which they have belong to the art of navigation or if not that he would at once execute they be greatly afraid they give everything up to he then vasco da gama hold the instrument all in he hand fling they into the sea and say : see here man that you have neither master nor pilot nor anyone to show you the way from henceforward because these man whom i have arrest will return to portugal below the deck if they do not die before that -lrb- for he be aware that they have agree among one another to rise up and return by force to portugal and on that account have cast everything into the sea -rrb- and i do not require master nor pilot nor any man who know the art of navigation because god alone be the master and pilot who have to guide and deliver we by he mercy if we deserve it and if not let he will be do to he you must commend yourselve and beg mercy henceforward let no one speak to I of put back for know from I for a certainty that if i do not find information of what i have come to seek to portugal i do not return see and hear these thing the crew become much more terrify and with much greater fear of death which they hold as certain not have either pilot or master nor anyone who know how to navigate a ship then the prisoner and all the crew on they knee beg he for mercy with loud cry the prisoner say that they be ignorant man and of faint heart have come to a understanding to put the ship about and return to the king and offer themselves for death if he choose to give it they and they would have take he a prisoner that the king might see that he be not to blame for put back but this be not to have be do except with the will of all the people of the other ship but since god have discover this to he before they have carry it out let he show they clemency for well they see that they deserve death from he which be more than the chain which they bear all the crew frequently call out to he for clemency and not to put the prisoner below the deck where they would soon die then the captain-major show that he only do it at they entreaty and not for any need which he have of they order they to remain in they cabin in the forecastle still in iron and forbid they give any direction for the navigation of the ship except only for the trim of the sail and the work of the ship vasco da gama then run alongside of the other ship and speak they say that he have put he pilot and master in iron in which he would bring they back to the kingdom if god pleased that they should return there and that they should not imagine that he have any need of they knowledge he have fling into the sea all the implement of they art of navigation because he place he hope in god alone who would direct they and deliver they from the peril among which they be go and on that account since he have now make he man secure let they secure themselves as they pleased and without wait for a answer he sheer off nicola coelho feel great joy in he heart on hearing from the captain-major that he have get he pilot and master thus secure from rise against he since he have put they in iron and without much dissimulation he speak to master and pilot and seaman say that he be much grieve at the captain-major 's way of treat he ship 's officer whom he stand so much in need of in the labor they be undergo but what he have do be because of he be of so strong and thorough a temperament as they all know and he have not choose to wait for they to make entreaty for the liberty of the prisoner but that whenever the ship again speak one another he would do this this all the crew beg he to do with loud cry of mercy since they would follow the flag-ship wherever it go this nicolas coelho promise they so they remain contented paulo da gama have other conversation with the officer of he ship with much urbanity for he be a man of gentle disposition he also promise they that he would entreat he brother on behalf of the prisoner and bid all pray god for the saving of they life and that all would end well so that all remain console while these thing be happen the wind do not shift its direction but the sea be smoother the ship be more easy though they let in so much water that they never leave off pump the captain-major saw this and that the ship have a absolute need of repair and also because they have no more water to drink because with the toss about in the storm many barrel have break and give way under such great pressure he stand in to land under sail for the weather be moderate and be begin to be favorable all be pray to god for mercy and that he would grant they a haven of safety which god be please to do in he mercy for presently he show they land at which it seem that all be resuscitate from the death which they look upon as certain if the ship be not repair after that the wind come free and they sail along the land for several day without find where to put in this be now in January of the year 1498 thus they run close to the land with a careful lookout for they do not dare to leave the land from the great peril in which the ship be from the great leakage proceeding in this way one day they find themselves at dawn in the mouth of a large river into which the captain-major enter for he always go first and all enter and find within a large bay sheltered from all wind in which they anchor and all exclaim three time the mercy of the lord god for which reason they give this river the name of the river of mercy here they soon catch much good fish with which the sick improve as it be fresh food and the water of the river be very good now at this time in all the ship there be not more than a hundred fifty man for all the rest have die soon after arrive at this place the captain-major go to see he brother and nicola coelho and they converse relate they hardship and nicola coelho related the treason which he man be prepare to take he prisoner and return to portugal and they do not do it from the fear they have that the captain-major would follow after they and if he catch they would have hang they all and they only wait for all to agree to mutiny and he have seek those feigned word which he have speak and it have pleased god that vasco da gama have understand they so that by he imprison he officer at once all have remain secure so all give praise to the lord for have deliver they from such great peril then they settle about refit the ship for they have all that be necessary for do it although they have a beach and tide for lay the ship aground for greater security it be order that they should be heel over while afloat and thus it be arrange for by all of they while they be on the quarter deck paulo da gama entreat he brother to set the prisoner at liberty which he do set free the sailor and the master and pilot with the condition that if god should bring they back to lisbon when he go before the king he would present they to he in the same manner in chain not to do they any harm but only that he difficulty might be credit and that for this he would give he greater favor at which all the crew feel much satisfaction afterward they speak with all the officer and arrange for careen the ship and go to look at they they find there be no repair the ship of nicola coelho as it have many of the rib and knee break for that reason they at once decide to break it up and then they cut out its mast and much timber and plank of the upper work which with the yard and spar of the other ship they lash together and fasten and make a great frame which they put under the side of the ship to raise it more out of the water for this purpose they then discharge from the captain-major 's ship into that of he brother which be bring alongside all that they could of the store and goods and everything heavy below deck they put on one side of the ship which cause it to heel over very much and with the timber under the side and the tackle fit to the main-mast they cant the ship over on one side so much that they lay she keel bare and on the outer side they put plank upon which all the crew get to work at the ship some clean the plank from the growth of sea-weed other extract the calking which be quite rotten from the seam and the calker put in fresh oakum and then pitch it over for they have a stove in a boat where they boil the pitch the captain be occupy with they own work day and night and give much food and drink to the crew so that they use such despatch that in one day and one night by morning they have finish one side of the ship very well execute though with great labor in draw out the water from the ship which leak very much lie thus on one side when she be upright they turn she over on the other side and do the same work much better perform because the ship do not leak so much and when it be complete and the ship upright it be so sound and water-tight that for two day there be no water in the pump then they load it again with its store and transship to it the store of the other ship upon which they execute the before-mentioned calking and repair so that it become like new they then fit they inside with several knee and rib and inner planking and all that be requisite with great perfection and collect the yard spar and all that they have need of belong to the ship são miguel and the captain-major take nicola coelho on board of he ship entertaining he well they then take away from the ship much wood for they use and beach the ship and take away its rudder and undo it and stow away its wood and iron-works in case of its be want for the other ship because they have all be build of the same pattern and size as a precaution that all might be able to take advantage of any part of they then they burn the ship in order to recover the nail which be in great quantity and a great advantage for other necessity which they meet with later after they have thus repair the ship the captain-major send nicola coelho with twenty man in a boat to go and discover the river and he after ascend it for two league find wood and verdure and farther on he find some canoe which be fishing and the man in they be dark but not very black they be naked have only they middle cover with leaf of tree and grass these man when they see the boat come to it and enter it in a brutish manner and be in a state of amazement no one know how to speak to they and they do not understand the sign which be make to they so nicola coelho make they go back to they canoe and return to the ship but of the canoe one follow after the boat and the other return to take the news to they village these man who come with the boat at once without any fear enter the ship and sit down to rest as if they be old acquaintance no one know how to speak to they then they give they biscuit and cake and slice of bread with marmalade this they do not understand until they see we people eat then they eat it and as they like the taste they eat in a great hurry and would not share with one another while this be go on they see many canoe come and larger one with many of those people also naked with tangled hair like kaffir without any other arm than some stick like half lance harden in the fire with sharp point grease over the captain-major see the other canoe come order the first come to go to they canoe which they do unwillingly and go out and remain to speak with those that be arrive and go they way the other arrive and all want to come on board as they be more than a hundred the captain-major would not allow they only ten or twelve who bring some bird which be something like hen and some yellow fruit of the size of walnut a very well-tasted thing to eat which we man would not touch and they see that eat they for we people to see who on tasting they be much pleased with they they kill one of the bird and find it very tender and savory to eat and all its bone be like those of a fowl the captain-major order biscuit and wine to be give they which they would not touch till they see we people drink he also order a looking-glass to be give they and when they see it they be much amaze and look at one another and again look at the mirror and laugh loudly and make joke and speak to the other who be in the canoe they go away with the looking-glass highly delighted and leave six bird and much of the fruit and all go away and in the afternoon they come again but bring a quantity of those bird at which we man rejoice very much and fill hencoop with they because they give they and be satisfy with anything that be give they especially white stuff so that the seamen cut they shirt in piece with which they buy so many of these bird that they kill and dry they in the sun and they keep very well here it be observe that in this river there be no fly for they never see any all the time they be there which be twenty day and they go away because the crew begin to fall ill it seem that it be from that fruit which be very delicious to eat and the principal ailment be that they gum swell and rot so that they tooth fall out and there be such a foul smell from the mouth that no one could endure it the captain-major provide a remedy for this for he order that each one should wash he mouth with he own water each time he pass it by do which in a few day they obtain health the captain-major make a hole with pickax in a stone slab at the entrance of this river and set up a marble pillar of which he have bring many for that purpose which have two escutcheon one of the arm of portugal and another on the other side of the sphere and letter engrave in the stone which say of the lordship of portugal kingdom of christian the captain-major see how much the seaman and master and pilot work especially he own notwithstanding the imprisonment which he have inflict upon they when he be about to quit this river of mercy make they all come to he ship where he address they all beseech they not to suffer weakness to enter they heart which would induce they to wish to commit another such error by harbor thought of treason which be so hideous before god and always bring a bad end to those who engage in it he say that he well see that faint-heartedness be the cause of what have pass and that he forgive all and that since the lord have be please to deliver they from so many danger as they have pass up to that time by he great mercy therefore they should put they trust in he who would conduct they in such manner as to obtain the result which they be go in search of by which they would gain such great honor and favor as the king would grant they on they return to portugal and he would present they to the king and would relate they great labor and service and that they ought to bear in remembrance these great advantage which would be such a cause of rejoice for all of they they with tear of joy all answer amen aman may the lord so will it of he great mercy and they weigh anchor and go out of the river with a land-breeze sailing with a fair wind they get sight of land which the pilot foretell before they see it this be a great mountain which be on the coast of indium in the kingdom of cananor which the people of the country in they language call the mountain delielly and they call it of the rat and they call it mount dely because in this mountain there be so many rat that they never could make a village there as it be the custom to give the fee of good news to the pilot when they see the land they give to each of the pilot a robe of red cloth and ten testoon and they go on approach the land until they see the beach and they run along it and pass within sight of a large town of thatched house inside a bay which the pilot say be name cananor where many skiff be go about fishing and several come near to see the ship and be much surprised and go ashore to relate that these ship have so much rigging and so many sail and white man which have be tell to the king he send some man of he own to see but the ship have already go far and they do not go in this country of indium they be much addict to soothsayer and diviner especially on this coast of indium which be name the country of malabar and they call these diviner _ canayate _ accord to what be know later there have be in this country of cananor a diviner so diabolical in whom they believe so much that they write down all that he say and preserve it like prophecy which would come to pass they hold a legend from he in which it be say that the whole of indium would be take and rule over by a very distant king who have white people who would do great harm to those who be not they friend and this be to happen a long time later and he leave sign of when it would be in consequence of the great disturbance cause by the sight of these ship the king be very desirous of know what they be and he speak to he diviner ask they to tell he what ship be those and whence they come the diviner converse with they devil and tell he that the ship belong to a great king and come from very far and accord to what they find write these be the people who be to seize indium by war and peace as they have already tell he many time because the period which have be write down be conclude the king much move ask they whether he kingdom would receive much injury they reply that we people would do no harm except to those who do it to they upon this the king become very thoughtful and talk of this frequently with he people who very much contradict what the diviner say and they tell he not to believe they for in this they never hit upon the truth because at the time that we ship arrive more than four hundred year have elapse since in one year more than eight hundred sail of large and small ship have come to india from the port of malacca and china and the lequeo with people of many nation and all laden with merchandise of great value which they bring for sale and they have come to calicut and have run along the coast and have go to cambay and they be so numerous that they have fill the country and have settle as dweller in all the town of the sea-coast where they be receive and welcome like merchant which they be when those people arrive thus on the coast of malabar everybody consider that they be the people whom they prophecy mention as those who would take indium and they have inquire of the diviner who look at they record tell they not to be afraid since the time when indium be to be take have not yet arrive thus it be for those people have go over all indium trading and sell they merchandise during many year in which many of they married and establish they abode and become naturalized in the country and mix up with the inhabitant of the country many other return to they own country and as no more ever arrive they go on diminish in number until they come to a end but a numerous progeny remain from they and because they be people of large property and numerous in the town where they reside they have a quarter set apart like as in portugal and castile in other time there use to be jewry and moorish quarter set apart and they build house for they idol sumptuous edifice which be to be see at this day and in the space of a hundred year there do not remain one all this they have get thus record in they legend and since at that time so many people do not take indium how be it to be take now by people who come from such a distance and who would not come in sufficient number to be able to conquer it and they mock at what the soothsayer say but the king who put great trust in they and whose heart divine what be go to come to pass speak to a soothsayer in whom he place great belief and tell he to look and see upon what grounds he make he assertion because if it be as he have be say he would labor to establish peace with the portuguese in such a manner as to make he kingdom secure forever and in this he would spend part of he treasure the soothsayer answer : sire i be tell you the truth that these man will not bring so many people with they to seize upon country and realm but those who come in whatever number they may be will be able to prevail more with they ship than all as many as go upon the sea on which account they must be master of the sea in which case of necessity the people of the land must obey they and when they shall have become powerful at sea what will happen to you kingdom if you have not secure peace with they i tell you the truth and you will see it with you eye and now follow what counsel you please the king answer my heart tell I that you be speak the truth and i will do that which be incumbent upon I the diviner say to he if before five year you do not see that i have tell you the truth order my head to be cut off upon which the king remain quite convinced and determine in he heart to establish with the portuguese all the peace and friendship that be possible and because soon after news arrive that we people be at the city of calicut which be twelve league from cananor the king send man to calicut who always come to tell he of what happen there to we man the ship continue run along the coast close to land for the coast be clear without bank against which to take precaution and the pilot give order to cast anchor in a place which make a sort of bay because there commence the city of calicut this town be name capocate and on anchor there a multitude of people flock to the beach all dark and naked only cover with cloth half way down the thigh with which they conceal they nakedness all be much amaze at see what they have never before see when news be take to the king he also come to look at the ship for all the wonder be at see so many rope and so many sail and because the ship arrive when the sun be almost set and at night they lower out the boat and vasco da gama go at once for he brother and nicola coelho and they remain together converse upon the method of deal with this king since here be the principal end which they have come to seek it seem to he that it would be best to comport himself as a ambassador and to make he he present always say that they have be separate from another fleet which they come to seek for there and that the captain-major have come and bring he letter from the king this they agree upon together and that vasco da gama should go on shore with that message send by the captain-major who carry the standard at the peak they also talk of the manner in which these thing be to be speak of when all be well decide upon nicola coelho return to the ship and vasco da gama remain with he brother talk with the moor taibo -lrb- the broker -rrb- who tell he not to go on shore without hostage that such be the custom of man who newly arrive at the country and the moor say that this king of calicut be the greatest king of all the coast of indium and on that account be very vain and he be very rich from the

of asia he next discover jamaica and in September return to isabella the indian rise in rebellion against the spaniard who have ill-use they and columbus quell the insurrection in a battle on the vega real April 25 1495 he have before plan for the enslavement of hostile indian a act from which he reputation have somewhat suffer owe to hardship and discontent some of the colonist carry complaint to spain bishop fonseca who have charge of colonial affair uphold the complainant and in 1495 juan aguado be send as royal commissioner to española aguado prepare a report fear the effect of which columbus return to spain at the same time -lrb- 1496 -rrb- with he a brother of columbus be leave in charge of the government at española the spanish sovereign ferdinand and isabellum dismiss the charge against columbus and on may 30 1498 he sail from san lucar on he third voyage to the new world the great navigator be no longer the powerful endure man of six year before exposure month of sleepless watch anxiety and tropical fever have at length do they work the bright intellect the vivid imagination the great heart the generous nature would be the same until death but the constitution be shatter the admiral now suffer from ophthalmia gout and a complication of disease the last six year of he life be destine to be a time of much and cruel suffering aggravate by ingratitude perfidy and injustice in fitting out the third expedition every petty annoyance and obstruction that the malice of bishop fonseca could invent be use to thwart and delay the admiral each subordinate official know that insolence to the object of the bishop 's envy and dislike and neglect of he wish be the surest way to the favor of he chief one creature of fonseca name jimeno de briviesca carry he insolence beyond the bound of the endurance even of the dignified and long-suffering admiral who very properly take he by the scruff of the neck on one occasion and kick he off the poop of the flag-ship the delay of fonseca and he agent cause incalculable injury to the public service as will presently appear the sovereign have order that six million maravedi -- about ten thousand dollar -- should be grant for the equipment of the expedition and that eight vessel should be provide the contractor for provision be jonato berardus a florentine merchant settle at seville and owe to he death the contracting work fall upon he assistant amerigo vespuccus who be very actively employ on this service from April 1497 to may 1498 in 1492 vespuccus come to spain as a partner of a italian trader at cadiz name donato nicolinus and he afterward become the chief clerk or agent of berardus it be thus that columbus first become acquaint with amerigo vespuccus when the admiral have reach the ripe age of forty-five as for he provision a good deal of the meat turn bad on the voyage and the contract be not very satisfactorily carry out it be strange that this beef and biscuit contractor should have give he name to the new world but perhaps not more strange than that a bacon contractor should be the patron saint of england and of genoa the admiral be most anxious to despatch supplies and re-enforcement to he brother and he succeed in send off two caravel in advance under the command of hernandez coronel who have be appoint chief magistrate of espafiolum the other vessel consist of two nao or ship of a hundred ton and four caravel after month of harassing and unnecessary delay they drop down the guadalquiver from seville and the admiral sail he touch at porto santo and madeira and reach gomera on may 19th columbus have become aware through information collect from the native of the island that there be extensive land probably a continent to the southward he have also receive a letter from a skilled and learn jeweller name jaime ferrer date August 5 1495 in which it be lay down that the most valuable thing come from very hot country where the native be black or tawny these and other consideration lead he to determine to cross the atlantic on a lower parallel than he have ever do before and he invoke the holy trinity for protection intend to name the first land that be sight in they honor but he be impress with the importance of send help to the colony without delay he therefore detach one ship and two caravel from gomera to make the voyage direct the ship be command by alonzo sanchez de carbajal of baeza one caravel be intrust to pedro de arana brother of beatriz enriquez and brother-in-law of the admiral the other have for she captain a genoese cousin juan antonio colombo it will be remember that antonio the brother of domenico colombo and uncle of the admiral live at the little coast village of quinto near genoa and have three son -- juan antonio mateo and amighetto when these cousin hear of the greatness and renown of christopher they think at least one of they might get some benefit from he prosperity so the younger one give all the little money they could scrape together to enable the eldest to go to spain he illustrious kinsman welcome he with affection and as he be a sailor he receive charge of a caravel in which trust he prove himself as las casas tell we to be careful efficient and fit for command the three vessel sail from gomera direct for española on June 21st columbus continue he voyage of discovery with one vessel and two caravel pero alonzo niño the pilot of the niña in the first voyage be with he herman perez matteo be another pilot and there be a few other old shipmate in the squadron the admiral touch at buena vista one of the cape de verd island remain at anchor for a few day and on July 5th he sail away into the unknown ocean for many day on a south-west course he intention be to go south as far as the latitude of sierra leone 8 ° 30 ' n and then to steer west until he reach land after ten day the vessel be in region of calm and the people begin to suffer from the intense heat the sun melt the tar of the rigging and the seam of the deck begin to open for day and day the scorching heat continue but at length there be some refreshing shower and light breeze spring up from the west but they progress be very slow and they stock of water nearly exhaust so the admiral order the course to be alter to northwest in hope of reach dominica it be July 31st the people be parch with thirst and yet no land have be see in the afternoon of that day the admiral 's servant alonzo perez of huelva go to the masthead and report land in the shape of three separate peak columbus have declare he intention of name the first land sight after the holy trinity and the coincidence of its appear in the form of three peak make a deep impression on he mind the island of trinidad retain its name to this day the admiral give heartfelt thanks to god and all the crew chant the _ salve regina _ and other hymn of prayer and praise meanwhile the little squadron glide through the water approach the newly discover land and columbus name the most eastern point cabo de la galera by reason of a great rock off it which at a distance look like a galley under sail all along the coast the tree be see to come down to the sea the most lovely sight that eye could rest on and at last on August 1st a anchorage be find and they be able to fill up with water from delicious stream and fountain the main continent of south america be see to the south appear like a long island and it receive the name of isla santa the point near the watering-place be call punta de la playa the western end of the island be name punta del arenal and here a extraordinary phenomenon present itself a violent current be rush out through a channel or strait not more than two league wide cause great perturbation of the sea with such a uproar of rush water that the crew be fill with alarm for the safety of the vessel the admiral name the channel la boca de la sierpe he pilot he little squadron safely through it and reach the gulf of parium name by he golfo de la ballena the land to the westward form the mainland of parium receive the name of isla de gracia standing across to the western side of the gulf the admiral be delighted with the beauty of the country and with the view of distant mountain near a point name aguja the country be so fruitful and charming that he call it jardine and here he see many indian among they woman wear bracelet of pearl and when they be ask whence the pearl be obtain they point to the westward as many pearl as could be barter from the native be collect for transmission to the sovereign for here be a new source of wealth another precious commodity from the new world columbus be astonish at the vast mass of fresh water that be pour into the gulf of parium he correctly divine the cause and make the deduction that a river with such a volume of water must come from a great distance he prescient mind show he the mighty river orinoco the wide savanna and the lofty range of the ande but the trammel of the erroneous measurement of astronomer bind they to asia and prevent he from picture they to himself in the new world he have really discover that the land must be continuous appear to be prove not only from the deduction of science but also from the word of god for he believe it to be establish from the reveal word -lrb- ii esdras vi 42 -rrb- that the ocean only cover one-seventh of the globe and that the other six-seventh be dry land moreover he splendid intellect be unite with a powerful imagination when he have grasp the fact with masterly intuition he fancy often raise upon they some strange theory derive partly from he extensive reading partly from he own teem brain thinking that a long and rapid course be insufficient to account for the volume of water and the violence of the current he conceive the idea that the earth though round be not a perfect sphere and that it rise in one part of the equinoctial line so as to be somewhat of a pear shape thus he account for the exceptional volume of water by the motion of river flow down from the end of the pear one step farther in the realm of fancy and he indulge in a dream that this center and apex of the earth 's surface with its mighty river could be no other than the terrestrial paradise write as one think course after another in he teem fancy we find these pass whim of a vivid imagination embody in the journal intend for the information of the sovereign but time be pass on and it be important that he should convey the provision with which he vessel be load to he infant colony he have see that another narrow channel lead from the northern side of the gulf and have name it boca del dragon on August 12th he have pilot he vessel to the punta de paria and prepare to pass through the channel at that critical moment it fall calm while the two current flow violently toward the opening where they meet and form a broken confused sea but the admiral make use of the current and by the exercise of consummate seamanship take he three vessel clear of the danger and out into the open sea the island of tobago and granada be sight receive the name of asuncion and concepcion then the rock and islet to the westward come in view name the testigo and guardia and the island margarita the latter name show that the admiral have obtain the correct information from the native of parium respect the locality of the pearl-fishery the admiral now crowd all sail to reach espanolum intend to make a landfall at the mouth of the river azuma where he know that he brother the adelantado -lrb- governor -rrb- have found the new city and name it santo domingo in memory of they old father domenico colombo but the current carry he far to the westward and on August 19th he sight the coast fifty league to leeward of the new capital on hearing of he arrival on the coast bartolome get on board a caravel and join he but it be not until the 31st that the two brother enter san domingo together the admiral for the first time young diego the third and youngest brother welcome they on they arrival the admiral have be absent for two year and a half during which time the adelantado have conduct the government of the colony with remarkable vigor and ability yet owe to the mutinous conduct of the worst of the settler there be a very disastrous report to make when the adelantado assume the command on the departure of the admiral for spain in march 1496 he first step in compliance with the instruction he have receive be to proceed to the valley on the south side of the island in which the gold mine of hayna be situate and to build a fort which he name san cristoval he next have receive supplies and reënforcements together with letter from the admiral by the caravel under nino take step for the foundation of the new capital still follow he brother 's instruction he select a site at the mouth of the river azuma where there be good anchorage in the bay and a fertile valley along the bank of the river on a bank command the harbor a fortress be erect and name santo domingo while the city be subsequently build on the east bank of the river it become the capital of the colony before long isabellum on the north coast be entirely abandon tree soon grow upon the street and through the roof of the house it present a scene of wild desolation and ghost be believe to wander in crowd through the abandon city ruin of the house of columbus of the church and the fort can still be trace out by those who penetrate into the dense jungle which now cover that part of the coast the next proceeding of the indefatigable adelantado be the settlement of the beautiful province of xaragua form the southwestern portion of the island it be rule over by a chief name behechio with whom dwell the famous anacaona he sister widow of caonabo but unlike that fierce carib a constant friend of the spaniard behechio meet the adelantado in battle array on the bank of the river neyva the eastern boundary of he dominion but as soon as they be inform that the errand of the spanish governor be a peaceful one both behechio and anacaona who be a princess of great ability and of a most amiable disposition receive he with cordial hospitality when after a time he open the subject of tribute to they they show opposition but bartolome prove himself to be a masterly diplomatist and in the end behechio not only consent to impose a tribute the detail of which be amicably arrange but undertake to collect and deliver it periodically to the spanish authority these indian be quite ready to submit to being who appear to be superior in power and intelligence to themselves if the sovereign of spain have trust columbus and he brother fully and completely have establish trading-station and impose a moderate tribute and have absolutely prohibit the overrunning of the country by penniless and worthless adventurer they would have have a rich and prosperous colony the discontent and rebellion of the native be solely cause by the misconduct of the spaniard a insurrection break out in the vega real head by the chief guarionex who after suffer innumerable wrong from the spaniard be at last drive to desperation by a outrage on he wife he assemble a number of dependent cacique but the news be promptly communicate to the garrison of fort concepcion and forward to santo domingo the adelantado stamp out the rebellion with he accustomed vigor he come by force march to concepcion and thence without stop to the camp of the native who be completely take by surprise guarionex and the other cacique be capture and they follower disperse always generous after victory bartolome columbus release guarionex at the prayer of he people a measure which be alike magnanimous and politic but it be impossible to rule over the native satisfactorily unless the spanish settler could be force to submit to the law and the adelantado be not powerful enough to keep the bad character in subjection the loyal and decent man of the colony be in a small minority the consequence be that the unfortunate guarionex be again goad into insurrection on the approach of the adelantado he flee into the mountain of ciguey on the northeast coast and take refuge with a dependent cacique name mayobanex whose residence be near cape cabron the western extreme of the samana peninsula a difficult and arduous mountain campaign follow which bartolome conduct with remarkable military skill it end in the capture and imprisonment of both the chief behechio now announce that he have collect the require tribute consist of a very large quantity of cotton and that it be ready for delivery the adelantado therefore proceed to xaragua and not only find this great store of cotton but receive a offer from the generous chief to supply he with as much cassava-bread as he need for the use of the colony this be a most acceptable present for the lazy ill-conditioned settler have neglect to cultivate they field and a famine be imminent the adelantado order a caravel to be send round to xaragua to be freight with cotton and bread and return himself to isabellum after take a cordial farewell of he native friend he have show extraordinary talent in he government of the native population and he rule have be a complete success always moderate in victory he have suppress the insurrection without bloodshed and have conciliate the people by he moderation he have make long and difficult march have subdue opposition by he readiness of resource and energy and have administer the native affair with humanity and excellent judgment unfortunately he power be insufficient to cope successfully with the insubordinate spaniard the ringleader of the mutineer be francisco roldan a man whom columbus have raise from the dust he have be a servant and the admiral note he ability have intrust he with some judicial function when he sail for spain he appoint roldan chief justice of the colony this ungrateful miscreant foster discontent and mutiny by every art of persuasion and calumny at he command and soon have a large band of worthless and idle ruffian ready to follow he lead he first plan be to murder the adelantado and seize the government but he lack the courage or the opportunity to put it into execution he next step be to march into the vega real with seventy armed mutineer and attempt to surprise fort concepcion the garrison be command by a loyal soldier name miguel ballester who close the gate and defy the rebel send to the adelantado for help bartolome at once hasten to he assistance and on he arrival at fort concepcion he send a messenger to roldan remonstrate with he and urge he to return to he duty but roldan find he force increase by the adhesion of all the discontented man in the colony and he insolence increase with he power all would probably have be lose but for the opportune arrival of pedro hernandez coronel in February 1498 who have be despatch from san lucar by the admiral in the end of the previous year with reënforcements he also bring out the confirmation of bartolome 's rank as adelantado the adelantado be thus enable to leave fort concepcion and establish he head-quarter at santo domingo he send coronel as a envoy to roldan to endeavor to persuade he to return to he duty but the mutineer fear to submit believe that he have go too far for forgiveness he march into the province of xaragua where he allow he dissolute follower to abandon themselves to every kind of excess the three caravel which have be despatch from gomera by the admiral unfortunately make a bad landfall and appear off xaragua roldan conceal the fact that he be a leader of mutineer and receive the captain in he official capacity induce they to supply he with store and provision while he follower busily endeavor to seduce the crew and succeed to some extent when roldan 's true character be discover the caravel put to sea with the loyal part of they crew while alonzo sanchez de carbajal a loyal and thoroughly honest man who be zealous for the good of the colony remain behind to endeavor to persuade roldan to submit to the admiral 's authority he only succeed in obtain from he a promise to enter into negotiation with a view to the termination of the deplorable state of affair he have create and with this carbajal proceed to santo domingo such be the state of affair when columbus arrive at the new seat of he government he brother have rule with ability and vigor during he absence have administer native affair very successfully but he power have be insufficient to subdue the band of spanish miscreant who be still in open mutiny the admiral be fill with grief and disappointment at the turn affair have take a thoroughly loyal man himself with no thought or desire but for the good of the colony he be thwart by treacherous miscreant who care for nothing but the accumulation of riches for themselves and a life of indulgence and licentious ease after long consideration he resolve upon a policy of conciliation the unsettled state of affair be bring ruin on the island and the restoration of peace be a absolute necessity the magnanimous genoese be incapable of personal resentment the man themselves be indeed beneath he contempt but he feel bind to treat with they and even to make great concession if necessary for the good of the public service the welfare of the colony be he sole object and he do not hesitate to sacrifice every personal feeling to he sense of duty it be with some impatience that one find the grand scheme of discovery and colonization interrupt by such contemptible means and the course of the narrative check by the necessity for record however briefly the paltry dissension of vile miscreant such as roldan and he crew the mutineer be most unwilling to make any agreement they be lead the sort of lawless and licentious life that exactly suit they and be disincline to submit to any authority the interest of they leader however be not quite the same and the acceptance of advantageous term would suit they carbajal be employ by the admiral to conduct the negotiation while the veteran ballester return to spain in November 1498 with the news of the rebellion and a request from the admiral that a learn and impartial judge might be send out to decide all dispute it be finally agree that roldan should return to he duty still retain the office of chief justice that all past offence should be condone and that he and he follower should receive grant of land with the service of the indian the admiral consent to these term most unwillingly and under the conviction that this be the only way to avoid the greater evil of civil dissension he resolve however that any future outbreak must be firmly and vigorously suppress by force although roldan have now resume he position as a legitimate official ready to maintain order it could hardly be expect that he fatal example would not be follow by other unprincipled man of the same stamp when the opportunity offer trouble arise owe to the conduct of a young castilian name hernando de guevara roldan be establish in xaragua when the youthful gallant arrive at the house of he cousin adrian de mujica one of the ringleader in roldan 's mutiny and fall in love with higueymota the daughter of anacaona guevara for some misconduct have be order by the admiral to leave the island but instead of obey he have make he way to xaragua and cause trouble by this love passage for he have a rival in roldan himself who order he to desist from the pursuit of the daughter of anacaona and to return to santo domingo guevara refuse to obey but he be promptly arrest and send as a prisoner to the capital when he cousin mujica who be then in the vega real receive the news he raise a mutiny offering reward to the soldier if they would follow he in a attempt to rescue guevara the admiral though suffer from illness show remarkable energy on this occasion march very rapidly at the head of eighteen choose man he surprise the mutineer capture the ringleader and carry he off to the fort of concepcion some severity have now become incumbent upon the authority and mujica be condemn to death the admiral regret the necessity but in no other way could a motive be supply to deter other from keep the country in a constant state of lawless disorder guevara riqueline and other disorderly character be imprison in the fort at santo domingo and by August 1500 peace be quite establish throughout the island thus have columbus restore tranquillity to the colony by prudent and conciliatory negotiation during which he have exercise the most wonderful self-abnegation and patience he have succeed in avert the serious danger cause by the formidable revolt of roldan but as the habit of disorder be threaten to become chronic he wisely take another way with the sedition of mujica maintain order by a resort to prompt and vigorous action and make a salutary example which be calculate to be deterrent in its effect with the restoration of peace trade revive and prosperity begin to return the receiver of grant of land find that they have a stake in the country and seek to derive profit from they crop similar activity appear at the mine and the building at santo domingo progress rapidly the admiral begin to hope that the first trouble incident to a infant colony be over and that the time have arrive for spain to feel the advantage of he great achievement he now look forward to further and more important discovery follow by colonization on the main continent yet at this very time a blow be about to come from a quarter whence it be least to be expect which be destine to shatter all the hope of this long-suffering man and dissipate all he bright vision of the future -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote :1 on the arrival -lrb- August 24 1500 -rrb- of francisco de boabdilla as royal commissioner he depose columbus and he brother and send they in chain to spain

they advance to be hereditary emperor of all germany and at length in 1499 the powerful emperor maximilian determine to enforce he double authority as duke and emperor he project be encourage by the discord rife among the little state or canton which compose the swiss league the follow account of the war that ensue be from the pen of a well-known swiss historian and be perhaps color by rather more enthusiasm and racial pride than historic accuracy yet the struggle be final never after do german or austrian dispute the independence of the swiss the unfortunate consequence bring by success upon the native be not only true but profoundly worthy of note fortunately danger and trouble soon appear from abroad this unite all the canton anew and be therefore salutary maximilian i of austrium be emperor of germany he have receive from france the country of lower burgundy and to hold it more securely incorporate it with the german empire as a single circle he wish to make switzerland also such a german imperial circle the confederate refuse prefer to remain by themselves as they have be until then in swabium the exist state have form a league among themselves for the suppression of small war and feud this pleased the politic emperor by become a associate he place himself at the head of the league which he be able to direct for the aggrandizement of he house of austrium he desire that the confederate also should enter the swabian league the swiss again refuse prefer to remain by themselves as before the emperor be irritated at this and at innspruck he say to the deputy of the confederate : you be refractory member of the empire some day i shall have to pay you a visit sword in hand the deputy answer and say : we humbly beseech you imperial majesty to dispense with such a visit for we swiss be rude man and do not even respect crown the boldness of the confederate wound the swabian league no less many provocation and quarrel take place here and there between the people on the border so that the city of constance for she own security join the swabian league for one day a band of valiant man of thurgau incite by the bailiff from urus have try to surprise the city in order to punish she for she bravado against the swiss neither be the austrian good neighbor to the grison the tyrol and engadine be constantly discuss and dispute about market privilege and toll once indeed in 1476 the tyrolese have march arm into the valley of engadine but be drive back into they own country through the narrow pass of finstermunz with bloody head now there be a fresh cause of quarrel in the division of the toggenburger inheritance the rights of toggenburg in the ten jurisdiction have fall to the count of matsch sax and montfort and afterward 1478-1489 by purchase to the ducal house of austrium hence much trouble arise as the grison have equal cause with the confederate to fear the power and purpose of emperor maximilian the gray league 1497 and that of god 's house 1498 make a friendly and defensive alliance with zurich lucerne urus schwyz unterwalden zug and glarus the ten jurisdiction dare not join they for fear of austrium then the emperor restrain he anger no longer and though already burden with a heavy war in the netherland he send fresh troops into the tyrol and the force of the swabian league advance and hem in switzerland from the grison pass near luziensteig between the rhetian mountain and germany along the lake of constance and the rhine as far as basel then switzerland and rhetium be in great danger but the grison rise courageously to defend they freedom as do all the confederate the sarganser also and the appenzeller hasten to the schollenberg the banner of valai basel and schaffhausen soon float in view of the enemy no man stay at home it be in February 1499 that the strife begin then eight thousand imperialist enter the grison territory of munsterthal and engadine loui of brandi the emperor 's general with several thousand man surprised and hold the pass of luziensteig and by the treachery of four burgher the little city of maienfeld but the grison retake the luziensteig and eight hundred swabian here find they death the rest flee to balzer then the confederate pass the rhine near azmoo and with the grison obtain a great victory near treisen the swabian nobility with ten thousand soldier be post near st john 's at hochst and hard between bregenz and fussach eight thousand confederate kill nearly half of the enemy 's army ascend as far as the forest of bregenz and impose contribution on the country ten thousand other confederate pass victoriously over the hegau and in eight day burn twenty village hamlet and castle skirmish follow quickly upon skirmish battle upon battle the enemy indeed issue from constance succeed in surprising the confederate garrison of ermatingen while asleep and in murder in they bed sixty-three defenceless man but they bloodily expiate this in the wood of schwaderloch whence eighteen thousand of they vanquish by two thousand confederate flee in such haste that the city gate of constance be too narrow for the fugitive and the number of they dead exceed that of the swiss oppose to they a body of confederate on the upper rhine penetrate into wallgau where the enemy be intrench near frastenz and fourteen thousand strong fear not the valor of the swiss but when henry wolleb the hero of urus have pass the langengasterberg with two thousand brave man and burn the strong intrenchment he heroic death be the signal of victory to the confederate they rush under the thunder of artillery into the rank of austrium and deal they fearful blow three thousand dead body cover the battle-field of frastenz such austrian as be leave alive flee in terror through wood and water then each swiss fight as though victory depend on he single arm for switzerland and swiss glory each fly joyously to meet danger and death and count not the number of the enemy and wherever a swiss banner float there be more than one like john walum of glarus who near gam in rheinthal measure himself singly with thirty horseman the grison also fight with no less glory witness the malserhaide in tyrol where fifteen thousand man under austrian banner behind strong intrenchment be attack by only eight thousand grison the rampart be turn the intrenchment storm benedict fontana be first on the enemy 's wall he have clear the way with he left hand hold the wide wound from which he entrails protrude he fight with he right and cry : forward now fellow-leaguers let not my fall stop you it be but one man the less to-day you must save you free fatherland and you free league if you be conquer you leave you child in everlasting slavery so say fontana and die the malserhaide be full of austrian dead nearly five thousand fall the grison have only two hundred kill and seven hundred wound when emperor maximilian in the netherland hear of so many battle lose he come and reproach he general and say to the prince of the german empire : send to I auxiliary against the swiss so bold as to have attack the empire for these rude peasant in whom there be neither virtue nor noble blood nor magnanimity but who be full of coarseness pride perfidy and hatred of the german nation have draw into they party many hitherto faithful subject of the empire but the prince of the empire delay to send auxiliary and the emperor then learn with increase horror that he army send over the engadine mountain to suppress the grison league have be destroy in midsummer by avalanche famine and the mass of rock which the grison throw down from the mountain then that on the woody height of bruderholz not far from basel one thousand swiss have vanquish more than four thousand of they enemy that shortly after in the same region near dornach six thousand confederate have obtain a brilliant victory over fifteen thousand austrian kill three thousand man with they general henry of furstenberg then the emperor reflect that within eight month the swiss have be eight time victorious in eight battle and he decide to end a war in which more than twenty thousand man have already fall and nearly two thousand village hamlet castle and city be destroy peace be negotiate and conclude on September 22 1499 in the city of basel the emperor acknowledge the ancient rights and the conquest of the confederate and grant to they moreover the ordinary jurisdiction over thurgau which with the criminal jurisdiction and other sovereign rights have until then belong to the city of constance thenceforward the emperor think no more of dissolve the confederacy or of incorporate it with the german empire in the field of frastenz of malserhaide and dornach be lay the first foundation-stone of swiss independence of foreign power the confederated canton thankfully acknowledge what basel and schaffhausen have constantly do in these heroic day for the whole confederacy and that warlike appenzell have never be backward at the call of glory and liberty therefore basel June 9 1501 and flourish schaffhausen August 9 1501 be receive into the perpetual swiss bond and finally 1513 appenzell already unite in perpetual alliance with most of the canton be acknowledge as coequal with all the confederate thus in the two hundred fifth year after the deed of william tell the confederacy of the thirteen canton be complete but valai and grison be consider as canton ally to the confederacy as be st gallen muhlhausen rothweil in swabium and other city -- all free place subject to no prince -- unite with the swiss by a defensive alliance at that period the thirteen canton of the swiss confederacy be not yet as now equal in virtue of the bond nor bind together directly by one and the same covenant they be properly unite only with the three canton of urus schwyz and unterwalden as with a common center but among themselves by special treaty each canton be attentive to its own interest and glory seldom to those of the other or to the welfare of the whole confederacy fear of the ambition and power of neighbor lord and prince have draw they together more and more so long as this fear last they union be strong as the government be independent of each other so far as they covenant allow and of foreign prince also they call themselves free swiss but within the country district there be little freedom for the people only in the shepherd canton -- urus schwyz and unterwalden also zug glarus and appenzell -- do the country people possess equal rights and in the city canton only the burgher of the city and often even among these latter only a few rich or ancient family the rest of the people dependent on the city have be either purchase or conquer be subject often indeed serf and enjoy only the limited rights which they have formerly possess under the count and prince even the shepherd canton hold subject whom they like prince govern by they bailiff and the confederate canton and city would by no means allow they subject to purchase they freedom as the old count and lord have formerly permit the confederate themselves to do but the people care little for liberty make rude and savage by continued war they love only quarrel and combat revel and debauchery when there be no war in they own country the young man greedy of booty follow foreign drum and fight the battle of prince for hire there be no good school in the village and the clergy care little for this indeed the moral of the clergy be often no less depraved than those of the citizen and country people even in the convent great disorder frequently prevail with great wealth many of the priest be very ignorant many drink gamble and blaspheme many lead shameless life in the chief city of the canton debauchery and dissipation be rife there be much division between citizen and councillor envy and distrust between the different profession the lord when once seat in the great and small council -- legislative and executive -- care more for themselves and they family than for the welfare of the citizen they endeavor to advance they son and relative and to procure lucrative office for they in all the canton there be certainly some great patriotic soul who prefer the interest of they country to they own but no one listen to they as switzerland have now no foreign war to fear and the neighbor king and prince be please to have in they army swiss for whose life and death they care much less than for the life and death of they own subject the principal family of the city and country canton take advantage of these circumstance to open fountain of wealth for themselves the desire of the king to enlist valiant swiss favor the avidity of the council lord as do the wish of the young man to get booty in spite of the positive prohibition of the magistrate thousand of young man often enlist in foreign service where most of they perish miserably because no one care for they therefore the government judge it best to make treaty with the king for the raising of swiss regiment command by national officer subject to they own law and regularly pay so that each government could take care of its subject when abroad confederate you require a vent for you energy have rudolf reding of schwyz already say when year before he see the free life of the young man after the burgundian war now begin the let out of swiss grison and valaisian to foreign military service by they government the first treaty of this nature be make by the king of france 1479-1480 with the confederate in lucerne next the house of austrium hire mercenary 1499 the prince of italy do the same as do other afterward even the pope themselves want a lifeguard of swiss the first 1503 be pope julius ii who be often engage in war switzerland suffer much from this course many a field remain untilled many a plough stand still because the husbandman have take mercenary arm and if he return alive he bring back foreign disease and vice and corrupt the innocent by evil example for he have acquire but little virtue in the war only the son of the patrician and council lord obtain captaincy command and riches by which they increase they influence and consideration in the land and could oppress other they pride themselves on the title of nobility and decoration confer by king and imagine these to be of value and that they themselves be more than other swiss when the king perceive the cupidity and folly of the swiss they take advantage of they for they own profit send ambassador into switzerland distribute present grant gratification and pension to they partisan in the council and for these the council lord become willing servant of foreign prince then one canton be french another milanese one venetian another spanish but rarely be one swiss this redound greatly to the shame of the swiss when the german emperor and the king of france be at the same time canvass the favor of the canton and bargaining in competition for troops so great be the contempt or insolence of the french ambassador at bern 1516 that he distribute the royal pension to the lord by sound of trumpet at freiburg he pour out silver crown upon the ground and while he heap they up with a shovel say to the bystander do not this silver jingle better than the emperor 's empty word so much have love of money debase the swiss the twelve canton appenzell be the only exception be at one moment ally with milan against france at the next with france against milan milan be rightly call the schwyzer 's grave it be not unusual for confederate to fight against confederate on foreign soil and to kill each other for hire the ecclesiastical lord matthew schinner bishop of sion in valai a very deceitful man help greatly to occasion this accord as he be hire he intrigue in switzerland sometimes for the king of france sometimes against france for the pope who in payment even make he cardinal and ambassador to the confederacy the mercenary war of the swiss upon foreign battle-field be not war for liberty or for honor but these hireling of prince maintain they reputation for valor even there with the aid of several thousand confederate the king of france subject the whole of lombardy in the space of twenty day but the expel duke of the country soon return with five thousand swiss whom he have enlist contrary to the will of the magistracy to drive out the french then the king of france receive twenty thousand man from the canton with whom he be ally maintained himself in italy and give to the three canton urus schwyz and unterwalden 1502-1503 the district of palenza riviera and bellenz but as soon as the king think he could do without the swiss he pay they badly and irregularly cardinal schinner please at this immediately shake a bag of gold with fifty-three thousand guilder in favor of the pope and of venice at once 1512 twenty thousand swiss and grison cross the high alp and join the venetian against the french the grison take possession of valtelina chiavenna and bormio they assert that a century before a eject duke of milan have cede these valley to the bishopric of coire the confederate of the twelve canton subject lugano locarno and valmaggium the french be drive out of lombardy and the young duke maximilian sforza son of he who have be dispossess by they be reinstate in he father 's inheritance at milan victorious for he the confederate beat the french near novara June 6 1513 two thousand swiss fall it be true but ten thousand of the enemy still more murderous be the two-day ' battle of melegnano September 14 1515 in which barely ten thousand swiss fight against fifty thousand french they lose the battle-field indeed but not they honor they sadly retreat to milan with they field-piece on they back they wound in the center of they army the enemy lose the flower of they troops and call this action the battle of the giant then the king of france franci i terrify by a victory which resemble a defeat make in the next year a perpetual peace with the confederate and by money and promise persuade some to furnish he with troops the other that they would allow no enrolling by he enemy thus the confederate once more help he against the emperor and pope and against milan and the king conclude a friendly alliance with they in 1521 during many year they shed they blood for he on the battle-field of italy without good result without advantage except that the confederacy stand godmother to he new-born son each canton send to pari for the _ fête _ a deputy with a baptismal present of fifty ducat more agreeable to the king than this present be the promptitude with which the swiss send sixteen thousand of they troops to he assistance in italy however as they have lose April 20 1522 three thousand man near bicocca as of nearly fifteen thousand who enter lombardy 1524 hardly four thousand come back as finally in the battle near pajium February 24 1525 in which the king himself become prisoner to the emperor the swiss experience a fresh loss of seven thousand man they by degree lose all taste for italian war amerigo vespuccus in america ad 1499 amerigo vespuccus it be the claim of amerigo vespuccus that he accompany four expedition to the new world and that he write a narrative of each voyage accord to amerigo the first expedition sail from spain in 1497 the second of which he own account be here give in 1499 both by order of king ferdinand grave doubt have be throw upon the first of these expedition the sole authority for which be vespucci himself the name america be give to two continent in honor of this naval astronomer on the authority of a account of he travels publish in 1507 in which he be represent as have reach the mainland in 1497 the justice of this naming have always be and still remain a matter of warm dispute among historical critic but at the age of almost fifty -- he be bear in florence in 1451 -- vespuccus unquestionably promote and make a voyage to the new world in may 1499 he sail from spain with alonzo de ojeda who command four vessel during the summer they explore the coast of venezuelum -lrb- little venice -rrb- a name first give by ojeda to a gulf of the caribbean sea on the shore of which be cabin build on pile over the water remind he of venice in italy ojeda who be but little acquaint with navigation enter upon this voyage more as a maraud enterprise than a expedition of discovery and he gladly avail himself of amerigo 's scientific ability vespuccus be also able to command the financial support of he wealthy acquaintance it be say that many of the former sailor of columbus ship with this expedition the follow account be write by amerigo in a letter to lorenzo pier francesco of the medicus family of florence from whom vespuccus have hold certain business commission in spain respect this letter a italian critic observe that it be the most ancient known writing of amerigo relate to he voyage to the new world have be compose within a month after he return from he second voyage and remain bury in we archive for a long time it be a precious monument for without it we should have be leave in ignorance of the great addition which he make to astronomical science the most rigorous examination of this letter can not bring to light the least circumstance prove anything for or against the accuracy of he first voyage the diffidence with which he commence the matter be however a strong indication that he have previously write a account of he first voyage to the same lorenzo de ' medicus to whom he address this communication most excellent and dear lord : it be a long time since i have write to you excellency and for no other reason than that nothing have occur to I worthy of be commemorate this present fetter will inform you that about a month ago i arrive from the indy by the way of the great ocean bring by the grace of god safely to this city of seville i think you excellency will be gratify to learn the result of my voyage and the most surprising thing which have be present to my observation if i be somewhat tedious let my letter be read in you more idle hour as fruit be eat after the cloth be remove from the table you excellency will please to note that commission by he highness the king of spain i set out with two small ship on may 18 1499 on a voyage of discovery to the southwest by way of the great ocean and steer my course along the coast of africa until i reach the fortunate island which be now call the canary after have provide ourselves with all thing necessary first offering we prayer to god we set sail from a island which be call gomera and turn we prow southwardly sail twenty-four day with a fresh wind without see any land at the end of these twenty-four day we come within sight of land and find that we have sail about thirteen hundred league and be at that distance from the city of cadiz in a southwesterly direction when we see the land we give thanks to god and then launch we boat and with sixteen man go to the shore which we find thickly cover with tree astonishing both on account of they size and they verdure for they never lose they foliage the sweet odor which they exhale -- for they be all aromatic -- highly delighted we and we be rejoice in regale we nostril we row along the shore in the boat to see if we could find any suitable place for landing but after toiling from morning till night we find no way or passage which we could enter and disembark we be prevent from do so by the lowness of the land and by its be so densely cover with tree we conclude therefore to return to the ship and make a attempt to land in some other spot we observe one remarkable circumstance in these sea it be that at fifteen league from the land we find the water fresh like that of a river and we fill all we empty cask with it have return to we ship we raise anchor and set sail turn we prow southwardly as it be my intention to see whether i could sail around a point of land which ptolemy call the cape of cattegara which be near the great bay in my opinion it be not far from it accord to the degree of latitude and longitude which will be state hereafter sailing in a southerly direction along the coast we see two large river issue from the land one run from west to east and be four league in width which be sixteen mile the other run from south to north and be three league wide i think that these two river by reason of they magnitude cause the freshness of the water in the adjoining sea see that the coast be invariably low we determine to enter one of these river with the boat and ascend it till we either find a suitable landing-place or a inhabit village have prepare we boat and put in provision for four day with twenty man well arm we enter the river and row nearly two day make a distance of about eighteen league we attempt to land in many place by the way but find the low land still continue and so thickly cover with tree that a bird could scarcely fly through they while thus navigate the river we see very certain indication that the inland part of the country be inhabit nevertheless as we vessel remain in a dangerous place in case a adverse wind should arise we conclude at the end of two day to return here we see a immense number of bird of various form and color a great number of parrot and so many variety of they that it cause we great astonishment some be crimson-colored other of variegated green and lemon other entirely green and other again that be black and flesh-colored oh the song of other species of bird also be so sweet and so melodious as we hear it among the tree that we often linger listen to they charming music the tree too be so beautiful and smell so sweetly that we almost imagine ourselves in a terrestrial paradise yet not one of those tree or the fruit of they be similar to the tree or fruit in we part of the world on we way back we see many people of various description fishing in the river have arrive at we ship we raise anchor and set sail still continue in a southerly direction and standing off to sea about forty league while sailing on this course we encounter a current which run from southeast to northwest so great be it and run so furiously that we be put into great fear and be expose to great peril the current be so strong that the strait of gibraltar and that of the faro of messina appear to we like mere stagnant water in comparison with it we could scarcely make any headway against it though we have the wind fresh and fair see that we make no progress or but very little and the danger to which we be expose we determine to turn we prow to the northwest as i know if i remember right that you excellency understand something of cosmography i intend to describe to you we progress in we navigation by the latitude and longitude we sail so far to the south that we enter the torrid zone and penetrate the circle of cancer you may rest assure that for a few day while sail through the torrid zone we see four shadow of the sun as the sun appear in the zenith to we at midday i would say that the sun be in we meridian give we no shadow but this i be enable many time to demonstrate to all the company and take they testimony of the fact this i do on account of the ignorance of the common people who do not know that the sun move through its circle of the zodiac at one time i see we shadow to the south at another to the north at another to the west and at another to the east and sometimes for a hour or two of the day we have no shadow at all we sail so far south in the torrid zone that we find ourselves under the equinoctial line and have both pole at the edge of the horizon have pass the line and sail six degree to the south of it we lose sight of the north star altogether and even the star of ursa minor or to speak better the guardian which revolve about the firmament be scarcely see very desirous of be the author who should designate the other polar star of the firmament i lose many a time my night 's sleep while contemplate the movement of the star around the southern pole in order to ascertain which have the least motion and which might be nearest to the firmament but i be not able to accomplish it with such bad night as i have and such instrument as i use which be the quadrant and astrolabe i could not distinguish a star which have less than ten degree of motion around the firmament so that i be not satisfy within myself to name any particular one for the pole of the meridian on account of the large revolution which they all make around the firmament while i be arrive at this conclusion as the result of my investigation i recollect a verse of we poet dante which may be find in the first chapter of he _ purgatory _ where he imagine he be leave this hemisphere to repair to the other and attempt to describe the antarctic pole say : i turn to the right hand and fix my mind on the other pole and see four star not see before since the time of we first parent : joyous appear the heaven for they glory oh northern land be widow since deprive of such a sight it appear to I that the poet wish to describe in these verse by the four star the pole of the other firmament and i have little doubt even now that what he say may be true i observe four star in the figure of a almond which have but little motion and if god give I life and health i hope to go again into that hemisphere and not to return without observe the pole in conclusion i would remark that we extend we navigation so far south that we difference of latitude from the city of cadiz be sixty degree and a half because at that city the pole be elevated thirty-five degree and a half and we have pass six degree beyond the equinoctial line let this suffice as to we latitude you must observe that this we navigation be in the month of July August and September when as you know the sun be longest above the horizon in we hemisphere and describe the greatest arch in the day and the least in the night on the contrary while we be at the equinoctial line or near it within four to six degree the difference between the day and the night be not perceptible they be of equal length or very nearly so as to the longitude i would say that i find so much difficulty in discover it that i have to labor very hard to ascertain the distance i have make by means of longitude i find nothing better at last than to watch the opposition of the planet during the night and especially that of the moon with the other planet because the moon be swifter in she course than any other of the heavenly body i compare my observation with the almanac of giovannus da monteregio which be compose for the meridian of the city of ferrara verify they with the calculation in the table of king alfonso and afterward with the many observation i have myself make one night with another on August 23 1499 -- when the moon be in conjunction with mar which accord to the almanac be to take place at midnight or half a hour after -- i find that when the moon rise to the horizon a hour and a half after the sun have set the planet have pass in that part of the east i observe that the moon be about a degree and some minute farther east than mar and at midnight she be five degree and a half farther east a little more or less so that make the proportion if twenty-four hour be equal to three hundred and sixty degree what be five hour and a half equal to i find the result to be eighty-two degree and a half which be equal to my longitude from the meridian of the city of cadiz then give to every degree sixteen league and two-third which be five thousand four hundred sixty-six mile and two-third the reason why i give sixteen league to each degree be because accord to tolomeo and alfagrano the earth turn twenty-four thousand mile which be equal to six thousand league which be divide by three hundred sixty degree give to each degree sixteen league and two-third this calculation i certify many time conjointly with the pilot and find it true and good it appear to I most excellent lorenzo that by this voyage most of those philosopher be controvert who say that the torrid zone can not be inhabit on account of the great heat i have find the case to be quite the contrary i have find that the air be fresher and more temperate in that region than beyond it and that the inhabitant be also more numerous here than they be in the other zone for reason which will be give below thus it be certain that practice be of more value than theory thus far i have relate the navigation i accomplish in the south and west it now remain for I to inform you of the appearance of the country we discover the nature of the inhabitant and they custom the animal we see and of many other thing worthy of remembrance which fall under my observation after we turn we course to the north the first land we find to be inhabit be a island at ten degree distant from the equinoctial line when we arrive at it we see on the sea-shore a great many people who stand look at we with astonishment we anchor within about a mile of the land fit out the boat and twenty-two man well arm make for land the people when they see we landing and perceive that we be different from themselves -- because they have no beard and wear no clothing of any description be also of a different color they be brown and we white -- begin to be afraid of we and all run into the wood with great exertion by means of sign we reassure they and negotiate with they we find that they be of a race call cannibal the greater part or all of whom live on human flesh you excellency may rest assure of this fact they do not eat one another but navigate with certain bark which they call ` canoe ' they bring they prey from the neighbor island or country inhabit by those who be enemy or of a different tribe from they own they never eat any woman unless they consider they outcast these thing we verify in many place where we find similar people we often see the bone and head of those who have be eat and they who have make the repast admit the fact and say that they enemy always stand in much greater fear on that account still they be a people of gentle disposition and beautiful stature they go entirely naked and the arm which they carry be bow and arrow and shield they be a people of great activity and much courage they be very excellent marksman in fine we hold much intercourse with they and they take we to one of they village about two league inland and give we we breakfast they give whatever be ask of they though i think more through fear than affection and after have be with they all one day we return to the ship still remain on friendly term with they we sail along the coast of this island and saw by the seashore another large village of the same tribe we land in the boat and find they be wait for we all load with provision and they give we enough to make a very good breakfast accord to they idea of dish see they be such kind people and treat we so well we dare not take anything from they and make sail till we arrive at a gulf which be call the gulf of parium we anchor opposite the mouth of a great river which cause the water of this gulf to be fresh and see a large village close to the sea we be surprise at the great number of people who be see there they be without arm and seem peaceably dispose we go ashore with the boat and they receive we with great friendship and take we to they house where they have make very good preparation for breakfast here they give we three sort of wine to drink not of the juice of the grape but make of fruit like beer and they be excellent here also we eat many fresh acorn a most royal fruit they give we many other fruit all different from ours and of very good flavor the flavor and odor of all be aromatic they give we some small pearl and eleven large one and they tell we by sign that if we would wait some day they would go and fish for they and bring we many of they we do not wish to be detain so with many parrot of various color and in good friendship we part from they from these people we learn that those of the before-mentioned island be cannibal and eat human flesh we issue from this gulf and sail along the coast see continually great number of people and when we be so disposed we treat with they and they give we everything we ask of they they all go as naked as they be bear without be ashamed if all be to be related concern the little shame they have it would be border on impropriety therefore it be better to suppress it after have sail about four hundred league continually along the coast we conclude that this land be a continent which might be bound by the eastern part of asia this be the commencement of the western part of the continent because it happen often that we see diver animal such as lion stag goat wild hog rabbit and other land animal which be not find in island but only on the mainland go inland one day with twenty man we see a serpent which be about twenty-four foot in length and as large in girth as myself we be very much afraid of it and the sight of it cause we to return immediately to the sea i oftentimes see many very ferocious animal and serpent thus sail along the coast we discover every day a great number of people speak various language when we have navigate four hundred league along the coast we begin to find people who do not wish for we friendship but stand wait for we with arm which be bow and arrow and with some other arm which they use when we go to the shore in we boat they dispute we landing in such a manner that we be oblige to fight with they at the end of the battle they find that they have the worst of it for as they be naked we always make great slaughter many time not more than sixteen of we fight with two thousand of they and in the end defeat they kill many and rob they house one day we see a great many people all post in battle array to prevent we landing we fit out twenty-six man well armed and cover the boat on account of the arrow which be shoot at we and which always wound some of we before we land after they have hinder we as long as they could we leap on shore and fight a hard battle with they the reason why they have so much courage and fight with such great exertion against we be that they do not know what kind of a weapon the sword be or how it cut while thus engage in combat so great be the multitude of people who charge upon we throw at we such a cloud of arrow that we could not withstand the assault and nearly abandon the hope of life we turn we back and run to the boat while thus dishearten and fly one of we sailor a portuguese a man of fifty-five year of age who have remain to guard the boat see the danger we be in jump on shore and with a loud voice call out to we child turn you face to you enemy and god will give you the victory throw himself on he knee he make a prayer and then rush furiously upon the indian and we all join with he wound as we be on that they turn they back to we and begin to flee and finally we route they and kill one hundred fifty we burn they house also at least one hundred eighty in number then as we be badly wound and weary we return to the ship and go into a harbor to recruit where we stay twenty day solely that the physician might cure we all escape except one who be wound in the left breast after be cure we recommence we navigation and through the same cause we often be oblige to fight with a great many people and always have the victory over they thus continue we voyage we come upon a island fifteen league distant from the mainland as at we arrival we see no collection of people the island appear favorably we determine to attempt it and eleven of we land we find a path in which we walk nearly two league inland and come to a village of about twelve house in which there be only seven woman who be so large that there be not one among they who be not a span and a half taller than myself when they see we they be very much frightened and the principal one among they who be certainly a discreet woman lead we by sign into a house and have refreshment prepare for we we see such large woman that be about determine to carry off two young one about fifteen year of age and make a present of they to they king as they be without doubt creature whose stature be above that of common man while we be debate this subject thirty-six man enter the house where we be drink they be of such large stature that each one be taller when upon he knee than i when stand erect in fact they be of the stature of giant in they size and in the proportion of they body which correspond well with they height each of the woman appear a pantasilea and the man anteus when they come in some of we own number be so frightened that they do not consider themselves safe they have bow and arrow and very large club make in the form of sword see that we be of small stature they begin to converse with we in order to learn who we be and from what part we come we give they fair word for the sake of peace and say that we be go to see the world finally we hold it to be we wisest course to part from they without question in we turn so return by the same path in which we have come they accompany we quite to the sea till we go on board the ship nearly half the tree of this island be dye-wood as good as that of the east we go from this island to another in the vicinity at ten league ' distance and find a very large village the house of which be build over the sea like venice with much ingenuity while we be strike with admiration at this circumstance we determine to go and see they and as we go to they house they attempt to prevent we enter they find out at last the manner in which the sword cut and think it best to let we enter we find they house fill with the finest cotton and the beam of they dwelling be make of dye-wood we take a quantity of they cotton and some dye-wood and return to the ship you excellency must know that in all part where we land we find a great quantity of cotton and the country fill with cotton-tree so that all the vessel in the world might be load in these part with cotton and dye-wood at length we sail three hundred league farther along the coast constantly find savage but brave people and very often fight with they and vanquish they we find seven different language among they each of which be not understand by those who speak the other it be say there be not more than seventy-seven language in the world but i say there be more than a thousand as there be more than forty which i have hear myself after have sail along this coast seven hundred league or more besides visit numerous island we ship become greatly sea-worn and leak badly so that we could hardly keep they free with two pump go the man also be much fatigued and the provision grow short we be then accord to the decision of the pilot within a hundred twenty league of a island call hispaniola discover by the admiral columbus six year before we determine to proceed to it and as it be inhabit by christian to repair we ship there allow the man a little repose and recruit we stock of provision because from this island to castile there be three hundred league of ocean without any land intervene in seven day we arrive at this island where we stay two month here we refit we ship and obtain we supply of provision we afterward conclude to go to northern part where we discover more than a thousand island the greater part of they be inhabit the people be without clothing timid and ignorant and we do whatever we wish to do with they this last portion of we discovery be very dangerous to we navigation on account of the shoal which we find thereabout in several instance we come near be lose we sail in this sea two hundred league directly north until we people have become wear down with fatigue through have be already nearly a year at sea they allowance be only six ounce of bread for eating and but three small measure of water for drinking per diem and as the ship become dangerous to navigate with much longer they remonstrate say that they wish to return to they home in castile and not to tempt fortune and the sea any more whereupon we conclude to take some prisoner as slave and load the ship with they to return at once to spain go therefore to certain island we possess ourselves by force of two hundred thirty-two and steer we course for castile in sixty-seven day we cross the ocean and arrive at the island of the azore which belong to the king of portugal and be three hundred league distant from cadiz here have take in we refreshment we sail for castile but the wind be contrary and we be oblige to go to the canary island from there to the island of madeira and thence to cadiz we be absent thirteen month on this voyage expose ourselves to awful danger and discover a very large country of asia and a great many island the largest part of they inhabit accord to the calculation i have several time make with the compass we have sail about five thousand league to conclude we pass the equinoctial line six and a half degree to the south and afterward turn to the north which we penetrate so far that the north star be at a elevation of thirty-five degree and a half above we horizon to the west we sail eighty-four degree distant from the meridian of the city and port of cadiz we discover immense region see a vast number of people all naked and speak various language on the land we see numerous wild animal various kind of bird and a infinite number of tree all aromatic we bring home pearl in they grow state and gold in the grain we bring two stone one of emerald color and the other of amethyst which be very hard and at least a half a span long and three finger thick the sovereign esteem they most highly and have preserve they among they jewel we bring also a piece of crystal which some jeweller say be beryl and accord to what the indian tell we they have a great quantity of the same we bring fourteen flesh-colored pearl with which the queen be highly delighted we bring many other stone which appear beautiful to we but of all these we do not bring a large quantity as we be continually busy in we navigation and do not tarry long in any place when we arrive at cadiz we sell many slave find two hundred remain to we the other complete the number of two hundred thirty-two have die at sea after

twelve ship very richly laden and he have send they again to those part where they will certainly do a profitable business if they arrive safely may we lord preserve and increase the exalted state of you noble excellency as i desire July 18 1500 you excellency 's humble servant amerigo vespuccus rise and fall of the borgia ad 1502 niccolo machiavellus the commencement of the sixteenth century find italy suffer from the foreign interference of france and spain the chief italian state at this period be the kingdom of naple the papal state the duchy of milan and the republic of venice florence and genoa ferdinand v of aragon and loui xii of france who have hereditary claim through he grandmother valentina viscontus have conclude a secret and perfidious treaty for the partition of the kingdom of naple the effect of which frederick ii the king vainly seek to avert they conquer naple in 1501 but disagree over the division of the spoil and the french army be defeat by the spanish on the garigliano in 1503 spanish influence soon after become dominant in italy in the march of the french army on naple in 1501 the french commander have for lieutenant caesar borgium son of pope alexander vi whose career furnish a vivid illustration of the internal condition of italy at this period borgium who have resign from the cardinalate confer on he by he father have be create duke of valentinoi by the king of france have marry the daughter of the king of navarre and be invest with the duchy of romagna by he father in 1501 by force and treachery he reduce the city of romagna which be rule by feudatory of the papal see and with the assistance of he relation endeavor to find a independent hereditary power in central italy the contemporaneous account of these event by the celebrated niccolo machiavellus possess a fascinating interest which be greatly enhance by the fact that machiavellus himself be a participant in the event of which he write a florentine by birth machiavellus be send by he fellow-citizen in 1502 on a mission to borgium who have just return from a visit to the king of france in lombardy during borgium 's absence friend and former colleague alarm at he ambition and cruelty have enter into a league with he enemy and invite the florentine to join they the florentine refuse but send machiavellus to make profession of friendship and offer of assistance to the duke and at the same time to watch he movement to discover he real intention and endeavor to obtain something in return for they friendship borgium who have the reputation of be the closest man of he age have to deal with a negotiator who though young be a match for he and the account of the mission be very curious there be deep dissimulation on both side machiavellus return to florence in January 1503 after three eventful month pass in the court and camp of borgium the treatise _ the prince _ have be describe as a display of cool judicious scientific atrocity on the part of caesar borgium -lrb- duke valentino -rrb- which seem rather to belong to a fiend than to the most depraved of man principle which the most hardened ruffian would scarcely hint to he most trust accomplice or avow without the disguise of some palliating sophism even to he own mind be profess without the slightest circumlocution and assume as the fundamental axiom of all political science on be reprove for the maxim contain in the work machiavellus reply if i teach prince how to tyrannize i also teach the people how to destroy they and in these word posterity have vindicate the reputation of the talented italian statesman and author those who from a private station have ascend to the dignity of prince by the favor of fortune alone meet with few difficulty in they progress but encounter many in maintain themselves on the throne obstruct by no impediment during they journey they soar to a great height but all the difficulty arise after they be quietly seat these prince be chiefly such as acquire they dominion by money or by favor such be the man whom darius place in greece in the city of ionium and of the hellespont whom for they own security and glory he raise to the rank of sovereign such be the emperor who from a private station arrive at the empire by corrupt the soldiery they sustain they elevation only by the pleasure and fortune of those who advance they two foundation equally uncertain and insecure they have neither the experience nor the power necessary to maintain they position for unless man possess superior genius or courage how can they know in what manner to govern other who have themselves always be accustom to a private station deficient in knowledge they will be equally destitute of power for want of troops on whose attachment and fidelity they can depend besides those state which have suddenly rise like other thing in nature of premature and rapid growth do not take sufficient root in the mind of man but they must fall with the first stroke of adversity unless the prince themselves -- so unexpectedly exalt -- possess such superior talent that they can discover at once the means of preserve they good-fortune and afterward maintain it by have recourse to the same measure which other have adopt before they to adduce instance of supreme power attain by good-fortune and superior talent i may refer to two example which have happen in we own time viz franci sforza and caesar borgia the former by lawful means and by he great ability raise himself from a private station to the dukedom of milan and maintain with but little difficulty what have cost he so much trouble to acquire caesar borgium duke of valentinoi -- commonly call the duke of valentino -- on the other hand attain a sovereignty by the good-fortune of he father which he lose soon after he father 's decease though he exert he utmost endeavor and employ every mean that skill or prudence could suggest to retain those state which he have acquire by the arm and good-fortune of another for though a good foundation may not have be lay before a man arrive at dominion it may possibly be accomplish afterward by a ruler of superior mind yet this can only be effect with much difficulty to the architect and danger to the edifice if therefore we examine the whole conduct of borgium we shall see how firm a foundation he have lay for future greatness this examination will not be superfluous -- for i know no better lesson for the instruction of a prince than be afford by the action and example of the duke -- for if the measure he adopt do not succeed it be not he fault but rather owe to the extreme perversity of fortune pope alexander vi wish to give he son a sovereignty in italy have not only present but future difficulty to contend with in the first place he see no means of make he sovereign of any state independent of the church and if he should endeavor to dismember the ecclesiastical state he know that the duke of milan and the venetian would never consent to it because faenza and riminus be already under the protection of the latter and the army of italy from whom he might expect material service be in the hand of those who have the most reason to apprehend the aggrandizement of the papal power such as the orsinus the colonnus and they partisan it be consequently necessary to dissolve these connection and to throw the italian state into confusion in order to secure the sovereignty of a part this be easy to accomplish the venetian influence by motive of they own have determine to invite the french into italy the pope make no opposition to they design he even favor it by consent to annul the first marriage of loui xii who therefore march into italy with the aid of the venetian and the consent of alexander he be no sooner at milan than the pope avail himself of he assistance to overrun romagna which he acquire by the reputation of he alliance with the king of france the duke have thus acquire romagna and weaken the colonnus wish at the same time to preserve and increase he own principality but there be two obstacle in he way the first arise from he own people upon whom he could not depend the other from the design of the french he fear that the orsinus of whose aid he have avail himself might fail at the critical moment and not only prevent he further acquisition but even deprive he of those he have make and he have reason to apprehend the same conduct on the part of france and be convince of the trifling reliance he could place on the orsinus for after the reduction of faenza when he make a attack upon bologna they manifest a evident want of activity as to the king he intention be easily discern for when he have conquer the duchy of urbino and be about to make a irruption into tuscany the king oblige he to desist from the enterprise the duke determine therefore neither to depend on fortune nor on the arm of another prince he begin by weaken the party of the orsinus and the colonnus at rome by corrupt all the person of distinction who adhere to they either by bribe appointment or command suit to they respective quality so that in a few month a complete revolution be effect in they attachment and they all come over to the duke have thus humble the colonnus he only wait a opportunity for destroy the orsinus it be not long before one offer of which he do not fail to avail himself the orsinus perceive too late that the power of the duke and the church must be establish upon they ruin call a council of they friend at magione in perugium to concert measure of prevention the consequence of they deliberation be the revolt of urbino the disturbance of romagna and the infinite danger which threaten the duke on every side and which he finally surmount by the aid of the french he affair once reestablish he grow weary of rely on france and other foreign ally and he resolve for the future to rely alone on artifice and dissimulation -- a course in which he so well succeed that the orsinus be reconcile to he through the intervention of signor paolo whom he have gain over to he interest by all manner of rich present and friendly office and this man be deceive himself so far prevail on the credulity of the rest that they attend the duke at a interview at sinigaglium where they be all put to death have thus exterminate the chief and convert they partisan into he friend the duke lay the solid foundation of he power he make himself master of all romagna and the duchy of urbino and gain the affection of the inhabitant -- particularly the former -- by give they a prospect of the advantage they might hope to enjoy from he government as this latter circumstance be remarkable and worthy of imitation i can not suffer it to pass unnoticed after the duke have possess himself of romagna he find it have be govern by a number of petty prince more addict to the spoliation than the government of they subject and whose political weakness rather serve to create popular disturbance than to secure the blessing of peace the country be infested with robber tear by faction and a prey to all the horror of civil commotion he find that to establish tranquillity order and obedience a vigorous government be necessary with this view he appoint ramiro d'orco governor a cruel but active man to whom he give the greatest latitude of power he very soon appease the disturbance unite all party and acquire the renown of restore the whole country to peace the duke soon deem it no longer necessary to continue so rigorous and odious a system he therefore erect in the midst of the province a court of civil judicature with a worthy and upright magistrate to preside over it where every city have its respective advocate he be aware that the severity of ramiro have excite some hatred against he and resolve to clear himself from all reproach in the mind of the people and to gain they affection by show they that the cruelty which have be commit do not originate with he but solely in the ferocious disposition of he minister take advantage of the discontent he cause ramiro to be massacre one morning in the market-place and he body expose upon a gibbet with a cutlass near it stain with blood the horror of this spectacle satisfy the resentment of the people and petrified they at once with terror and astonishment the duke have now deliver himself in a great measure from present enemy and take effectual means to secure himself by employ against they arm of he own put it out of the power of he neighbor to annoy he to secure and increase he acquisition he have nothing to fear from anyone but the french he well know that the king of france who have at last perceive he error would oppose he further aggrandizement he resolve in the first place to form new connection and alliance and adopt a system of prevarication with france as plainly appear when they army be employ in naple against the spaniard who have lay siege to gaeta he design be to fortify himself against they and he would certainly have succeed if alexander vi have live a little longer such be the method he take to guard against present danger against those which be more remote -- as he have reason to fear that the new pope would be inimical to he and seek to deprive he of what have be bestow on he by he predecessor -- he design to have make four different provision : in the first place by utterly destroy the family of all those noble whom he have deprive of they state so that the future pope might not reestablish they secondly by attach to he interest all the gentry of rome in order by they means to control the power of the pope thirdly by secure a majority in the college of cardinal fourthly and lastly by acquire so much power during the lifetime of he father that he might be enable of himself to resist the first attack of the enemy three of these design he have effect before the death of alexander and have make every necessary arrangement for avail himself of the fourth he have put to death almost all the noble whom he have despoil and have gain over all the roman gentry he party be the strongest in the college of cardinal and for a further augmentation of he power he design to have make himself master of tuscany he be already master of perugium and piombino and have take pisa under he protection of which he soon afterward take actual possession he cautious policy with regard to the french be no longer necessary as they have be drive from the kingdom of naple by the spaniard and both of these people be under the necessity of court he friendship lucca and sienna presently submit to he either from fear or hatred of the florentine the latter be then unable to defend themselves and if this have be the case at the time of alexander 's death the duke 's power and reputation would have be so great that he might have sustain he dignity without any dependence on fortune or the support of other alexander vi die five year after he have first unsheathed he sword he leave he son nothing firmly establish but the single state of romagna all he other conquest be absolutely visionary as he be not only enclosed between two hostile and powerful army but be himself attack by a mortal disease the duke however possess so much ability and courage be so well acquaint with the art either of gain or ruin other as it suit he purpose and so strong be the foundation he have lay in that short space of time that if he have either be in health or not distressed by those two hostile army he would have surmount every difficulty as a proof of the soundness of the foundation he have lay romagna continue faithful to he and be firm to he interest for above a month afterward although the baglionus the vitellus and the ursinus all come to rome at that time yet -- half dead as he be -- they fear to attempt anything against he if he could not elect a pope of he own choice he be at least able to prevent the election of one unfriendly to he interest if he have be in health when alexander die he would have succeed in all he design for he say the very day that julius ii be elect that he have foresee every obstacle which could arise on the death of he father and have prepare adequate remedy but that he could not foresee that at the time of he father 's death he own life would be in such imminent hazard -lrb- 1 -rrb- upon a thorough review of the duke 's conduct and action i can not reproach he with have omit any precaution and i feel that he merit be propose as a model to all who by fortune or foreign arm succeed in acquire sovereignty for as he have a great spirit and vast design he could not have act otherwise in he circumstance and if he miscarry in they it be solely owe to the sudden death of he father and the illness with which he be himself attack whoever therefore would secure himself in a new principality against the attempt of enemy and find it necessary to gain friend to surmount obstacle by force of cunning to make himself beloved and fear by the people respect and obey by the soldiery to destroy all those who can or may oppose he design to promulgate new law in substitution of old one to be severe indulgent magnanimous and liberal to disband a army on which he can not rely and raise another in its stead to preserve the friendship of king and prince so that they may be ever prompt to oblige and fearful to offend -- such a one i say can not have a better or more recent model for he imitation than be afford by the conduct of borgium one thing blamable in he action occur on the election of julius ii to the pontificate he could not nominate the prelate whom he wish but he have it in he power to exclude anyone whom he dislike he ought therefore never to have consent to the election of one of those cardinal whom he have formerly injure and who might have reason to fear he after he election for mankind injure other from motive either of hatred or fear among other whom he have injure be st peter ad vinculum colonna st george and ascanius all the other candidate for the pontificate have cause to fear he except the cardinal of rouen and the spanish cardinal -- the latter be unite to he by family connection -- and the cardinal d'amboise who be too powerfully support by france to have reason to fear he the duke ought by all means to have procure the election of a spaniard or in case of failure should have consent to the proposal of the archbishop of rouen but on no account to the nomination of st peter ad vinculum it be a error to think that new obligation will extinguish the memory of former injury in the mind of great man the duke therefore in this election commit a fault which prove the occasion of he utter ruin -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : on August 18 1503 he and he father drink by mistake a poison which they have presumably prepare for one of they guest the father die and borgium 's life be for a time in extreme danger -rrb- -lrb- footnote :2 within thirteen

florence in the interval between all these date he produce many of he masterpiece from this period the historian follow michelangelo through a important stage of he active career show how the hand that round peter 's dome and create so many other of the greatest work of art toil on with patient heroism in spite of hinderance almost incredible the painting of the sistine chapel upon which he fame so largely rest be here describe in language that reveal the manhood no less clearly than the artistic genius of michelangelo in 1508 michelangelo return to rome and resume he labor on the mausoleum he have soon again to abandon they bramante have persuade the pope that it be unlucky to have he tomb erect but advise he to employ michelangelo in paint the chapel build by he uncle sixtus iv it be in effect in the beginning of this year that he commence this gigantic decoration which be destine to be he most splendid work we shall see the resistance he first oppose to julius ' desire and the ardor with which he undertake and the rapidity with which he accomplish the work once he make up he mind to accept it but first since at the period we have come to most of the statue which now adorn the tomb of julius ii at san pietro in vinculo and those more numerous that belong to the original project but which have be disperse be block out or finish i wish to give in order not to return to the subject a general idea of this monument to show what from reduction to reduction the original design have become and what annoyance it occasion its author the original magnificent design remain unmodified until 1513 but on julius ' death he testamentary executor the cardinal santiquatro and aginense and the duke of urbino reduce to six the number of statue that be to form the decoration and reduce from ten thousand to six thousand ducat the sum to be employ on it from 1513 to 1521 leo x who care less to complete he predecessor 's monument than to endow he native city florence with the work of the great artist employ michelangelo almost exclusively in build the façade and sacristy of san lorenzo during the short austere pontificate of adrian vi michelangelo again devoted himself to the sculpture of the monument but under clement vii he have again to abandon they in order to execute in florence the project of leo x which the new pope have adopt toward 1531 the duke of urbino at last obtain permission for michelangelo to suspend the work at san lorenzo in order to finish the tomb so long since begin nevertheless it do not appear that he be allow much time to devote to it at last on the death of clement vii he think he have regain he liberty and could after such long involuntary delay fulfil he engagement but hardly be paul iii install than he send for he give he the most cordial reception and beg he to consecrate he talent to he service michelangelo reply that it be impossible he be bind by treaty to terminate the mausoleum of julius ii paul fly into a rage and say : thirty year have i desire this and now that i be pope i be not to be allow to satisfy it i shall tear up this contract i mean that you shall obey I the duke of urbino loudly complain openly accuse michelangelo of want of good faith the sculptor not know which way to turn besought the pope to allow he to complete the work he be pledge to he form the wildest project in order to escape the amicable compulsion of paul among other that of retire to carrara where he have pass some tranquil year among the mountain of marble the pontiff to put a end to all these discussion issue a brief dated September 18 1537 wherein he declare michelangelo he heir and successor release from all obligation result from the different contract enter into on the subject of the monument this fashion of terminate thing could not satisfy the duke of urbino nor relieve michelangelo the negotiation be again resume and it end in they agreement that the monument should be raise in the form in which we now see it in the church of san pietro in vinculo and should be compose of the statue of mose execute entirely by the hand of michelangelo of two figure personify active life and contemplative life which be already much advanced but be to be finish by rafaello de monte lupo of two other statue by this master -- a madonna after a model by michelangelo and the figure of julius by maso del bosco such be the very abridged history of this monument which be not entirely complete till 1550 after have cause for nearly half a century real torment to buonarroti the duke of urbino be not satisfied neither be michelangelo the figure originally intend to form part of a colossal whole under the great roof of st peter 's appear too large for the place they now occupy the importance of the statue of mose mislead the mind suggest the idea that the monument itself be raise to the memory of the hebrew legislator rather than to that of the warrior-pope at all event in this statue be centre the principal we may say the unique interest of the tomb this prodigious work must be in the memory of all amid the masterpiece of ancient and modern sculpture the mose remain ever unparalleled a type not irreproachable but the most striking of a new art i do not speak of the consummate science which michelangelo display in the modelling of this statue the greek be learn in another fashion but be so equally with he whence come it nevertheless that in spite of _ bizarrery _ needless to defend or to deny and although this austere figure be far from attain or pretend to the serene and tranquil beauty which the ancient regard as the supreme term of art whence be it that it produce upon the most prejudiced mind a irresistible impression it be that it be more than human that it lift the soul into a world of feeling and idea of which the ancient know less than we do they voluptuous art in deify the human form hold down think to earth the mose of michelangelo behold god hear that voice of thunder and bear the terrible impress of what he see and hear on mount sinaus : he profound eye be scrutinize the mystery he vaguely see in he prophetic dream be it the mose of the bible i can not say be it in this way praxitele and phidia would have represent lycurgus and solon we may deny it boldly the legislator in they hand would have be the embodiment of law they would have represent a abstraction in a form whose harmonious beauty nothing could alter mose be not merely the legislator of a people not think alone dwell beneath this powerful brow he feel he suffer he live in a moral world which jehovah have open to he and although above humanity be a man on he return to rome in 1508 michelangelo have find julius ii not cool toward he but preoccupy by new project the pope make no allusion to he monument and be absorb in the reconstruction of st peter 's which he have confide to bramante raphael be begin at the same time the fresco of the stanza della segnatura and two biographer of michelangelo whose testimony it be true on this point may be suspect agree in say that the architect of st peter 's jealous of the superiority of the florentine sculptor fear lest he should discover the mistake commit in he recent construction and the malversation of which perhaps he be not innocent advise the pope to confide to he the painting of the ceiling of the chapel build by sixtus iv hope to compromise and ruin he by engage he in work of which he have no experience julius adopt the idea send for michelangelo and order he to begin forthwith buonarrotus have have no practice in fresco-painting since he student day under ghirlandajo he know that the painting of a ceiling be not a easy matter he plead every excuse propose that the commission should be give to raphael say that for he part be but a sculptor he could not succeed the pope be inflexible and michelangelo begin the ceiling on may 10 1508 the most prodigious monument perhaps that ever spring from the human mind julius have order bramante to construct the necessary scaffolding but the latter do it in so inefficient a manner that michelangelo be oblige to dispense with he assistance and construct the whole machinery himself he have send for some of he fellow-student from florence not as vasarus by some strange aberration state because he be ignorant of fresco-painting since all the artist of the time understand it and the pupil of ghirlandajo have himself practice it but because he fellow-student have have more experience in it and he wish to be help in a work of this importance he be however so dissatisfied with they work that he efface all that they do and without any assistance if we be to believe he biographer even grind he own color he shut himself up in the chapel beginning at dawn quit at nightfall often sleep in he clothes on the scaffolding allow himself but a slight repast at the end of the day and let no one see the work he have begin hardly have he set to work when unforeseen difficulty present themselves which be on the point of make he relinquish the whole thing the color while still fresh be cover with a mist the cause of which he be unable to discover utterly discourage he go to the pope and say : i forewarned you holiness that painting be not my art all i have do be lose and if you do not believe I order someone to come and see it julius send san gallo who see that the accident be cause by the quality of the time and that michelangelo have make he plaster too wet buonarrotus after this proceed with the utmost ardor and in the space of twenty month without further accident finish the first half the mystery with which michelangelo surround himself keenly excite public curiosity in spite of the painter 's objection julius frequently visit he in the chapel and notwithstanding he great age ascend the ladder michelangelo extend a hand that he might with safety reach the platform he grow impatient he be eager that all rome should share he admiration it be in vain that michelangelo object that all the machinery would have to be reconstruct that half the ceiling be not complete the pope would listen to nothing and the chapel be accordingly open to the public on the morning of November 1 1509 julius be the first to arrive before the dust occasion by the take down of the scaffolding be lay and celebrate mass there the same day the success be immense bramante see that he evil intention far from succeed have only serve to add to the glory of michelangelo who have come triumphant out of the trap he have lay for he beseech the pope to permit raphael to paint the other half of the chapel notwithstanding the affection he bear he architect julius adhere to he resolution and michelangelo resume after a brief interruption the painting of the ceiling but rumor of these cabal reach he they trouble he and he complain to the pope of bramante 's conduct it be probable that the coolness which always exist between raphael and michelangelo date from this period the second part of the ceiling by much the most considerable be finish in 1512 it be difficult to explain how vasarus confuse the date and appear to apply to the whole what refer only to the first part could have state that this immense work be complete in the space of twenty month if anything could astonish it be that michelangelo be able in four year to accomplish so gigantic a work it be needless for the purpose of exciting we admiration to endeavor to persuade we that it be do in a space of time materially insufficient such be the impatience of julius that again he nearly quarrel with michelangelo the latter require to go to florence on business go to the pope for money when do you mean to finish my chapel say the pope as soon as i can answer michelangelo ` as soon as i can as soon as i can ' reply the irascible pontiff i 'll have you fling off you scaffolding and he touch he with he stick michelangelo go home set he affair in order and be on the point of leave when the pope send he he favorite accursio with he apology and five hundred ducat this time again michelangelo be unable to finish he work as completely as he would have wish he desire to retouch certain portion but see the inconvenience of reërecting the scaffolding he determine to do nothing more say that what be want to he figure be not of importance you should put a little gold on they say the pope my chapel will look very poor the people i have paint there answer michelangelo be poor accordingly nothing be change these painting on the ceiling of the sistine transcend all description how give a idea of these countless sublime figure to those who have not tremble and turn pale in this awful temple the immense superiority of michelangelo be manifest in this chapel itself where be painting of ghirlandajo of signorellus which pale near those of the florentine as the light of a lamp do in the light of the sun raphael paint about the same time and under the influence of what he have see in the sistine he admirable sibyl of the pace but compare they he also no doubt attain in some of he work -- the st paul of the cartoon the vision of ezekiel the virgin of the dresden museum -- the summit of sublime art but that which be the exception with sanzio be the rule with the great buonarrotus michelangelo live in a superhuman world and he daring unexpected conception be so beyond and outside the habitual thought of man that they repel by they very elevation and be far from fascinating all mind as do the wonderful and charming creation of the painter of urbino it be necessary however to combat the widespread opinion that michelangelo understand only the extreme feeling and could express these only by violent and exaggerated movement all agree that he figure possess the highest quality of art -- invention sublimity of style breadth and science in the draw appropriateness and fitness of color and this character so striking in the ceiling of the sistine that it be not of the painter that the painting make you think that look at it you say to yourself this tragic heaven must have come thus all people with its gigantic form and it be by a effort of the mind only we be bring to think of the creator of this sublime work but it be deny that he understand grace young and innocent beauty the form which express the tender and delicate feeling those which the divine pencil of raphael so admirably represent i own that he take little heed of the pleasurable aspect of thing he austere genius be at ease only in grave thought but i do not agree that he be always a stranger to gentle beauty to feminine beauty in particular i shall not cite the virgin of the london academy nor in another order the admirable captive of the louvre museum but without quit the sistine could we dream of anything more marvellously beautiful than he adam awake for the first time to light or more chaste more graceful more touching than he young eve lean toward she creator and breathing in through she half-opened lip the divine breath that be give she life what be the meaning of this terrible work what mean this long evolution of human destiny why do these two being that we see beautiful and happy in the begin why do they people the earth with this ardent restless at once gigantic and powerless race ah greece would have make this ceiling a olympus inhabit by happy and divine man michelangelo put there great unhappy being and this painful poem of humanity be truer than the wondrous fiction of ancient poetry and art michelangelo say condivus especially admire dante he also devote himself earnestly to the reading of the scripture and the writings of savonarolum for whom he have always great affection have preserve in he mind the memory of he powerful voice besides the country of the great florentine the glorious italy of the renaissance be in a state of dissolution such study such reminiscence such and so sad reality may explain the vision that pass through the mind of the great artist during the four year of almost complete solitude he pass in the sistine the precise meaning of these composition will probably never be know but so long as man exist they will as be the object of art attract mind toward the dim world of the ideal the year that follow the opening of the sistine and which precede the death of julius appear as do the first two of leo x 's pontificate to have be the happiest and calmest of michelangelo 's life the old pope love he show he say condivus attention he show no other of those who approach he he honor he probity and even that independence of character of which he himself have more than once have experience michelangelo on he side forgive he he frequent outburst of impetuosity that be ever atone for by prompt and complete acknowledgment michelangelo 's sight greatly enfeebled by this persistent work of four year compel he to take almost absolute repose the necessity he be under say vasarus during this period of work of keep he eye turn upward have so weakened he sight that for several month after he could not look at a drawing nor read a letter without raise it above he head he enjoy a uncontested glory in this interval of semirepose which follow he great effort it be probable that he thought be now concentrate upon the sepulchral monument of he patron the work for which he have be force to postpone but leo x have other view he be all-powerful in florence where by the aid of julius and the league of cambray he have reinstate he family in 1512 he now wish to endow he native city with monument which by recall to the vanquish citizen of this glorious republic the magnificence of they early patron might help they to forget the institution they have lose for the second time the church of san lorenzo build by brunelleschus where several member of he family be bury have not be complete he now determine to have the façade construct several artist among other san gallo the two sanzovino and raphael send in plan for this important work but michelangelo 's be prefer and in 1515 he go to carrara to order the necessary marble leo do not leave he there long in quiet be inform that at serrayezza in the highest part of the mountain of pietra santa on the florentine territory there be marble equal in quality to that of carrara he order michelangelo to go to pietra santa and work these quarry in vain the latter point out the enormous expense of open they of cut road through the mountain and make the marsh passable besides the inferior quality of the marble leo would not listen michelangelo set out make the road raise the marble remain from 1516 to 1521 in this desert and the four year he pass there in the full force of he age and genius result in the transport of five column four of which remain on the seashore and the fifth of which lie still useless and bury among the rubbish of the piazza of san lorenzo without mean to contest the debt which the art owe leo x there be certain reservation that we must make on this score a man of letter of amiable manners astute somewhat of a mischief-maker ever fluctuate between france and the emperor ever on the watch to provide for he family and to redeem these defect have neither heroism nor the undoubted though mistaken love that julius ii bear to italy he political career can not i think be defend he have the merit of be the patron of raphael whose facile flexible character pleased he and who thanks to he protection marked every instant of he short life by some _ chef d'oeuvre _ it must not be forget that it be by the most extravagant largess by make a traffic of everything that he encourage the pleiad of artist who shed such glory upon he name he obstinacy in employ michelangelo for so many year in spite of he reluctance and entreaty on a work which he own fickleness and the war in lombardy ought to have make he abandon have there can be no doubt deprive we of some admirable work but for it michelangelo would have finish the tomb of julius ii and we should now possess a gigantic monument that would no doubt have rival the grandest work of ancient statuary a few word of condivus 's show the grief and discouragement which the capriciousness of leo and the inutility of the work the master be employ on cause michelangelo on he return to florence he find leo 's ardor entirely cool he continue a long time weigh down by grief unable to do anything have hitherto to he great displeasure be drive from one project to another it be however about this period -lrb- 1520 -rrb- that leo order the tomb of he brother giuliano and he nephew lorenzo for the sacristy of the church of san lorenzo which be not execute till ten year later also plan for the library for the reception of the valuable manuscript collect from cosmo and lorenzo the magnificent and which have be disperse during the trouble of 1494 he be at florence when the academy of santa marium novellum of which he be a member propose to have transport from ravenna to florence the ash of dante and address the noble supplication to the pope which have be preserve by gore sign by the most illustrious name of the time and among other that of michelangelo with this addition : i michelangelo sculptor also beseech you holiness and offer myself to execute a suitable monument for the divine poet in some fitting part of the city leo do not receive this project favorably and it be abandon the statue the christ on the cross that have be order by antonio matellus and which be now in the church of santa marium sopra minerva be it be probable execute during michelangelo 's rare visit to rome under leo 's pontificate he discouragement have become such that he have it finish and put up at the end of 1521 by a florentine sculptor of the name of federigo frizzus the statue of christ one of the most finished and display most knowledge that issue from the hand of michelangelo be far to my mind from equal other work of the great sculptor yet it be the rapidly acquire celebrity of the work terminate by federigo frizzus that decide franci i on send primaticio to italy commission he to make a cast of the christ of the minerva and to ask michelangelo to execute a statue for he also to deliver to he the flattering letter preserve in the valuable collection at lille leo x die on December 1 1521 a year after raphael he successor the humble and austere adrian vi know nothing about picture except those of van eyck and albert dürer he simple manners form a striking contrast to the ostentatious habit of leo during he pontificate all the great work be stop at rome and slacken at florence while michelangelo be obscurely work at the library of san lorenzo the great age of art be draw to its close raphael and leonardo be dead and they pupil be already hurry on to a rapid decadence character be begin to decline at the same time that talent do and michelangelo who as it be open this grand era be destine to survive alone like those lofty summit that first receive the morning light and which be still light up while all around have grow obscure and night be already profound balboa discover the pacific ad 1513 manuel josé quintana vasco nuñez de balboa the spanish soldier and discoverer of the pacific ocean be bear in 1475 and die near darien the scene of he principal achievement probably in 1517 unfairly charge with conspiracy after render great service to he country he be behead just as he be complete preparation to explore the south sea as he name the

marry he go by sea to he father-in-law 's territory and take with he some of the king 's indian he move into the territory of the cacique ponca a enemy of careta quintana whose account follow be the favorite historian of this expedition he _ life of celebrated spaniard _ be regard as one of the classic of spanish prose literature ponca not daring to await the come of the ally take refuge in the mountain abandon he land to the ravage and ruin prepared for it by the indian and spaniard balboa however do not pursue he success further at present leave to the future the conquest or as he term it the pacification of the interior he return to the coast where it be more for the advantage security and subsistence of the colony to have he friend or he vassal station careta have for a neighbor a cacique call by some comogre by other panquiaco chief of about ten thousand indian among whom be three thousand warrior have hear of the valor and enterprise of the castilian this chief desire to enter into treaty and friendship with they and a principal indian a dependent of careta have present himself as the agent in this friendly overture vasco nuñez anxious to profit by the opportunity of secure such a ally go with he follower to visit comogre no sooner be the cacique apprise of this visit than he sail forth at the head of he principal vassal and he seven son all still youth and the offspring of different wife to receive the spaniard great be the courtesy and kindness with which he treat he guest who be lodge in different house in the town and provide with victuals in abundance and with man and woman to serve they what chiefly attract they attention be the habitation of comogre which accord to the memorial of the time be a edifice of a hundred and fifty pace in length and fourscore in breadth build on thick post surround by a lofty stone wall and on the roof a attic story of beautifully and skilfully interwoven wood it be divide into several compartment and contain its market its shop and its pantheon for the dead for it be in the corpse of the cacique 's ancestor that the spaniard first behold these ghastly remain dry and arrange as above describe the honor of the hospitality be confide to the eldest son of comogre a youth of more sagacity and intelligence than he brother he one day present to vasco nuñez and to colmenare whom from they manner and appearance he recognize as chief of the party sixty slave and four thousand piece of gold of different weight they immediately melt the gold and have separate a fifth for the king begin to divide it among themselves this division beget a dispute that give occasion to threat and violence which be observe by the indian he suddenly overthrow the scale in which they be weigh the precious metal exclaim : why quarrel for such a trifle if such be you thirst for gold that for its sake you forsake you own country and come to trouble those of stranger i will show you a province where you may gather by the handful the object of you desire but to succeed you ought to be more numerous than you be as you will have to contend with powerful king who will vigorously defend they dominion you will first find a cacique who be very rich in gold who reside at the distance of six sun from hence soon you will behold the sea which lie to that part and he point toward the south there you will meet with people who navigate in bark with sail and oar not much less than you own and who be so rich that they eat and drink from vessel make of the metal which ye so much covet these celebrated word preserve in all the record of the time and repeat by all historian be the first indication the spaniard have of peru they be much excite on hear they and endeavor to extract from the youth further information of the country he have mention he insist on the necessity of have at least a thousand man to give they a chance of success in its subjugation offer to serve they himself as they guide to aid they with he father 's man and to put he life in pledge for the veracity of he word balboa be transport by the prospect of glory and fortune which open before he he believe himself already at the gate of the east indy which be the desire object of the government and the discoverer of that period he resolve to return in the first place to the darien to raise the spirit of he companion with these brilliant hope and to make all possible preparation for realize they he remain nevertheless yet a few day with the cacique and so strict be the friendship he have contract with they that they and they family be baptize careta take in baptism the name of fernando and comogre that of carlo balboa then return to the darien rich in the spoil of ponca rich in the present of he friend and still richer in the golden hope which the future offer he at this time and after a absence of six month arrive the magistrate valdivium with a vessel laden with different store he bring likewise great promise of abundant aid in provision and man the succor however which valdivia bring be speedily consume they seed destroy in the ground by storm and flood promise they no resource whatever and they return to they usual necessitous state balboa then consent to they extend they incursion to more distant land as they have already waste and ruin the immediate environs of antigua and he send valdivium to spain to apprise the admiral of the clew he have gain to the south sea and the report wealth of those region valdivium take with he fifteen thousand piece of gold which belong to the king as he fifth and a charge to petition for the thousand man which be necessary to the expedition and to prevent the adventurer be compel to exterminate the tribe and cacique of the indian for otherwise be so few in number they would be drive to avoid they own destruction to the slaughter of all who would not submit themselves this commission however together with the rich present in gold send by the chief of the darien to they friend and valdivium with all he crew be no doubt swallow by the sea as no trace of they be ever afterward discover to the departure of valdivium succeed immediately the expedition to the gulf and the examination of the land situate at its inner extremity there lay the dominion of dabaibe of whose riches prodigious report be spread especially of a idol and a temple represent to be make entirely of gold there cemaco and the indian who follow he have take refuge and have never lose either the wish or the hope of drive away the invade horde who have usurp they country balboa march against they by land with sixty man and colmenare go by water with as many more to take the enemy by surprise the former do not find cemaco but colmenare be more fortunate for he surprise the savage in tichirus he command the general to be shoot with arrow in he presence and sentence the lord to be hang and so terrify be the indian by this example that they never dare in future elevate they thought to independence it be now deliberate to send new deputy to spain to acquaint the king with the state of the colony and on the road to touch at espanolum to entreat for necessary aid in case valdivium might have perish on the voyage which event have no doubt take place it be say that balboa require this commission for himself either ambitious of gain favor at court or apprehensive that the colony at darien might inflict upon he punishment due to usurpation but he companion would not consent to he quit they allege that in lose he they should feel desert and without a guide or governor he only be respect and follow willingly by the soldier and he only be fear by the indian they suspect that if they permit of he departure he would never return to share those labor and trouble which be from time to time accumulate upon they as have already happen with other they elect juan de caicedo the inspector who have belong to the armament of nicuesa and rodrigo enriquez de colmenare both man of weight and expert in negotiation and hold in general esteem they believe that these would execute they charge satisfactorily and that both would return because caicedo would leave he wife behind he and colmenare have realize much property and a farm in the darien pledge of confidence in and adhesion to the country it be thus impossible for balboa to proceed to spain in protection of he own interest he manoeuvre for gain at least the good grace of the treasurer pasamonte and probably it be on this occasion that he send he the rich present of slave piece of gold and other valuable article of which the licentiate zuazo speak in he letter to the senor de chieve at the same time the new procurator take with they the fifth which belong to the king together with a donative make he by the colony and happier than they predecessor they leave the darien in the end of October and reach spain the end of may in the year follow soon after this departure a slight disturbance happen which though at first it threaten to destroy the authority of vasco nuñez serve in fact to strengthen it under pretence that bartolome hurtado abuse the particular favor of the governor alonzo perez de la rua and other unquiet spirit raise a seditious tumult they object be to seize ten thousand piece which yet remain entire and divide they at they pleasure after some contest in which there be many arrest and a great display of animosity the malcontent plot to surprise vasco nuñez and throw he into prison he know it and quit the town as if go to the chase foresee that when these turbulent man have obtain possession of the authority and the gold they would so abuse the one and the other that all the rational part of the community would be in haste to recall he and thus it be master of the treasure rua and he friend show so little decency in the partition that the principal colonist ashamed and disgusted perceive the immense distance that exist between vasco nuñez and these people seize the head of the sedition secure they and call back balboa whose authority and government they be anxious again to recognize in the interim two vessel laden with provision and carry two hundred man one hundred fifty of whom be soldier command by cristoval serrano arrive from santo domingo they be all send by the admiral and balboa receive from the treasurer pasamonte the title of governor of that land that functionary conceive himself authorize to confer such a power and have become as favorable as he have formerly be the reverse exult in he title and he opportune success and secure of the obedience of he people vasco nuñez liberate he prisoner and resolve to sally forth into the environs and to occupy he man in expedition and discovery but while engage in make he preparation he receive to embitter he satisfaction a letter from he friend zamudio inform he of the indignation which the charge of encisco and the first information of the treasurer have kindle against he at court instead of he service be appreciate he be accuse as a usurper and intruder he be make responsible for the injury and prejudice of which he accuser loudly complain and the founder and pacificator of the darien be to be prosecute for the criminal charge bring against he this alloy however instead of subdue he spirit animated he to new daring and impel he to higher enterprise should he permit another to profit by he toil to discover the south sea and to ravish from he the wealth and glory which be almost within he grasp he do indeed still want the thousand man who be necessary to the project expedition but he enterprise he experience and he constancy impel he to undertake it even without they he would by so signal a service blot out the crime of he primary usurpation and if death should overtake he in the midst of he exertion he should die labor for the prosperity and glory of he country and free from the persecution which threaten he full of these thought and resolve on follow they he discourse with and animated he companion select one hundred ninety of the best armed and disposed and with a thousand indian of labor a few bloodhound and sufficient provision he set sail in a brigantine with ten canoe he ascend first to the port and territory of careta where he be receive with demonstration of regard and welcome suitable to he relation with that cacique and leave he squadron there take he way by the sierra toward the dominion of ponca that chief have flee as at the first time but vasco nuñez who have adopt the policy most convenient to he desire to bring he to a amicable agreement and to that end despatch after he some indian of peace who advise he to return to he capital and to fear nothing from the spaniard he be persuade and meet with a kind reception he present some gold and receive in return some glass bead and other toy and trifle the spanish captain then solicit guide and man of labor for he journey over the sierra which the cacique bestow willingly add provision in great abundance and they part friend he passage into the domain of quarequa be less pacific whose chief torecha jealous of this invasion and terrify by the event which have occur to he neighbor be disposed and prepared to receive the castilian with a warlike aspect a swarm of ferocious indian arm in they usual manner rush into the road and begin a wordy attack upon the stranger ask they what bring they there what they seek for and threaten he with perdition if they advance the spaniard reckless of they bravado proceed nevertheless and then the chief place himself in front of he tribe dress in a cotton mantle and follow by the principal lord and with more intrepidity than fortune give the signal for combat the indian commence the assault with loud cry and great impetuosity but soon terrify by the explosion of the crossbow and musket they be easily destroy or put to flight by the man and bloodhound who rush upon they the chief and six hundred man be leave dead on the spot and the spaniard have smooth away that obstacle enter the town which they spoil of all the gold and valuable it possess here also they find a brother of the cacique and other indian who be dedicate to the abomination before glance at fifty of these wretch be tear to piece by the dog and not without the consent and approbation of the indian the district be by these example render so pacific and so submissive that balboa leave all he sick there dismiss the guide give he by ponca and take fresh one pursue he road over the height the tongue of land which divide the two america be not at its utmost width above eighteen league and in some part become narrow a little more than seven and although from the port of careta to the point toward which the course of the spaniard be direct be only altogether six day ' journey yet they consume upon it twenty nor be this extraordinary the great cordillera of sierra which from north to south cross the new continent a bulwark against the impetuous assault of the pacific ocean cross also the isthmus of darien or as may be more properly say compose it wholly from the wreck of the rocky summit which have be detach from the adjacent land and the discoverer therefore be oblige to open they way through difficulty and danger which man of iron alone could have front and overcome sometimes they have to penetrate through thick entangled wood sometimes to cross lake where man and burden perish miserably then a rugged hill present itself before they and next perhaps a deep and yawning precipice to descend while at every step they be oppose by deep and rapid river passable only by means of frail bark or slight and tremble bridge from time to time they have to make they way through oppose indian who though always conquer be always to be dread and above all come the failure of provision -- which form a aggregate with toil anxiety and danger such as be sufficient to break down bodily strength and depress the mind at length the quarequano who serve as guide show they at a distance the height from whose summit the desire sea might be discover balboa immediately command he squadron to halt and proceed alone to the top of the mountain on reach it he cast a anxious glance southward and the austral ocean break upon he sight -lrb- 1 -rrb- overcome with joy and wonder he fall on he knee extend he arm toward the sea and with tear of delight offer thanks to heaven for have destine he to this mighty discovery he immediately make a sign to he companion to ascend and point to the magnificent spectacle extend before they again prostrate himself in fervent thanksgiving to god the rest follow he example while the astonished indian be extremely puzzle to understand so sudden and general a effusion of wonder and gladness hannibal on the summit of the alp point out to he soldier the delicious plain of italy do not appear accord to the ingenious comparison of a contemporary writer either more transport or more arrogant than the spanish chief when rise from the ground he recover the speech of which sudden joy have deprive he and thus address he castilian : you behold before you friend the object of all we desire and the reward of all we labor before you roll the wave of the sea which have be announce to you and which no doubt enclose the immense riches we have hear of you be the first who have reach these shore and these wave yours be they treasure yours alone the glory of reduce these immense and unknown region to the dominion of we king and to the light of the true religion follow I then faithful as hitherto and i promise you that the world shall not hold you equal in wealth and glory all embrace he joyfully and all promise to follow whithersoever he should lead they quickly cut down a great tree and strip it of its branch form a cross from it which they fix in a heap of stone find on the spot from whence they first descry the sea the name of the monarch of castile be engraven on the trunk of the tree and with shout and acclamation they descend the sierra and enter the plain they arrive at some bohio which form the population of a chief call chiape who have prepare to defend the pass with arm the noise of the musket and the ferocity of the war-dog disperse they in a moment and they flee leave many captive by these and by they quarequano guide the spaniard send to offer chiape secure peace and friendship if he would come to they or otherwise the ruin and extermination of he town and he field persuade by they the cacique come and place himself in the hand of balboa who treat he with much kindness he bring and distribute gold and receive in exchange bead and toy with which he be so divert that he no longer think of anything but content and conciliate the stranger there vasco nuñez send away the quarequano and order that the sick who have be leave in they land should come and join he in the mean while he send francisco pizarro juan de ezcarag and alonzo martin to reconnoitre the environs and to discover the shortest road by which the sea might be reach it be the last of these who arrive first at the coast and enter a canoe which chance to lie there and push it into the wave let it float a little while and after please himself with have be the first spaniard who enter the south sea return to seek balboa balboa with twenty-six man descend to the sea and arrive at the coast early in the evening of the 29th of that month they all seat themselves on the shore and await the tide which be at that time on the ebb at length it return in its violence to cover the spot where they be then balboa in complete armor lift he sword in one hand and in the other a banner on which be paint a image of the virgin mary with the arm of castile at she foot raise it and begin to march into the midst of the wave which reach above he knee say in a loud voice : long live the high and mighty sovereign of castile thus in they
