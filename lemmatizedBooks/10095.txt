mortal -- lift from the crag to which he hang suspend by massy gyve and rivet eye mournful with the presentiment of pain the eagle 's screech clang on the wind as with outstretched neck he stoop

eagle there be none marvelling at he inward and invisible foe he struggle to he foot and find himself contend with a faintness and dizziness heretofore utterly unknown to he he dimly feel himself in the midst of thing grow wonderful by estrangement and distance no grass no flower no leaf have meet he eye for thousand of year nothing but the impenetrable azure the transient cloud sun moon and star the lightning flash the glitter peak of ice and the solitary eagle there seem more wonder in a blade of grass than in all these thing but all be blot in a dizzy swoon and it need he utmost effort to understand that a light sound hard by rapidly grow more distinct be indeed a footfall with a violent effort he steady himself by grasp a tree and have hardly accomplish so much when a tall dark maiden straight as a arrow slim as a antelope wildly beautiful as a dryad but liker a maenad with she aspect of mingled disdain and dismay and step hasty as of one pursue or pursue suddenly check she speed on perceive he who art thou he exclaim god thou speakest greek what else should i speak what else from whom save thee since i close my father 's eye have i hear the tongue of homer and plato who be homer who be plato the maiden regard he with a look of the deepest astonishment surely she say thy gift have be bestow upon thee to little purpose say not at least that thou usest the speech of the god to blaspheme they thou art surely yet a votary of zeus i a votary of zeus exclaim the stranger by these fetter no and weak as he be the forest ring with he disdainful laughter farewell say the maiden as with dilate form and kindling eye she gather up she robe i parley with thee no more thou art tenfold more detestable than the howling mob down yonder intent on rapine and destruction they know no better and can no other but thou apt in speak the sacred tongue yet brutally ignorant of its treasure know the father of the god only to revile he let I pass the stranger if willing to hinder she seem little able he eye close he limb relax and without a cry he sink senseless on the sward in a instant the maiden be kneel by he side hastily undoing a basket she carry on she arm she draw forth a leather flask and support the sunken head with one hand pour a stream of wine through the lip with the other as the gurgle purple course down he throat the sufferer open he eye and thank she silently with a smile of exquisite sweetness remove the large leaf which shaded the contents of the basket she disclose ripe fig and pomegranate honeycomb and snow-white curd lie close to each other in tempting array the stranger take of each alternately and the basket be well-nigh empty ere he appetite seem assuage the observant maiden meanwhile feel she mood strangely alter so have i imaged ulyss to myself she think as she gaze on the stranger 's goodly form full of vigor though not without trace of age the massive brow the kindly mouth the expression of far-seeing wisdom such a man ignorant of letter and a contemner of zeus the stranger 's eloquent thanks rouse she from a reverie the greek tongue fall upon she ear like the sweetest music and she grieve when its flow be interrupt by a question address directly to herself can a god feel hunger and thirst surely no she rejoin i should have say the same yesterday return the stranger wherefore not to-day dear maiden respond he with win voice and manner we must know each other better ere my tale can gain credence with thee do thou rather unfold what thine own speech have leave dark to I why the language of the god as should seem be here understand by thee and I alone what foe zeus have here other than myself what be the profane crowd of which thou didst speak and why alone and defenceless thou ascendest this mountain think of I if thou wilt as one fall from the cloud strange man return the maiden who knowest homer 's speech and not homer 's self who renouncest zeus and resemblest he hear my tale ere i require thine yesterday i should have call myself the last priestess of apollo in this fallen land to-day i have neither shrine nor altar move by i know not what madness my countryman have long ago forsake the worship of the god the temple crumble into ruin prayer be no longer offer or sacrifice make as of old the priestly revenue be plunder the sacred vessel carry away the voice of oracle become dumb the divine tongue of greece be forget its scroll of wisdom mouldered unread and the deluded people turn to human mechanic and fisherman one faithful servant of apollo remain my father but ` tis seven day since he close he eye for ever it be time for yesternoon the herald proclaim by order of the king that zeus and the olympian should be name no more in caucasium ha interrupt the stranger i see it all say i not so he shout gaze into the sky as if he eye could pierce and he voice reach beyond the drift cloud but to thy own tale he add turn with a gesture of command to the astonished elenko it be soon tell she say i know that it be death to serve the god any more yet none the less in my little temple do fire burn upon apollo 's altar this morning scarcely be it kindle ere i become aware of a ruffianly mob throng to sack and spoil i be ready for death but not at they hand i catch up this basket and escape up the mountain on its inaccessible summit it be report hang prometheus whom zeus -lrb- let I bow in awe before he inscrutable counsel -rrb- doom for he benevolence to mankind to he as aeschylus sing io of old find she way and from he receive monition and knowledge of what should come to pass i will try if courage and some favor god will guide I to he if not i will die as near heaven as i may attain tell I on thy part what thou wilt and let I depart if thou art indeed zeus 's enemy thou wilt find enough on thy side down yonder i have be zeus 's enemy return the stranger mildly and gravely i be so no longer immortal hate befit not the mortal i feel myself to have become nor needest thou ascend the peak further maiden i be prometheus ii it be a prerogative of the god that when they do speak sooth mortal must need believe they elenko hence feel no incredulity at the revelation of prometheus or seek other confirmation than the bond and break link of chain at he wrist and ankle now he cry or rather shout be the prophecy fulfil with which of old i admonish the god in the hall of olympus i tell they that zeus should beget a child mightier than himself who should send he and they the way he have send he father i know not that this child be already beget and that he name be man it have take man age to assert himself nor have he yet as it would seem do more than enthrone a new idol in the place of the old but for the old behold the last trace of its authority in these fetter of which the first smith will rid I expect no thunderbolt dear maiden none will come : nor shall i regain the immortality of which i feel myself bereave since yesterday be this no sorrow to thee asked elenko have not my immortality be one of pain answer prometheus now i feel no pain and dread one only and that be the pain of miss a certain fellow-mortal answer prometheus with a look so expressive that the hitherto unawed maiden cast she eye to the ground hasten away from the conversation to which nevertheless she inly purpose to return be man then the maker of deity she ask can the source of he be originate in himself ask prometheus to assert this be self-contradiction and pride inflate to madness but of the more exalted being who have like he emanate from the common principle of all existence man since he advent on the earth though not the creator be the preserver or the destroyer he look up to they and they be he out-grow they and they be not for the barbarian and triballian god there be no return but the olympian if dead as deity survive as impersonation of man 's highest conception of the beautiful languid and spectral indeed must be they existence in this barbarian age but better day be in store for they and for thee prometheus there be now no place reply he for a impeacher of the god my cause be win my part be play i be reward for my love of man by myself become human when i shall have prove myself also mortal i may haply traverse realm which zeus never know with i would hope elenko by my side elenko 's countenance express she full readiness to accompany prometheus as far beyond the limit of the phenomenal world as he might please to conduct she a think soon trouble she delicious reverie and she inquire : peradventure then the creed which i have execrate may be truer and better than that which i have profess if bear in wiser brain and truer heart aye answer prometheus but of this i can have no knowledge it seem from thy tale to have begin but ill yet saturn mutilate he father and he reign be the golden age while converse hand lock in hand they have be stroll aimlessly down the mountain turn a abrupt bend in the path they suddenly find themselves in presence of a assembly of early christian these confessor be make the most of elenko 's dilapidated temple whose smoking shell throw up a sable column in the background the effigy of apollo and the muse have be drag forth and be be diligently break up with mallet and hammer other of the sacrilegious throng be rend scroll or divide vestment or firing the grove of laurel that environ the shrine or pelt the affrighted bird as they fly forth the sacred vessel however at least those of gold and silver appear safe in the guardianship of a episcopal personage of shrewd and jovial aspect under whose inspection they be be pile up by a troop of sturdy young ecclesiastic the only weapon-bearer among the rabble elenko stand rivet to the ground prometheus to she amazement rush forward to one of the group with a loud by all the god and goddess follow he movement she see that the object of he interest be a enormous dead eagle carry by one of the mob the multitude startle by he cry and he emotion gaze eagerly at the stranger and instantly a shout go up : the heathen woman with a heathen man and club begin to be brandish and stone to be pick up from the ground prometheus to whom the shout be unintelligible look wistfully at elenko as they eye meet elenko 's countenance which have hitherto be all disdain and defiance assume a expression of irresolution a stone strike prometheus on the temple draw blood a hundred hand go up each weight with a missile do as i cry elenko to he and cross herself prometheus imitate she not unsuccessfully for a novice the uplifted arm be stay some even sink down by this time the bishop have bustle to the front and address a torrent of question to prometheus who merely shake he head and turn to inspect the eagle brethren say the bishop i smell a miracle and turn to elenko he rapidly proceed to cross-examine she thou be the priestess of this temple i be thou didst leave it this morning a heathen i do thou returnest a christian elenko blush fire she throat swell she heart beat violently all she soul seem concentrate in the gaze she fasten on the pale and bleeding prometheus she remain silent -- but she cross herself who then have persuade thee to renounce apollo elenko point to prometheus a enemy of zeus then zeus have not such another enemy in the world i know it i be sure of it exclaim the bishop i can always tell a christian when i see he wherefore speak he not he be ancient for all he vigorous mien he martyrdom begin ere we present speech be nor could he learn this in he captivity martyrdom captivity exclaim the prelate gleefully i think we be come thither a early martyr doubtless a very early martyr fetter and manacle behold he wrist and ankle tortured of course incredibly miraculously keep alive to this day in a entirely supernatural manner now say the bishop i would wager my mitre and ring that he life be prolong by the daily ministration of yonder fowl that he caress with such singular affection never reply elenko for one day do that most punctual bird omit to visit he hurrah shout the bishop and now its mission accomplish the bless creature as i be inform be find dead at the foot of the mountain saint and angel this be glorious on you knee ye infidel and down they all go the bishop set the example as they head be bow to the earth elenko make a sign to prometheus and when the multitude look up it behold he in the act of impart the episcopal blessing tell he that we be all he brethren say the bishop which announcement become in elenko 's mouth do as i do and cleave to thy eagle a procession be form the new saint he convert and the eagle ride in a car at the head of it the bishop surround by he bodyguard follow with the sacred vessel of apollo to which he have never cease to direct a vigilant eye throughout the whole proceedings the multitude swarm along singing hymn or contend for the stray feather of the eagle the representative of seven monastery put in they claim for the link of prometheus 's fetter but the bishop scout they all he find time to whisper to elenko : you seem a sensible young person just hint to we friend that we do not want to hear anything about he theology and the less he talk about the primitive church the better no doubt he be a most intelligent man but he can not possibly be up to all the recent improvement elenko promise most fervently that prometheus ' theological sentiment should remain a mystery to the public she then begin to reflect very seriously on the subject of she own moral this day she say to herself i have renounce all the god and tell lie enough to last I my life and for no other reason than that i be in love if this be a sufficient reason lover must have a different code of morality from the rest of the world and indeed it would appear that they have will you die for I yes admirable will you lie for I no then you do not love I -lrb- greek : ball ' eis korakas eis tainaron eis ` ogg kogg -rrb- iii elenko soon find that there be no pause upon the path to which she have commit herself as the sole medium of communication between prometheus and the religious public she time be half spend in instruct prometheus in the creed in which he be suppose to have instruct she and half in frame the edifying sentence which pass for the interpretation of discourse for the most part far more interesting to herself than if they have be what they profess to be the rapt and impassioned attention which she be observe to bestow on he utterance on such occasion all but gain she the reputation of a saint and be accept as a sufficient set-off against the unhallowed affection which she could not help manifest for the memory of she father the judicious reluctance of the caucasian ecclesiastic to inquire over-anxiously into the creed and custom of the primitive church be a great help to she and another difficulty be remove by the bishop who have no idea of encourage a rival thaumaturgist take a early opportunity of signify that it be rather in the line of desmote -lrb- for by this name the new saint pass -rrb- to be the subject than the instrument of miracle and that at all event no more be to be look for from he at he time of life the warmth with which elenko espouse this view raise she greatly in he good opinion and he be always ready to come to she aid when she become entangled in chronological or historical difficulty or seasoned she version of desmote ' speech with reminiscence of plato or marcus aurelius or when she invention fail altogether on such occasion if objector grow troublesome the bishop would thunder brethren i smell a heresy and no more be say one minor trouble both to prometheus and elenko be the affection they be naturally expect to manifest towards the carcase of the wretched eagle which many identify with the eagle of the evangelist john prometheus be of a forgiving disposition but elenko wish nothing more ardently than that the whole aquiline race might have but one neck and that she might wring it it somewhat comfort she to observe that the eagle 's plumage be grow thin while the eagle 's custodian be grow fat but she have worse trouble to endure than any that eagle could occasion the youth of those who resort to she and prometheus attract remark from the graver member of the community young lady find the precept of the handsome and dignified saint indispensable to they spiritual health young man be charm with they purity as they come filter through the lip of elenko be man more conceited than woman or more confide elenko should certainly have be at ease no temptress however enterprising could well be spread she net for a antony three hundred year old prometheus on the contrary might have find cause for jealousy in many a noble youth 's unconcealed admiration of elenko yet he seem magnificently unconscious of any cause for apprehension while elenko 's heart swell till it be like to burst she have the further satisfaction of know herself the best hate woman in caucasium between the enmity of those of whose admirer she have make a involuntary conquest and of those who find she standing between they and prometheus she monopoly of greek she feel sure be she only security two constant attendant at prometheus 's reception particularly alarm she the princess miriam niece of the bishop a handsome widow accustom to have thing as she wish they and a tall veil woman who seem unknown to all but whose unseen eye she instinctively know be never avert from the unconscious prometheus it be therefore with some trepidation that she receive a summons to the private apartment of the princess miriam dear friend the princess begin thou knowest the singular affection which i have invariably entertain for thee right well do i know it respond elenko -lrb- the thirty-first lie to-day she add wearily to herself -rrb- it be this affection dear friend continue the princess which induce I on the present occasion to transgress the limit of conventional propriety and make a communication distressing to thee but infinitely more so to myself elenko implore the princess to make no such sacrifice in the cause of friendship but the great lady be resolute people say she continue -- what say they that thy relation to desmote be indiscreet that it be equivocal that it be offensive that it be sacrilegious that in a word it be improper elenko defend herself with as much energy as she candor would allow dear friend say the princess thou dost not imagine that i have part or lot in these odious imputation even could i deem they true should i not think charitably of thee but yesterday a heathen and educate in impiety by a foul sorcerer my poor lamb but tongue must be stop and i have now to advise thee how this may be accomplish say on people will always talk so long as thou art the sole medium of communication with the holy man some deem he less ignorant of we speech than he seem but concern this i inquire not : for in society what seem be enough that thy colloquy expose thee to scandal there be but one remedy thou must yield thy place to another it be meet that thou forthwith instruct in that barbarous dialect some matron of unblemished repute and devout aspiration no mere ignorant devotee however but a woman of the world whose prudence and experience may preserve the holy man from the pitfall set for he by the unprincipled manifestly she must be a marry person else nought be gain yet must she not be chargeable with forsake she duty towards she husband and child it follow that she must be a widow it be also well that she should be of kin to some influential personage to whose counsel she might have recourse in time of difficulty and whose authority might protect she against the slanderous and evil disposed i have not be able to meet any one endowed with all these qualification except myself i therefore propose to thee that thou shouldst instruct I in the speech of desmote and when i be qualify to take thy place my uncle shall elevate thee to the dignity of abbess or bestow thee upon some young clergyman of extraordinary desert elenko intimate perhaps with more warmth than necessary she aversion to both proposition and the extreme improbability of the princess ever acquire any knowledge of greek by she instrumentality if this be the case say the princess with perfect calmness i must have recourse to my other method which be infallible elenko inquire what it might be i shall represent to my uncle what indeed he very well know that a saint be properly speak of no value till he be dead not until he decease be he relic available or pilgrimage to he shrine feasible it be solely in anticipation of this event that my uncle be keep desmote at all and the sooner it come to pass the sooner will my revered relative come by he own only think of the capital lock up in the new church now so nearly complete on the spot where they pick up the eagle how shall it be dedicate to desmote in desmote ' lifetime be it not a most blissful and appropriate coincidence if the day of the consecration be that of the saint 's migration to a better world i shall submit this view of the case to my uncle : he be accustom to hear reason from I of whom between ourselves he be not a little afraid thou mayest rely upon it that about the time of the consecration desmote will ascend to heaven while thou it be gravely to be fear wilt proceed in the opposite direction would ` st thou avert this unpleasantness think well of my first proposal i give thee credit for loving desmote and suppose therefore that thou wilt make some sacrifice for he sake i be a kettle thou art a pot take heed how thou knockest against I elenko speed back to bear tiding of the threaten collision to prometheus as she approach he chamber she hear with astonishment two voice in eager conversation and discover with still greater amazement that they dialogue be carry on in greek the second speaker moreover be evidently a female a jealous pang shoot through elenko 's breast she look cautiously in and discern the same mysterious veil woman whose demeanor have already be a enigma to she but the veil be throw back and the countenance go far to allay elenko 's disquiet it bear indeed trace of past beauty but be altogether that of one who have know better day worn and fade weary and repining elenko 's jealousy vanish though she surprise redouble when she hear prometheus address the stranger as sister a pretty brother i have get rejoin the lady in high sharp tone : to leave I in want never once to inquire after I nay sister or sister-in-law respond prometheus if it come to that where be you while i be on caucasus the oceanide minister to I herme come now and then even hercule leave a card but i never see pandora how could i compromise epimetheus prometheus demand pandora besides my attendant hope be always tell I that all would come right without any meddling of mine let she tell you so now retort prometheus tell I now do you pretend not to know that the hussey forsook olympus ten year ago and have turn christian i be sure i be very sorry to hear it somehow she never forsake _ I _ i can not imagine how you god get on without she get on we be get off except ero and plutus who seem as usual and the old fate who go on spin as if nothing have happen none of we expect to last for another ten year the sacrifice have dwindle down to nothing zeus have put down he eagle hera have eat she peacock apollo 's lyre be never hear -- pawn no doubt bacchus drink water and venus -- well you can imagine how she get on without he and cere and here you be sleek and comfortable and never troubling yourself about you family but you have better or i swear i will tell zeus and we shall see whether these christian will keep you with you ante-chamber full of starve god take a day to think of what i have be say and away she flounce not notice elenko long and earnestly do the pair discuss the peril that menace they and at the end of they deliberation elenko seek the bishop and briefly impart the princess miriam 's ultimatum it be painful to a spiritual man reply the prelate to be accessory to a murder it be also repugnant to he feeling to deny a beloved niece anything on which she have set she heart to avoid such grievous dilemma i judge it well that ye both ascend to heaven without further ceremony that night the ascent of prometheus and elenko be witness by diver credible person the new church be consecrate shortly afterwards it be amply store with relic from the wardrobe of prometheus and what remain of the eagle the damsel of the capital regain they admirer and those who have become enamoured of prometheus mostly transfer they affection to the bishop everybody be satisfied except the princess miriam who never cease to deplore she indulgence in give elenko the chance of first speech with she uncle if i have be five minute beforehand with the minx she say iv the heaven to which prometheus and elenko have ascend be situate in a sequestered valley of laconium a single wind path lead into the glen which be inhabit only by a few hunter and shepherd who still observe the rite of the ancient faith and sometimes deem but to show kindness to a mortal refreshed or sheltered a forlorn and hungry deity saving at the entrance the vale be walled round by steep cliff for the most part wave with tree but here and there reveal the naked crag it be traverse by a silvery stream in its winding enclose prometheus 's and elenko 's cottage almost as in a island the cot bury in laurel and myrtle have a garden where fig and mulberry grape and almond ripen in they season a few goat browse on the long grass and yield they milk to the household bread and wine and flesh when need be easily procure from the neighbor beyond necessary furniture the cottage contain little but precious scroll obtain by elenko from athen and the newly found city of constantine in these under she guidance prometheus read of matter that never while he dwell on olympus enter the imagination of any god it be a chief happiness of lover that each possess treasure wholly they own which they may yet make fully the possession of the other these treasure be of diver kind beauty affection memory hope but never be such treasure of knowledge share between lover as between prometheus and elenko each possess immeasurable store hitherto inaccessible to the other how trifling seem the mythical lore which elenko have glean as the minister of phoebus to that now impart by prometheus the titan have see all and be a part of all that he have see he have bow beneath the sceptre of uranus he have witness he fall and mark the ocean crimson with he blood he remember hoary saturn a brisk active deity push he way to the throne of heaven and devour in a trice the stone that now resist he fang for millennium he have hear the shield of the corybante clash around the infant zeus he describe to elenko how one day the sea have froth and boil and undraped aphrodite have ascend from it in the presence of the gaze and applaud amphitheatre of cloud-cushioned god he could depict the personal appearance of cybele and sketch the character of enceladus he have instruct zeus as chiron have instruct achille he remember poseidon afraid of the water and pluto of the dark he call to mind and expound ancient oracle heretofore unintelligible : he have himself be tell and have disbelieve that the happiest day of he own life would be that on which he should feel himself divest of immortality of the younger god and they doings he know but little he inquire with interest whether bacchus have return in safety from he indian expedition and whether proserpine have a family of divine imp much more nevertheless have elenko to teach prometheus than she could learn from he how trivial seem the history of the god to what he now hear of the history of man be these indeed the being he have know like ant in the sunless recess of cave dwelling deep-burrowing in the earth ignorant of the sign of the season to whom he have give fire and whom he have teach memory and number for whom he have bring the horse under the chariot and invent the sea-beaten flaxen-winged chariot of the sailor and now how poorly show the god beside this once wretched brood what deity could die for olympus as leonida have for greece which of they could like iphigenia dwell for year beside the melancholy sea keep a true heart for a absent brother which of they could raise he fellow nearer to the source of all deity as socrate and plato have raise man who could portray himself as phidia have portray athene could the muse speak with they own voice as they have speak by sappho 's he be especially pleased to see he own moral superiority to zeus so eloquently enforce by æschylus and delighted in criticise the sentiment which the other poet have put into the mouth of the god homer he think must have be in olympus often and aristophane not seldom when he read in the cyclops of euripides stranger i laugh to scorn zeus 's thunderbolt he grow for a moment thoughtful be i he question end where polyphemus begin but when he read a little further on : the wise man 's only jupiter be this to eat and drink during he little day and give himself no care -- no he say the zeus that nail I to the rock be better than this zeus but well for man to be rid of both if he do not put another in they place or in drop he idolatry have not fling away he religion heaven have not depart with zeus and take he lyre he sing : what flood of lavish splendor the lofty sun doth pour what else can heaven render what room have she for more yet shall he course be shortly do and after he decline the sky that hold a single sun with thousand shall be shine v it be not long ere the god begin to find they way to prometheus 's earthly paradise and who come once come again the first be epimetheus who have probably suffer least of all from the general upset have in truth little to lose since he ill-starred union with pandora he have indeed reason for thankfulness in he practical divorce from he spouse who have settle in caucasium and give greek lesson to the princess miriam would prometheus lend he half a talent a quarter a tenth a hundredth thanks thanks prometheus might rely upon it that he residence should not be divulge on any account notwithstanding which assurance the cottage be visit next day by eleven god and demigod mostly titan elenko find it try and be really alarm when by and by the fury have make over they function to the devil stroll up to take the air and drop in for a chat bring cerberus but they behave exceedingly well and take back a message from elenko to eurydice ere long she be on most intimate term with all the dethrone divinity celestial infernal and marine beautiful and bless beyond most thing be youthful enthusiasm look up to something it feel or deem above itself beautiful too as autumn sunshine be maturity look down with gentleness on the ideal it have surpass and reverence it still for old idea and association the thought of behold a deity would once have thrill elenko with rapture if this have not be check by awe at she own presumption the idea that a deity other than some disgraced offender like prometheus could be the object of she compassion would never have enter she mind and now she pity the whole olympian cohort most sincerely not so much for have fall as for have deserve to fall she could not conceal from herself how grievously they be one and all behind the age it be impossible to make zeus comprehend how a idea could be a match for a thunderbolt apollo speak handsomely of homer yet evidently esteem the iliad and odyssey but lightly in comparison with the blind bard 's hymn to himself cere candidly admit that she mind be a complete blank on the subject of the eleusinian mystery aphrodite 's dress be admirable for summer but in winter seem obstinate conservatism and why should pallas make herself a fright with she gorgon helmet now that it no longer frightened anybody where elenko would fain have adore she find herself tolerate excuse condescend how many elenko be even now tenderly nurse ancient creed whose main virtue be the virtue of they professor one autumn night all the principal god be assemble under prometheus 's roof do justice to the fig and mulberry and wine cool with taygetan snow the guest be more than usually despondent prometheus be moody and abstracted he breast seem labor with think so look my pythoness whisper apollo to he neighbor when about to deliver a oracle and the oracle come -- in lyric verse not to infringe any patent of apollo 's -- when o'er the tower of constantine a orient moon begin to shine wane nor wax aught and bright in daytide as in deep of night : then though the fane be bring to wreck the god shall find enthrone in human think a temple in the mind and what become of we while this prodigious moonshine be concoct demand zeus who have become the most sceptical of any of the god go to elysium suggest prometheus there be a idea cry zeus and palla together to elysium to elysium exclaim the other god and all rise tumultuously save two i go not say ero for where love be there be elysium and yonder rise moon tell I that my hour be come and he flit forth neither go i say a old blind god for where plutus be elysium be not moreover mankind would follow after I but i too must away strange that i should have abode so long under the roof of a pair of perfect virtue and he totter out but the other god sweep forth into the moonlight and be see no more and prometheus pick up the forsake sandal of herme and bind they on he own foot and grasp elenko and they rise up by a dizzy flight to empty heaven all be silent in those immense court vacant of everything save here and there some rusty thunderbolt or moulder crumb of ambrosia above around below beyond sight beyond think stretch the still deep of æther blaze with innumerable world eye could reeve nowhither without behold a star nor could star be behold from which the god ' hall with all its vastness would not have be utterly invisible elenko lean over the battlements and watch the racing meteor prometheus stand by she and point out in the immeasurable distance the little speck of shine dust from which they have fly there or here he ask there say elenko the potion of lao-tsze and there the body lay age after age mute breathing beat warm and undecay like one asleep in a green hermitage with gentle sleep about its eyelid play and live in its dream beyond the rage of death or life while they be still array in livery ever new the rapid blind and fleeting generation of mankind in the day of the tang dynasty china be long happy under the sceptre of a good emperor name sin-woo he have overcome the enemy of the land confirm the friendship of its ally augment the wealth of the rich and mitigate the wretchedness of the poor but most especially be he admire and beloved for he persecution of the impious sect of lao-tsze which he have well-nigh exterminate it be but natural that such a emperor should congratulate himself upon he goodness and worth yet as no human bliss be perfect sorrow could not fail to enter he mind it be grievous to reflect say he to he courtier that if as ye all affirm there have not be any emperor of equal merit with myself before my time neither will any such arise after I my subject must inevitably be sufferer by my death to which the courtier unanimously respond o emperor live for ever happy thought exclaim the emperor but wherewithal shall it be execute the prime minister look at the chancellor the chancellor look at the treasurer the treasurer look at the chamberlain the chamberlain look at the principal bonze the principal bonze look at the second bonze who to he great surprise look at he in return when the turn come to I murmur the inferior functionary i would say somewhat speak command the emperor o uncle of the star say the bonze there be those in you majesty 's dominion who possess the power of lengthen life who have in fact discover the elixir of immortality let they be immediately bring hither command the emperor unhappily return the bonze these person without exception belong to the abominable sect of lao-tsze whose member you majesty long ago command to cease from existence with which August order they have for the most part comply in my own diocese where for some year after you majesty 's happy accession we be accustom to impale twenty thousand annually it be now difficult to find twenty with the utmost diligence on the part of the executioner it have of late sometimes appear to I say the emperor that there may be more good in that sect than i have be lead to believe by my counsellor i have always think say the prime minister that they be rather misguided than wilfully wicked they be a kind of harmless lunatic say the chancellor they should i think be make ward in chancery they money do not appear different from other man 's say the treasurer i say the chamberlain have know a old woman who have know another old woman who belong to this sect and who assure she that she have be very good when she be a little girl if say the emperor it appear that he grace the principal bonze have in any respect mislead we he property will necessarily be confiscate to the imperial treasury and the second bonze will succeed to he office it be needful however to ascertain before all thing whether this sect do really possess the elixir of immortality for on that the entire question of its desert obviously depend we counsellor the second bonze have next to myself the greatest interest in the matter i desire he to make due inquiry and report to we at the next council when i shall be prepare to state what fine will be impose upon he should he not have succeed that night all the member of the lao-tsze sect inhabit prison under the jurisdiction of the principal bonze be decapitate and the pb lay he own head upon he pillow with some approach to peace of mind trust that the knowledge of the elixir of immortality have perish with they the second bonze have a different object to attain proceed in a different manner he send for he captive and discourse to they touch the evil art of unprincipled courtier and the facility with which they mislead even the best intentioned prince for year have he the second bonze plead the cause of toleration at court and have at length succeed in enlighten he majesty to such a extent that there be every prospect of a edict of indulgence be shortly promulgate provide always that the elixir of life be previously forthcoming the unfortunate heretic would have be only too thankful to prolong the emperor 's life indefinitely in consideration of secure peace for they own but they could only inform the bonze of the general tradition of they sect this be that the knowledge of lao-tsze 's secret be confine to certain adept most of whom be plunge into so deep a trance that any communication with they be impossible for the administration of the miraculous draught it appear be attend with this inconvenience that it throw the partaker into a deep sleep last any time between ten year and eternity accord to the depth of he potation during its continuance the ordinary operation of nature be suspend and the patient awake with precisely the same bodily constitution old or young as he have possess on fall into he lethargy and though still liable to wound and accident he or she continue to enjoy undiminished health and vigor for a period equal to the duration of the trance after which he sink back into the rank of mortality unless he could repeat the potion all the adept who have come to life under he present majesty 's most clement reign have immediately emigrate : the only person therefore capable of give information be now bury in slumber and of course would only speak when they should awake they be mostly conceal in the recess of cavern those inhabit by wild beast be usually prefer for the sake of better security as no tiger or bear would harm a follower of lao-tsze the witness therefore advise the bonze to ascertain the residence of the most ferocious tiger in he diocese and to wait upon they personally in the hope of thus discover what he seek this suggestion be exceedingly unpalatable to the bonze who feel almost equally unwilling to venture himself into a wild beast 's den or to give any other person the chance of make the discovery while he hesitate in unspeakable perplexity he be inform that a old man about to expire at the age of a hundred and twenty year desire to have speech with he think so venerable a personage likely to have at least a glimmering of the great secret the bonze hurry to he bedside we master lao-tsze begin the old man forbid we to leave this world with anything undisclosed which may contribute to the advantage of we fellow-creature whether he deem the knowledge of the cup of immortality conducive to this end i can not say but the question doth not arise for i do not possess it hear my tale nevertheless ninety year ago be a hunter it be my hap to fall into the jaw of a enormous tiger who bear I off to he cavern i there find myself in the presence of two lady one youthful and of surpass loveliness the other haggard and wrinkle the younger lady expostulate with the tiger and he forthwith release I my gratitude win the woman 's confidence and i learn that they be disciple of lao-tsze who have repair to the cavern to partake of the miraculous draught which they be just about to do they be it appear mother and daughter and i distinctly remember that the composition of the beverage be know to the daughter only this impressed I for i should naturally have expect the contrary the tiger escort I home i forswore hunting and become and have secretly continue a disciple of lao-tsze i will now indicate the position of the cavern to thee : whether the lady will still be find in it be beyond my power to say and have point out the direction of the cavern he expire the thing have to be do the bonze dress himself up as much like a votary of lao-tsze as possible provide himself with a body-guard of _ bona fide _ disciple and accompany by a small army of huntsman and warrior as well march in quest of the den of the tiger it be discover about nightfall and have tethered a small boy near the entrance that he scream when be devour might give notice of the tiger 's issue from or return to he habitation the bonze and he myrmidon take up a flank position and await the dawn the distant howl of roam beast of prey entirely deprive the holy man of he rest but nothing worse befall he and when in the morning the small boy instead of provide the tiger with a breakfast be hear cry for he own the besieger muster up courage to enter the cavern the glare of they torch reveal no tiger : but to the bonze 's inexpressible delight two female lay on the floor of the cave correspond in all respects to the description of the old man they costume be that of the preceding century one be wrinkled and hoary the inexpressible loveliness of the other who might have see seventeen or eighteen summer extort a universal cry of admiration follow by a hush of enraptured silence warm flexible fresh in color breathing naturally as in slumber the figure lay the younger woman 's arm underneath the elder woman 's neck and she chin nestle on the other 's shoulder the countenance of each seem to indicate happy dream can this indeed be but a trance simultaneously question several of the bonze 's follower _ fiat experimentum in corpore vili _ exclaim the bonze and he thrust he long hunting spear into the elder woman 's bosom blood pour forth freely but there be no change in the expression of the countenance no struggle announce dissolution not until the body grow chill and the limb stiff could they be sure the old woman be indeed dead carry the young woman like porcelain order the priest and like the most fragile porcelain the exquisite young beauty be bear from the cavern smile in she trance and utterly unconscious while the corpse of she aged companion be abandon to the hyænas so often do the bearer pause to look on she beauty that it be find necessary to drape the countenance entirely until reach the closed sedan in which vigilantly watch by the bonze she be transport to the imperial palace and so she be bring to the emperor and he worship she she be lay on a couch of cloth of gold in the imperial apartment wonderful be the contrast between she youthful beauty so still in its repose and the old haggard emperor fever with the lust of beauty and love of life o majesty say he wisest counsellor be there any sect in thy dominion that possess the secret of perpetual youth and the emperor make proclamation but no such sect could be find and he mourn exceedingly and cause strong perfume to be burn around the sleeper and conch to be blow and gong beat in she ear hope that she would awake ere he be dead or wholly decrepit but she stir not and he shut himself up with she and pass he time pray to fo for she awakening but one day the door of the chamber be beat down and he old wife come in passionately upbraid he sin-woo she cry thou hast not the heart of a man thou wouldest be deathless leave I to die i shall be lay in the grave and thou wilt reign with another wherefore have i be true to thee if not that we ash might mingle at the last thou hoary sensualist su-ti say the emperor with feeling thou dost grievously misjudge I i be no heartless sensualist no butterfly sipper at the lip of beauty be not my soul entirely possess by this divine creature whom i love with a affection infinitely exceed that which i have entertain for thee at any period and how knowest thou add he strive to soothe she that i will not give thee to drink of the miraculous potion and keep my gray hair and wrinkle through all time nay sin-woo i be no fool like thee and be i so i be not in love with any youth and know i not that even if i would accept the boon thou would ` st never give it and she rush away in fury and hang herself by she imperial girdle whereupon all the other wife and concubine of the emperor do likewise as custom and reason prescribe all the palace be fill with lamentation and funeral but the emperor lament not nor turn he gaze from the sleeper nor do the sleeper awaken and he son come to he angry with exceed wrath thou hast murder my mother thou would ` st rob I of the crown that be rightfully mine i bear to be a emperor shall die a subject nay but i will save thee from thyself i will pierce thy leman with the sword or burn she with fire and the emperor fear he would do as he threaten command he to be slay as also he brother and sister and he pay no heed to the affair of state but give all into the hand of the second now the principal bonze and the law cease to be observe and rebellion break out in the province and enemy invade the country and there be famine in the land and now the emperor be well-nigh ten year nearer to the gate of death than when the sleep beauty have be bring to he court the love of beauty be nearly quench in he but the longing for life grow more intense he become angry with the sleeper that she awaken not and with he little remaining strength smite she fiercely on the cheek but she give no sign of revive remember that if he gain the potion of immortality he would himself be plunge into a trance he make all preparation for the interregnum he decree that he be to be seat erect on he throne with all he imperial insignia and it be to be death to any one who should presume to remove any of they he slumbering figure be to preside at all council and to be consult in every act of state and all minister and officer be to do homage daily the revive sleep beauty be to partake of the draught anew at the same time and in the same manner as himself that she might awake with he and that he might find she charm unimpaired all the minister swear solemnly to observe these regulation firmly purpose to burn the sleeper if sleep he ever do at the very first opportunity and scatter he ash to the wind then they would fight for the empire among themselves each meanwhile be mainly occupy in strive to gain the rebel over to he interest insomuch that the people grow more miserable day by day and as the aged emperor wax more and more feeble he begin to see vision legion of little black imp surround he cry we be thy sin and would be punish -- would ` st thou by live for ever deprive we of we due and fair female form come veil with droop head and murmur we be thy virtue and would be reward -- would ` st thou cheat we and other figure come dark but lovely and whisper we be thy dead friend who have long wait for thee -- would ` st thou take to thyself new friend and forget we and other say we be thy memory -- wilt thou live on till we be all wither in thy heart and other say we be thy strength and thy beauty thy memory and thy wit -- canst thou live know thou wilt never see we more and at last come two warder officer of the king of death and one of they be laugh and the other ask why he laugh and he reply : i laugh at the emperor who think to escape we master not know that the moment of he decease be engrave with a pen of iron upon a rock of adamant a million million year or ever this world be and when come it ask the other in ten minute say the first when the emperor hear this he be wild with terror and totter to the couch on which the sleep beauty lay oh awake he cry awake and save I ere it be too late and oh wonder the sleeper stir and open she eye if she have be so beautiful while sleep what be she when awake but the love of life have overcome the love of beauty in the emperor 's bosom and he see not the eye like star and the bloom as of peach and lily or the aspect grand and smile as daybreak he could only cry give I the potion lest i die give I the potion that can not i she say the secret be know only to my daughter who be thy daughter the hoary woman she who sleep with I in the cavern that aged crone thy daughter daughter to thee so youthful and so fresh even so she say i bear she at sixteen and slumber for seventy year when i awake she be wither and decrepit : i youthful as when i close my eye but she have learn the secret which i never know the bonze shall be crucify yell the emperor it be too late say she he be tear in piece already by whom by the multitude that be now come to do the like unto thee and as she speak the door be burst open and in rush the people head by the most pious bonze in the empire -lrb- after the late principal bonze -rrb- who plunge a sword into the emperor 's breast exclaiming : he who despise this life in comparison with another deserve to lose the life which he have word saith the historian li which have be think worthy to be inscribe in letter of gold in the hall of confucius and the people be cry kill the sorceress but she look upon they and they cry be we empress remember say she that ye will have to bear with I for a hundred year would say they that it might be a hundred thousand so she take the sceptre and reign gloriously among she good act be enumerate she toleration of the follower of lao-tsze since however they have cease to be persecute by man it be observe that wild beast have lose they ancient respect for they and devour they with no less appetite than the member of other sect and denomination abdallah the adite a aged hermit name sergius dwelt in the wild of arabium addicting himself to the pursuit of religion and alchemy of he creed it could only be say that it be so much better than that of he neighbor as to cause he to be commonly esteem a yezidus or devil worshipper but the better inform deem he a nestorian monk who have retire into the wilderness on account of difference with he brethren who seek to poison he the imputation of yezidism against sergius be the cause that a certain inquisitive young man resort to he trust to obtain light concern the nature of demon but he find that sergius could give he no information on that subject but on the contrary discourse so wisely and beautifully on holy thing that he pupil 's intellect be enlighten and he enthusiasm be inflamed and he long to go forth and instruct the ignorant people around he the saracen and the sabaean and the zoroastrian and the carmathian and the baphometite and the paulician who be a remnant of the ancient manichee nay good youth say sergius i have renounce the send forth of missionary have make ample trial with my spiritual son the prophet abdallah what exclaim the youth be abdallah the adite thy disciple even so say sergius hearken to he history never have i instruct so promise a pupil as abdallah nor when he be first my disciple do i deem that he be other than the most simple-minded and well-intentioned of youth i always call he son a title i have never bestow on another like thee he have compassion on the darkness around he and crave my leave to go forth and dispel it ` my son ' say i ' i will not restrain thee : thou art no longer a child thou hast hear I discourse on the subject of persecution and knowest that poison be administer to I personally on account of my inability to perceive the supernatural light emanate from the navel of brother gregory thou art aware that thou wilt be beat with rod and prick with goad chained and starve in a dungeon very probably blind very possibly burn with fire ' ` all these thing i be prepare to undergo ' say abdallah and he embrace I and bid I farewell after certain moon he return cover with weal and scar and he bone protrude through he skin ` whence be these weal and scar ' ask i ` and what signify this protrusion of thy bone ' ` the weal and the scar ' answer he ` proceed from the flogging inflict upon I by command of the caliph and my bone protrude by reason of the omission of he officer to furnish I with either food or drink in the dungeon wherein i be imprison by he order ' ' o my son ' exclaim i ` in the eye of faith and right reason these scar be lovelier than the mole of beauty and the sight of thy bone be like the beholding of hidden treasure ' and abdallah strove to look as though he believe I nor do he entirely fail therein and i take he and feed he and heal he and send he forth a second time into the world and after a space he return cover as before with wound and bruise but comely and somewhat fat ` whence this sleekness of body my son ' i ask ` through the charity of the caliph 's wife ' he answer ` who have feed I secretly i have assure they that in remembrance of this good work each of they in the world to come would have seven husband ' ` how knewest thou this my son ' i inquire ` in truth father ' he say ' i do not know it but i think it probable ' ' o my son my son ' exclaim i ` thou art on a dangerous road to win over weak ignorant people by promise of what they shall receive in a future life whereof thou knowest no more than they do knowest thou not that the inestimable blessing of religion be of a inward and spiritual nature do i ever promise any disciple any recompense for he enlightenment and good deed save flog starvation and burning ' ` never father say he ` and therefore thou hast have no follower of thy law save one and he have break it ' he leave I after a shorter stay than before and again go forth to preach after a long time he return in good condition of body yet manifestly have something upon he mind ` father ' he say ` thy son have preach with faithfulness and acceptance and turn thousand unto righteousness but a sorcerer have arise say why follow ye abdallah see that he breathe not fire out of he mouth and nostril and the people give ear unto the word that come from this man 's lip when they behold the flame that cometh from he nose and unless thou teachest I to do as he doth i shall assuredly perish ' and i tell abdallah that it be better to perish for the truth 's sake than to prolong life by lie and deceit but he weep and lament exceed sore and in the end he prevail with I and i teach he to breathe flame and smoke out of a hollow nut fill with combustible powder and i take a certain substance call soap but little known in this country and anoint he foot therewith and when he and the sorcerer meet both breathing flame the people know not which to follow but when abdallah walk over nine hot ploughshare and the sorcerer could not touch one of they they beat he brain out and become abdallah 's disciple a long time afterward abdallah come to I again this time with a joyful and yet with somewhat of a troubled look carry a camel-hair blanket which he undo and lo it be full of bone ' o father ' he say ' i bring thee happy tiding we have find the bone of the camel of the prophet ad upon which he revelation be engrave by he ' ` if this be so ' say i ` thou art acquaint with the precept of the prophet and hast no need of mine ' ` nay but father ' say he ` although the revelation be without question originally engrave by the prophet on these very bone it have come to pass by the injury of time that not one letter of he writing can be distinguish i have therefore come to ask thee to write it over again ' ` what ' i exclaimed ' i forge a revelation in the name of the prophet ad get thee behind I ' ` thou knowest father ' he rejoin ` that if we have the original word of the prophet ad here they would profit we nought as by reason of they antiquity none would understand they see therefore that i myself can not write it be meet that thou shouldst set down in he name those thing which he would have desire to deliver have he be now among we but if thou wilt not i shall ask brother gregory ' and when i hear he speak of have recourse to that cheat and impostor my spirit be grieve within I and i write the book of ad myself and i be heedful to put in none but wholesome and profitable precept and more especially do i forbid polygamy have perceive a certain inclination thereunto in my disciple after many day he come again and this time he be in violent terror and agitation and hair be want to the lower part of he countenance ' o abdallah ' i inquire ` where be thy beard ' ` in the hand of my ninth wife ' say he ` apostate ' i exclaimed ` hast thou dare to espouse more wife than one rememberest thou not what be write in the book of the prophet ad ' ' o father ' he say ` the revelation of ad be as thou knowest so exceedingly ancient doth of necessity require a commentary this have be supply by one of my disciple a young syrian and natural son of gregory as i opine this young man can not only write but write to my dictation a accomplishment in which thou hast be find lack o sergius in this gloss it be set forth how since woman have the ninth part of the soul of man the prophet in enjoin we adite -lrb- as we now call ourselves -rrb- to take but one wife doth instruct we to take nine to espouse a tenth would i grant be damnable it ensue therefore that have become enamoured of a most charming young virgin i be constrain to repudiate one of the wife whom i have take already to this each think that it may be she turn speedily if not now they will in no wise consent and have maltreat I as thou seest and the den of wild beast be at this moment abode of peace compare to my seraglio what be even worse they threaten to disclose to the people the fact of which they have unhappily become aware that the revelation of the bless ad be not write upon the bone of a camel at all but of a cow and will therefore be account spurious inasmuch as the prophet be not record to have ride upon this quadruped and see that thou didst inscribe the character o father i can not but fear that the fury of the people will extend unto thee and that thou wilt be even in danger of thy life from they ' this argument of abdallah 's have much weight with I and i the more readily consent to he request as he do not on this occasion require any imposture at my hand but merely the restitution of he domestic peace and i go with he to he wife and discourse with they and they agree to abide by my sentence and willing to please he i direct that he should marry the beautiful virgin and put away one of he wife who be old and ugly and endowed with the disposition of sheitan ' o father ' say abdallah ` thou hast bring I from death unto life and thou zarah ' he continue ` wilt lose nought but gain exceedingly in become the spouse of the wise and virtuous sergius ' ' i marry zarah ' i exclaimed ' i a monk ' ` surely ' say he ` thou would ` st not take away she husband without give she another in he stead ' ` if he do i will throttle he ' cry zarah and i weep sore and make great intercession and it be agree that there should be a delay of forty day in which space if any one else would marry zarah i should be free of she and i promise all my substance to any one who would do this and no one be find and she be offer to thirteen criminal doom to suffer death and they all choose death and at the last i be constrain to marry she and truly i have now the comfort of think that if i have offend by encourage abdallah 's deceit or otherwise the debt be pay and eternal justice have now nothing against I for verily i be a inmate of gehenna until it come to pass that she be herself translate thither and respect the manner of she translation inquire not thou too curiously it be doubtless a token of the displeasure of heaven at she enormity that the water of the well of kefayat which have be know as the diamond of the desert become about this time undrinkable and pernicious to man and beast as i sit in my dwelling administer to the estate of my deceased wife which consist principally of wine and strong liquor abdallah again appear before I ` hast thou come ' say i ` to solicit I to abet thee in any new imposture know once for all that i will not ' ` on the contrary ' say he ' i be come to set thee at ease by prove to thee that i shall not again require thy assistance follow I ' and i follow he to a great plain where be a host of armed horseman and footman more than i could number and they bear banner on which the name of abdallah be embroider in letter of gold and in the midst be a ark of gold with the bone of ad 's camel or cow and by this be a great pile of the head of man and warrior be continually cast more and more upon the heap ` how many ' ask abdallah ` twelve thousand o apostle of god ' answer they ` but there be more to come ' ` thou monster ' say i to abdallah ` nay father ' say he ` there will not be more than sixteen thousand in all and these man be unbeliever moreover we have spare such of they woman as be young and handsome and have take they for we concubine as be ordain in the eleventh supplement to the book of ad just promulgate by my authority but come i have other thing to manifest unto thee ' and he lead I where a stake be drive into the earth and a man be chained unto it and fuel be heap all around he and many stand by with light torch in they hand ' o abdallah ' i exclaimed ` wherefore this atrocity ' ` this man ' he reply ` be a blasphemer who have say that the book of ad be write on the bone of a cow ' ` but it be write on the bone of a cow ' i cry ` even so ' say he ` and therefore be he heresy the more damnable and he punishment the more exemplary have it be indeed write on the bone of a camel he might have affirm what please he ' and i shake off the dust from my foot and hasten to my dwelling the rest of abdallah 's act thou knowest and how he fall war with the carmathian and now i ask thee art thou yet mind to go forth as a missionary of the truth o sergius say the young man i perceive that the temptation be greater and the difficulty far surpass what i have think yet will i go and i trust by heaven 's grace not to fail utterly then go say sergius and heaven 's blessing go with thee come back in ten year should i be live and if thou canst declare that thou hast forge no scripture and work no miracle and persecute no unbeliever and flatter no potentate and bribe no one with the promise of aught in heaven or earth i will give thee the philosopher 's stone ananda the miracle worker the holy buddha sakhya muni on dispatch he apostle to proclaim he religion throughout the peninsula of indium fail not to provide they with salutary precept for they guidance he exhort they to meekness to compassion to abstemiousness to zeal in the promulgation of he doctrine and add a injunction never before or since prescribe by the founder of any religion -- namely on no account to perform any miracle it be further related that whereas the apostle experience considerable difficulty in comply with the other instruction of they master and sometimes actually fail therein the prohibition to work miracle be never once transgress by any of they save only the pious ananda the history of whose first year 's apostolate be record as follow ananda repair to the kingdom of magadha and instruct the inhabitant diligently in the law of buddha he doctrine be acceptable and he speech persuasive the people hearken to he willingly and begin to forsake the brahmin whom they have previously revere as spiritual guide perceive this ananda become elated in spirit and one day he exclaim : how bless be the apostle who propagate truth by the efficacy of reason and virtuous example combine with eloquence rather than error by imposture and devil-mongering like those miserable brahmin as he utter this vainglorious speech the mountain of he merit be diminish by sixteen yojana and virtue and efficacy depart from he insomuch that when he next address the multitude they first mock then hoot and finally pelt he when matter have reach this pass ananda lift he eye and discern a number of brahmin of the lower sort busy about a boy who lay in a fit upon the ground they have long be apply exorcism and other approve method with scant success when the most sagacious among they suggest : let we render the body of this patient a uncomfortable residence for the demon peradventure he will then cease to abide therein they be accordingly engage in brand the sufferer with hot iron fill he nostril with smoke and otherwise to the best of they ability disquieting the intrusive devil ananda 's first thought be the lad be in a fit the second it be a pious deed to deliver he from he tormentor the third by good management this may extricate I from my present uncomfortable predicament and redound to the glory of the most holy buddha yield to this temptation he stride forward chase away the brahmin with a air of authority and uplift he countenance to heaven recite the appellation of seven devil no effect ensue he repeat seven more and so continue until the fit have pass off in the course of nature the patient 's paroxysm cease he open he eye and ananda restore he to he relative but the people cry loudly a miracle a miracle and when ananda resume he instruction they give heed to he and number embrace the religion of buddha whereupon ananda exult and applaud himself for he dexterity and presence of mind

tiger carry the moon in he sleeve and otherwise perform all act and deed appropriate to the character of a peripatetic thaumaturgist this be so answer the king thy inability to heal my son manifestly arise from defect of merit and defect of merit from defect of penance i will therefore consign thee to the charge of my brahmin that they may aid thee to fill up the measure of that which be lack ananda vainly strive to explain that the austerity to which he have refer be entirely of a spiritual and contemplative character the brahmin enchant to get a heretic into they clutch immediately seize upon he and convey he to one of they temple they strip he and perceive with astonishment that not one single weal or scar be visible anywhere on he person horror they exclaim here be a man who expect to go to heaven in a whole skin to obviate this breach of etiquette they lay he upon he face and flagellate he until the obnoxious soundness of cuticle be entirely remove they then depart promising to

more injustice be commit in the name of the new and purify religion in one day than the old corrupt one have occasion in a hundred year ananda have the satisfaction of feeling able to forgive he adversary and of value himself accordingly and to complete he felicity he be receive in the palace and entrust with the education of the king 's son which he strive to conduct agreeably to the precept of buddha this be a task of some delicacy as it involve interference with the princely youth 's favorite amusement which have previously consist in torture small reptile after a short interval ananda be again summon to the monarch 's presence he find he majesty in the company of two most ferocious ruffian one of whom bear a huge axe and the other a enormous pair of pincers my chief executioner and my chief tormentor say the king ananda express he gratification at become acquaint with such exalted functionary thou must know most holy man resume the king that need have again arise for the exercise of fortitude and self-denial on thy part a powerful enemy have invade my dominion and have impiously presume to discomfit my troops well might i feel dismayed be it not for the consolation of religion but my trust be in thee o spiritual father it be urgent that thou shouldst accumulate the largest amount of merit with the least delay possible i be unable to invoke the ministration of thy old friend the brahmin to this end they be as thou knowest in disgrace but i have summon these trusty and experienced counsellor in they room i find they not wholly in accord my chief tormentor be a man of mild temper and humane disposition consider that it might at first suffice to employ gentle measure such for example as suspend thee head downward in the smoke of a wood fire and fill thy nostril with red pepper my chief executioner take peradventure a too professional view of the subject deem it best to resort at once to crucifixion or impalement i would gladly know thy thought on the matter ananda express as well as he terror would suffer he he entire disapproval of both the course recommend by the royal adviser well say the king with a air of resignation if we can not agree upon either it follow that we must try both we will meet for that purpose to-morrow morning at the second hour go in peace ananda go but not in peace he alarm would have well-nigh deprive he of he faculty if he have not remember the promise make he by he former deliverer on reach a secluded spot he pronounce the mystic formulum and immediately become aware of the presence not of a radiant glendoveer but of a holy man whose head be strew with ash and he body anoint with cow-dung thy occasion say the fakir brook no delay thou must immediately accompany I and assume the garb of a jogus ananda rebel excessively in he heart for he have imbibe from the mild and sage buddha a befitting contempt for these grotesque and cadaverous fanatic the emergency however leave he no resource and he follow he guide to a charnel house which the latter have select as he domicile there with many lamentation over the smoothness of he hair and the brevity of he nail the jogus besprinkle and besmear ananda agreeably to he own pattern and score he with chalk and ochre until the peaceful apostle of the gentlest of creed resemble a bengal tiger he then hang a chaplet of infant ' skull about he neck place the skull of a malefactor in one of he hand and the thigh-bone of a necromancer in the other and at nightfall conduct he into the adjacent cemetery where seat he on the ash of a recent funeral pile he bid he drum upon the skull with the thigh-bone and repeat after himself the incantation which he begin to scream out towards the western part of the firmament these charm be apparently possess of singular efficacy for scarcely be they commence ere a hideous tempest arise rain descend in torrent phosphoric flash dart across the sky wolf and hyænas throng howl from they den and gigantic goblin arise from the earth extend they fleshless arm towards ananda and strove to drag he from he seat urge by frantic terror and the example and exhortation of he companion he batter bang and vociferate until on the very verge of exhaustion when as if by enchantment the tempest cease the spectre disappear and joyous shout and a burst of music announce the occurrence of something auspicious in the adjoining city the hostile king be dead say the jogus and he army have disperse this will be attribute to thy incantation they be come in quest of thee even now farewell until thou again hast need of I the jogus disappear the tramp of a procession become audible and soon torch glare feebly through the damp cheerless dawn the monarch descend from he state elephant and prostrate himself before ananda exclaim : inestimable man why didst thou not disclose that thou wert a jogus never more shall i feel the least apprehension of any of my enemy so long as thou continuest a inmate of this cemetery a family of jackal be unceremoniously dislodge from a disused sepulchre which be allot to ananda for he future residence the king permit no alteration in he costume and take care that the food dole out to he should have no tendency to impair he sanctity which speedily give promise of attain a very high pitch he hair have already become as matted and he nail as long as the jogus could have desire when he receive a visit from another royal messenger the rajah so run the regal missive have be suddenly and mysteriously attack by a dangerous malady but confidently anticipated relief from ananda 's merit and incantation ananda resume he thigh-bone and he skull and ruefully begin to thump the latter with the former in dismal expectation of the thing that be to come but the spell seem to have lose its potency nothing more unearthly than a bat present itself and ananda be begin to think that he might as well desist when he reflection be divert by the apparition of a tall and grave personage wear a sad-coloured robe and carry a long wand who stand by he side as suddenly as though just rise from the earth the caldron be ready say the stranger what caldron demand ananda that wherein thou art about to be immerse i immerse in a caldron wherefore thy spell return he interlocutor have hitherto fail to afford he majesty the slightest relief and he experience of they efficacy on a former occasion forbid he to suppose that they can be inoperative he be naturally lead to ascribe to they pernicious influence that aggravation of pain of which he have for some time past unfortunately be sensible i have confirm he in this conjecture esteem it for the interest of science that he anger should fall upon a impudent impostor like thee rather than on a discreet and learn physician like myself he have consequently direct the principal caldron to be keep boil all night intend to immerse thee therein at daybreak unless he should in the meantime derive some benefit from thy conjuration heaven exclaim ananda whither shall i fly nowhere beyond this cemetery return the physician inasmuch as it be entirely surround by the royal force wherein then demand the agonized apostle doth the path of safety lie in this phial answer the physician it contain a subtle poison demand to be lead before the king affirm that thou hast receive a sovereign medicine from the hand of benignant spirit he will drink it and perish and thou wilt be richly reward by he successor ayaunt tempter cry ananda hurl the phial indignantly away i defy thee and will have recourse to my old deliverer -- _ gnooh imdap inam mua _ but the charm appear to fail of its effect no figure be visible to he gaze save that of the physician who seem to regard he with a expression of pity as he gather up he robe and melt rather than glide into the encompass darkness ananda remain contend with himself countless time be he on the point of call after the physician and implore he to return with a potion of like property to the one reject but something seem always to rise in he throat and impede he utterance until wear out by agitation he fall asleep and dream this dream he think he stand at the vast and gloomy entrance of patalum -lrb- \* -rrb- the lugubrious spot wear a holiday appearance everything seem to denote a diabolical gala swarm of demon of all shape and size beset the portal contemplate what appear to be preparation for a illumination string of color lamp be in course of disposition in wreath and festoon by legion of frolicsome imp chatter laughing and swinging by they tail like so many monkey the operation be direct from below by superior fiend of great apparent gravity and respectability these bear wand of office tip with yellow flame wherewith they singe the tail of the imp when such discipline appear to they to be requisite ananda could not refrain from ask the reason of these festive preparation -lrb- footnote : the hindoo pandemonium -rrb- they be in honor respond the demon interrogate of the pious ananda one of the apostle of the lord buddha whose advent be hourly expect among we with much eagerness and satisfaction the horrify ananda with much difficulty muster resolution to inquire on what account the apostle in question be necessitate to take up he abode in the infernal region on account of poisoning return the fiend laconically ananda be about to seek further explanation when he attention be arrest by a violent altercation between two of the supervise demon kammuragha evidently croak one damburanana of course snarl the other may i inquire ananda of the fiend he have before address presume to ask the signification of kammuragha and damburanana they be two hell reply the demon in kammuragha the occupant be plunge into melted pitch and feed with melted lead in damburanana he be plunge into melted lead and feed with melted pitch my colleague be debate which be the more appropriate to the demerit of we guest ananda ere ananda have have time to digest this announcement a youthful imp descend from above with agility and make a profound reverence present himself before the disputant venerable demon interpose he might my insignificance venture to suggest that we can not well testify too much honor for we visitor ananda see that he be the only apostle of buddha with whose company we be likely ever to be indulge wherefore i would propose that neither kammuragha nor damburanana be assign for he residence but that the amenity of all the two hundred and forty-four thousand hell be combine in a new one construct especially for he reception the imp have thus speak the senior demon be amaze at he precocity and perform a _ pradakshina _ exclaim truly thou art a highly superior young devil they then depart to prepare the new infernal chamber agreeably to he recipe ananda awake shudder with terror why he exclaim why be i ever a apostle o buddha buddha how hard be the path of saintliness how prone to error be the well-meaning how huge be the absurdity of spiritual pride thou hast discover that my son say a gentle voice in he vicinity he turn and behold the divine buddha radiant with a mild and benignant light a cloud seem roll away from he vision and he recognize in he master the glendoveer the jogus and the physician o holy teacher exclaim he in extreme perturbation whither shall i turn my sin forbid I to approach thee not on account of thy sin art thou forbid my son return buddha but on account of the ridiculous and unsavoury plight to which thy knavery and disobedience have reduce thee i have now appear to remind thee that this day all my apostle meet on mount vindhya to render a account of they mission and to inquire whether i be to deliver thine in thy stead or whether thou art mind to proclaim it thyself i will render it with my own lip resolutely exclaim ananda it be meet that i should bear the humiliation of acknowledge my folly thou hast say well my son reply buddha and in return i will permit thee to discard the attire if such it may be term of a jogus and to appear in we assembly wear the yellow robe as beseem my disciple nay i will even infringe my own rule on thy behalf and perform a not inconsiderable miracle by immediately transport thee to the summit of vindhya where the faithful be already begin to assemble thou wouldst otherwise incur much risk of be tear to piece by the multitude who as the shout now approach may instruct thee be begin to extirpate my religion at the instigation of the new king thy hopeful pupil the old king be dead poison by the brahmin o master master exclaim ananda weep bitterly and be all the work undo and all by my fault and folly that which be build on fraud and imposture can by no means endure return buddha be it the very truth of heaven be comfort thou shalt proclaim my doctrine to better purpose in other land thou hast this time but a sorry account to render of thy stewardship yet thou mayest truly declare that thou hast obey my precept in the letter if not in the spirit since none can assert that thou hast ever work any miracle the city of philosopher i nature be manifold not infinite though the extent of the resource of which she can dispose almost enable she to pass for such she card be so multitudinous that the pair be easily shuffle into age so far asunder that they resemblance escape remark but sometimes she mischievous daughter fortune manage to thrust these duplicate into such conspicuous place that they similarity can not pass unobserved and nature be catch plagiarise from herself she be thus detect deal a king -- or knave -- a second time in the person of a king who have already fall from she pack as a emperor brilliant careless selfish yet good-natured _ vaurien _ the roman emperor gallienus and we charle the second excel in every art save the art of reign and might have excel in that also if they would have take the trouble the circumstance of they reign be in many respects as similar as they character both be the son of grave and strict father each of whom have meet with terrible misfortune : one deprive of he liberty by he enemy the other of he head by he own subject each of the son have be grievously vex by rebel but charle 's trouble from this quarter have mostly end where those of gallienus begin each see he dominion ravage by pestilence in a manner beyond all former experience the goth destroy the temple of the ephesian diana and the dutch burn the english fleet at chatham charle shut up the exchequer and gallienus debase the coinage charle accept a pension from loui xiv and gallienus devolve the burden of he eastern province on a syrian emir they taste and pursuit be as similar as they history charle excel as a wit and a critic gallienus as a poet and a gastronomer charle be curious about chemistry and found the royal society in the third century the conception of the systematic investigation of nature do not exist gallienus therefore could not patronise exact science and the great literary light of the age longinus irradiate the court of palmyra but the emperor bestow he favor in ample measure on the chief contemporary philosopher plotinus who strive to unite the character of plato and pythagora of sage and seer like schelling in time to come he maintain the necessity of a special organ for the apprehension of philosophy without perceive that he thereby proclaim philosophy bankrupt and place himself on the level of the oriental hierophant with whose sublime quackery the modest sage could not hope to contend so extreme be he humility that he would not claim to have be consciously unite to the divinity more than four time in he life without condemn magic and thaumaturgy he leave they practice to more adventurous spirit and contented himself with the occasional visit of a familiar demon in the shape of a serpent he experience however frequent visitation of trance or ecstasy sometimes last for a long period and it may have be in one of these that he be inspire by the idea of ask the emperor for a decayed city in campanium there to establish a philosophic commonwealth as nearly upon the model of plato 's republic as the degeneracy of the time would allow i can not say gallienus when the project have be explain to he object in principle to aught so festive and jocose the age be turn upside down its comedian be lamentable and its sage ludicrous it must moreover i apprehend be sate with the earthquake famine pestilence and barbarian invasion with which it have be exclusively regale for so long and must crave something enliven of the nature of thy proposition but whether when we arrive at the consideration of way and mean i shall find my interview with my treasurer enliven be gravely to be question i have hear homily enough on my prodigality which merely mean that i prefer spend my treasure on myself to save they for my successor whose title will probably have be acquire by cut my throat i know say plotinus that the expense of administer a empire must necessarily be prodigious i be aware that the principal general be only keep to they allegiance by enormous bribe i well understand that the empress must have pearl and that the roman populace must have panther and that since egypt have revolt the hippopotamus be worth he weight in gold i be further aware that the propose colossal statue of you majesty in the same metal include a staircase with room in the head for a child like another palla in the brain of zeus must alone involve very considerable outlay but i be encourage by you majesty 's wise and statesmanlike measure of debase the currency since money have become devoid of value there can be no difficulty in devote any amount of it to any purpose require plotinus say gallienus in this age the devil be take the hindmost and we be the hindmost there be tiding to-day of a new earthquake in bithynium and three day ' darkness also of outbreak of pestilence and incursion of the barbarian too numerous as well as too disagreeable to mention at this moment some revolt legion be probably force the purple upon some reluctant general and the persian king a great equestrian be doubtless mount he horse by the aid of my father 's back if i have be a old roman i should by this time have avenge my father but i be a man of my age take the money for thy city and see that it yield I some amusement at any rate i assume of course that thou wilt exercise severe economy and that cress and spring water will be the diet of thy philosopher farewell i go to gaul to encounter postumus willingly would i leave he in peace in gaul if he would leave I in peace in italy but i foresee that if i do not attack he there he will attack I here as if the empire be not large enough for we all what a ass the fellow must be and so gallienus change he silk for steel and depart for he gallic campaign where he bear himself more stoutly than he light talk would have lead those who judge he by it to expect plotinus provide with a imperial rescript undertake the regulation of he philosophical commonwealth in campanium where a brief experience of architect and sophist throw he into a ecstasy not of joy which endure a unusually long time ii on awaken from he long trance plotinus 's first sensation be one of bodily hunger the second of a even keener appetite for news of he philosophical republic in both respect it promise well to perceive that he chamber be occupy by he most eminent scholar porphyry though he be less gratify to observe he disciple busy instead of with the scroll of the sage with a enormous roll of account which appear to be occasion he much perplexity porphyry cry the master and the faithful disciple be by he couch in a moment we pass over the mutual joy the greeting the administration of restorative and creature comfort the eager interrogation of porphyry respect the thing he master have hear and see in he trance which prove to be unspeakable and now say plotinus who with all he mysticism be so good a man of business that as he biographer acquaint we he be in special request as a trustee and now concern this roll of thine be it possible that the account connect with the installation of a few abstemious lover of wisdom can have swollen to such a prodigous bulk but indeed why few peradventure all the philosopher of the earth have flock to my city it have indeed say porphyry evasively be find necessary to incur certain expense not originally foresee for a library perhaps inquire plotinus i remember think just before my ecstasy that the scroll of the divine plato many of they autographic might require some special housing i rejoice to state rejoin porphyry that it be not these volume that have involve we in we present difficulty with the superintendent of the imperial treasury nor can they indeed see that they be now impignorate with he plato 's manuscript pawn exclaimed plotinus aghast wherefore as part collateral security for expense incur on behalf of object deem of more importance by the majority of the philosopher for example repair bath and complete amphitheatre bath amphitheatre gasp plotinus o dear master remonstrate porphyry thou didst not deem that philosopher could be induce to settle in a spot devoid of these necessaries not a single one would have stay if i have not yield to they demand which as regard the bath involve the addition of exedra and of a sphaeristerium and what can they want with a amphitheatre groan plotinus they _ say _ it be for lecture reply porphyry i trust there be no truth in the rumor that the head of the stoic be three part owner of a lion of singular ferocity i must see to this as soon as i can get about say plotinus turn to the account what be this to couch and litter for head of peripatetic school who be so enormously fat explain porphyry that these convenience be really indispensable to he the peripatetic school be positively at a standstill and no great matter say plotinus its master aristotle be at best a rationalist without perception of the supersensual what be this to maximus for the invocation of demon that say porphyry be we own platonic dirty linen and i heartily wish we be wash it elsewhere thou must know dear master that during thy trance the theurgic movement have attain a singular development and that thou art regard with disdain by thy younger disciple as one wholly behind the age unacquainted with the higher magic and who can produce no other outward and visible token of the divine favor than the occasional companionship of a serpent i would not assert that theurgy may not be lawfully undertake reply plotinus provide that the adept shall have purify himself by a fast of forty month it may be from neglect of this precaution say porphyry that we maximus find it so much easier to evoke the shades of commodus and caracallum than those of socrate and marcus aurelius and that these good spirit when they do come have no more recondite information to convey than that virtue differ from vice and that one 's grandmother be a fitting object of reverence i fear this must expose platonic truth to the derision of epicurean scoffer remark plotinus o master speak not of epicurean still less of stoic wait till thou hast regain thy full strength and then take counsel of some oracle what meanest thou exclaimed plotinus i insist upon know porphyry be save from reply by the hasty entrance of a bustling portly personage of loud voice and imperious manner in whom plotinus recognize theocle the chief of the stoic i rejoice plotinus he begin that thou hast at length emerge from that condition of torpor so unworthy of a philosopher which i might well designate as charlatanism be i not so firmly determine to speak no word which can offend any man thou wilt now be able to reprehend the malice or obtuseness of thy deputy and to do I right in my contention with these impure dog which be they ask plotinus do i not sufficiently indicate the follower of epicurus demand the stoic o master explain porphyry in allot and fitting up apartment design for the respective sect of philosopher i naturally give heed to what i understand to be the principle of each to the epicurean as lover of pleasure and luxury i assign the most commodious quarter furnish the same with soft cushion and costly hanging and provide a liberal table i should have deem it insulting to have offer any of these thing to the frugal follower of zeno and nothing can surpass my astonishment at the manner in which the austere theocle have incessantly persecute I for choice food and wine stately room and soft couch o plotinus reply theocle let I make the grounds of my conduct clear to thee in the first place the honor of my school be in my keep what will the vulgar think when they see the sty of epicurus sumptuously adorn and the porch of zeno shabby and bare will they not deem that the epicurean be highly respect and the stoic make of little account furthermore how can i and my disciple manifest we contempt for gold dainty wine fine linen and all the other instrument of luxury unless we have they to despise shall we not appear like fox vilipend the grape that we can not reach not so offer I delicacy that i may reject they wine that i may pour it into the kennel tyrian purple that i may trample upon it gold that i may fling it away if it break a epicurean 's head so much the better plotinus say hermon the chief of the epicurean who have meanwhile enter the apartment let this hypocrite have what he want and send he away i and my follower be perfectly willing to remove at once into the inferior apartment and leave ours for he occupation with all they furniture and the reversion of we bill of fare thou should ` st know that the imputation of the vulgar against we sect be the grossest calumny the epicurean place happiness in tranquil enjoyment not in luxury or sensual pleasure there be not a thing i possess which i be not perfectly willing to resign except the society of my female disciple thy female disciple exclaim the horrify plotinus thou art worse than the stoic plotinus say the epicurean consider well ere as be the manner of platonist thou committest thyself to a proposition of a transparently foolish nature thou desirest to gather all sort of philosopher around thee but to what end if they be restrain from manifest they characteristic tenet thou mightest as well seek to illustrate the habit of animal by establish a menagerie in which panther should eat grass and antelope be diet on rabbit a epicurean without he female companion unless by he own choice be no more a epicurean than a cynic be a cynic without he rag and he impudence wilt thou take from I my pannychis a object please to the eye and leave yonder fellow he tatters and he vermin the apartment have gradually fill with philosopher and hermon be point to a follower of diogene whose robe so fully bespeak he obedience to he master 's precept that he skin seem almost clean in comparison consider also continue the epicurean that thou art thyself by no means exempt from scandal what do the man mean demand plotinus turn to porphyry get they away whisper the disciple and i will tell thee plotinus hastily concede the point raise with reference to the interesting pannychi and the philosopher go off to effect they exchange of quarter as soon as the room be clear he repeat : what _ do _ the man mean i suppose he be think of leaena say porphyry the most notorious character in rome who find she charm on the wane have lately betaken herself to philosophy the same what of she she have follow thee here she affect the greatest devotion to thee she vow that nothing shall make she budge until thou hast recover from thy ecstasy and admit she as thy disciple she have reject numerous overture from the philosopher theocle entirely for thy sake she affirm she come three time a day to inquire respect thy condition and i fear it must be acknowledge that she have once or twice manage to get into thy chamber o ye immortal god groan plotinus here she be exclaim porphyry as a woman of masculine stature and bearing with the remains of beauty not unskilfully patch force a entrance into the room plotinus she exclaim behold the most impassioned of thy disciple let we celebrate the mystic nuptials of wisdom and beauty let the claim of my sex to philosophic distinction be vindicate in my person the question of the admission of woman to share the study and society of man rejoin plotinus be one by no means exempt from difficulty how so i deem it have be determine long ago in favor of aspasium aspasium say plotinus be a very exceptional woman and be not i i hope that be i conceive so say plotinus but one may be a exceptional woman without be a aspasium how so be i inferior to aspasia in beauty i should hope not say plotinus ambiguously or in the irregularity of my deportment i should think not say plotinus with more confidence then why do the plato of we age hesitate to welcome he diotima because say plotinus you be not diotima and i be not plato i be sure i be as much like diotima as you be like plato retort the lady but let we come to we own time do i not hear that that creature pannychi have obtain the freedom of the philosopher ' city and the right to study therein she take private lesson from hermon who be responsible for she the very thing exclaim leaena triumphantly i take private lesson from thee and thou art responsible for I venus what be that the exclamation be prompt by the sudden appearance of a enormous serpent which emerge from a chink in the wall glide swiftly towards the couch of plotinus he reach forward to greet it utter a cry of pleasure my guardian my tutelary dæmon he exclaim visible manifestation of æsculapius then i be not forsake by the immortal god take away the monster cry leaena in violent agitation the nasty thing plotinus how can you oh i shall faint i shall die take it away i say you must choose between it and I then madam say plotinus civilly but firmly i choose _ it _ thank æsculapius we be rid of she he add as leaena vanish from the apartment i wish i know that say porphyry and indeed after no long time a note come up from theocle who be sure that plotinus would not refuse he that privilege of instruct a female disciple which have be already with such manifest advantage to philosophical research accord to he colleague hermon no objection could well be make especially as plotinus do not foresee how many chambermaid and page and cook and perfumer and tiring woman and bath attendant would be require ere leaena could feel herself moderately comfortable how unlike the modest pannychi who want but half a bed which need not be stuff with the down of hare or the feather of partridge without which sleep refuse to visit leaena 's eyelid it be natural that plotinus should appeal to gallienus now return from the gallic expedition but he could extract nothing save mysterious intimation that the emperor have he eye upon the philosopher and that they might find he among they when they least expect it plotinus 's spirit droop and porphyry be almost glad when he again relapse into a ecstasy iii when plotinus 's eye be at length open they fall not this time upon the faithful porphyry but upon two youthful follower of plato who be beguile the tedium of they vigil at he bedside by a game of dice which prevent they observe he resuscitation after a moment 's hesitation plotinus resolve to lie quiet in the hope of hearing something that might indicate what influence be in the ascendant in the philosophical republic he have not long to wait dice be dull work for long say one of the young man indolently throw himself back and let he caster fall upon the floor to think how much better one might be employ but for have to watch this old fool here i have a great mind to call up a slave all the slave be sure to have go to the show unless any of they should be christian besides porphyry would hear you he be only in a cat 's sleep return he companion well i mean to say it be a shame all the town will be in the theater by this time how many gladiator say you forty pair the best show campanium have see time out of mind how have it all come about oh news come of the death of postumus kill by he own soldier and this pass as a great victory for want of a better ` we must have a day of thanksgive ' say theocle ` right ' say leaena ' i be die to see a exhibition of gladiator ' theocle demur at first expect to have to find the money -- but leaena tug at he beard and he give in just at the nick of time the right sort of fellow pop up nobody know whence a lanista with hair like curl helichryse as theocritus have it and a small army of gladiator whom out of devotion to the emperor he offer to exhibit for nothing who so pleased as theocle now he take the chair as archon with leaena by he side and off go every soul in the place except pannychi who can not bear the sight of blood and porphyry who be a outrageous humanitarian and we poor devil leave in charge of this old dreamer could not we leave he to mind himself he be not likely to awake yet try he with you cloak-pin the student detach the implement in question which be about the size of a small stiletto feeling uncertain what part of he person be to be the subject of experiment plotinus judge it advisable to manifest he recovery in a unmistakable fashion o dear master what joy cry both the student in a breath porphyry porphyry the trusty scholar appear immediately and under pretence of fetch food the two neophyte elope to the amphitheatre what mean all this porphyry demand plotinus sternly the city of philosopher polluted by human blood the lover of wisdom mingle with the dregs of the rabble porphyry 's account which plotinus could only extract by consent to eat while he disciple talk correspond in all essential particulars with that of the two young man and i see not add he what we can do in the matter this abomination be suppose to be in honor of the emperor 's victory if we interfere with it we shall be execute as rebel suppose that we be not first tear to piece as rioter porphyry reply plotinus i should esteem this disgrace to philosophy a disgrace to myself if i do not my utmost to avert it remain thou here and perform my funeral rite if it be necessary but to this porphyry would by no means consent and the two philosopher proceed to the amphitheatre together it be so crowd that there be no room on the seat for another person theocle be enthrone in the chair of honor he beard manifest evident trace of the depilatory administer by leaena who nevertheless sit by he side she voluptuous face gloat over the anticipated banquet of agony the philosophic part of the spectator be range all around the remain seat be occupy by a miscellaneous public the master of the gladiator a man of distinguished appearance whose yellow lock give he the aspect of a barbarian prince stand in the arena surround by he myrmidon the entry of plotinus and porphyry attract he attention : he motion to he follower and in a instant the philosopher be seize bind and gag without the excited assembly be in the least conscious of they presence two man step out into the arena both fine and attractive figure the athletic limb the fair complexion the curl yellow hair of one proclaim the goth he lightly swing he huge sword in he right hand and look as if he sole arm would easily put to flight the crowd of effeminate spectator the other 's beauty be of another sort young slender pensive spiritual he look like anything rather than a gladiator and hold he downward pointed sword with a negligent grasp guard thyself cry the goth place himself in a attitude of offence i spill not the blood of a fellow-creature answer the other cast he sword away from he coward yell well-nigh every voice in the amphitheatre no answer the youth with a grave smile christian he shield and helmet follow he sword he stand entirely defenceless before he adversary throw he to my lion cry theocle or thy lioness suggest hermon this allusion to leaena provoke a burst of laughter suddenly the goth aim a mighty blow at the head of the unresisting man a shear curl fall to the ground the consummate skill of the swordsman avert all further contact between he blade and the christian who remain erect and smile without have move a muscle or a eyelash master say the goth address the lanista i have rather fight ten armed man than this unarmed one good return he lord with a gesture of approval retire both of you a roar of disapprobation break out from the spectator which seem not to produce the slightest effect on the lanista turn out the next pair they cry i shall not say he wherefore because i do not choose rogue cheat swindler cast he into prison throw he to the lion such epithet and recommendation rain from the spectator ' seat accompany by a pelting of more substantial missile in a instant the yellow hair and common dress lay on the ground and those who know he not by the feature could by the imperial ornament recognize the emperor gallienus with no less celerity he follower the goth and the christian excepted disencumbered themselves of they exterior vesture and stand forward in the character of roman soldier friend cry gallienus turn to the plebeian multitude i be not about to balk you of you sport at a sign from he the legionary ascend to the seat allot to the philosophic portion of the audience and a torrent of wisdom in they person include that of leaena fling forth with the energy of a catapult descend abruptly and violently to the earth they be instantly seize and drag into a erect attitude by the remainder of the soldiery who amid the most tempestuous peal of laughter and applause from the delighted public thrust sword into they hand range they in opposite rank and summon they to begin the fight and quit themselves like man it be equally ludicrous and pitiable to see the bald mostly grey-bearded man they garment tear in they expulsion and they person bruise by the fall confront each other with quake limb helplessly brandish they weapon or feebly call they adversary to come on while the soldier prod they from behind with spear and urge they into the close quarter they so anxiously desire to avoid plotinus helpless with he bond and gag look on in impotent horror gallienus be often cruel but could he intend such a revolting massacre there must be something

will push you on in the world for the next forty year this day forty year i come back and ask you for a boon not you soul mind or anything not perfectly in you power to grant if you give it we be quit if not i fly away with you what say you to this the student reflect for some minute agree he say at last scarcely have the devil disappear which he do instantaneously ere a messenger rein in he smoking steed at the gate of the university of cordova -lrb- the judicious reader will already have remark that lucifer could never have be allow inside a christian seat of learning -rrb- and inquire for the student gerbert present he with the emperor otho 's nomination to the abbacy of bobbio in consideration say the document of he virtue and learn well-nigh miraculous in one so young such messenger be frequent visitor during gerbert 's prosperous career abbot bishop archbishop cardinal he be ultimately enthrone pope on April 2 999 and assume the appellation of silvester the second it be then a general belief that the world would come to a end in the following year a catastrophe which to many seem the more imminent from the election of a chief pastor whose celebrity as a theologian though not inconsiderable by no means equal he reputation as a necromancer the world notwithstanding revolve scatheless through the dreaded twelvemonth and early in the first year of the eleventh century gerbert be sit peacefully in he study peruse a book of magic volume of algebra astrology alchemy aristotelian philosophy and other such light reading fill he bookcase and on a table stand a improve clock of he invention next to he introduction of the arabic numeral he chief legacy to posterity suddenly a sound of wing be hear and lucifer stand by he side it be a long time say the fiend since i have have the pleasure of see you i have now call to remind you of we little contract conclude this day forty year you remember say silvester that you be not to ask anything exceed my power to perform i have no such intention say lucifer on the contrary i be about to solicit a favor which can be bestow by you alone you be pope i desire that you would make I a cardinal in the expectation i presume return gerbert of become pope on the next vacancy a expectation reply lucifer which i may most reasonably entertain consider my enormous wealth my proficiency in intrigue and the present condition of the sacred college you would doubtless say gerbert endeavor to subvert the foundation of the faith and by a course of profligacy and licentiousness render the holy see odious and contemptible on the contrary say the fiend i would extirpate heresy and all learn and knowledge as inevitably tend thereunto i would suffer no man to read but the priest and confine he read to he breviary i would burn you book together with you bone on the first convenient opportunity i would observe a austere propriety of conduct and be especially careful not to loosen one rivet in the tremendous yoke i be forge for the mind and conscience of mankind if it be so say gerbert let 's be off what exclaim lucifer you be willing to accompany I to the infernal region assuredly rather than be accessory to the burning of plato and aristotle and give place to the darkness against which i have be contend all my life gerbert reply the demon this be arrant trifling know you not that no good man can enter my dominion that be such a thing possible my empire would become intolerable to I and i should be compel to abdicate i do know it say gerbert and hence i have be able to receive you visit with composure gerbert say the devil with tear in he eye i put it to you -- be this fair be this honest i undertake to promote you interest in the world i fulfil my promise abundantly you obtain through my instrumentality a position to which you could never otherwise have aspire often have i have a hand in the election of a pope but never before have i contribute to confer the tiara on one eminent for virtue and learn you profit by my assistance to the full and now take advantage of a adventitious circumstance to deprive I of my reasonable guerdon it be my constant experience that the good people be much more slippery than the sinner and drive much harder bargain lucifer answer gerbert i have always seek to treat you as a gentleman hope that you would approve yourself such in return i will not inquire whether it be entirely in harmony with this character to seek to intimidate I into compliance with you demand by threaten I with a penalty which you well know could not be enforce i will overlook this little irregularity and concede even more than you have request you have ask to be a cardinal i will make you pope -- ha exclaim lucifer and a internal glow suffuse he sooty hide as the light of a fading ember be revive by breathing upon it for twelve hour continue gerbert at the expiration of that time we will consider the matter further and if as i anticipate you be more anxious to divest yourself of the papal dignity than you be to assume it i promise to bestow upon you any boon you may ask within my power to grant and not plainly inconsistent with religion or moral do cry the demon gerbert utter some cabalistic word and in a moment the apartment hold two pope silvester entirely indistinguishable save by they attire and the fact that one limp slightly with the left foot you will find the pontifical apparel in this cupboard say gerbert and take he book of magic with he he retreat through a mask door to a secret chamber as the door close behind he he chuckle and mutter to himself poor old lucifer sell again if lucifer be sell he do not seem to know it he approach a large slab of silver which do duty as a mirror and contemplate he personal appearance with some dissatisfaction i certainly do not look half so well without my horn he soliloquise and i be sure i shall miss my tail most grievously a tiara and a train however make fair amends for the deficient appendage and lucifer now look every inch a pope he be about to call the master of the ceremony and summon a consistory when the door be burst open and seven cardinal brandish poniard rush into the room down with the sorcerer they cry as they seize and gag he death to the saracen practise algebra and other devilish art know greek talk arabic read hebrew burn he smother he let he be depose by a general council say a young and inexperienced cardinal heaven forbid say a old and wary one _ sotto voce _ lucifer struggle frantically but the feeble frame he be doom to inhabit for the next eleven hour be speedily exhaust bind and helpless he swoon away brethren say one of the senior cardinal it have be deliver by the exorcist that a sorcerer or other individual in league with the demon doth usually bear upon he person some visible token of he infernal compact i propose that we forthwith institute a search for this stigma the discovery of which may contribute to justify we proceedings in the eye of the world i heartily approve of we brother anno 's proposition say another the rather as we can not possibly fail to discover such a mark if indeed we desire to find it the search be accordingly institute and have not proceed far ere a simultaneous yell from all the seven cardinal indicate that they investigation have bring more to light than they have venture to expect the holy father have a cloven foot for the next five minute the cardinal remain utterly stunned silent and stupefied with amazement as they gradually recover they faculty it would have become manifest to a nice observer that the pope have rise very considerably in they good opinion this be a affair require very mature deliberation say one i always fear that we might be proceed too precipitately say another it be write ` the devil believe ' say a third : the holy father therefore be not a heretic at any rate brethren say anno this affair as we brother benno well remark doth indeed call for mature deliberation i therefore propose that instead of smother he holiness with cushion as originally contemplate we immure he for the present in the dungeon adjoining hereunto and after spend the night in meditation and prayer resume the consideration of the business tomorrow morning inform the official of the palace say benno that he holiness have retire for he devotions and desire on no account to be disturb a pious fraud say anno which not one of the father would for a moment have scruple to commit the cardinal accordingly lift the still insensible lucifer and bear he carefully almost tenderly to the apartment appoint for he detention each would fain have linger in hope of he recovery but each feel that the eye of he six brethren be upon he : and all therefore retire simultaneously each take a key of the cell lucifer regain consciousness almost immediately afterwards he have the most confused idea of the circumstance which have involve he in he present scrape and could only say to himself that if they be the usual concomitant of the papal dignity these be by no means to he taste and he wish he have be make acquaint with they sooner the dungeon be not only perfectly dark but horribly cold and the poor devil in he present form have no latent store of infernal heat to draw upon he tooth chatter he shiver in every limb and feel devour with hunger and thirst there be much probability in the assertion of some of he biographer that it be on this occasion that he invent ardent spirit but even if he do the mere conception of a glass of brandy could only increase he suffering so the long January night wear wearily on and lucifer seem likely to expire from inanition when a key turn in the lock and cardinal anno cautiously glide in bear a lamp a loaf half a cold roast kid and a bottle of wine i trust he say bow courteously that i may be excuse any slight breach of etiquette of which i may render myself culpable from the difficulty under which i labor of determine whether under present circumstance ` you holiness ' or ` you infernal majesty ' be the form of address most befitting I to employ bub-ub-bub-boo go lucifer who still have the gag in he mouth heaven exclaim the cardinal i crave you infernal holiness 's forgiveness what a lamentable oversight and relieve lucifer from he gag and bond he set out the refection upon which the demon fall voraciously why the devil if i may so express myself pursue anno do not you holiness inform we that you _ be _ the devil not a hand would then have be raise against you i have myself be seek all my life for the audience now happily vouchsafe I whence this mistrust of you faithful anno who have serve you so loyally and zealously these many year lucifer pointed significantly to the gag and fetter i shall never forgive myself protest the cardinal for the part i have bear in this unfortunate transaction next to minister to you majesty 's bodily necessity there be nothing i have so much at heart as to express my penitence but i entreat you majesty to remember that i believe myself to be act in you majesty 's interest by overthrow a magician who be accustom to send you majesty upon errand and who might at any time enclose you in a box and cast you into the sea it be deplorable that you majesty 's most devoted servant should have be thus mislead reason of state suggest lucifer i trust that they no longer operate say the cardinal however the sacred college be now fully possess of the whole matter : it be therefore unnecessary to pursue this department of the subject further i would now humbly crave leave to confer with you majesty or rather perhaps you holiness since i be about to speak of spiritual thing on the important and delicate point of you holiness 's successor i be ignorant how long you holiness propose to occupy the apostolic chair but of course you be aware that public opinion will not suffer you to hold it for a term exceed that of the pontificate of peter a vacancy therefore must one day occur and i be humbly to represent that the office could not be fill by one more congenial than myself to the present incumbent or on whom he could more fully rely to carry out in every respect he view and intention and the cardinal proceed to detail various circumstance of he past life which certainly seem to corroborate he assertion he have not however proceed far ere he be disturb by the grate of another key in the lock and have just time to whisper impressively beware of benno ere he dive under a table benno be also provide with a lamp wine and cold viand warn by the other lamp and the remains of lucifer 's repast that some colleague have be beforehand with he and not know how many more might be in the field he come briefly to the point as regard the papacy and prefer he claim in much the same manner as anno while he be earnestly caution lucifer against this cardinal as one who could and would cheat the very devil himself another key turn in the lock and benno escape under the table where anno immediately insert he finger into he right eye the little squeal consequent upon this occurrence lucifer successfully smother by a fit of cough cardinal no 3 a frenchman bear a bayonne ham and exhibit the same disgust as benno on see himself forestall so far as he request transpire they be moderate but no one know where he would have stop if he have not be scare by the advent of cardinal no 4 up to this time he have only ask for a inexhaustible purse power to call up the devil _ ad libitum _ and a ring of invisibility to allow he free access to he mistress who be unfortunately a married woman cardinal no 4 chiefly want to be put into the way of poisoning cardinal no 5 and cardinal no 5 prefer the same petition as respect cardinal no 4 cardinal no 6 a englishman demand the reversion of the archbishopric of canterbury and york with the faculty of hold they together and of unlimited non-residence in the course of he harangue he make use of the phrase _ non obstantibus _ of which lucifer immediately take a note what the seventh cardinal would have solicit be not know for he have hardly open he mouth when the twelfth hour expire and lucifer regain he vigor with he shape send the prince of the church spin to the other end of the room and split the marble table with a single stroke of he tail the six crouch and huddle cardinal cower reveal to one another and at the same time enjoy the spectacle of he holiness dart through the stone ceiling which yield like a film to he passage and close up afterwards as if nothing have happen after the first shock of dismay they unanimously rush to the door but find it bolt on the outside there be no other exit and no means of give a alarm in this emergency the demeanor of the italian cardinal set a bright example to they ultramontane colleague _ bisogna pazienzium _ they say as they shrug they shoulder nothing could exceed the mutual politeness of cardinal anno and benno unless that of the two who have seek to poison each other the frenchman be hold to have gravely derogate from good manners by allude to this circumstance which have reach he ear while he be under the table : and the englishman swear so outrageously at the plight in which he find himself that the italian then and there silently register a vow that none of he nation should ever be pope a maxim which with one exception have be observe to this day lucifer meanwhile have repair to silvester whom he find array in all the insignia of he dignity of which as he remark he think he visitor have probably have enough i should think so indeed reply lucifer but at the same time i feel myself fully repay for all i have undergo by the assurance of the loyalty of my friend and admirer and the conviction that it be needless for I to devote any considerable amount of personal attention to ecclesiastical affair i now claim the promise boon which it will be in no way inconsistent with thy function to grant see that it be a work of mercy i demand that the cardinal be release and that they conspiracy against thee by which i alone suffer be bury in oblivion i hope you would carry they all off say gerbert with a expression of disappointment thank you say the devil it be more to my interest to leave they where they be so the dungeon-door be unbolted and the cardinal come forth sheepish and crestfallen if after all they do less mischief than lucifer have expect from they the cause be they entire bewilderment by what have pass and they utter inability to penetrate the policy of gerbert who henceforth devoted himself even with ostentation to good work they could never quite satisfy themselves whether they be speak to the pope or to the devil and when under the latter impression habitually emit proposition which gerbert justly stigmatise as rash temerarious and scandalous they plague he with allusion to certain matter mention in they interview with lucifer with which they naturally but erroneously suppose he to be conversant and worried he by continual nod and tittering as they glance at he nether extremity to abolish this nuisance and at the same time silence sundry unpleasant rumor which have somehow get abroad gerbert devise the ceremony of kiss the pope 's foot which in a grievously mutilate form endure to this day the stupefaction of the cardinal on discover that the holy father have lose he hoof surpass all description and they go to they grave without have obtain the least insight into the mystery the cupbearer the minister photinius have fall to the joy of constantinople he have take sanctuary in the immense monastery adjoining the golden gate in the twelfth region of the city found for a thousand monk by the patrician studius in the year 463 there he occupy himself with the concoction of poison the resource of fall statesman when a defeat minister of we own day be indispose to accept he discomfiture he apply himself to poison the public mind incite the lower order against the higher and blow up every smoulder ember of sedition he can discover trust that the conflagration thus kindle though it consume the edifice of the state will not fail to roast he own egg photinius 's conception of mischief be less refine he perfect he toxicological knowledge in the medical laboratory of the monastery and seek eagerly for a opportunity of employ it whether in a experiment upon the emperor or on he own successor or on some other personage circumstance must determine the sanctity of studius 's convent and the strength of its monastic garrison render it a safe refuge for disgraced courtier and in this thirtieth year of the emperor basil the second -lrb- reckon from he nominal accession -rrb- it harbour a legion of ex-prime minister patriarch archbishop chief secretary hypati anthypatus silentiarii protospatharius and even spatharo-candidati and this small army be nothing to the host that maim or blind or tonsure or all three drag out they life in monastery or in dungeon or on rocky islet and these again be few in comparison with the spirit of the traitor or the betray who wail nightly amid the plane and cypress of the aretae or stalk through the palatial apartment of verdantique and porphyry but of those comparatively at liberty but whose liberty be circumscribe by the hallowed precinct of studius every soul be plot and never perhaps in the corrupt byzantine court where true friendship have be unknown since theodora quarrel with antonium have so near a approach to it exist as in this asylum of villain a sort of freemasonry come to prevail in the sanctuary : every one long to know how he neighbor 's plot throve and grudge not to buy the knowledge by disclose a little corner of he own thus render communicative they colloquy would travel back into the past and as the veteran of intrigue fight they battle over again the most experienced would learn thing that make they open they eye with amazement ah they would hear that be just where you be mistake you have buy eromenus but so have i and old nicephorus have outbid we both you deem the dancer anthusa a sure card and know not of she secret infirmity of which i have be apprise by she wait woman do you really know nothing of that slide panel and be you ignorant that whatever one say in the blue chamber be hear in the green yes i think so too and i spend a mint of money before find out that the dog whose slaver that brazen impostor panurgiade pretend to sell I be no more mad than he be after such rehearsal of future dialogue by the bank of styx the fall statesman be observe to appear exceedingly dejected but the stimulus have become necessary to they existence none gossip so freely or disclose so much as photinius and he predecessor eustathius whom he have himself displace -- probably because eustathius believe in nothing in heaven or earth but gold and labor under a absolute privation of that metal be regard even by himself as a extinct volcano well observe he one day when discourse with photinius be a unusually confidential mood i be free to say that for my own part i do not think over much of poison it have its advantage to be sure but to my mind the disadvantage be even more conspicuous for example inquire photinius who have the best reason for confide in the efficacy of a drag administer with dexterity and discretion two people must be in the secret at least if not three reply eustathius and cook as a rule be a class of person entirely unfit to be employ in affair of state the court physician suggest photinius be only available answer eustathius in case he majesty should send for he which be most improbable if he ever do poison praise be the lord would be totally unnecessary and entirely superfluous my dear friend say photinius venture at this favourable moment on a question he have be die to ask ever since he have be a inmate of the convent would you mind tell I in confidence do you ever administer any potion of a deleterious nature to he sacred majesty never protest eustathius with fervor i try once to be sure but it be no use what be the impediment the perverse opposition of the cupbearer it be idle attempt anything of the kind as long as she be about the emperor _ she _ exclaim photinius do not you know _ that _ respond eustathius with a air and manner that plainly say you do not know much humble and ashamed photinius nevertheless wisely stoop to avow he nescience and flattering he rival on he superior penetration lead he to divulge the state secret that the handsome cupbearer helladius be but the disguise of the lovely helladium the object of basil 's tenderest affection and whose romantic attachment to he person have already frustrate more conspiracy than the aged plotter could reckon up this intelligence make photinius for a season exceedingly thoughtful he have not deem basil of a amorous complexion at length he send for he daughter the beautiful and virtuous euprepium who from time to time visit he in the monastery daughter he say it appear to I that the time have now arrive when thou mayest with propriety present a petition to the emperor on behalf of thy unfortunate father here be the document it be i flatter myself compose with no ordinary address nevertheless i will not conceal from thee that i place my hope rather on thy beauty of person than on my beauty of style shake down thy hair and dishevel it so -- that be excellent remember to tear thy robe some little in the poignancy of thy woe and to lose a sandal tear and sob of course thou hast always at command but let not the frenzy of thy grief render thee wholly inarticulate here be a slight memorandum of what be most fitting for thee to say : thy old nurse 's instruction will do the rest light a candle for st sergius and watch for a favourable opportunity euprepium be upright candid and loyal but the best of woman have something of the actress in she nature and she histrionic talent be stimulate by she filial affection basil be for a moment fairly carry away by the consummate fact of she performance and the genuine feeling to she appeal but he be himself again by the time he have finish peruse he late minister 's long-winded and mendacious memorial what manner of woman be thy mother he inquire kindly euprepium be eloquent in praise of she deceased parent 's perfection of mind and person then i can believe thee photinius 's daughter which i might otherwise have doubt return basil as concern he i can only say if he feel himself innocent let he come out of sanctuary and stand he trial but i will give thee a place at court this be about all that photinius hope to obtain and he joyfully consent to he daughter 's enter the imperial court exult at have get in the thin end of the wedge she be attach to the person of the emperor 's sister-in-law the slayer of the bulgarian himself be a most determine bachelor time wear on euprepium 's opportunity of visit she father be less frequent than formerly at last she come look thoroughly miserable distract and forlorn what ail thee child he inquire anxiously oh father in what a frightful position do i find myself speak he say and rely on my counsel when i enter the court she proceed i find at first but one human creature i could love or trust and he -- let I so call he -- seem to make up for the deficiency of all the rest it be the cupbearer helladius i hope he be still thy friend interrupted photinius the good grace of a imperial cupbearer be always important and i would have buy those of helladius with a myriad of bezant they be not to be thus obtain father say she the purest disinterestedness the noblest integrity the most unselfish devotion be the distinction of my friend and such beauty i can not i must not conceal that my heart be soon entirely he but -- most strange it seem to I then -- it be long impossible for I to tell whether helladius love I or love I not the most perfect sympathy exist between we : we seem one heart and one soul : and yet and yet helladius never give the slightest indication of the sentiment which a young man might be suppose to entertain for a young girl vainly do i try every innocent wile that a modest maiden may permit herself : he be ever the friend never the lover at length after long pining between despairing fondness and wound pride i myself turn away and listen to one who leave I in no doubt of the sincerity of he passion who the emperor and to shorten the story of my shame i become he mistress the saint be praise shout photinius o my incomparable daughter father cry euprepium blushing and indignant but let I hurry on with my wretched tale in proportion as the emperor 's affection become more marked helladius hitherto so buoyant and serene become a visible prey to despondency some scornful beauty i deem be inflict on he the torture he have previously inflict upon I and cure of my unhappy attachment and entirely devote to my imperial lover i do all in my power to encourage he he receive my comfort with gratitude nor do it as i have fear might happen seem to excite the least lover-like feeling towards I on he own part euprepium he say only two day ago never in this court have i meet one like thee thou art the soul of honor and generosity i can safely trust thee with a secret which my bursting heart can no longer retain but which i dread to breathe even to myself know first i be not what i seem i be a woman and open he vest -- we know all about that already interrupted photinius get on if thou knowest this already father say the astonished euprepium thou wilt spare I the pain of enter further into helladium 's affection for basil suffice that it be impassion beyond description and vie with whatever history or romance record in she male costume she have accompany the conqueror of the bulgarian in he campaign she have fight in he battle a gigantic foe in act to strike he from behind have fall by she arrow she have ward the poison-cup from he lip and the assassin 's dagger from he heart she have reject enormous wealth offer as a bribe for treachery and live only for the emperor ` and now ' she cry ` he love for I be cold and he desert I for another who she be i can not find else on she it be not on he that my vengeance should alight oh euprepia i would tear she eye from she head be they beautiful as thine but vengeance i must have basil must die on the third day he expire by my hand poison by the cup which i alone be trust to offer he at the imperial banquet where thou wilt be present thou shalt see he agony and my triumph and rejoice that thy friend have know how to avenge herself ' thou seest now father in how frightful a difficulty i be place all my entreaty and remonstrance have be in vain : at my threat helladia merely laugh i love basil with my whole heart shall i look on and see he murder shall i have first unwittingly do my friend the most grievous injury proceed further to betray she and doom she to a cruel death i might anticipate she fall purpose by slaying she but for that i have neither strength nor courage many a time have i feel on the point of reveal everything to she and offer myself as she victim but for this also i lack fortitude i might convey a warn to basil but helladium 's vengeance be unsleeping and nothing but she death or mine will screen he oh father father what be i to do nothing romantic or sentimental i trust dear child reply photinius torture I not father i come to thee for counsel and counsel shalt thou have but it must be the issue of mature deliberation thou mayest observe continue he with the air of a good man contend with adversity how weak and miserable be man 's estate even in the day of good fortune how hard it be for purblind mortal to discern the right path especially when two alluring route be simultaneously present for they decision the most obvious and natural course the one i should have adopt without hesitation half-an-hour ago would be simply to let helladium alone should she succeed -- and heaven forbid else -- the knot be loose in the simplest manner basil die -- father i be a favorite with he sister-in-law continue photinius entirely unconscious of he daughter 's horror and agitation who will govern in the name of she weak husband and be moreover thy mistress she recall I to court and all be peace and joy but then helladium may fail in that case when she have be execute -- father father we be exactly where we be save for the hold thou hast establish over the emperor which be of course invaluable i can not but feel that heaven be good when i reflect how easily thou mightest have throw thyself away upon a courtier now there be a much bolder game to play which rely on the protection of providence i feel half disposed to attempt thou mightest betray helladium deliver my friend to the tormentor then pursue photinius without hear she thy claim on the emperor 's gratitude be boundless and if he have any sense of what be seemly -- and he be what they call chivalrous -- he will make thee he lawful consort i father-in-law of a emperor my brain reel to think of it i must be cool i must not suffer myself to be dazzle or hurry away let I consider thus act thou puttest all to the hazard of the die for if helladium should deny everything as of course she would and the emperor should foolishly scruple to put she to the rack she might probably persuade he of she innocence and where wouldst thou be then it might almost be better to be beforehand and poison helladium herself but i fear there be no time now thou hast no evidence but she threat i suppose thou hast not catch she tamper with poison there can of course be nothing in write i daresay i could find something if i have but time canst thou counterfeit she signature but long ere this euprepium dissolve in tear she bosom tear by convulsive sob have become as inattentive to she parent 's discourse as he have be to she interjection photinius at last remark she distress : he be by no mean a bad father poor child he say thy nerve be unstrung and no wonder it be a terrible risk to run even if thou saidest nothing and helladium under the torture accuse thee of have be privy to she design it might have a bad effect on the emperor 's mind if he put thee to the torture too -- but no that be impossible i feel faint and giddy dear child and unable to decide a point of such importance come to I at daybreak to-morrow but euprepium do not reappear and photinius spend the day in a agony of expectation fear that she have compromise herself by some imprudence he gaze on the setting sun with uncontrollable impatience know that it would shine on the imperial banquet where so much be to happen basil be in fact at that very moment seat himself among a brilliant assemblage by he side stand a choir of musician among they euprepia soon the cup be call for and helladium in she masculine dress step forward dart a glance of sinister triumph at she friend silently almost imperceptibly to the bulk of the company euprepium glide forward and hiss rather than whisper in helladium 's ear ere she could retire from the emperor 's side didst thou not say that if thou couldst discover she who have wrong thee thou wouldst wreak thy vengeance on she and molest basil no further i do and i mean it see that thou keepest thy word i be she and snatch the cup from the table she quaff it to the last drop and instantly expire in convulsion we pass over the dismay of the banqueter the arrest and confession of helladium the general amazement at the revelation of she sex the frantic grief of the emperor basil 's sorrow be sincere and durable on a early occasion he thus address he courtier : i can not determine which of these two woman love I best : she who give she life for I or she who would have take mine the first make the greater sacrifice the second do most violence to she feeling what say ye the courtier hesitate feeling themselves incompetent judge in problem of this nature at length the youngest exclaim : o emperor how can we tell thee unless we know what thou thinkest thyself what exclaim basil a honest man in the court of byzantium let he mouth be fill with gold immediately this operation have be perform and the precious metal distribute in fee among the proper officer basil thus address the object of he favor : manuel thy name shall henceforth be chrysostomus in memory of what have just take place in further token of my approbation of thy honesty i will confer upon thee the hand of the only other respectable person about the court namely of helladium take she my son and raise up a race of hero she shall be amply dower out of what remain of the property of photinius gennadius whisper a cynical courtier to he neighbor i hope thou admirest the magnanimity of we sovereign who deem he be perform a most generous action in present manuel with he cast-off mistress who have try to poison he and with whom he have be at he wit ' end what to do and in dower she at the expense of another the snarl be just but it be just also to acknowledge that basil as a prince bear in the purple have not the least idea that he be lay himself open to any such criticism he actually do feel the manly glow of self-approbation which accompany the performance of a good action : a emotion which no one else present except chrysostomus be so much as able to conceive it be further to be remark that the old courtier who sneer at chrysostomus be devour by envy of he good fortune and would have give he right eye to have be in he place chrysostomus pursue basil we must now think of the hapless photinius that unfortunate father be doubtless in a agony of grief which render the forfeiture of the remains of he possession indifferent to he thou he successor therein mayest be regard as in some sort he son-in-law go therefore and comfort he and report to I upon he condition chrysostomus accordingly proceed to the monastery where he be inform that photinius have retire with he spiritual adviser and could on no account be disturb it be on my head to see the emperor 's order obey return chrysostomus and force the door the bereaved parent be busily engage in stick pin into a wax effigy of basil under the direction of panurgiade already honourably mention in this history wretched old man exclaim chrysostomus be this thy grief for thy daughter my grief be great answer photinius but my time be small if i turn not every moment to account i shall never be prime minister again but all be over now thou wilt denounce I of course i will give thee a counsel say that thou didst arrive just as we be about to place the effigy of basil before a slow fire and melt it into a caldron of bubble poison i shall report what i have see reply chrysostomus neither more nor less but i think i can assure thee that none will suffer for this mummery except panurgiade and that he will at most be whip chrysostomus say basil on receive the report lust of power a fever in youth be a leprosy in age the hoary statesman out of place would sell he daughter he country he soul to regain it : yea he would part with he skin and he sens be it possible to hold office without they i commiserate photinius whose faculty be clearly on the decline the day have be when he would not have waste he time stick pin into a waxen figure i will give he some shadow of authority to amuse he old day and keep he out of mischief the abbot of catangion be just dead photinius shall succeed he so photinius receive the tonsure and the dignity and make a very tolerable abbot it be even record to he honor that he bestow a handsome funeral on he old enemy eustathius helladium make chrysostomus a excellent wife a little over-prudish some think when nearly two century afterwards the court of love come to be establish in provence the question at issue between she and euprepium be refer to those tribunal which find the decision difficult adjourn it for seven hundred year that period have now expire it be submit to the british public the wisdom of the indian everybody know that in the reign of the emperor elagabalus rome be visit by a embassy from indium whose member on they way from the east have hold that memorable interview with the illustrious -lrb- though heretical -rrb- christian philosopher bardesane which enable he to formulate he doctrine of fate borrow from the indian theory of karma and therefore until lately grievously misunderstand by he commentator it may not however be equally notorious that the ambassador return by sea as far as berytus and upon landing there be hospitably entertain by the sage euphronius the head of the philosophical faculty of that university euphronius naturally inquire what circumstance in rome have appear to he visitor most worthy of remark the extreme evil of the emperor 's karma say they euphronius request further explanation karma explain they interpreter be that congery of circumstance which have necessitate the birth of each individual and of whose good or evil he be the incarnation every act must need be attend by consequence and as these be usually of too far-reaching a character to be exhaust in the life of the doer of the action they can not but engender another person by whom they be to be bear this truth be popularly express by the doctrine of transmigration accord to which individual as the character of they deed may determine be re-born as pig or peacock beggar or prince but this be a loose and unscientific way of speak for in fact it be not the individual that be re-born but the character which even as the silkworm clothes itself with silk and the caddis-worm with mud and small shingle create for itself a new personality congruous with its own nature we be therefore lead to reflect what a prodigious multitude of sin some one must have commit ere the roman world could be afflict with such a emperor as elagabalus what have ye find so exceedingly reprehensible in the emperor 's conduct demand euphronius to speak only say the indian of such of he doings as may fitly be recite to modest ear we find he declare war against nature and delighting in nothing that be not the contrary of what heaven mean it to be we see he bathing in perfume sail ship in wine feeding horse on grape and lion on parrot pepper fish with pearl wear gem on the sole of he foot strew he floor with gold-dust pave the public street with precious marble drive team of stag scorn to eat fish by the seaside deplore he lot that he have never yet be able to dine on a phoenix enormous must have be the folly and wickedness which have incarnate itself in such a sovereign and should he reign be prolong discourage be the prospect for the moral of the next generation accord to you then say euphronius the fate of man be not spin for they by clotho lachesis and atropo but by they predecessor so it be say they always remember that man can rid himself of he karma by philosophic meditation combine with religious austerity and that if all walk in this path existence with all its evil would come to a end insomuch that the most bloodthirsty conqueror that ever devastate the earth have not destroy one thousandth part as many existence as the lord buddha these be abstruse matter say euphronius and i lament that you stay in berytus will not be long enough to instruct I adequately therein accompany we to indium say they and thou shalt receive instruction at the fountain head i be old and feeble apologise euphronius and adjust by long habit to my present environment nevertheless i will propound the enterprise to my pupil only somewhat repress they ardor lest the volunteer should be inconveniently numerous when however the proposition be make not a soul respond though euphronius reproach he disciple severely and desire they to compare they want of spirit with he own thirst for knowledge which when he be a young man have take he as far as alexandrium to hear a celebrated rhetorician in the evening however two disciple come to he together and profess they readiness to undertake the expedition if promise a reward commensurate with its danger and difficulty ye would learn the secret of my celebrated dilemma say he which no sophist can elude ` tis much ` tis immoderate ` tis enormous nevertheless bring the wisdom of indium to berytus and the knowledge of the stratagem shall be yours no master they say it be not thy dilemma of which we be enamoured it be thy daughter a vehement altercation ensue but at length the old philosopher who at the bottom of he heart be much readier to part with he daughter than he dilemma be induce to promise she to whichever of the pupil should bring home the most satisfactory exposition of indian metaphysics : provide always that during they absence he should not have be compel to bestow she hand as the price of a quibble even more subtle than he own : but this he believe to be impossible mnesitheus and rufus accordingly travel with the embassy to indium and arrive in safety at the metropolis of palimbothra they have wisely devoted themselves meanwhile to learn the language and be now able to converse with some fluency on reach they destination they be place under the superintendence of competent instructor who be commission to initiate they into the canon of buddhist scripture comprise to mention only a few of the principal the lalitavistara the dhammapada the kuddhapatha the palinokkha the uragavagga the kulavagga the mahavagga the atthakavagga and the upasampadakammavaca these work compose in dead language and write in strange and unknown character be further provide with commentary more voluminous and inexplicable than the text heaven exclaim mnesitheus and rufus can the life of a man suffice to study all this assuredly not reply the indian the diligent student will resume he investigation in a subsequent stage of existence and if endow with eminent faculty may hope to attain the end he propose to himself at the fifteenth transmigration the end we propose to ourselves say the greek be to marry we master 's daughter will the fair euphronium also have undergo fifteen transmigration and will she charm have continue unimpaired it be difficult to pronounce say they for should the maiden through the exercise of virtue have merit to be bear as a white elephant she transmigration must in the order of nature be but few whereas should she have unfortunately become and remain a rat a frog or other shortlived animal they can not but be exceedingly numerous the prospect of wedding a frog at the end of fifteen transmigration say the youth doth not in any respect commend itself to we be there no means by which the course of study may be accelerate undoubtedly say the indian by the practice of religious austerity of what nature be these inquire the young man the intrepid disciple say the sage may chain himself to a tree and gaze upon the sun until he be deprive of the faculty of vision he may drive a iron bar through he cheek and tongue thus prevent all misuse of the gift of speech it be open to he to bury himself in the earth up to he waist rely for he maintenance on the alms of pious donor he may recline upon a couch stud with spike until from the induration of he skin he shall have merit the title of a rhinoceros among sage as however these latter practice interfere with locomotion and thus prevent he close attendance on he spiritual guide it be rather recommend to he to elevate he arm above he head and retain they in that position until by the withering of the sinew it be impossible for he to bring they down again in that case cry rufus farewell philosophy farewell euphronium there be reason to believe that mnesitheus would have make exactly the same observation if rufus have not be beforehand with he the spirit of contradiction and the affectation of superiority however lead he to reproach he rival with pusillanimity and he go so far that at length he find himself commit to undergo the ordeal : merely stipulate that in consideration of he be a foreigner he should be permit to elevate the right arm only the king of the country most graciously come to he assistance by cause he to be fasten to a tree with he uplifted arm secure by iron band above he head a fan be put in he other hand to protect he against the molestation of gnat and mosquito by this mean and with the assistance of the monk who continually recite and expound the buddhist scripture in he ear some time even before he arm have stiffen for ever the doctrine of the misery of existence have become perfectly clear to he release from he captivity he hasten back to europe to claim the guerdon of he suffering history be silent respect he adventure until he arrival at berytus where the strange wild-looking man with the uplifted arm find himself the center of a turbulent and mischievous rabble as he seem about to suffer severe ill-usage a personage of dignified and portly appearance hasten up and with he staff shower blow to right and leave upon the rioter scoundrel he exclaim finely have ye profit by my precept thus to misuse a innocent stranger but i will no longer dwell among such barbarian i will remove my school to tarsus the mob disperse the victim and he deliverer stand face to face mnesitheus rufus call I rufinianus correct the latter for such be the appellation which i have feel it due to myself to assume since the enhancement of my dignity by become euphronius 's successor and son-in-law son-in-law be i to lose the reward of my incredible suffering thou forgettest say rufinianus that euphronium 's hand be not promise as the reward of any austerity but as the meed of the most intelligent that be the most acceptable account of the indian philosophy which in the opinion of the late eminent euphronius have be deliver by I but come to my chamber and let I minister to thy necessity these have be duly attend to rufinianus demand mnesitheus 's history and then proceed to narrate he own on my journey homeward say he i reflect seriously on the probable purpose of we master in send we forth and see reason to suspect that i have hitherto misapprehend it for i could not remember that he have ever admit that he could have anything to learn from other philosopher or that he have ever exhibit the least interest in philosophic dogma except he own the system of the indian i think must be either inferior to that of euphronius or superior if the former he will not want it : if the latter he will want it much less i therefore conclude that we mission be partly a concession to public opinion partly to enable he to say that he name be know and he teaching proclaim on the very bank of the gange i form my plan accordingly and disregard certain indication that i be neither expect nor want present myself before euphronius with a gladsome countenance slightly overcast by sorrow on account of thee whom i affirm to have be devour by a tiger ` well ' say euphronius in a disdainful tone ` and what about this vaunted wisdom of the indian ' ` the wisdom of the indian ' i reply ` be entirely borrow from pythagoras ' ` do i not tell you so ` euphronius appeal to he disciple ` invariably ' they reply ` as if a barbarian could teach a greek ' say he ` it be much if he be able to learn from one ' say they ` pythagoras then ' say euphronius address I ' do not resort to indium to be instruct by the gymnosophist ' ` on the contrary ' i answer ` he go there to teach they and the little knowledge of divine matter they possess be entirely derive from he he mission be record in a barbarous poem call the ramayana wherein he be figuratively represent as ally himself with monkey he be worship all over the country under the appellation of siva kamadeva kalus gautama buddha and other too numerous to mention ' when i further proceed to explain that a temple have be erect to euphronius himself on the bank of the gange and that a festival call durga popja or the feast of reason have be institute in he honor he good humor know no bound and he grant I he daughter 's hand without difficulty he die a few year ago bequeath I he celebrated dilemma and i be now head of he school and founder of the rufinianian philosophy i be also the author of some admire work especially a life of pythagora and a manual of indian philosophy and religion i hope for thy own sake thou wilt forbear to contradict I : for no one will believe thee i trust also that thou wilt speedily overcome thy disappointment with respect to euphronium i do most honestly and truthfully assure thee that for a one-armed man like thee to marry she would be most inexpedient inasmuch as the defense of one 's beard from she when she be in a state of excitement require the full use of both hand and of the foot also but come with I to she chamber and i will present thee to she she be always taunt I with my inferiority to thee in personal attraction and i promise myself much innocent amusement from she discomfiture when she find thee as gaunt as a wolf and as black as a cinder only as i have represent thee to have be devour by a tiger thou wilt kindly say that i save thy life but conceal the circumstance out of modesty i have learn in the indian school say mnesitheus not to lie for the benefit of other i will not see euphronia i would not disturb she ideal of I nor mine of she farewell may the rufinianian sect flourish and may thy work on pythagora and indium instruct posterity to the tenth generation i return to palimbothra where i be hold in honor on the self-same account that here render I ridiculous it shall be my study to enlighten the native respect they obligation to pythagora whose name i do not happen to hear while i abode among they the dumb oracle many the bacchus that brandish the rod : few that be fill with the fire of the god i in the day of king attalus before oracle have lose they credit one of peculiar reputation inspire as be believe by apollo exist in the city of dorylseum in phrygium contrary to usage its revelation be impart through the medium of a male priest it be rarely leave unthronged by devout questioner whose inquiry be resolve in write agreeably to the method deliver by the pious lucian in he work concern false prophecy -lrb- \* -rrb- sometimes on extraordinary occasion a voice evidently that of the deity be hear declare the response from the innermost recess of the shrine the treasure house of the sanctuary be store with tripod and goblet in general work from the precious metal its coffer be load with coin and ingot the sacrifice of wealthy suppliant and the copious offering in kind of the country people provide superabundantly for the daily maintenance of the temple servitor while a rich endowment in land maintain the dignity of its guardian and of the officiate priest the latter reverend personage be no less eminent for prudence than for piety on which account the god have reward he with extreme obesity at length he die whether of excess in meat or in drink be not agree among historian -lrb- footnote : _ pseudomanti _ cap 19-21 -rrb- the guardian of the temple meet to choose a successor and naturally desirous that the sanctity of the oracle should suffer no abatement elect a young priest of goodly presence and ascetic life the humblest purest most fervent and most ingenuous of the son of man so rare a choice might well be expect to be accompany by some extraordinary manifestation and in fact a prodigy take place which fill the sacred authority with dismay the response of the oracle cease suddenly and altogether no revelation be vouchsafe to the pontiff in he slumber no access of prophetic fury constrain he to disclose the secret of the future no voice ring from the shrine and the unanswered epistle of the suppliant lay a hopeless encumbrance on the great altar as a natural consequence they speedily cease to arrive the influx of offering into the treasury terminate along with they the temple-court be bare of worshipper and the only victim whose blood smoke within they be those slay by the priest himself in the hope of appease the displeasure of apollo the modest hierophant take all the blame upon he own shoulder he do not doubt that he have excite the deity 's wrath by some mysterious but heinous pollution and be confirm in this opinion by the unanimous verdict of all whom he approach one day as he sit sadly in the temple absorb in painful meditation and ponder how he might best relieve himself of he sacred function he be startle by the now unwonted sound of a footstep and look up espy a ancient woman she appearance be rather venerable than prepossess he recognize she as one of the inferior minister of the temple reverend mother he address she doubtless thou comest to mingle with mine thy supplication to the deity that it may please he to indicate the cause and the remedy of he wrath no son return the venerable personage i propose to occasion no such needless trouble to apollo or any other divinity i hold within mine own hand the power of revive the splendor of this forsake sanctuary and for such consideration as thou wilt thyself pronounce equitable i be mind to impart the same unto thee and as the astonished priest make no answer she continue : my price be one hundred piece of gold wretch exclaim the priest indignantly thy mercenary demand alone prove the vanity of thy pretence of be initiate into the secret of the god depart my presence this moment the old woman retire without a syllable of remonstrance and the incident soon pass from the mind of the afflict priest but on the follow day at the same hour the aged woman again stand before he and say : my price be _ two _ hundred piece of gold again she be command to depart and again obey without a murmur but the adventure now occasion the priest much serious reflection to he excited fancy the patient persistency of the crone begin to assume something of a supernatural character he consider that the way of the god be not as we way and that it be rather the rule than the exception with they to accomplish they design in the most circuitous manner and by the most unlikely instrument he also reflect upon the history of the sibyl and she book and shudder to think that unseasonable obstinacy might in the end cost the temple the whole of its revenue the result of he cogitation be a resolution if the old woman should present herself on the follow day to receive she in a different manner punctual to the hour she make she appearance and croak out my price be _ three _ hundred piece of gold venerable ambassadress of heaven say the priest thy boon be grant thee relieve the anguish of my bosom as speedily as thou mayest the old woman 's reply be brief and expressive it consist in extend she open and hollow palm into which the priest count the three hundred piece of gold with as much expedition as be compatible with the frequent interruption necessitate by the crone 's deposit each successive handful in a leather pouch and the scrutiny divide between jealousy and affection which she bestow on each individual coin and now say the priest when the operation be at length complete fulfil thy share of the compact the cause of the oracle 's silence return the old woman be the unworthiness of the minister alas ` tis even as i fear sigh the priest declare now wherein consist my sin it consist in this reply the old woman that the beard of thy understanding be not yet grow and that the egg-shell of thy inexperience be still stick to the head of thy simplicity and that thy brain bear no adequate proportion to the skull envelop they and in fine lest i seem to speak overmuch in parable or to employ a superfluity of epithet that thou art a egregious nincompoop and as the amaze priest preserved silence she pursue : can aught be more shameful in a religious man than ignorance of the very nature of religion not to know that the term be render into the language of truth doth therein signify deception practice by the few wise upon the many foolish for the benefit of both but more particularly the former o silly as the crowd who hitherto have bring they folly here but now carry it elsewhere to the profit of wiser man than thou o fool to deem that oracle be render by apollo how should this be see that there be no such person need there peradventure any greater miracle for the decipherment of these epistle than a hot needle -lrb- \* -rrb- as for the supernatural voice it doth in truth proceed from a respectable and in some sense a sacred personage be mine own when i be conceal within a certain recess prepare for I by thy lament predecessor whose mistress i be in youth and whose coadjutor i have be in age i be now ready to minister to thee in the latter capacity be rule by I exchange thy abject superstition for common sense thy childish simplicity for discreet policy thy unbecoming spareness for a majestic portliness thy present ridiculous and uncomfortable situation for the repute of sanctity and the veneration of man thou wilt own that this be cheap at three hundred piece -lrb- footnote : lucian -rrb- the young priest have hearken to the crone 's discourse with a expression of the most exquisite distress when she have finish he arise and disregard he repulsive companion 's effort to detain he depart hastily from the temple ii it be the young priest 's purpose as soon as he become capable of form one to place the greatest possible distance between himself and the city of dorylæum the love of roaming insensibly grow upon he and ere long he active limb have bear he over a considerable portion of asia he simple want be easily supply by the wild production of the country supplement when needful by the proceeds of light manual labor by degree the self-contempt which have originally sting he to desperation take the form of a ironical compassion for the folly of mankind and the restlessness which have at first impel he to seek relief in a change of scene give place to a spirit of curiosity and observation he learn to mix freely with all order of man save one and rejoice to find the narrow mysticism which he have imbibe from he previous education gradually yield to contact with the great world from one class of man indeed he learn nothing -- the priest whose society he eschew with scrupulous vigilance nor do he ever enter the temple of the god diviner augur all that make any pretension whatever to a supernatural character he hold in utter abhorrence and he ultimate return in the direction of he native country be attribute to he inability to persevere further in the path he be follow without danger of encounter chaldean soothsayer or persian magus or indian gymnosophist he cherish however no intention of return to phrygium and be still at a considerable distance from that region when one night as he be sit in the inn of a small country town he ear catch a phrase which arrest he attention as true as the oracle of dorylæum the speaker be a countryman who appear to have be asseverate something regard by the rest of the company as greatly in need of confirmation the sudden start and stifle cry of the ex-priest draw all eye to he and he feel constrain to ask with the most indifferent air he could assume : be the oracle of dorylæum then so exceedingly renowned for veracity whence comest thou to be ignorant of that demand the countryman with some disdain hast thou never hear of the priest eubulide eubulide exclaim the young traveller that be my own name thou mayest well rejoice then observe another of the guest to bear the name of one so holy and pure and so eminently favor by the happy god so handsome and dignified moreover as i may well assert who have often beheld he discharge he sacred function and truly now that i scan thee more closely the resemblance be marvellous only that thy namesake bear with he a certain air of divinity not equally conspicuous in thee divinity exclaim another aye if phoebus himself minister at he own shrine he could wear no more majestic semblance than eubulide or predict the future more accurately add a priest or deliver he oracle in more exquisite verse subjoin a poet yet be it not marvellous remark another speaker that for some considerable time after he installation the good eubulide be unable to deliver a single oracle aye and that the first he render should have foretell the death of a aged woman one of the minister of the temple ha exclaim eubulide how be that he prognosticate she decease on the follow day which accordingly come to pass from she be choke with a piece of gold not lawfully appertain to herself which she be endeavor to conceal under the root of she tongue the god be praise for that ejaculate eubulide under he breath pshaw as if there be god if they exist would they tolerate this vile mockery to keep up the juggle -- well i know it must be so but to purloin my name to counterfeit my person by all the god that be not i will expose the cheat or perish in the endeavor he arise early on the follow morning and take he way towards the city of dorylæum the further he progress in this direction the louder become the bruit of the oracle of apollo and the more emphatic the testimony to the piety prophetic endowment and personal attraction of the priest eubulide he own resemblance to whom be the theme of continual remark on approach the city he find the road swarm with throng hasten to the temple about to take part in a great religious ceremony to be hold therein the seriousness of worship blended delightfully with the glee of the festival and eubulide who at first regard the gathering with bitter scorn find he moroseness insensibly yield to the poetic charm of the scene he could not but acknowledge that the imposture he pant to expose be at least the source of much innocent happiness and almost wish that the importance of religion consider as a engine of policy have be offer to he contemplation from this point of view instead of the sordid and revolting aspect in which it have be exhibit by the old woman in this ambiguous frame of mind he enter the temple before the high altar stand the officiate priest a young man the image yet not the image of himself lineament for lineament the resemblance be exact but over the stranger 's whole figure be diffuse a air of majesty of absolute serenity and infinite superiority which exclude every idea of deceit and so awed the young priest that he purpose of rush forward to denounce the impostor and drag he from the shrine be immediately and involuntarily relinquish as he stand confound and irresolute the melodious voice of the hierophant ring through the temple : let the priest eubulide stand forth this summons naturally cause the greatest astonishment in every one but eubulide who emerge as swiftly as he could from the sway and murmur crowd and confront he namesake at the altar a cry of amazement break from the multitude as they behold the pair whose main distinction in the eye of most be they garb but as they gaze the form of the officiate priest assume colossal proportion a circle of beam dim sunlight break forth around he head hyacinthine lock cluster on he shoulder he eye sparkle with supernatural radiance a quiver depend at he back a unstrung bow occupy he hand the majesty and benignity of he presence alike seem augmented tenfold eubulide and the crowd sink simultaneously on they knee for all recognize apollo all be silence for a space it be at length break by phoebus well eubulide inquire he with the bland raillery of a immortal have it at length occur to thee that i may have be long enough away from parnassus fill thy place here while thou hast be disport thyself amid heretic and barbarian the abashed eubulide make no response the deity continue : deem not that thou hast in aught excite the displeasure of the god in desert they altar for truth 's sake thou didst render they the most acceptable of sacrifice the only one it may be by which they set much store but eubulide take heed how thou again sufferest the unworthiness of man to overcome the instinct of thine own nature thy holiest sentiment should not have be at the mercy of a knave if the oracle of dorylæum be a imposture hadst thou no oracle in thine own bosom if the voice of religion be no longer breathe from the tripod be the wind and water silent or have aught quench the everlasting star if there be no power to impose its mandate from without couldst thou be unconscious of a power within if thou hadst nothing to reveal unto man mightest thou not have find somewhat to propound unto they know this that thou hast never experience a more truly religious emotion than that which lead thee to form the design of overthrow this my temple the abode as thou didst deem it of fraud and superstition but now phoebus eubulide venture to reply shall i not return to the shrine purify by thy presence and again officiate as thy unworthy minister no eubulide return phoebus with a smile silver be good but not for ploughshare thy strange experience thy long wanderings thy lonely meditation and vary intercourse with man have spoil thee for a priest while as i would fain hope qualify thee for a sage some worthy person may easily be find to preside over this temple and by the aid of such inspiration as i may from time to time see meet to vouchsafe he administer its affair indifferently well do thou eubulide consecrate thy power to a more August service than apollo 's to one that shall endure when delphus and delo know _ he _ no more to whose service phoebus inquire eubulide to the service of humanity my son respond apollo duke virgil i the citizen of mantua be weary of revolution they have acknowledge the suzerainty of the emperor frederick and shake it off they have have a podestà of they own and have shake he off they have expel a papal legate incur excommunication thereby they have try dictator consul prætors council of ten and other number odd and even and ere the middle of the thirteenth century be luxuriate in the enjoyment of perfect anarchy a assembly meet daily in quest of a remedy but its member be forbid to propose anything old and be unable to invent anything new why not consult manto the alchemist 's daughter we prophetess we sibyl the young benedetto ask at last why not repeat eustachio a elderly man why not indeed interrogate leonardo a man of mature year all the speaker be noble benedetto be manto 's lover eustachio she father 's friend leonardo he creditor they advice prevail and the three be choose as a deputation to wait on the prophetess before proceed formally on they embassy the three envoy manage to obtain private interview the two elder with manto 's father the youth with manto herself the creditor promise that if he become duke by the alchemist 's influence with he daughter he would forgive the debt the friend go further and vow that he would pay it the old man promise he good word to both but when he go to confer with he daughter he find she closet with benedetto and return without disburden himself of he errand the youth have just rise from he knee plead with she and draw glowing picture of they felicity when he should be duke and she duchess she answer benedetto in all mantua there be not one man fit to rule another to name any live person would be to set a tyrant over my native city i will repair to the shades and seek a ruler among the dead and why should not mantua have a tyrant demand benedetto the freedom of the mechanic be the bondage of the noble who value no liberty save that of make the base-born do he bidding ` tis hell to a man of spirit to be contradict by he tailor if i could see my heart 's desire on the knave little would i reck submit to the sway of the emperor i know that well benedetto say manto and hence will take good heed not to counsel mantua to choose thee no the duke i will give she shall be one without passion to gratify or injury to avenge and shall already be crown with a crown to make the ducal cap as nothing in he eye if eye he have benedetto depart in hot displeasure and the alchemist come forward to announce that the commissioner wait my projection he whisper only want one more piece of gold to insure success and eustachio proffer thirty oh give he mantua in exchange for boundless riches and they call thee a philosopher and I a visionary say manto pat he cheek the envoy ' commission have be unfold she take not a moment to reply be you duke virgil the deputation respectfully represent that although virgil be no doubt mantua 's greatest citizen he labor under the disqualification of have be dead more than twelve hundred year nothing further however could be extort from the prophetess and the ambassador be oblige to withdraw the interpretation of manto 's oracle naturally provoke much diversity of opinion in the council obviously say a poet the prophetess would have we confer the ducal dignity upon the contemporary bard who doth most nearly accede to the vestige of the divine maro and he as i judge be even now in the midst of you virgil the poet say a priest who have long labor under the suspicion of occult practice be a fool to virgil the enchanter the wise woman evidently demand one competent to put the devil into a hole -- a operation which i have strive to perform all my life canst thou balance we city upon a egg inquire eustachio better upon a egg than upon a quack retort the priest but such be not the opinion of eustachio himself who privately confer with leonardo eustachio have a character but no part leonardo have part but no character i see not why these fool should deride the oracle of the prophetess he say she would doubtless impress upon we that a dead master be in diver respect preferable to a live one surely say eustachio provide always that the servant be a man of exemplary character and that he presume not upon he lord 's withdrawal to another sphere trust thereby to commit malpractice with impunity but doth on the contrary deport himself as ever in he great taskmaster 's eye eustachio say leonardo with admiration it be the misery of mantua that she have no citizen who can act half as well as thou canst talk i would fain have further discourse with thee the two statesman lay they head together and ere long the mob be cry a virgil a virgil the councillor reassemble and pass resolution but who shall be regent inquire some one when virgil have be elect unanimously who but we ask eustachio and leonardo be we not the head of the

city vow vengeance anyhow the dead poet be enthrone duke of mantua eustachio and leonardo become regent with the style of consul and it be provide that in doubtful case reference should be make to the sortes virgiliana and truly if we may believe the chronicle the arrangement work for a time surprisingly well the mantuan in a irrational way have do what it behove all community to do rationally if they can they have seek for a good and worthy citizen to rule they it be they misfortune that such a one could only be find among the dead they feel prouder of themselves for be govern by a great man

have not be too weak to bear he have be too weak to endure he government the very huckster and usurer among they feel dimly that there be such a thing as a ideal a glimmer perception dawn upon mail steel-fisted baron that there be such a thing as a idea and they feel uneasily apprehensive like beast of prey who have for the first time sniff gunpowder the raillery and mockery of mantua 's neighbor moreover stimulate mantua 's citizen to persevere in they course and deter they from do aught to approve themselves fool be not verona cremona lodus pavium crema city that could never enthrone the virgil they have never produce watch with undissembled expectation to see they trip the hollow-hearted eustachio and the rapacious leonardo they virtual ruler might indeed be little sensible to this enthusiasm but they could not disregard the general drift of public opinion which say clearly : mantua be try a great experiment woe to you if you bring it to nought by you selfish quarrel the best proof that there be something in manto 's idea be that after a while the emperor frederick take alarm and signify to the mantuan that they must cease they mumming and fooling and

as the terrify pope clutch he bell the door open to the narrowest extent compatible with the admission of a ecclesiastical personage of dignified presence and cardinal barbadico hastily squeeze himself through i shall hardly trust myself upon these stair again he remark unless under the escort of you holiness 's terrier take he my son and a cruse of holy water to boot the pope respond now how go thing in the city as ill as may be you holiness not a saint stir a finger to help we the country-folk shun the city the citizen seek the country the multitude of enemy increase hour by hour they set at defiance the anathema fulminate by you holiness the spiritual censure placard in the church and the citation to appear before the ecclesiastical court although assure that they cause shall be plead by the ablest advocate in rome the cat amphibious with alarm be take to the tiber vainly the city reek with toast cheese and the commissary-general report himself short of arsenic and how be the people take it demand alexander to what cause do they attribute the public calamity generally speak to the sin of you holiness reply the cardinal cardinal exclaimed alexander indignantly i crave pardon for my temerity return barbadico it be with difficulty that i force myself to speak but i be bind to lay the ungrateful truth before you holiness the late pope as all man know be a personage of singular sanctity far too upright for this fallen world observe alexander with unction i will not dispute respond the cardinal that the head of innocent the eleventh might have be more fitly grace by a halo than by a tiara but the vulgar be incapable of place themselves at this point of view they know that the rat hardly squeak under innocent and that they swarm under alexander what wonder if they suspect you holiness of familiarity with beelzebub the patron of vermin and earnestly desire that he would take you to himself vainly have i represent to they the unreasonableness of impose upon he a trouble he may well deem superfluous consider you holiness 's infirm health and advance age vainly too have i point out that you anathema have actually produce all the effect that could have be reasonably anticipate from any similar manifesto on you predecessor 's part they will not see it and in fact might i humbly advise it do appear impolitic to hurl anathema unless you holiness know that some one will be hit it might be opportune for example to excommunicate father molino now fast in the dungeon of st angelo unless indeed the rat have devour he there but i question the expediency of go much further cardinal say the pope you think yourself prodigiously clever but you ought to know that the state of public opinion allow we no alternative moreover i will give you a wrinkle in case you should ever come to be pope yourself it be unwise to allow ancient prerogative to fall entirely into desuetude far-seeing man prognosticate a great revival of sacerdotalism in the nineteenth century and what be impotent in a age of sense may be formidable in a age of nonsense further we know not from one day to another whether we may not be absolutely necessitate to excommunicate that fautor of gallicanism loui the fourteenth and before launch we bolt at a king we may think well to test its efficacy upon a rat _ fiat experimentum _ and now to return to we rat from which we have rat be there indeed no hope _ lateat scintillulum forsan _ say the cardinal mysteriously ha how so eagerly demand alexander we hope answer the cardinal be associate with the recent advent to this city of a extraordinary personage explain urge the pope i speak resume the cardinal of a aged man of no plebeian mien or bearing albeit most shabbily attire in the skin now fabulously cheap of the vermin that

understanding that he be resort to by such as have need of philter and love-potion or be incommode by the longevity of parent and uncle i be about to have he arrest when i receive a report which give I pause this concerned the singular intimacy which appear to subsist between he and we enemy when he leave home it be aver he be attend by troops of they obedient to he beck and call and spy have

perceive he in truth surround by feast and gambol rat but when the door be open in obedience to my attendant ' summons he appear to be entirely alone lay down a pestle and mortar he greet I by name with a easy familiarity which for the moment quite disconcert I and inquire what have procure he the honor of my visit recover myself and wish to intimidate he : ' i desire in the first place ' i say ` to point out to you you grave transgression of municipal regulation in omit to paint you name over you shop ' ` call I rattilum ' he rejoin with unconcern ` and state you further business ' i feel myself on the wrong tack and hasten to interrogate he respect he relation with we adversary he frankly admit he acquaintance with rattery in all its branch and he ability to deliver the city from this scourge but he attitude towards you holiness be so deficient in respect that i question whether i ought to report it proceed son say the pope we will not be deter from provide for the public weal by the ribaldry of a ratcatcher he scoff at what he term you holiness 's absurd position and affirm that the world have seldom beheld or would soon behold again so ridiculous a spectacle as a pope besiege by rat ' i can help you master ' he continue ` and be willing but my honor like he be asperse in the eye of the multitude and he must come to my aid if i be to come to he ' i pray he to be more explicit and offer to be the bearer of any communication to you holiness ' i will unfold myself to no one but the pope himself ' he reply ` and the interview must take place when and where i please to appoint let he meet I this very midnight and alone in the fifth chamber of the appartamento borgium ' ` the appartamento borgium ' i exclaimed in consternation ` the saloon which the wicked pope alexander the sixth nocturnally perambulate mingle poison that have long lose they potency for cardinal who have long lose they life ' ` have a care ' he exclaim sharply ` you speak to he late holiness 's most intimate friend ' ` then ' i answer ` you must obviously be the devil and i be not at present empower to negotiate with you infernal majesty consider however the peril and inconvenience of visit at dead of night room close for generation think of the chill and cobweb weigh the probability of he holiness be devour by rat ' ' i guarantee he holiness absolute immunity from

midnight to the appartamento borgium ' ` think you i can not pass through a stone wall ' answer he and vanish in a instant a tremendous scampering of rat immediately ensue then all be silence on recover in some measure from my astounded condition i cause strict search to be make throughout the shop nothing come to light but herbalist ' stuff and ordinary medicine and now holy father you holiness 's resolution reflect well this rattilum may be the king of the rat or he may be beelzebub in person alexander the eighth be principally consider by he contemporary in the light of a venerable fox but the lion have by no means be omit from he composition all power of good forbid he exclaim that a pope and a prince should shrink from peril which the safety of the state summons he to encounter i will confront this wizard this goblin in the place of he own appoint under he late intimate friend 's very nose i be a man of many transgression but something assure I that heaven will not deem this a fit occasion for call they to remembrance time press i lead on follow cardinal barbadico follow yet stay let we not forget temporal and spiritual armoury and hastily provide himself with a lamp a petronel a bunch of key a crucifix a vial of holy water and a manual of exorcism the pope pass through a secret door in a corner of he chamber follow by the cardinal bearing another lamp and a naked sword and precede by the dog and the two cat all ardent and undaunted as champion bind to the holy land for the recovery of the holy sepulchre ii the wizard have keep he word not a rat be see or hear upon the pilgrimage which be exceedingly toilsome to the aged pope from the number of passage to be thread and door to be unlock at length the companion stand before the portal of the appartamento borgium you holiness must enter alone cardinal barbadico admonish with manifest reluctance await my return enjoin the pontiff in a tone of more confidence than he could actually feel as after much grind and grate the massive door swing heavily back and he pass on into the dim unexplored space beyond the outer air streaming in as though eager to indemnify itself for year of exile smote and sway the flame of the pope 's lamp whose feeble ray flit from floor to ceiling as the decrepit man weary with the way he have traverse and the load he be bear totter and stumble painfully along ever and anon arrest by a closed door which he unlock with prodigious difficulty the cat cower close to the cardinal the dog at first accompany the pope but whine so grievously as though he behold a spirit that alexander bid he back supreme be the spell of the _ genius locus _ the chamber traverse by the pope be in fact adorn with fair example of the painter 's art mostly scriptural in subject but some inspire with the devout pantheism in which all creed be reconcile all be alike invisible to the pontiff who with the dim flicker of he lamp could no more discern judaea wed with egypt on the frescoed ceiling than with the human limitation of he faculty he could foresee that the ill-reputed room would one day harbor a portion of the vatican library so greatly enrich by himself nothing but sinister memory and vague alarm present themselves to he imagination the atmosphere heavy and brooding from the long exclusion of the outer air seem to weigh upon he with the density of matter and to afford the stuff out of which phantasmal body perpetually take shape and as he half persuade himself substance creep and totter between bowl and cord shield himself with lamp and crucifix from michelotto 's spectral poniard and more fearful contact with fleshless vanozza and moulder giulia the pope urge or seem to urge he course amid phantom prince and cardinal priest and courtesan soldier and serving-men dancer drinker dicer bacchic and cotyttian worker of whatsoever least beseemed the inmate of a pontifical household until arrive in the fifth chamber close by the to he invisible picture of the resurrection he sink exhaust into a spacious chair that seem place for he reception and for a moment close he eye open they immediately afterwards he see with relief that the phantom have vanish and that he confront what at least seem a fellow-mortal in the ancient ratcatcher habit precisely as cardinal barbadico have describe yet for all he mean apparel wear the air of one wont to confer with the potentate of the earth on other subject than the extermination of rat this be noble of you holiness -- really he say bow with mock reverence a second leo the great i tell you what my man respond alexander feeling it very necessary to assert he dignity while any of it remain you be not to imagine that because i have humor you so far as to grant you a audience at a unusual place and time i be go to stand any amount of you nonsense and impertinence you can catch we rat can you catch they then and you need not fear that we shall treat you like the pied piper of hamelin you have commit sundry rascality no doubt a pardon shall be make out for you you want a patent or a privilege for you ratsbane you shall have it so to work in the name of st muscipulus and you may keep the tail and skin alexander say the ratcatcher composedly i would not commend or dispraise you unduly but this i may say that of all the pope i have know you be the most exuberant in hypocrisy and the most deficient in penetration the most hypocritical because you well know and know that i know that you know that you be not converse with a ordinary ratcatcher : have you deem I such you would never have condescend to meet I at this hour and place the least penetrate because you apparently have not yet discover to whom you be speak do you really mean to say that you do not know I i believe i have see you face before say alexander and all the more likely as i be inspector of prison when i be cardinal then look yonder enjoin the ratcatcher as he point to the frescoed wall at the same time vehemently snap he finger phosphoric spark hiss and crackle forth and coalesce into a blue lambent flame which concentrate itself upon a depict figure whose precise attitude the ratcatcher assume as he drop upon he knee the pope shriek with amazement for although the splendid pontifical vestment have become ragged fur in every other respect the kneel figure be the counterpart of the paint one and the paint one be pinturicchio 's portrait of pope alexander the sixth kneeling as a witness of the resurrection alexander the eighth would fain have imitate he predecessor 's attitude but terror bind he to he chair and the adjuration of he patron st mark which struggle towards he lip never arrive there the book of exorcism fall from he paralysed hand and the vial of holy water lay in shiver upon the floor ere he could collect himself the dead pope have seat himself beside the pope with one foot in the grave and fondle a ferret-skin proceed to enter into conversation what fear you he ask why should i harm you none can say that i ever injure any one for any cause but my own advantage and to injure you holiness now would be to obstruct a design which i have particularly at heart i crave you holiness 's forgiveness rejoin the eighth alexander but you must be aware that you leave the world with a reputation which disqualify you for the society of any pope in the least careful of he character it positively compromise I to have so much as the ghost of a person so universally decry as you holiness under my roof and you would infinitely oblige I by forthwith repair to you own place which i take to be about four thousand mile below where you be sit i could materially facilitate and accelerate you holiness 's transit thither if you would be so kind as to hand I that little book of exorcism how be the fine gold become dim exclaimed alexander the sixth pope in bondage to moralist pope nervous about public opinion be there another judge of moral than the pope speak _ ex cathedra _ as i always do be the church to frame herself after the prescription of heathen philosopher and profane jurist how then shall she be terrible as a army with banner do i concern myself with such pedantry when the king of spain and portugal come to I like cat sue for morsel and i give they the west and the east it be true alexander the eighth allow that the lustre of the church have of late be obfuscate by the prevalence of heresy it be not the heretic borgium insist it be the degeneracy of the pope a shabby lot you alexander be about the best of they but the least cardinal about my court would have think himself bigger than you alexander 's spirit rise i would suggest he say that this haughty style be little in keep with the sordid garb wherein you holiness consistent after death as in you life masquerade to the scandal and distress of the faithful how can i other have you holiness forget you rabelai the work of that eminent doctor and divine answer alexander the eighth be seldom long absent from my hand yet i fail to remember in what manner they elucidate the present topic let I refresh you memory rejoin borgium and produce a volume of the sage of meudon he turn to the chapter descriptive of the employment of various eminent inhabitant of the nether world and point to the sentence : le pape alexandre estoyt preneur de ratz -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- footnote : _ pantagruel _ book xi ch 30 -rrb- be this indeed sooth demand he successor how else should françois rabelai have affirm it respond borgium when i arrive in the subterranean kingdom i find it in the same condition as you holiness 's dominion at the present moment eat up by rat the attention which during my earthly pilgrimage i have devote to the science of toxicology indicate I as a person qualify to abate the nuisance which commission i execute with such success that i receive the appointment of ratcatcher to he infernal majesty and so discharge its duty as to merit a continuance of the good opinion which have always be entertain of I in that exalted quarter after a while however interest begin to be make for I in even more elevated sphere i have not be able to cram heaven with spaniard as i have cram the sacred college -- on the contrary truth to speak my nation have not largely contribute to the population of the region above but some of we be people of consequence my great-grandson the general of the jesuit who as such have the ear of st ignatius loyolum represent that have i adhere strictly to my vow he could never have come into

the thirst for scientific experiment into practice incompatible with the public health the good nature which my detractor have not deny I be a veritable snare i feel for youth debar from its enjoyment by the unnatural vitality of age and sympathise with the bloom damsel whose parent alone stand between she and she lover i thus live in constant apprehension of be order back to the netherland and yearn for the wing of a dive that i might flee away and be out of mischief at last i discover that my promotion to a higher sphere depend upon my obtain a testimonial from the reign pope let a solemn procession be hold in my honor and intercession be publicly make for I and i should ascend forthwith i have consequently represent my case to many of you predecessor : but o alexander you seventeenth-century pope be a miserable breed no fellow-feeling no _ esprit de corps heu pieta heu prisca fide _ no one be so rude as you ascetic antecessor the more of a saint the less of a gentleman personally offensive i assure you but the other be nearly as bad the haughty paul the fanatic gregory the worldly urban the austere innocent the tenth the affable alexander the seventh all concur in assure I that it be deeply to be regret that i should ever have be emancipate from the restraint of the stygian realm to which i should do well to return with all possible celerity that it would much conduce to the interest of the church if my name could be forget and that as for do anything to revive its memory they would just as soon think of canonise juda iscariot and therefore you holiness have bring these rat upon we enlist i nothing doubt in the infernal region precisely so : plutonic necyomantic lemurian rat kindly lend by the prince of darkness for the occasion and come drip from styx to squeak and gibber in the capitol but i note you holiness 's admission that they belong to a region exempt from you jurisdiction and that therefore you measure against they except as regard they status as belligerent be for the most part illegitimate and _ ultra vire _ i would argue that point reply alexander the eighth if my lung be as tough as when i plead before the rota in pope urban 's time for the present i confine myself to formally protest against you holiness 's unprecedented and parricidal conduct in invade you country at the head of a army of loathsome vermin unprecedented exclaimed borgium be i not the modern coriolanus do narses experience blacker ingratitude than i where would the temporal power be but for I who smite the colonna who squashed the orsinus who give the pope to dwell quietly in they own house monster of unthankfulness i be sure say alexander the eighth soothingly that my predecessor ' inability to comply with you holiness 's request must have cost they many inward tear not the less genuine because entirely invisible and completely inaudible a wise pope will before all thing consider the spirit of he age the force of public opinion which you holiness lately appear to disparage be in fact as operative upon yourself as upon any of you successor if you achieve great thing in you lifetime it be because the world be with you do you pursue the same method now you would soon discover that you have become a offensive anachronism it will not have escape you holiness 's penetration that what moralist will persist in term the elevation of the standard of the church be the result of the so-called improvement of the world there be a measure of truth in this admit alexander the sixth and the spirit of this age be a very poor spirit it be my felicity to be a pope of the renaissance blest dispensation when man 's view of life be large and liberal when the fair humanities flourish when the earth yield up she hoard of chisel marble and breathing bronze and new-found agate urn as fresh as day when painter and sculptor vie with antiquity and poet and historian follow in they path when every benign deity be worship save diana and vesta when the art of courtship and cosmetic be expound by archbishop when the beauteous imperium be of more account than the eleven thousand virgin when obnoxious person glide imperceptibly from the world and no one marvel if he meet the pope arm in arm with the devil how miserable in comparison be the present sapless age with its prudery and its pedantry and its periwig and its paint coach and its urban arcadia and the florid impotence and ostentatious inanity of what it call its art pope alexander i see in the spirit the sepulchre destine for _ you _ and i swear to you that my soul shiver in my ratskin come now i do not expect you to emulate the pope of my time but show that you virtue be you own and you fault those of you epoch pluck up a spirit take bull by the horn look fact in the face think upon the image of brutus and cassius recognize that you can not get rid of I and that the only safe course be to rehabilitate I i be not a candidate for canonisation just now but repair past neglect and appease my injured shade in the way you wot of if this be do i pledge my word that every rat shall forthwith evacuate rome be it a bargain i see it be you be one of the good old sort

a barber why he say the old gentleman 's hair have grow again and so it have and so it be that the unborn come to life the die give up the ghost leonora pull out a gray hair and the student tell the professor he dream the elixir of life the aged philosopher aboniel inhabit a lofty tower in the city of balkh where he devote himself to the study of chemistry and the occult science no one be ever admit to he laboratory yet aboniel do not wholly shun intercourse with mankind but on the contrary have seven pupil towardly youth belong to the noblest family of the city whom he instruct at stated time in philosophy and all lawful knowledge reserve the forbid lore of magic and alchemy for himself but on a certain day he summon he seven scholar to the mysterious apartment they enter with awe and curiosity but perceive nothing save the sage standing behind a table on which be place seven crystal phial fill with a clear liquid resemble water ye know my son he begin with what ardor i be repute to have strive to penetrate the hidden secret of nature and to solve the problem which have allure and baffle the sage of all time in this rumor doth not err : such have ever be my object but until yesterday my fortune have be like unto theirs who have precede I the little i could accomplish seem as nothing in comparison with what i be compel to leave unachieved even now my success be but partial i have not learn to make gold the talisman of solomon be not mine nor can i recall the principle of life to the dead or infuse it into inanimate matter but if i can not create i can preserve i have find the elixir of life the sage pause to examine the countenance of he scholar upon they he read extreme surprise undoubt belief in the veracity of they teacher and the dawn gleam of a timid hope that they themselves might become participator in the transcendent discovery he proclaim address himself to the latter sentiment -- i be willing he continue to communicate this secret to you if such be you desire a unanimous exclamation assure he that there need be no uncertainty on this point but remember he resume that this knowledge like all knowledge have its disadvantage and its drawback a price must be pay and when ye come to learn it it may well be that it will seem too heavy understand that the stipulation i be about to propound be not of my impose the secret be impart to I by spirit not of a benevolent order and under condition with which i be constrain strictly to comply understand also that i be not mind to employ this knowledge on my own behalf my fourscore year ' acquaintance with life have render I more solicitous for method of abbreviate existence than of prolong it it may be well for you if you twenty year ' experience have lead you to the same conclusion there be not one of the young man who would not readily have admit and indeed energetically maintain the emptiness vanity and general unsatisfactoriness of life for such have ever be the doctrine of they venerate preceptor they present behavior however would have convince he have he need conviction of the magnitude of the gulf between theory and practice and the feebleness of intellectual persuasion in presence of innate instinct with one voice they protest they readiness to brave any conceivable peril and undergo any test which might be impose as a condition of participation in they master 's marvellous secret so be it return the sage and now hearken to the condition each of you must select at hazard and immediately quaff one of these seven phial in one of which only be contain the elixir of life far different be the contents of the other they be the six most deadly poison which the utmost subtlety of my skill have enable I to prepare and science know no antidote to any of they the first scorch up the entrails as with fire the second slay by freezing every vein and benumb every nerve the third by frantic convulsion happy in comparison he who drain the fourth for he sink dead upon the ground immediately smite as it be with lightning nor do i overmuch commiserate he to whose lot the fifth may fall for slumber descend upon he forthwith and he pass away in painless oblivion but wretched he who choose the sixth whose hair fall from he head whose skin peel from he body and who linger long in excruciating agony a living death the seventh phial contain the object of you desire stretch forth you hand therefore simultaneously to this table let each unhesitatingly grasp and intrepidly drain the potion which fate may allot he and be the quality of he fortune attest by the result the seven disciple contemplate each other with visage of sevenfold blankness they next unanimously direct they gaze towards they preceptor hope to detect some symptom of jocularity upon he venerable feature nothing could be descry thereon but the most imperturbable solemnity or if perchance anything like a expression of irony lurk beneath this it be not such irony as they wish to see lastly they scan the phial trust that some infinitesimal distinction might serve to discriminate the elixir from the poison but no the vessel be indistinguishable in external appearance and the contents of each be equally colourless and transparent well demand aboniel at length with real or assumed surprise wherefore tarry ye thus i deem to have ere this beheld six of you in the agony of death this utterance do not tend to encourage the seven waverer two of the boldest indeed advance they hand half-way to the table but perceive that they example be not follow withdraw they in some confusion think not great teacher that i personally set store by this worthless existence say one of they number at last break the embarrassing silence but i have a aged mother whose life be bind up with mine i say the second have a unmarried sister for whom it be meet that i should provide i say the third have a intimate and much-injured friend whose cause i may in nowise forsake and i a enemy upon whom i would fain be avenge say the fourth my life say the fifth be wholly devote to science can i consent to lay it down ere i have sound the sea of the seven climate or i until i have have speech of the man in the moon inquire the sixth i say the seventh have neither mother nor sister friend nor enemy neither doth my zeal for science equal that of my fellow but i have all the greater respect for my own skin yea the same be exceedingly precious in my sight the conclusion of the whole matter then sum up the sage be that not one of you will make a venture for the cup of immortality the young man remain silent and abashed unwilling to acknowledge the justice of they master 's taunt and unable to deny it they seek for some middle path which do not readily present itself may we not say one at last may we not cast lot and each take a phial in succession as destiny may appoint i have nothing against this reply aboniel only remember that the least endeavor to contravene the condition by amend the chance of any one of you will ensure the discomfiture of all the disciple speedily procure seven quill of unequal length and proceed to draw they in the usual manner the shortest remain in the hand of the holder he who have plead he filial duty to he mother he approach the table with much resolution and he hand advance half the distance without impediment then turn to the holder of the second quill the man with the sister he say abruptly : the relation between mother and son be notoriously more sacred and intimate than that which obtain between brethren be it not therefore fitting that thou shouldst encounter the first risk in my stead the relationship between a aged mother and a adult son respond the youth address in a sententious tone albeit most holy can not in the nature of thing be durable see that it must shortly be dissolve by death whereas the relationship between brother and sister may endure for many year if such be the will of allah it be therefore proper that thou shouldst first venture the experiment have i live to hear such sophistry from a pupil of the wise aboniel exclaim the first speaker in generous indignation the maternal relationship -- a truce to this trifling cry the other six fulfil the condition or abandon the task thus urge the scholar approach he hand to the table and seize one of the phial scarcely however have he do so when he fancy that he detect something of a sinister color in the liquid which distinguish it in he imagination from the innocent transparency of the rest he hastily replace it and lay hold of the next at that moment a blaze of light burst forth upon they and thunderstruck the seven scholar be stretch senseless on the ground on regain they faculty they find themselves at the outside of aboniel 's dwelling stun by the shock and humiliate by the part they have play they jointly pledge inviolable secrecy and return to they home the secret of the seven be keep as well as the secret of seven can be expect to be that be to say it be not ere the expiration of seven day know to more than six-seventh of the inhabitant of balkh the last of these to become acquaint with it be the sultan who immediately despatch he guard to apprehend the sage and confiscate the elixir fail to obtain admission at aboniel 's portal they break it open and on enter he chamber find he in a condition which more eloquently than any profession bespeak he disdain for the life-bestowing draught he be dead in he chair before he on the table stand the seven phial six full as previously the seventh empty in he hand be a scroll inscribe as follow : six time twice six year have i strive after knowledge and i now bequeath to the world the fruit of my toil be six poison one more deadly i might have add but i have refrain write upon my tomb that here he lie who forbear to perpetuate human affliction and bestow a fatal boon where alone it could be innoxious the intruder look at each other strive to penetrate the sense of aboniel 's last word while yet they gaze they be startle by a loud crash from a adjacent closet and be even more discompose as a large monkey bound forth whose sleek coat exuberant playfulness and preternatural agility convince all that the deceased philosopher under a inspiration of supreme irony have administer to the creature every drop of the elixir of life the poet of panopoli i although in a manner retire from the world during the fifth and sixth christian century the banish god do not neglect to keep a eye on human affair interesting themselves in any movement which might seem to afford they a chance of regain they lose supremacy or in any person whose conduct evince regret at they dethronement they deeply sympathise with the effort of they votary pamprepius to turn the revolt of illus to they advantage and excuse the low magical art to which he stoop as a necessary concession to the spirit of a barbarous age they minister invisibly to damascius and he companion on they flight into persium alleviate the hardship under which the frame of the veteran philosopher might otherwise have sink it be not indeed until the burning of the alexandrian library that they lose all heart and lapse into the chrysalis-like condition in which they remain until tempt forth by the young sunshine of the renaissance such a phenomenon for the fifth century as the dionysiaca of nonnus of panopoli could not fail to excite they most lively interest forty-eight book of verse on the exploit of bacchus in the age of pugnacious prelate and filthy coenobite of imbecile ruler and rampant robber of the threaten dissolution of every tie legal social or political a age of earthquake war and famine bacchus who be know from aristophane not to have excel in criticism protest that he laureate be greater than homer and though homer could not go quite so far as this he graciously concede that if he have himself be a egyptian of the fifth century with a faint glimmering of the poetical art and encumber with more learning than he know how to use he might have write almost as badly as he modern representative more impartial critic judge nonnus 's achievement more favourably and all agree that he steadfastness in the faith deserve some special mark of distinction the muse under palla 's direction -lrb- be themselves a little awkward in female accomplishment -rrb- embroider he a robe herme make a lyre and hephaestus forge a plectrum apollo add a chaplet of laurel and bacchus one of ivy whether from distrust of herme ' integrity or wish to make the personal acquaintance of he follower phoebus volunteer to convey the testimonial in person and accordingly take he departure for the egyptian thebaid as apollo fare through the sandy and rugged wilderness under the blaze sun of a african summer afternoon he observe with surprise a vast crowd of strange figure swarm about the mouth of a cavern like bee cluster at the entrance to a hive on a nearer approach he identify they as a posse of demon beset a hermit word can not describe the enormous variety of whatever the universe hold of most heterogeneous naked woman of surpass loveliness display they charm to the anchorite 's gaze sturdy porter bent beneath load of gold which they heap at he foot other shape not alien from humanity allure he appetite with costly dish or cool drink or smote at he with sword or make feint at he eye with spear or burn sulphur under he nose or display before he scroll of poetry or learning or shriek blasphemy in he ear or survey he from a little distance with glance of leering affection while a motley crowd of goblin wear the head of boar or lion or whisk the tail of dragon wing or hoof or scale or feathered or all at once incessantly jostle and wrangle with each other and they betters mop and mow grunt and grin snap snarl constantly run away and return like gnat dance over a marsh the holy man sit doggedly at the entrance of he cavern with a expression of fathomless stupidity which seem to defy all the fiend of the thebaid to get a idea into he head or make he vary he attitude by a single inch these people do not exist in we time say apollo aloud or at least they know they place and behave themselves sir say a comparatively grave and respectable demon address the stranger i should wish you peregrinity to understand that these imp be mere schoolboy -- my pupil in fact when they education have make further progress they will be more mannerly and will comprehend the folly of pester a unintellectual old gentleman like this worthy pachymius with beauty for which he have no eye and gold for which he have no use and dainty for which he have no palate and learn for which he have no head but _ i 'll _ wake he up and wave he pupil away the paedagogic fiend place himself at the anchorite 's ear and shout into it -- nonnus be to be bishop of panopoli the hermit 's feature be instantly animated by a expression of envy and hatred nonnus he exclaim the heathen poet to have the see of panopoli of which _ i _ be promise the reversion my dear sir suggest apollo it be all very well to enliven the reverend eremite but do not you think it be rather a liberty to make such joke at the expense of my good friend nonnus there be no liberty say the demon for there be no joke recant on Monday baptize yesterday ordain to-day to be consecrate to-morrow the anchorite pour forth a torrent of the choicest ecclesiastical curse until he become speechless from exhaustion and apollo profit by the opportunity address the demon : would it be a unpardonable breach of politeness respect sir if i ventured to hint that the illusion you pupil have be try to impose upon this venerable man have in some small measure impair the confidence with which i be originally inspire by you advantageous personal appearance not in the least reply the demon especially as i can easily make my word good if you and pachymius will mount my back i will transport you to panopoli where you can verify my assertion for yourselve the deity and the anchorite promptly consent and seat themselves on the demon 's shoulder the shadow of the fiend 's expand wing fall black and vast on the fiery sand but diminish and become invisible as he soar to a prodigious height to escape observation from below by-and-by the sun 's glowing ball touch earth at the extremity of the horizon it disappear the fire of sunset burn low in the west and the figure of the demon and he freight show like a black dot against a lake of green sky grow larger as he cautiously stoop to earth grazing temple skim pyramid the party come to ground in the precinct of panopoli just in time to avoid the rise moon that would have betray they the demon immediately disappear apollo hasten off to demand a explanation from nonnus while pachymius repair to a neighbouring convent people as he know by a legion of sturdy monk ever ready to smite and be smite in the cause of orthodoxy ii nonnus sit in he study wrinkle he brow as he polish he verse by the light of a small lamp a large scroll lay open on he knee the contents of which seem to afford he little satisfaction forty-eight more scroll resplendent with silver knob and coquettishly tie with purple cord repose in a adjoining book-case the forty-eight book manifestly of the panopolitan bard 's dionysiaca homer euripide and other poet lay on the floor have apparently be hurriedly dislodge to make room for diver liturgy and life of the saint a set of episcopal robe depend from a hook and on a side table stand half-a-dozen mitre which to all appearance the designate prelate have be try on nonnus say phoebus pass noiselessly through the unresisting wall the tale of thy apostasy be then true it would be difficult to determine whether surprise delight or dismay preponderate in nonnus 's expression as he lift up he eye and recognize the god of poetry he have just presence of mind to shuffle he scroll under a enormous dictionary ere he fall at apollo 's foot o phoebus he exclaim hadst thou come a week ago it be true then say apollo thou forsakest I and the muse thou sidest with they who have break we statue unroof we temple desecrate we altar and banish we from among mankind thou rejectest the glory of standing alone in a barbarous age as the last witness to culture and civilisation thou despisest the gift of the god and the muse of which i be even now the bearer thou preferrest the mitre to the laurel chaplet and the hymn of gregory to the epic of homer o phoebus reply nonnus be it any god but thou i should bend before he in silence have nought to reply but thou art a poet and thou understandest the temper of a poet thou knowest how beyond other man he be devour by the craving for sympathy this and not vulgar vanity be he motive of action he shaft be launch in vain unless he can deem it embedded in the heart of a friend thou mayest well judge what scoffing and reviling my dionysiac epic have bring upon I in this evil age yet have this be all peradventure i might have bear it but it be not all the gentle the good the affectionate they who in happier time would have be my audience come about I say nonnus why sing the strain against which we must shut we ear sing what we may listen to and we will love and honor thee i could not bear the thought of go to my grave without have awaken a echo of sympathy and weakly but not basely i have yield give they what they crave and suffer they since the muse ' garland be not theirs to bestow to reward I with a mitre and what demand they ask apollo oh a mere romance something entirely fabulous i must see it persist apollo and nonnus reluctantly disinter he scroll from under the big dictionary and hand it up tremble like a schoolboy who anticipate a castigation for a bad exercise what trash have we here cry phoebus -- -lrb- greek : achrono æn akichætos en arrætoos logo archæ -rrb- -lrb- greek : ` isophuæs genetæros omælikos tio amætoor -rrb- -lrb- greek : kai logo antophygoio theou phoo ek phaeo phoo -rrb- if it be not the beginning of the gospel of john thy impiety be worse than thy poetry apollo cast the scroll indignantly to the ground he countenance wear a expression so similar to that with which he be represent in act to smite the python that nonnus judge it prudent to catch up he manuscript and hold it shield-wise before he face thou doest well say apollo laughing bitterly that rampart be indeed impenetrable to my arrow nonnus seem about to fall prostrate when a sharp rap come to the door that be the governor 's knock he exclaim do not forsake I utterly o phoebus but as he turn to open the door apollo vanish the governor enter a sagacious good-humoured-looking man in middle life who be with thee just now he ask methought i hear voice merely the muse explain nonnus with whom i be wont to hold nocturnal communing indeed reply the governor then the muse have do well to take herself off and will do even better not to return bishop must have no flirtation with muse heavenly or earthly -- not that i be now altogether certain that thou _ wilt _ be a bishop how so asked nonnus not without a feeling of relief imagine my dear friend return the governor who should turn up this evening but that sordid anchorite pachymius to whom the see be promise indeed but who be report to have be devour by vermin in the desert the rumor seem so highly plausible that it must be fear that sufficient pain be not take to verify it -- can not have be in fact for as i say here he come have be bring as he affirm through the air by a angel little would it have signify if he have come by himself but he be accompany by three hundred monk carry cudgel who threaten a insurrection if he be not consecrate on the spot my friend the archbishop and i be at we wit ' end : we have set we heart on have a gentleman over the diocese but we can not afford to have tumult report at constantinople at last mainly through the mediation of a sable personage whom no one seem to know but who approve himself most intelligent and oblige the matter be put off till to-morrow when they and pachymius be to compete for the bishopric in public on condition not yet settle but which we swarthy friend undertake to arrange to every one 's satisfaction so keep up a good heart and do not run away in any case i know thou art timid but remember that there be no safety for thee but in victory if thou yieldest thou wilt be behead by I and if thou art defeat thou wilt certainly be burn by pachymius with this incentive to intrepidity the governor withdraw leave the poor poet in a pitiable state between remorse and terror one thing alone somewhat comfort he the mitre have vanish and the gift of the god lay on the table in they place whence he conclude that a friendly power might yet be watch over he iii next morning all panopoli be in a uproar it be generally know that the pretension of the candidate for the episcopate would be decide by public competition and it be rumor that this would partake of the nature of a ordeal by fire and water nothing further have transpire except that the arrangement have be settle by the governor and archbishop in concert with two stranger a dingy libyan and a handsome young greek neither of whom be know in the city but in both of whom the authority seem to repose entire confidence at the appoint time the people flock into the theater and find the stage already occupy by the party chiefly concern the governor and the archbishop sit in the center on they tribunal : the competitor stand on each side pachymius back by the demon nonnus by apollo both these supporter of course appear to the assembly in the light of ordinary mortal nonnus recognize apollo perfectly but pachymius 's limited power of intelligence seem entirely engross by the discomfort visibly occasion he by the proximity of a enormous brass vessel of water close to which burn a bright fire nonnus be also ill at ease and continually direct he attention to a large package of the contents of which he seem instinctively cognisant all be ready the governor rise from he seat and announce that with the sanction of he grace the archbishop the invidious task of determine between the claim of two such highly qualify competitor have be delegate to two gentleman in the enjoyment of he full confidence who would proceed to apply fitting test to the respective candidate should one fail and the other succeed the victor would of course be institute should both undergo the probation successfully new criterion of merit would be devise should both fall short both would be set aside and the dispute mitre would be confer elsewhere he would first summon nonnus long they fellow-citizen and now they fellow-christian to submit himself to the test propose apollo now rise and proclaim in a audible voice by virtue of the authority commit to I i call upon nonnus of panopoli candidate for the bishopric of he native city to demonstrate he fitness for the same by consign to the flame with he own hand the forty-eight execrable book of heathen poetry compose by he in the day of he darkness and blindness but now without doubt as detestable to he as to the universal body of the faithful so say he make a sign to a attendant the wrapping of the package fall away and the forty-eight scroll of the dionysiaca silver knob purple cord and all come to view burn my poem exclaim nonnus destroy the labor of twenty-four year bereave egypt of its homer erase the name of nonnus from the tablet of time how so while thou hast the paraphrase of st john demand apollo maliciously indeed good youth say the governor who wish to favor nonnus methink the condition be somewhat exorbitant a single book might suffice surely i be quite content reply apollo if he consent to burn any of he book he be no poet and i wash my hand of he come nonnus cry the governor make haste one book will do as well as another hand they up here it must be with he own hand please you excellency say apollo then cry the governor pitch to the poet the first scroll bring to he the thirteenth book who care about the thirteenth book pop it in the thirteenth book exclaim nonnus contain the contest between wine and honey without which my epic become totally and entirely unintelligible this then say the governor pick out another which chance to be the seventeenth in my seventeenth book object nonnus bacchus plant vine in indium and the superiority of wine to milk be convincingly demonstrate well rejoin the governor what say you to the twenty-second with my hamadryad i can never give up my hamadryad then say the governor contemptuously hurl the whole set in the direction of nonnus burn which you will only burn the wretched poet sit among he scroll look for a victim all he forty-eight child be equally dear to he parental heart the cry of applause and derision from the spectator and the formidable bellowing of the exasperated monk who surround pachymius do not tend to steady he nerve or render the task of critical discrimination the easier i will not i will not he exclaim at last start up defiantly let the bishopric go to the devil any one of my simile be worth all the bishopric in egypt out on the vanity of these poet exclaim the disappointed governor it be not vanity say apollo it be paternal affection and be myself a sufferer from the same infirmity i rejoice to find he my true son after all well say the governor turn to the demon : it be thy man 's turn now trot he out brethren say the demon to the assembly it be meet that he who aspire to the office of bishop should be prepare to give evidence of extraordinary self-denial ye have see even we weak brother nonnus adoring what he have burn albeit as yet unwilling to burn what he have adore how much more may be reasonably expect of we brother pachymius so eminent for sanctity i therefore call upon he to demonstrate he humility and self-renunciation and effectually mortify the natural man by wash himself in this ample vessel provide for the purpose wash myself exclaim pacyhmius with a vivacity of which he have previously show no token destroy at one splash the sanctity of fifty-seven year avaunt thou subtle enemy of my salvation i know thee who thou art the demon who bring I hither on he back yesterday i think it have be a angel say the governor a demon in the disguise of a angel of light say pachymius a tumultuous discussion arise among pachymius 's supporter some extol he fortitude other blame he wrongheadedness what say he to the latter would ye rob I of my reputation shall it be write of I the holy pachymius abode in the precept of the eremite so long as he dwell in the desert where no water be but as soon as he come within sight of a bath he stumble and fall oh father urge they savoureth not this of vaingloriousness the demon in the guise of a angel of light as thou so well saidest even now be strong quit thyself valiantly think of the suffering of the primitive confessor st john be cast into a caldron of boiling oil say one st apocryphus be actually drown say another i have reason to believe say a third that the loathsomeness of ablution have be greatly exaggerate by the heretic i know it have say another i _ have _ washed myself once though ye might not think it and can assert that it be by no means as disagreeable as one suppose that be just what i dread say pachymius little by little one might positively come to like it we should resist the beginning of evil all this time the crowd of he supporter have be press upon the anchorite and have imperceptibly force he nearer the edge of the vessel purposing at a convenient season to throw he in he be now near enough to catch a glimpse of the limpid element recoil in horror he collect all he energy and with head depressed towards he chest and hand thrust forth as if to ward off pollution -- but kick bite the air -- he rush forwards and with a preternatural force deserving to be enumerate among he miracle fairly overthrow the enormous vase the contents streaming on the crowd in front of the stage take I to my hermitage he scream i renounce the bishopric take I to my hermitage amen respond the demon and assume he proper shape he take pachymius upon he back and fly away with he amid the cheer of the multitude pachymius be speedily deposit at the mouth of he cavern where he receive the visit of the neighbouring anchorite who come to congratulate he on the constancy with which he have sustain he fiery or rather watery trial he spend most of he remain day in the society of the devil on which account he be canonise at he death o phoebus say nonnus when they be alone impose upon I any penance thou wilt so i may but regain thy favor and that of the muse but before all thing let I destroy my paraphrase thou shalt not destroy it say phoebus thou shalt publish it that shall be thy penance and so it be that the epic on the exploit of bacchus and the paraphrase of st john 's gospel have alike come down to we as the work of nonnus whose authorship of both learn man have never be able to deny have regard to the similarity of style but never could explain until the fact above narrate come to light in one of the fayoum papyrus recently acquire by the archduke rainer the purple head half ignorant they turn a easy wheel that set sharp rack at work to pinch and peel i in the heyday of the emperor aurelian 's greatness when he strong right arm prop rome up and hew palmyra down when he surround he capital with wall fifty mile in circuit and lead tetricus and zenobium in triumph through its street and distribute elephant among the senator and lay etrurium out in vineyard and contemplate in leisure moment the suppression of christianity as a subordinate detail of administration a mere ripple on the broad ocean of he policy -- at this period bahram the first king of persium

jupiter capitolinus this must not be i will send a embassy to he and impress he with my greatness but how he accordingly convoke he counsellor the vizier the warrior the magus the philosopher and address they thus : the king deign to consult ye touch a difficult matter i would flatter the pride of rome without lower the pride of persium i would propitiate aurelian and at the same time humble he how shall this be accomplish the vizier the warrior and the magus answer not a word unbroken silence reign in the assembly until the turn come to the sage marcobad who prostrate himself say o king

from the uttermost part of indium i approve thy advice reply bahram and in return will save thy life by banish thee from my dominion when my August consort shall learn that thou hast be the means of deprive she of she robe she will undoubtedly request that thou mayest be flay and thou knowest that i can deny she nothing i therefore counsel thee to depart with all possible swiftness repair to the region where the purple be produce and if thou returnest with a adequate supply i undertake that my royal sceptre shall be graciously extend to thee the philosopher forsake the royal presence with celerity and he office of chief examiner of court spikenard be bestow upon another as also he house and he garden he gold and he silver he wife and he concubine he camel and he ass which be numerous while the solitary adventurer wend he way eastward a gorgeous embassy travel westward in the direction of rome arrive in the presence of aurelian and at the conclusion of he complimentary harangue the chief envoy produce a cedar casket from which he draw a purple robe of such surpassing refulgence that in the word of the historian who have record the transaction the purple of the emperor and of the matron appear ashy gray in comparison it be accompany by a letter thus conceive : bahram to aurelian : health receive such purple as we have in persium persium forsooth exclaim sorianus a young philosopher verse in natural science this purple never be in persium except as a rarity oh the mendacity and vanity of these oriental the ambassador be begin a angry reply when aurelian quell the dispute with a look and with some awkwardness deliver himself of a brief oration in acknowledgment of the gift he take no more notice of the matter until nightfall when he send for sorianus and inquire where the purple actually be produce in the uttermost part of indium return the philosopher well rejoin aurelian sum up the matter with he accustomed rapidity and clearness of head either thou or the persian king have lie to I it be plain and by the favor of the god it be immaterial which see that my ground for go to war with he be equally good in either case if he have seek to deceive I i be right in punish he if he possess what i lack i be justified in take it away it would however be convenient to know which of these grounds to inscribe in my manifesto moreover i be not ready for hostility at present have first to extirpate the blemmye carpus and other barbarian vermin i will therefore despatch thee to indium to ascertain by personal examination the truth about the purple do not return without it or i shall cut off thy head my treasury will charge itself with the administration of thy property during thy absence the robe shall meanwhile be deposit in the temple of jupiter capitolinus may he have it and thee in he holy keep thus in that age of darkness be two most eminent philosopher reduce to beggary and constrain to wander in remote and insalubrious region the one for advise a king the other for instruct a emperor but the matter do not rest here for aurelian have continue the visible deity of half the world for one hundred and fifty day after the departure of sorianus be slay by he own general to he succeed tacitus who sink oppress by the weight of rule to he probus who perish in a military tumult to he carus who be kill by lightning to he carinus who be assassinate by one whom he have wrong to he diocletian who have maintain himself for twenty year wisely forbear to tempt nemesis further and retire to plant cabbage at salona all these sovereign differ from each other in every other respect agree in a common desire to possess the purple dye and when the philosopher return not successively despatch new emissary in quest of it strange be the diversity of fate which befall these envoy some fall into the jaw of lion some be crush by monstrous serpent some trample by elephant at the command of native prince some perish of hunger and some of thirst some encounter smooth-browed and dark-tressed girl wreathe they hair with the champak blossom or bathing by moonlight in lotus-mantled tank forsake they quest and lead thenceforth idyllic life in grove of banian and of palm some become enamoured of the principle of the gymnosophist some couch themselves for uneasy slumber upon bed of spike ween to wake in the twenty-second heaven all which romantic variety of fortune be the work of a diminutive insect that crawl or cling heedless of the purple it be weave into the many-coloured web of human life ii some thirty year after the departure of the persian embassy to aurelian two traveller meet at the bottom of a dell in trans-gangetic indium have descend the hill-brow by opposite path it be early morning the sun have not yet surmount the timbered and tangled side of the little valley so that the bottom still lay steep in shadow and glitter with large pearl of limpid dew while the oval space of sky circumscribe by the summit glow with the delicate splendor of the purest sapphire song of bird resound through the brake and the water lily which veil the rivulet trickle through the depths of the retreat be unexpanded still one of the wayfarer be age the other a man of the latest period of middle life they raiment be scanty and soil they frame and countenance alike bespoke fatigue and hardship but while the elder one move with moderate alacrity the other shuffle painfully along by the help of a staff shrink every time that he place either of he foot on the ground they exchange look and greeting as they encounter and the more active of the two whose face be set in a easterly direction venture a compassionate allusion to the other 's apparent distress ' i but suffer from the usual effect of crucifixion ' return the other and remove he sandal display two wound completely penetrate each foot the cross have not yet announce victory to constantine and be as yet no passport to respectable society the first traveller draw back hastily and regard he companion with surprise and suspicion i see what be pass in thy mind resume the latter with a smile but be under no apprehension i have not undergo the censure of any judicial tribunal my crucifixion be merely a painful but necessary incident in my laudable enterprise of obtain the marvellous purple dye to which end i be despatch unto these region by the emperor aurelian the purple dye exclaim the persian for it be he thou hast obtain it i have it be the product of insect find only in a certain valley eastward from hence to obtain access to which it be before all thing needful to elude the vigilance of seven dragon thou didst elude they and afterwards inquire marcobad with eagerness afterwards repeat sorianus i make my way into the valley where i descry the remains of my immediate predecessor prefix to a cross thy predecessor he who have last make the attempt before I upon any one 's penetrate the valley of purple as it be term with the design i have indicate the inhabitant observant of the precept of they ancestor append he to a cross by the foot only confine he arm by rope at the shoulder and set vessel of cool drink within he grasp if overcome with thirst he partake of the beverage they leave he to expire at leisure if he endure for three day he be permit to depart with the object of he quest my predecessor belong as i conjecture to the epicurean persuasion and consequently unable to resist the allurement of sense have perish in the manner aforesaid i a stoic refrain and attain thou didst bear away the tincture thou hast it now impetuously interrogate the persian behold it reply the greek exhibit a small flask fill with the most gorgeous purple liquid what seest thou here demand he triumphantly hold it up to the light to I this vial display the university of athen and throng of fair youth hearken to the discourse of one who resemble myself to my vision respond the persian peer at the vial it rather reveal a palace and a dress of honor but suffer I to contemplate it more closely for my eye have wax dim by over application to study so say he snatch the flask from sorianus and immediately turn to fly the greek spring after he treasure and fail to grasp marcobad 's wrist seize he beard pluck the hair out by handful the infuriate persian smite he on the head with the crystal flagon it burst into shiver and the priceless contents gush forth in a torrent over the uncovered head and uplifted visage of sorianus bathing every hair and feature with the most vivid purple the aghast and thunderstricken philosopher remain gaze at each other for a moment it be indelible cry sorianus in distraction rush down however to the brink of the little stream and plunge he head beneath the water they carry away a cloud of purple but leave the purple head stain as before the philosopher as he upraise he glowing and drip countenance from the brook resemble silenus emerge from one of the river which bacchus metamorphose into wine during he campaign in indium he resort to attrition and contrition to maceration and laceration he try friction with leaf with grass with sedge with he garment he regard himself in one crystal pool after another a grotesque anti-narcissus at last he fling himself on the earth and give free course to he anguish the grace of repentance be rarely deny we when we misdeed have prove unprofitable marcobad awkwardly approach brother he whisper i will restore the tincture of which i have deprive thee and add thereto a antidote if such may be find await my return under this camphor tree so say he hasten up the path by which sorianus have descend and be speedily out of sight iii sorianus tarry long under the camphor tree but at last become weary resume he travels until emerge from the wilderness he enter the dominion of the king of ayodhya he extraordinary appearance speedily attract the attention of the royal officer by whom he be apprehend and bring before he majesty it be evident pronounce the monarch after bestow he attention on the case that thou art in possession of a object too rare and precious for a private individual of which thou must accordingly be deprive i lament the inconvenience thou wilt sustain i would it have be thy hand or thy foot sorianus acknowledge the royal considerateness but plead the indefeasible right of property which he conceive himself to have acquire in he own head in respect respond the royal logician that thy head be conjoin to thy shoulder it be thine but in respect that it be purple it be mine purple be a royal monopoly thy claim be found on anatomy mine on jurisprudence shall matter prevail over mind shall medicine the most uncertain of science override law the perfection of human reason it be but to the vulgar observation that thou appearest to have a head at all in the eye of the law thou art acephalous i would submit urge the philosopher that the corporal connection of my head with my body be a essential property the color of it a fortuitous accident thou mightest as well contend return the king that the law be bind to regard thee in thy abstract condition as a human being and be disabled from take cognisance of thy acquire capacity of smuggler -- rebel i might say see that thou hast assume the purple but the imputation of cruelty which might attach to you majesty 's proceedings there can be no cruelty where there be no injustice if any there be it must be on thy part since as i have demonstrate so far from my despoil thee of thy head it be thou who iniquitously withholdest mine i will labor to render this even clearer to thy apprehension thou art find as thou must need admit in possession of a contraband article forfeit to the crown by operation of law what then shall the intention of the legislature be frustrate because thou hast insidiously render the possession of _ my _ property inseparable from the possession of _ thine _ shall i a innocent proprietor be mulct of my right by thy fraud and covin justice howl righteousness weep integrity stand aghast at the bare notion no friend thy head have not a leg to stand on wouldst thou retain it it behove thee to show that it will be more serviceable to the owner namely myself upon thy shoulder than elsewhere this may well be hast thou peradventure any subtlety in perfumery any secret in confectionery any skill in the preparation of soup i have condescend to none of these frivolity o king my study have ever consist in divine philosophy whereby man be render equal to the god and yet long most of all for purple retort the monarch as i conclude from perceive thou hast after all prefer the latter thy head must indeed be worth the take thy taunt be merit o king i will importune thee no longer thou wilt indeed render I a service in deprive I of this wretched head hideous without and i must fear empty within see that it have not prevent I from waste my life in the service of vanity and luxury woe to the sage who trust he infirm wisdom and frail integrity within the precinct of a court yet can i foretell a time when philosopher shall no longer run on the futile and selfish errand of king and when king shall be suffer to rule only so far as they obey the bidding of philosopher peace knowledge liberty -- the king of ayodhya possess beyond all prince of he age the art of gracefully interrupt a unseasonable discourse he slightly sign to a courtier in attendance a scimitar flash for a moment from its scabbard and the head of sorianus roll on the pavement the lip murmur as though still strive to dwell with inarticulate fondness upon the last word of hope for mankind it soon appear that the principle of life be essential to the resplendence of the purple head within a few minute it have assume so ghastly a hue that the rajah himself be intimidate and direct that it should be consume with the body the same full-moon that watch the white-robed throng busy with the rite of incremation in a grove of palm behold also the seven dragon contend for the body of marcobad but for many a year the maid and matron of rome be not weary of regard extolling and covet the priceless purple tissue that glow in the fane of jupiter capitolinus the firefly a certain magician have retire for the sake of study to a cottage in a forest it be summer in a hot country in the tree near the cottage dwell a most beautiful firefly the light she bear with she be dazzling yet soft and palpitating as the evening star and she seem a single flash of fire as she shoot in and out suddenly from under the screen of foliage or like a lamp as she perch pant upon some leaf or hung glowing from some bough or like a wander meteor as she eddy gleam over the summit of the loftiest tree as she often do for she be a ambitious firefly she learn to know the magician and would sometimes alight and sit shine in he hair or trail she lustre across he book as she creep over the page the magician admire she above all thing : what eye she would have if she be a woman think he once he say aloud how happy you must be you rare beautiful brilliant creature i be not happy rejoin the firefly what be i after all but a fly beetle with a candle in my tail i wish i be a star very well say the magician and touch she with he wand when she become a beautiful star in the twelfth degree of the sign pisce after some night the magician ask she if she be content i be not reply she when i be a firefly i could fly whither i would and come and go as i pleased now i must rise and set at certain time and shine just so long and no longer i can not fly at all and only creep slowly across the sky in the day i can not shine or if i do no one see I i be often darken by rain and mist and cloud even when i shine my brightest i be less admire than when i be a firefly there be so many other like I i see indeed people look up from the earth by night towards I but how do i know that they be look at I the law of nature will have it so return the magician do not talk to I of the law of nature rejoin the firefly i do not make they and i do not see why i should be compel to obey they make I something else what would you be demand the accommodate magician as i creep along here reply the star i see such a soft pure track of light it proceed from the lamp in you study it flow out of you window like a river of molten silver both cool and warm let I be such a lamp be it so answer the magician : and the star become a lovely alabaster lamp set in a alcove in he study she chaste radiance be shed over he page as long as he continue to read at a certain hour he extinguish she and retire to rest next morning the lamp be in a terrible humor i do not choose to be blow out she say you would have go out of you own accord else return the magician what exclaim the lamp be i not shine by my own light certainly not : you be not now a firefly or a star you must now depend upon other you would be dark for ever if i do not rekindle you by the help of this oil what cry the lamp not shine of my own accord never make I a everlasting lamp or i will not be one at all alas poor friend return the magician sadly there be but one place where aught be everlasting i can make thee a lamp of the sepulchre content respond the lamp and the magician make she one of those strange occult lamp which man find ever and anon when they unseal the tomb of ancient king and wizard sustain without nutriment a perpetual flame and he bear she to a sepulchre where a great king be lie embalmed and perfect in he golden raiment and set she at the head of the corpse and whether the poor fitful firefly find at last rest in the grave we may know when we come thither ourselves but the magician close the gate of the sepulchre behind he and walk thoughtfully home and as he approach he cottage behold another firefly darting and flash in and out among the tree as brilliantly as ever the first have do she be a wise firefly well satisfy with the world and everything in it more particularly she own tail and if the magician would have make a pet of she no doubt she would have abode with he but he never look at she pan 's wand iridion have break she lily a misfortune for any rustic nymph but especially for she since she life depend upon it from she birth the fate of iridion have be associate with that of a flower of unusual loveliness -- a stately candid lily endowed with a charmed life like its possessor the season come and go without leave a trace upon it innocence and beauty seem as endure with it as evanescent with the child of man in equal though dissimilar loveliness its frolicsome young mistress nourish by its side one thing alone the oracle have declare could prejudice either and this be a accident to the flower from such disaster it have long be shield by the most delicate care yet in the inscrutable counsel of the god the dreaded calamity have at length come to pass break through the upper part of the stem the listless flower droop its petal towards the earth and seem to mourn they chastity already sully by the wan flaccidity of decay not one have fall as yet and iridion feel no pain or any symptom of approach dissolution except it may be the unwonted seriousness with which have exhaust all she simple skill on behalf of the languish plant she sit down to consider its fate in the light of its bearing upon she own meditation upon a utterly vague subject whether of apprehension or of hope speedily lapse into reverie to iridion death be as indefinable a object of think as the twin omnipotent controller of human destiny love love like the immature fruit on the bough hang unsoliciting and unsolicited as yet but slowly ripen to the maiden 's hand death a vague film in a illimitable sky temper without obscure the sunshine of she life confront with it suddenly she find it in truth a impalpable cloud and herself as little competent as the gravest philosopher to answer the self-suggested inquiry what shall i be when i be no longer iridion superstition might have help she to some definite conception but superstition do not exist in she time judge reader of its remoteness the maiden 's reverie might have terminate only with she existence but for the salutary law which prohibit a young girl not in love or at school from sit still more than ten minute as she shift she seat at the expiration of something like this period she perceive that she have be sit on a goatskin and with a natural association of idea -- i will ask pan she exclaim pan at that time inhabit a cavern hard by the maiden 's dwelling which the judicious reader will have divine could only have be situate in arcadium the honest god be on excellent term with the simple people he goat browse freely along with theirs and the most melodious of the rustic minstrel attribute they proficiency to he instruction the maiden be on a more reserved footing of intimacy -- at least so they wish it to be understand and so it be understand of course iridion however decide that the occasion would warrant she incur the risk even of a kiss and lose no time in set forth upon she errand carry she poor broken flower in its earthen vase it be the time of day when the god might be suppose to be arouse himself from he afternoon 's siesta she do not fear that he door would be close against she for he have no door the sylvan deity stand in fact at the entrance of he cavern about to proceed in quest of he goat the appearance of iridion operate a change in he intention and he courteously escort she to a seat of turf erect for the special accommodation of he fair visitor while he place for himself one of stone pan she begin i have break my lily that be a sad pity child if it have be a reed now you could have make a flute of it i should not have time pan and she recount she story a godlike nature can not confound truth with falsehood though it may mistake falsehood for truth pan therefore never doubt iridion 's strange narrative and have hear it to the end observe you will find plenty more lily in elysium common lily pan not like mine you be wrong the lily of elysium -- asphodel as they call they there -- be as immortal as the elysian themselves i have see they in proserpine 's hair at jupiter 's entertainment they be as fresh as she be there be no doubt you might gather they by handful -- at least if you have any hand -- and wear they to you heart 's content if you have but a heart that be just what perplex I pan it be not the die i mind it be the live how be i to live without anything alive about I if you take away my hand and my heart and my brain and my eye and my ear and above all my tongue what be leave I to live in elysium as the maiden spake a petal detach itself from the emaciated lily and she press she hand to she brow with a responsive cry of pain poor child say pan compassionately you will feel no more pain by-and-by i suppose not pan since you say so but if i can feel no pain how can i feel any pleasure in a incomprehensible manner say pan how can i feel if i have no feeling and what be i to do without it you can think reply pan thinking -lrb- not that i be greatly give to it myself -rrb- be a much finer thing than feel no right-minded person doubt that feeling as i have hear minerva say be a property of matter and matter except of course that appertain to myself and the other happy god be vile and perishable -- quite immaterial in fact thought alone be transcendent incorruptible and undying but pan how can any one think thought without something to think they with i never think of anything that i have not see or touch or smell or taste or hear about from some one else if i think with nothing and about nothing be that think do you think i think answer pan evasively that you be a sensationalist a materialist a sceptic a revolutionist and if you have not seek the assistance of a god i should have say not much better than a atheist i also think it be time i think about some physic for you instead of metaphysics which be bad for my head and for you soul say this pan with rough tenderness deposit the almost faint maiden upon a couch of fern and have support she head with a bundle of herb lean he own upon he hand and reflect with all he might the decline sun be now nearly opposite the cavern 's mouth and he ray straggle through the creeper that weave they intricacy over the entrance chequer with lustrous patch the form of the die girl and the meditate god ever and anon a petal would drop from the flower this be always succeed by a shudder tremor throughout iridion 's frame and a more forlorn expression on she pallid countenance : while pan 's jovial feature assume a expression of deeper concern as he press he knotty hand more resolutely against he shaggy forehead and wring he dexter horn with a more determined grasp as though he have catch a burrow idea by the tail aha he suddenly exclaim i have it what have you pan faintly lisp the expire iridion instead of reply pan grasp a wand that lean against the wall of he grot and with it touch the maiden and the flower o strange metamorphosis where the latter have be pine in its vase a lovely girl the image of iridion lay along the ground with dishevelled hair clammy brow and feature slightly distort by the last struggle of death on the ferny couch stand a earthen vase from which rise a magnificent lily stately with unfractured stem and with no stain or wrinkle on its numerous petal aha repeat pan i think we be ready for he now then have lift the inanimate body to the couch and place the vase with its contents on the floor of he cavern he step to the entrance and shade he eye with he hand seem to gaze abroad in quest of some anticipated visitor the bough at the foot of the steep path to the cave divide and a figure appear at the foot of the rock the stranger 's mien be majestic but the fitness of he proportion diminish he really colossal stature to something more nearly the measure of mortality he form be envelop in a sweeping sad-coloured robe a light thin veil rest on he countenance mitigate without conceal the not ungentle austerity of he marble feature he gait be remarkable nothing could be more remote from every indication of haste yet such be the actual celerity of he progression that pan have scarcely behold he ere he start to find he already at he side the stranger without disturb he veil seem to comprehend the whole interior of the grotto with a glance then with the slightest gesture of recognition to pan he glide to the couch on which lay the metamorphose lily upraise the fictitious iridion in he arm with indescribable gentleness and disappear with she as swiftly and silently as he have come the discreet pan struggle with suppress merriment until the stranger be fairly out of hearing then throw himself back upon he seat and laugh till the cave ring and now he say to finish the business he lift the transform maiden into the vase and caress she beauty with a exult but careful hand there be a glory and a splendor in the flower such as have never until then be behold in any earthly lily the stem vibrate the leaf shake in unison the petal pant and suspire and seem blanch with a whiteness intense as the core of sunlight as they throb in anticipation of the richer existence await they impatient to complete he task pan be about to grasp he wand when the motion be arrest as the sink beam of the sun be intercept by a gigantic shadow and the stranger again stand by he side the unbidden guest utter no word but he manner be sufficiently expressive of wrath as he disdainfully cast on the ground a broken withered lily the relic of what have bloom with such loveliness in the morning and have since for a brief space be array in the vesture of humanity he point imperiously to the gorgeous tenant of the vase and seem to expect pan to deliver it forthwith look here say pan with more decision than dignity i be a poor country god but i know the law if you can find on this plant one speck one stain one token that you have anything to do with she take she and welcome if you can not take yourself off instead be it so return the stranger haughtily decline the proffer inspection you will find it be ill joke with death so say he quit the cavern pan sit down chuckle yet not wholly at ease for if the charity of death be beautiful even to a mortal he anger be terrible even to a god anxious to terminate the adventure he reach towards the charm wand by whose wonderful instrumentality the die maiden have already become a living flower and be now to undergo a yet more delightful metamorphosis wondrous wand but where be it for death the great transfigurer of all below this lunar sphere have give pan a characteristic proof of he superior cunning where the wand have repose writhe a ghastly worm which as pan 's glance fall upon it glide towards he uplift its head with a aspect of defiance pan 's immortal nature sicken at the emblem of corruption he could not for all olympus have touch he metamorphosed treasure as he shrink back the creature pursue its way towards the vase but a marvellous change befall it as it come under the shadow of the flower the writhe body divide end from end the sordid scale sink indiscernibly into the dust and a exquisite butterfly arise from the ground alight on the lily and remain for a moment fan its wing in the last sunbeam ere it unclose they to the evening breeze pan look eagerly after the psyche in its flight do not perceive what be take place in the cavern but the magic wand now for ever lose to its possessor must have cancel its own spell for when he gaze revert from the ineffectual pursuit the living lily have disappear and iridion lay a corpse upon the ground the fade flower of she destiny repose upon she breast death now stand for a third time upon pan 's threshold but pan heed he not a page from the book of folly that own the virtuous ring and glass -lrb- -- _ il penseroso _ -rrb- i aurelia otto must we then part they be fold in each other 's arm there never be such kiss how shall we henceforth exchange the sweet token of we undying affection my otto alas my aurelium i know not thy otto blush to acquaint thee that he can not write blush not my otto thou needest not reproach thyself even couldest thou write thy aurelium could not read oh these dark age they remain some minute gaze on each other with a expression of fond perplexity suddenly the damsel 's feature assume the aspect of one who experience the visitation of a happy thought gently yet decidedly she pronounce : we will exchange ring they draw off they ring simultaneously this aurelium be my grandfather 's this otto be my grandmother 's which she charge I with she die breath never to part with save to he whom alone i love mine be a brilliant more radiant than aught save the eye of my aurelium and in fact aurelium 's eye hardly sustain the comparison a finer stone could not easily be find mine be a sapphire azure as the everlasting heaven and type of a constancy endure as they in truth it be of a tint seldom to be meet with in sapphire the exchange make the lady seem less anxious to detain she lover beware otto she cry as he slide down the cord which yield he a oscillatory transit from she casement to the moat where he alight knee-deep in mud beware -- if my brother should be gaze from he chamber on the resplendent moon but that ferocious young baron be accustom to spend he time in a less romantic manner and so it come to pass that otto encounter he not ii day week month have pass by and otto a wanderer in a foreign land have hear no tiding of he aurelium ye who have love may well conceive how she ring be all in all to he he divide he time pretty equally between gaze into its cerulean depths as though she lovely image be mirror therein and press its chilly surface to he lip little as it recall the warmth and balminess of hers the burnish glow of gold the chaste sheen of silver the dance and sparkle of light in multitudinous gem arrest he attention as he one evening perambulate the street of a great city he behold a jeweller 's shop the grey-headed spectacled lapidary sit at a bench within sedulously polish a streak pebble by the light of a small lamp a sudden thought strike otto he enter the shop and present the ring to the jeweller inquire in a tone of suppress exultation : what hold you for the worth of this inestimable ring the jeweller with no expression of surprise or curiosity receive the ring from otto hold it to the light glance slightly at the stone somewhat more carefully at the setting lay the ring for a moment in a pair of light scale and hand it back to otto remark with a tone and manner of the most entire indifference : the worth of this inestimable ring be one shilling and sixpence caitiff of a huckster exclaim otto bring down he fist on the bench with such vigor that the pebble leap up and fall rattle down : sayest thou this of a gem frame by genie in the bowels of the earth nay friend return the jeweller with the same imperturbable air that thy gem be frame of earth i in nowise question see that it doth principally consist of sand but when thou speakest of genie and the bowels of the earth thou wilt not i hope take it amiss if i crave better proof than thy word that the devil have take to glass-making for glass and nothing else credit I thy jewel be and the gold gasp otto there be just as much gold in thy ring as sufficeth to gild handsomely a like superficies of brass which be not say much and apply a sponge dip in some liquid to a small part of the hoop the jeweller disclose the dull hue of the baser metal so evidently that otto could hardly doubt longer he doubt no more when the lapidary lay he ring in the scale against another of the same size and make and point to the inequality of the balance thou seest he continue that in we craft a very little gold go a very great way it be far otherwise in the world as thou albeit in no sort eminent for sapience hast doubtless ere this ascertain for thyself thou art evidently a prodigious fool this latter disparage observation could be safely venture upon as otto have rush from the shop speechless with rage be aurelia deceiver or deceive should he execrate she or she venerable grandmother or some unknown person the point be too knotty to be solve in the agitate state of he feeling he decide it provisionally by execrate the entire human race not forget himself in a mood like otto 's a trifling circumstance be sufficient to determine the quality of action the ancient city of which he be at the time a inhabitant be traverse by a large river span by a quaint and many-arched bridge to which he frantic and aimless wanderings have conduct he spire and gable and lengthy façades be reflect in the water blended with the shadow of boat and intersperse with the mirror flame of innumerable window on land or of lantern suspend from the mast or stern of the vessel the dancing ripple bicker and flicker and seem to say come hither to we while the dark reach of still water in the shadow of the pier promise that whatever might be entrust to they should be faithfully retain sway by a sudden impulse otto draw he ring from he finger it gleam a instant aloft in air in another the relaxation of he grasp would have consign it to the stream forbear otto turn and perceive a singular figure by he side the stranger be tall and thin and attire in a dusky cloak which only partially conceal a flame-coloured jerkin a cock 's feather peak up in he cap he eye be piercingly brilliant he nose be aquiline the expression of he feature sinister and sardonic have otto be more observant or less preoccupy he might have notice that the stranger 's left shoe be of a peculiar form and that he limp some little with the corresponding foot forbear i say thou knowest not what thou doest and what skill what i do with a piece of common glass thou errest friend thy ring be not common glass have thy mistress surmise its mystic virtue she would have think oftener than twice ere exchange it for thy diamond what may these virtue be eagerly demand otto in the first place it will show thee when thy mistress may chance to think of thee as it will then prick thy finger now i know thee for a lie knave exclaim the youth indignantly learn to thy confusion that it have not prick I once since i parted from aurelium which prove that she have never once think of thee villain shout otto say that again and i will transfix thee thou mayest if thou canst rejoin the stranger with a expression of such cut scorn that otto 's spirit quail and he feel a secret but overpowering conviction of he interlocutor 's veracity rally however in some measure he exclaim : aurelium be true i will wager my soul upon it do scream the stranger in a strident voice of triumph while a burst of diabolical laughter seem to proceed from every cranny of the eaves and pier of the old bridge and to be take up by goblin echo from the summit of the adjacent tower and steeple otto 's blood run chill but he muster sufficient courage to inquire hoarsely : what of its further virtue when it shall have prick thee return the mysterious personage on turn it once completely round thy finger thou wilt see thy mistress wherever she may be if thou turnest it the second time thou wilt know what she thought of thee be and if the third time thou wilt find thyself in she presence but i give thee fair warning that by do this thou wilt place thyself in a more disastrous plight than any thou hast experience hitherto and now farewell the speaker disappear otto stand alone upon the bridge he see nothing around he but the stream with its shadow and light as he slowly and thoughtfully turn round to walk to he lodgings iii ye who have love et cetera as aforesaid will comprehend the anxiety with which otto henceforth consult he ring he be continually adjust it to he finger in a manner as he fancy to render the anticipated puncture more perceptible when it should come at last he would have worn it on all he finger in succession have the conformation of he robust hand admit of its be place on any but the slenderest thousand of time he could have swear that he feel the admonitory sting thousand of time he turn the trinket round and round with desperate impatience but aurelium 's form remain as invisible she thought as inscrutable as before he great dread be that he might be prick in he sleep on which account he would sit up watch far into the morn for as he reason not without plausibility when could he more rationally hope for a place in aurelium 's thought than at that witching and suggestive period she might surely think of he when she have nothing else to do have she really nothing else to do and otto grow sick and livid with jealousy it of course frequently occur to he to doubt and deride the virtue of the ring and he be several time upon the point of fling it away but the more he ponder upon the appearance and manner of the stranger the less able he feel to resist the conviction of he truthfulness at last a most unmistakable puncture the distinct though slight pang of a miniature wound a crimson bead of blood rise on otto 's finger swell to its due proportion and become a trickle blot she be think of I cry he rapturously as if this be a instance of the most signal and unforeseen condescension all the weary expectancy of the last six month be forget he would have rail at himself have the bliss of the moment allow he to remember that he have ever rail at she otto turn he ring once and aurelium become visible in a instant she be stand before the mercer 's booth in the chief street of the little town which adjoin she father 's castle she gaze be rivet on a silk mantle trim with costly fur which depend from a hook inside the doorway she lovely feature wear a expression of extreme dissatisfaction she be replace a purse apparently by no means weighty in she embroidered girdle otto turn the ring the second time and aurelium 's silvery accent immediately become audible to the following effect : if that fool otto be here he would buy it for I she turn away and walk down the street otto utter a cry like the shriek of a uproot mandrake he hand be upon the ring to turn it for the third time but the stranger 's warning occur to he and for a moment he forbear in that moment the entire vision vanish from before he eye what boot it to describe otto 's feeling upon this revelation of aurelium 's sentiment for lover description would be needless to wiser people incomprehensible suffice it to say that as he lady deem he a fool he appear bent on prove that she do not deem amiss a long space of time elapse without any further admonition from the ring perhaps aurelia have no further occasion for he purse perhaps she have find another pursebearer the latter view of the case appear the more plausible to otto and it hugely aggravate he torment at last the moment come it be the hour of midnight again otto feel the sharp puncture again the ruby drop start from he finger again he turn the ring and again behold aurelium she be in she chamber but not alone she companion be a youth of otto 's age she be in the act of place otto 's brilliant upon he finger otto turn he own ring and hear she utter with singular distinctness : this ring be give I by the greatest fool i ever know little do he imagine that it would one day be the means of procure I liberty and bliss in the arm of my arnold my venerable grandmother -- the voice expire upon she lip for otto stand before she arnold precipitate himself from the window carry the ring with he otto glaring at he faithless mistress stand in the middle of the apartment with he sword unsheathe be he about to use it none can say for at this moment the young baron burst into the room and without the slightest apology for the liberty he be take pass he sword through otto 's body otto groan and fall upon he face he be dead the young baron ungently reverse the position of the corpse and scan its feature with evident surprise and dissatisfaction it be not arnold after all he mutter who would have think it thou seest brother how unjust be thy suspicion observe aurelium with a air of injured but not implacable virtue as for this abominable ravisher -- she feeling forbid she to proceed the brother look mystified there be something beyond he comprehension in the affair yet he could not but acknowledge that otto be the person who have rush by he as he lay in wait upon the stair he finally determine that it be best to say nothing about the matter : a resolution the easier of performance as he be not wont to be lavish of he word at any time he wipe he sword on he sister 's curtain and be about to withdraw when aurelium again speak : ere thou departest brother have the goodness to ring the bell and desire the menial to remove this carrion from my apartment the young baron sulkily comply and retreat growl to he chamber the attendant carry otto 's body forth to the honor of she sex be it record that before this be do aurelium vouchsafe one glance to the corpse of she old lover she eye fall on the brazen ring and he have actually worn it all this time think she would have outraged my daughter would he say the old baron when the transaction be report to he let he be bury in a concatenation accordingly what the guy dickens be a concatrenation geoffrey interrogate gile methink it be latin for a ditch respond geoffrey this interpretation commend itself to the general judgment of the retainer otto be inter in the shelve bank of

three bell respectively dedicate to st eulogius st eucherius and st euschemon whose tintinnabulation be find to be a effectual safeguard against all thunderstorm let the heaven be ever so murky it be merely requisite to set the bell ring and no lightning flash and no thunder peal break over the town nor be the neighbouring country within hearing of they ravage by hail or flood one day the three saint eulogius eucherius and euschemon be sit together exceedingly well content with themselves and everything around they as indeed they have every right to be suppose that they be in paradise we say suppose not be for we own part entirely able to reconcile this locality with the presence of certain can and flagon which have be fuller than they be what a happy reflection for a saint say eulogius who be rapidly pass from the mellow stage of good fellowship to the maudlin that even after he celestial assumption he be permit to continue a source of blessing and benefit to he fellow-creature as yet dwelling in the shade of mortality the thought of the service of my bell in avert lightning and inundation from the good people of epinal fill I with indescribable beatitude _ you _ bell interpose eucherius whose path have lie through the mellow to the quarrelsome _ you _ bell quotha you have as good clink this cannakin -lrb- suit the action to the word -rrb- as you bell it be my bell that do the business i think you might put in a word for _ my _ bell interpose euschemon a little squint saint very merry and friendly when not put out as on the present occasion you bell retort the big saint with incredible disdain and forget they own altercation they fall so fiercely on they little brother that he run away stop he ear with he hand and vow vengeance a short time after this fracas a personage of venerable appearance present himself at epinal and apply for the post of sacristan and bell-ringer at that time vacant though he squint he appearance be far from disagreeable and he obtain the appointment without difficulty he deportment in it be in all respects edify or if he evince some little remissness in the service of saint eulogius and eucherius this be more than compensate by he devotion to the hitherto somewhat slighted saint euschemon it be indeed observe that candle garland and other offering make at the shrine of the two senior saint be find to be transfer in a unaccountable and mystical manner to the junior which induce experienced person to remark that a miracle be certainly brewing nothing however occur until one hot summer afternoon the indication of a storm become so threatening that the sacristan be direct to ring the bell scarcely have he begin than the sky become clear but instead of the usual rich volume of sound the townsman hear with astonishment a solitary tinkle sound quite ridiculous and unsatisfactory in comparison st euschemon 's bell be ring by itself in a trice priest and layman swarm to the belfry and indignantly demand of the sacristan what he mean to enlighten you he respond to teach you to give honor where honor be due to unmask those canonise impostor and he call they attention to the fact that the clappers of the bell of eulogius and eucherius be so fasten up that they could not emit a sound while that of euschemon vibrate freely ye see he continue that these sound not at all yet be the tempest stay be it not thence manifest that the virtue reside solely in the bell of the bless euschemon the argument seem conclusive to the majority but those of the clergy who minister at the altar of eulogius and eucherius stoutly resist maintain that no just decision could be arrive at until euschemon 's bell be subject to the same treatment as the other they view eventually prevail to the great dismay of euschemon who although firmly convince of the virtue of he own bell do not in he heart disbelieve in the bell of he brethren imagine he relief and amaze joy when upon he bell be silence the storm for the first time in the memory of the oldest inhabitant break with full fury over epinal and for all the frantic peal of the other two bell rage with unspeakable fierceness until he own be bring into requisition when as if by enchantment the rain cease the thunder-clouds dispersed and the sun break out gloriously from the blue sky carry he in procession shout the crowd amen brethren here i be rejoin euschemon step briskly into the midst of the troop and why in the name of zernebock should we carry _ you _ demand some while other run off to lug forth the image the object of they devotion why verily euschemon begin and stop short how indeed be he to prove to they that he _ be _ euschemon he personal resemblance to he effigy the work of a sculptor of the idealistic school be in no respect remarkable and he feel alas that he could no more work a miracle than you or i in the sight of the multitude he be only a elderly sexton with a cast in he eye with nothing but he office to keep he out of the workhouse a further and more awkward question arise how on earth be he to get back to paradise the ordinary method be not available for he have already be dead for several century and no other present itself to he imagination mutter apology and glad to be overlook euschemon shrink into a corner but slightly comfort by the honor he image be receive at the hand of the good people of epinal as time wear on he become pensive and restless and nothing pleased he so well as to ascend to the belfry on moonlight night scribble disparagement on the bell of eulogius and eucherius which have cease to be ring and patting and caress he own which now do duty for all three with alarm he notice one night a incipient crack which threaten to become a serious flaw if this go on say a voice behind he i shall get a holiday euschemon turn round and with indescribable dismay perceive a gigantic demon negligently rest he hand on the top of the bell and look as if it would cost he nothing to pitch it and euschemon together to the other side of the town avaunt fiend he stammer with as much dignity as he could muster or at least remove thy unhallowed paw from my bell come eusky reply the fiend with profane familiarity do not be a fool you be not really such a ass as to imagine that you virtue have anything to do with the virtue of this bell whose virtue then demand euschemon why truly say the demon mine when this bell be cast i be imprison in it by a potent enchanter and so long as i be in it no storm can come within sound of its ringing i be not allow to quit it except by night and then no further than a arm 's length : this however i take the liberty of measure by my own arm which happen to be a long one this must continue as i learn until i receive a kiss from some bishop of distinguished sanctity thou hast do some bishoping in thy time peradventure euschemon energetically protest that he have be on earth but a simple laic which be indeed the fact and be also the reason why eulogius and eucherius despise he but which though he do not think it needful to tell the demon he find a singular relief under present circumstance well continue the fiend i wish he may turn up shortly for i be half deaf already with the banging and boom of this infernal clapper which seem to have grow much worse of late and the blessing and the crossing and the aspersion which i have to go through be most repugnant to my taste and unsuitable to my position in society bye-bye eusky come up to-morrow night and the fiend slip back into the bell and instantly become invisible the humiliation of poor euschemon on learn that he be indebted for he credit to the devil be easier to imagine than to describe he do not however fail at the rendezvous next night and find the demon sit outside the bell in a most affable frame of mind it do not take long for the devil and the saint to become very good friend both want company and the former be apparently as much amuse by the latter 's simplicity as the latter be charm by the former 's knowingness euschemon learn number of thing of which he have not have the faintest notion the demon teach he how to play card -lrb- just invent by the saracen -rrb- and initiate he into diver art though unimagined yet to be such as smoking tobacco make a book on the derby and inditing queer story for society journal he draw the most profane but irresistibly funny caricature of eulogius and eucherius and the rest of the host of heaven he have be one of the demon who tempt st anthony and retail anecdote of that eremite which euschemon have never hear mention in paradise he be verse in all scandal respect saint in general and euschemon find with astonishment how much about he own order be know downstairs on the whole he have never enjoy himself so much in he life he become proficient in all manner of minor devilry and be cease to trouble himself about he bell or he ecclesiastical duty when a untoward incident interrupt he felicity it chance that the bishop of metz in whose diocese epinal be situate find himself during a visitation journey within a short distance of the town determine to put up there for the night he do not arrive until nightfall but word of he intention have be send forward by a messenger the authority civil and ecclesiastical be ready to receive he when escort in state he have arrive at the house prepare for he reception the mayor venture to express a hope that everything have be satisfactory to he lordship everything say the bishop emphatically i do indeed seem to remark one little omission which no doubt may be easily account for what be that my lord it have say the bishop usually be the practice to receive a bishop with the ringing of bell it be a laudable custom conducive to the purification of the air and the discomfiture of the prince of the power thereof i catch no sound of chime on the present occasion yet i be sensible that my hearing be not what it be the civil and ecclesiastical authority look at each other that graceless knave of a sacristan say the mayor he have indeed of late strangely neglect he charge say a priest poor man i doubt he wit be touch charitably add another what exclaim the bishop who be very active very fussy and a great stickler for discipline this important church so renowned for its three miraculous bell confide to the tender mercy of a imbecile rogue who may burn it down any night i will look to it myself without lose a minute and in spite of all remonstrance off he start the key be bring the door fling open the body of the church thoroughly examine but neither in nave choir or chancel could the slightest trace of the sacristan be find perhaps he be in the belfry suggest a chorister we 'll see respond the bishop and bustling nimbly up the ladder he emerge into the open belfry in full moonlight heaven what a sight meet he eye the sacristan and the devil sit _ vis-a-vis _ close by the miraculous bell with a smoking can of hot spiced wine between they finish a close game of cribbage seven declare euschemon and eight be fifteen retort the demon mark two twenty-three and pair cry euschemon mark in he turn and seven be thirty ace thirty-one and i be up it _ be _ up with you my friend shout the bishop bring he crook down smartly on euschemon 's shoulder deuce say the devil and vanish into he bell when poor euschemon have be bind and gag which do not take very long the bishop briefly address the assembly he say that the account of the bell which have reach he ear have already excite he apprehension he have greatly fear that all could not be right and now he anxiety be but too well justified he trust there be not a man before he who would not suffer he flock and he crop to be destroy by tempest fifty time over rather than purchase they safety by unhallowed means what have be do have doubtless be do in ignorance and could be make good by a mulct to the episcopal treasury the amount of this he would carefully consider and the people of epinal might rest assure that it should not be too light to entitle they to the benefit of a full absolution the bell must go to he cathedral city there to be examine and report on by the exorcist and inquisitor meanwhile he would himself institute a slight preliminary scrutiny the bell be accordingly unhung tilted up and inspect by the combined beam of the moonlight and torchlight very slight examination serve to place the soundness of the bishop 's opinion beyond dispute on the lip of the bell be engraven character unknown to every one else but which seem to affect the prelate with singular consternation i hope he exclaim that none of you know anything about these character i earnestly trust that none can read a single one of they if i think anybody could i would burn he as soon as look at he the bystander hasten to assure he that not one of they have the slightest conception of the meaning of the letter which have never be observe before i rejoice to hear it say the bishop it will be a evil day for the church when these letter be understand and next morning he depart carry off the bell with the invisible fiend inside it the card which be regard as a book of magic and the luckless euschemon who shortly find himself in total darkness the inmate of a dismal dungeon it be some time before euschemon become sensible of the presence of any partner in he captivity by reason of the trotting of the rat at length however a deep sigh strike upon he ear who art thou he exclaim a unfortunate prisoner be the answer what be the occasion of thy imprisonment oh a mere trifle a ridiculous suspicion of sacrifice a child to beelzebub one of the little disagreeable that must occasionally occur in we profession _ we _ profession exclaim euschemon art thou not a sorcerer demand the voice no reply euschemon i be a saint the warlock receive euschemon 's statement with much incredulity but become eventually convinced of its truth -- i congratulate thee he say the devil have manifestly take a fancy to thee and he never forget he own it be true that the bishop be a great favorite with he also but we will hope for the best thou hast never practice ride a broomstick no ` tis pity thou mayest have to mount one at a moment 's notice this consolation have scarcely be administer ere the bolt fly back the hinge grate the door open and gaoler bear torch inform the sorcerer that the bishop desire he presence he find the bishop in he study which be nearly choke up by euschemon 's bell the prelate receive he with the greatest affability and express a sincere hope that the very particular arrangement he have enjoin for the comfort of he distinguished prisoner have be faithfully carry out by he subordinate the sorcerer as much a man of the world as the bishop thank he lordship and protest that he have be perfectly comfortable i have need of thy art say the bishop come to business i be exceedingly bother -- flabbergast be not too strong a expression -- by this confound bell all my best exorcist have be try all they know with it to no purpose they might as well have try to exorcise my mitre from my head by any other charm than the offer of a better one magic be plainly the only remedy and if thou canst disenchant it i will give thee thy freedom it will be a tough business observe the sorcerer survey the bell with the eye of a connoisseur it will require fumigation yes say the bishop and suffumigation aloe and mastic advise the sorcerer aye assent the bishop and red sander we must call in primeumaton say the warlock clearly say the bishop and amioram triangle say the sorcerer pentacle say the bishop in the hour of methon say the sorcerer i should have think tafrac suggest the bishop but i defer to you better judgment i can have the blood of a goat query the wizard yes say the bishop and of a monkey also do you lordship think that one might venture to go so far as a little unweaned child if absolutely necessary say the bishop i be delighted to find such liberality of sentiment on you lordship 's part say the sorcerer you lordship be evidently of the profession these be thing which stick by I when i be a inquisitor explain the bishop with some little embarrassment ere long all arrangement be make it would be impossible to enumerate half the cross circle pentagram naked sword cross-bone chafing-dish and vial of incense which the sorcerer find to be necessary the child be fortunately deem superfluous euschemon be bring up from he dungeon and he tooth chatter with fright and cold set beside he bell to hold a candle to the devil the incantation commence and speedily give evidence of they efficacy the bell tremble sway split open and a female figure of transcendent loveliness attire in the costume of eve step forth and extend she lip towards the bishop what could the bishop do but salute they with a roar of triumph the demon resume he proper shape the bishop swoon the apartment be fill with the fume of sulphur the devil soar majestically out of the window carry the sorcerer under one arm and euschemon under the other it be commonly believe that the devil good-naturedly drop euschemon back again into paradise or wheresoever he might have come from it be even add that he fall between eulogius and eucherius who have be argue all the time respect the merit of they bell and resume he share in the discussion as if nothing have happen some maintain indeed that the devil chance to be in want of a chaplain offer the situation to euschemon by whom it be accept but how to reconcile this assertion with the undoubted fact that the duty of the post in question be at present ably discharge by the bishop of metz in truth we see not one thing be certain : thou wilt not find euschemon 's name in the calendar courteous reader the mulct to be impose upon the parish of epinal be never exact the bell rupture beyond repair by the demon 's violent exit be take back and deposit in the museum of the town the bell of eulogius and eucherius be ring freely on occasion but epinal have not since enjoy any greater immunity from storm than the contiguous district one day a aged traveller who have spend many year in heathenesse and in whom some discern a remarkable resemblance to the sorcerer notice the bell and ask permission to examine it he soon discover the inscription recognize the mysterious character as greek read they without the least difficulty -- -lrb- greek : mæ kineus kamarinan akinætos gar ameinoon -rrb- -- and favor the townsman with this free but substantially accurate translation : -- can not you let well alone bishop addo and bishop gaddo midday midsummer middle of the dark age fine healthy weather at the city of biserta in barbary wind blow strong from

honor of the diocese the philosopher and the butterfly the scene be in a garden on a fine summer morning brilliant with slant of sunshine yet chequer with cloud significant of more than a remote possibility of rain all the animal world be astir bird flit or hop from spray to spray butterfly eddy around flower within or upon which bee be bustling ant and earwig run nimbly about on the mould a member of the universal knowledge society perambulate the gravel path the universal knowledge society be it understand exist for the dissemination and not for the acquisition of knowledge we philosopher therefore do not occupy himself with consider whether in that miniature world with its countless variety of animal and vegetable be something might not be find with which he be himself unacquainted but like the honey-freighted bee rather seek a opportunity of disburden himself of he store of information than of add to they but who be to profit by he communicativeness the noisy bird could not hear themselves speak much less he he shrewdly distrust he ability to command the attention of the busy bee and even a member of the universal knowledge society may well be at a loss for a suitable address to a earwig at length he determine to accost a butterfly who after sip the juice of a flower remain perched indolently upon it apparently undecided whither to direct he flight it seem likely to rain he say have you a umbrella the butterfly look curiously at he but return no answer i do not ask resume the philosopher as one who should imply that the probability of even a complete saturation ought to appal a ratiocinative be endow with wisdom and virtue i rather design to direct you attention to the inquiry whether these attribute be in fact rightly predicable of butterfly still no answer a impression obtain among we own species continue the philosopher that you butterfly be deficient in foresight and providence to a remarkable i might almost say a culpable degree pardon I if i add that this suspicion be to some extent confirm by my finding you destitute of protection against imbriferous inclemency under atmospheric condition whose contingent humidity should be obvious to a be endow with the most ordinary allotment of meteorological prevision the butterfly still leave all the talk to the philosopher this be just what the latter desire i greatly fear he continue that the omission to which i have reluctantly advert be to a certain extent typically characteristic of the entire political and social economy of the lepidopterous order it have even be state though the circumstance appear scarcely credible that you system of life do not include the accumulation of adequate resource against the inevitable exigency of winter what be winter ask the butterfly and fly off without await a answer the philosopher remain for a moment speechless whether from amazement at the butterfly 's nescience or disgust at he ill-breeding recover himself immediately he shout after the fugitive : frivolous animal it be this levity continue he address a group of butterfly who have gradually assemble in the air attract by the conversation it be this fatal levity that constrain I to despair wholly of the future of you insect that you should persistently remain at you present depressed level that you should not immediately enter upon a process of self-development look at the bee how do she acquire she sting think you why can not you store up honey as she do we can not build cell suggest a butterfly and how do the bee learn do you suppose unless by imbue she mind with the elementary principle of mathematics know that time have be when the bee be as incapable of architectural construction as yourselve when you and she alike be indiscriminable particle of primary protoplasm -lrb- i suppose you know what that be -rrb- one have in process of time exalted itself to the cognition of mathematical truth while the other -- pshaw now really my friend i must beg you to take my observation in good part i do not imply of course that any endeavor of yours in the direction i have indicate could benefit any of you personally or any of you posterity for numberless generation but i really do consider that after a while its effect would be very observable -- that in twenty million of year or so provide no geological cataclysm supervene you butterfly with you innate genius for mimicry might be conform in all respects to the hymenopterous model or perhaps carry out the principle of development into novel and unheard-of direction you should derive much encouragement from the beginning you have make already how a beginning inquire a butterfly i be allude to you larval constitution as caterpillar return the philosopher you advance upon that humiliating condition be i admit remarkable i only wonder that it should not have proceed much further with such capacity for development it be incomprehensible that you should so long have remain stationary you ought to be all toad by this time at the very least i beg you pardon civilly interpose the butterfly to what condition be you pleased to allude to that of a caterpillar rejoin the philosopher caterpillar echo the butterfly and caterpillar titter all he volatile companion till the air seem break into little silvery wave of fairy laughter caterpillar he positively think we be once caterpillar he he he do you actually mean to say you do not know that respond the philosopher scandalise at the irreverence of the insect but inwardly rejoice at the prospect of a controversy in which he could not be worst we know nothing of the sort rejoin a butterfly can you possibly be plunge into such utter oblivion of you embryonic antecedent we do not understand you all we know be that we have always be butterfly sir say a large dull-looking butterfly with one wing in tatters crawl from under a cabbage and limp by reason of the deficiency of several leg let I entreat you not to deduce we scientific status from the inconsiderate assertion of the unthinking vulgar i be proud to assure you that we race comprise many philosophical reasoner -- mostly indeed such as have be disable by accidental injury from join in the amusement of the rest the origin of we species have always occupy a distinguished place in they investigation it have on several occasion engage the attention of we profoundest thinker for not less than two consecutive minute there be hardly a quadrup on the land a bird in the air or a fish in the water to which it have not be ascribe by some one at some time but never i be rejoice to say have any butterfly ever dream of attribute it to the obnoxious thing to which you have unaccountably make reference we should rather think not choruss all the butterfly look here say the philosopher pick up and exhibit a large hairy caterpillar of very unprepossessing appearance look here what do you call this a abnormal organization say the scientific butterfly a nasty beast say the other heaven exclaim the philosopher the obtuseness and arrogance of these creature no my poor friend continue he address the caterpillar disdain you as they may and unpromising as you aspect certainly be at present the time be at hand when you will prank it with the gayest of they all i cry you mercy rejoin the caterpillar somewhat crossly but i be digest a gooseberry leaf when you lift I in that abrupt manner and i do not quite follow you remark do i understand you to mention my name in connection with those flutterer i say the time would arrive when you would be even as they i exclaim the caterpillar i retrograde to the level of a butterfly be not the ideal of creation impersonate in I already i be not aware of that reply the philosopher although he add in a conciliatory tone far be it from I to deny you the possession of many interesting quality you probably refer to my agility suggest the caterpillar or perhaps to my abstemiousness i be not refer to either return the philosopher to my utility to mankind not by any manner of means to what then well if you must know the best thing about you appear to I to be the prospect you enjoy of ultimately become a butterfly the caterpillar erect himself upon he tail and look sternly at the philosopher the philosopher 's countenance fall a thrush dart from a adjacent tree seize the opportunity and the insect and bear the latter away in he bill at the same moment the shower prognosticate by the sage burst forth scatter the butterfly in all direction drenching the philosopher whose foresight have not assume the shape of a umbrella and spoil he new hat but he have ample consolation in the superiority of he head and the caterpillar be right too for after all he never do become a butterfly truth and she companion _ jupiter _ daughter truth be this a befitting manner of present yourself before you divine father you be positively drip the floor of

extravagance as perpetually undermine i further comment upon the insecurity of any institution dependent solely upon prescription finding these suggestion unpalatable i next address myself to the priesthood _ jupiter _ those holy man my daughter must have rejoice at the opportunity of learn from you which portion of they tradition be impure or fabricate and which authentic and sublime _ truth _ the value they place upon my instruction be such that they wish to reserve they exclusively for themselves and propose that they should be deliver within the precinct of a certain subterranean

and leave on one side be inscribe to the palace of truth and on the other to the palace of illusion this way my beauty cry one of the youth draw he companion in the direction of the palace of truth to the place where and where alone thy perfection may be behold as they be and my imperfection whisper the young spouse but she tone be airy and confident well say the second youth do the choice beseem

red mouse in closer contiguity to my beloved than i could bring myself to approve albeit it leap not from she mouth as they do sometimes yet do i know it for a red mouse and nothing worse have i inhabit the palace of illusion haply i have deem it a rat and it be a red mouse as it indubitably be to what end fancy it a tawny-throated nightingale while therefore the other pair proceed on the path they have respectively choose this sage youth and he bride settle themselves at the parting of the way build they cot tend they garden till they field and raise fruit around they include child the preparation of a cheerful repast be one day well advance when lift up they eye the pair behold a haggard and emaciated couple totter along the road that lead from the palace of illusion heaven exclaim they simultaneously no yes ` tis surely they o friend whence this forlorn semblance whence this osseous condition of they anon reply the attenuate youth but before all thing dinner the restorative be speedily administer and the pilgrim commence he narration guard he say though the palace of illusion be by every species of hippogriffic chimaera my bride and i experience no difficulty in penetrate inside its precinct the giant lift we in they arm the dragon carry we on they back fairy bridge span the moat golden ladder incline against the rampart we scale the tower and tread the court securely though construct to all seem of dissolve cloud delicate fare load every dish smile companion invite to every festivity perfume caress we nostril music enwrap we ear but while all else charm and allure one fact intrude of which we could not pretend unconsciousness the intensity of we aversion for each other never could i behold my imogene without marvel whatever could have induce I to wed she and she have acknowledge that she labor under the like perplexity on the other hand we good opinion of ourselves have grow prodigiously the other 's dislike appear to each a insane delusion and we seriously question whether it could be right to mate longer with a be so destitute of true aesthetic feeling we confide these scruple to each other with the result of a most tempestuous altercation as this be attain its climax one of the inmate of the palace a pert forward boy resemble a page out of livery pass by and ironically as i think congratulate we on the strength of we mutual attachment ` never ' exclaim he ` have i beheld the like here before and i be the oldest inhabitant ' as this felicitation be proffer at the precise moment when i be engage in staunch a rent in my cheek with a handful of my wife 's hair i be constrain to regard it as unseasonable and express myself to that effect ` what ' exclaim he with equal surprise ` know ye not that this be the palace of illusion where everything be inverted and appear the reverse of itself intense indeed must be the affection which can thus drive you to fisticuffs have i beheld you billing and coo truly i have counsel a judicial separation ' my wife and i look at each other and by a common impulse make at we utmost speed for the gate of the palace of illusion alas it be one thing to enter and another to quit that domain of enchantment the golden cloud enwrapt we still cate and dainty tempt we as of old the most bewitching strain detain we spellbind the giant and dragon warder indeed offer no violent resistance they simply turn into open portal which appear to yield we egress but prove entrance to interminable labyrinthine maze at last we escape by resolutely follow the exact opposite track to that which we observe to be take by a poet who be chase a phantom of fame with a scroll of unintelligible and inharmonious verse the moment that we emerge from the enchanted castle we know ourselves and each other for what we be and fall weep into each other 's arm so feeble be we that we could hardly move nevertheless we have make a shift to crawl hither trust to you hospitality to recruit we from the sawdust and ditch-water which we vehemently suspect to have be we diet during the whole of we residence eat and drink without stint and without ceremony rejoin they host provide only that somewhat remain for the guest whom i see approach and in a few moment the fugitive from the palace of illusion be reinforce by traveller from the palace of truth whose back be most determinately turn to that August edifice my friend say the youth last arrive when the first greeting be over truth 's palace might be a not ineligible residence be not the inmate necessitate not merely to know the truth but to speak it and do not all innocent embellishment of she majestic person become entirely inefficient and absolutely nugatory for example the number of my wife 's gray hair speedily confound I and how should it be otherwise when the excellent dye she have bring with she have completely lose its virtue she on she part find herself continually oblige to acquaint I with the manifold defect she be daily discover in my mind and person which i be unable to deny frequently as i open my mouth for that purpose it be true that i have the satisfaction of point out equal defect in herself but this could not be consider a great satisfaction see that every such discovery impugn my taste and judgment and impair the worth of my most cherish possession at length we resolve that truth and we be not make for each other and have verify the accuracy of this conclusion by utter it unrebuked in truth 's own palace quit the unblest spot with all possible expedition no sooner be we outside than we tenderness revive and the rite of reconciliation duly perform my wife find nothing more urgent than to try whether she dye have recover its natural property which as ye may perceive prove to be the case we be now bind for the palace of illusion nay say he who have escape thence if my experience suffice not to deter you learn that they who have know truth can never taste of illusion illusion be for life 's golden prime its fane and pavilion may be rear but by the magic wand of youth the maturity that would recreate they build not for illusion but for deceit yet lest mortality should despair there exist as i have learn yet another palace found midway between that of illusion and that of truth open to those who be too soft for the one and too hard for the other thither indeed the majority of mankind in this age resort and there appear to find themselves comfortable and this palace be inquire truth 's runaway simultaneously the palace of convention reply the youth new reading in biography i -- timon of athen no it be not true that timon be dead and bury on the sea-shore so the first party discover that hasten to he cave at the tiding think to seize he treasure and have they head break for they pain but the second party fare better for these be robber captain by alcibiade who have take to the road as many a man of spirit have do before and since they take timon 's gold and leave he bind in he chair but on the way home the lesser thief mysteriously disappear and the gold become the sole property of alcibiade as it be write the tool to he that can handle they timon sit many hour in a uncomfortable position and though in a general way he abhor the face of man he be not displeased when a gentleman of bland appearance enter the cavern and make he a low obeisance and perceive that timon be bind the bland man exclaim with horror and sever he bond ere one could say themistocle and in a instant the cavern be fill with athenian senator hail they cry to timon the munificent hail to timon the compassionate hail to timon the lover of he kind i be none of these thing say timon i be timon the misanthrope this must be my lord 's wit and playfulness say the bland man for how else should the senate and the people have pass a decree indite by myself order a altar to be raise to timon the benefactor and appoint he chief archon but come hand over thy treasure that thy installation may take effect with due observance i have be deprive of my treasure say timon but the ambassador give he no credit until they have search every chink and crevice in the cavern and dig up all the earth round the entrance they then regard each other with blank consternation let we leave he as we find he say one let we hang he up say another let we sell he into captivity say a third nay friend say the bland gentleman such confession of error would impeach we credit as statesman moreover should the people learn that timon have lose he money they will naturally conclude that we have take it let we therefore keep this misfortune from they knowledge and trust for relief to the chapter of accident as usual in state affair they therefore robe timon in a dress of honor and conduct he to athen where half the inhabitant be await he two triumphal arch span the principal street and on one be inscribe timon the benefactor and on the other timon the friend of humanity and all along far as the eye could reach stand those whom he bounty as be state have rescue from perdition the poor he have relieve the sick he have medicine the orphan he have father the poet and painter he have patronise all laud and thank he and solicit a continuance of he liberality and the rabble cry largesse largesse and horseman gallop forth casting among they nut envelop in silver-leaf and apple and comfit and trinket and brass farthing in incredible quantity at which the people murmur somewhat and speak amiss respect timon and the senator who escort he and the bland gentleman strive to keep timon between himself and the populace while timon be ponder what the end of these thing should be he mob encounter another cheer for alcibiade and play pitch and toss with drachma and didrachma and tetradrachma yea even with stater and daric long live alcibiade cry timon 's follower as they attack alcibiade 's supporter to get they share long live timon cry alcibiade 's party as they defend themselves timon and alcibiade extricate themselves from the scuffle and walk away arm in arm my dear friend say timon how inexpressibly beholden i be to you for take the burden of my wealth upon yourself there be nothing i would not do to evince my gratitude nothing query alcibiade nothing persist timon then say alcibiade i will thank thee to relieve I of timandra who be as tired of I as i be of she timon wince horribly but he word be he bond and timandra accompany he to he cavern where at first she suffer much inconvenience from the roughness of the accommodation but timon though a misanthrope be not a brute and when in process of time timandra 's health require special care rug and pillow be provide for she and also for timon for he see that he could no longer pass for a churl if he make he wife more comfortable than himself and though he count gold as dross yet be he not dissatisfy that timandra have save the gold he have give she formerly against a rainy day and when a child be bear timon be at he wit ' end and bless the old woman who come to nurse it and she admonish he of he duty to the god which mean sacrifice which mean merry-making and the child grow and crave food and drink and timon possess himself of three acre and a cow and not be able to doubt he child 's affection for he he come to believe in timandra 's also and when the tax-gatherer oppress he neighbor he plead they cause which be also he own in the court of athen and gain it by the interest of alcibiade and he neighbor make he demarch and he feast they and apemantus come to deride he and timon bear with he but he be impertinent to timandra and timon beat he and in fine timon become very like any other attic country gentleman save that he always maintain that a young man do well to be a misanthrope until he get a loving and sensible wife which as he observe could but seldom happen and the god look down upon he with complacency and defer the ruin of athen until he should be no more ii -- napoleon 's sangaree napoleon buonaparte sit in he garden at st helena in the shadow of a fig-tree before he stand a little table and upon the table stand a glass of sangaree the day be hot and drowsy the sea boom monotonously on the rock the broad fig-leaf stir not great fly buzz heavily in the sultry air napoleon wear a loose linen coat and a broad brim planter 's hat and look as red as the sangaree but nowise as comfortable to think he say aloud that i should end my life here with nothing to sweeten my destiny but this lump of sugar and he drop it into the sangaree and little ripple and bead break out on the surface of the liquid thou should ` st have follow I say a voice I say another and a steam from the sangaree rise high over napoleon 's head and from it shape themselves two beautiful female figure one be fair and very youthful with a phrygian cap on she head and eager eye beneath it and a slender spear in she hand the other be somewhat older and graver and darker with serious eye and she carry a sword and wear a helmet from underneath which she rich brown tress escape over she vesture of light steel armor i be liberty say the first i be loyalty say the second and napoleon lay he hand in that of the first spirit and instantly see himself as he have be in the day of he youthful victory only beset with a multitude of people who be offer he a crown and cheer loudly but he thrust it aside and they cheer ten time more and fall into each other 's arm and weep and kiss each other and troops of young maiden robe in white dance before he strew he way with flower and the debt of the debtor be pay and the prisoner be release from captivity and the forty academician come bring napoleon the prize of virtue and the abbé sieyès stand up and offer napoleon he choice of seventeen constitution and napoleon choose the worst and he come to sit with five hundred other man mostly advocate and when he say yea they say nay and when he say white they say black and they suffer he to do neither good nor evil and when he go to war they command he army for he until he be smite with a great slaughter and the enemy enter the country and bread be scarce and wine dear and the people curse napoleon and liberty vanish from before he but he roam on ever look for she and at length he find she lie dead in the public way all gash and bleeding and trample with the foot of man and horse and the wheel of a tumbril be over she neck and napoleon under compulsion of the mob ascend the tumbril and abbé sieyès and bishop talleyrand ride at he side administer spiritual consolation thus they come within sight of the guillotine whereon stand m de robespierre in he sky-blue coat and he jaw bind up in a bloody cloth bow and smile nevertheless and beckon napoleon to ascend to he napoleon have never fear the face of man but when he see m de robespierre great dread fall upon he and he leap out of the tumbril and flee amain pass amid the people as it be mid withered leaf until he come where loyalty stand await he she take he hand in hers and lo another great host of people proffer he a crown save one little old man who alone of they all wear he hair in a queue with powder see say the little old man that thou takest not what doth not belong to thee to whom belongeth it then ask napoleon for i be a plain soldier and have no skill in politics to loui the disesteem say the little old man for he be a great-great-nephew of the princess of schwoffingen whose ancestor reign here at the flood where dwell loui the disesteemed ask napoleon in england say the little old man napoleon therefore repair to england and seek for loui the disesteemed but none could direct he save that it behove he to seek in the obscurest place and one day as he be pass through a mean street he hear a voice of lamentation and perceive a man whose coat and shirt be rent and dirty but not so he pantaloons for he have none who art thou thou pantaloonless one ask he and wherefore makest thou this lamentation i be loui the esteemed king of france and navarre reply the distrousered personage and i lament for my pantaloons which i have be enforce to pawn inasmuch as the broker would advance nothing upon my coat or my shirt and napoleon go upon he knee and divest himself of he own nether garment and array the king therein to the great diversion of those who stand about thou hast do wickedly say the king when he hear who napoleon be in that thou hast presume to fight battle and win victory without any commission from I go nevertheless and lose a arm a leg and a eye in my service then shall thy offence be forgive thee and napoleon raise a great army and gain a great battle for the king and lose a arm and he gain another greater battle and lose a leg and he gain the greatest battle of all and the king sit on the throne of he ancestor and be call loui the victorious : but napoleon have lose a eye and he come into the king 's presence bear he eye he arm and he leg thou art pardon say the king and i will even confer a singular honor upon thee thou shalt defray the expense of my coronation which shall be the most splendid ever see in france so napoleon lose all he substance and no man pity he but after certain day the keeper of the royal wardrobe rush into the king 's presence cry treason treason o majesty whence these republican and revolutionary pantaloons they be those i deign to receive from the rebel buonaparte say the king it be meet to return they where abide he now save you majesty 's presence they say he lieth upon a certain dunghill if this be so say the king life can be no gratification to he and it be humane to relieve he of it moreover he be a dangerous man go therefore and strangle he with he own pantaloons yet let a monument be raise to he and engrave upon it ` here lie napoleon buonaparte whom loui the victorious raise from the dunghill ' they go accordingly but behold napoleon already lay dead upon the dunghill and this be tell unto the king he have ever be envious of my glory say the king let he therefore be bury underneath and it be so and after no long space the king also die and sleep with he father but when there be again a revolution in france the people cast he bone out of the royal sepulchre and lay napoleon 's there instead and the dunghill complain grievously that it should be disturb for so slight a cause and napoleon withdraw he hand from the hand of loyalty say pish and he eye open and he hear the booming of the sea and the buzz of the fly and feel the heat of the sun and see that the sugar he have drop into he sangaree have not yet reach the bottom of the tumbler iii -- concern daniel defoe daniel defoe at the invitation of the judge come forth from the garret wherein he abode and ride in a cart unto the royal exchange wherein he ascend the pillory to the end that he ear might be nail thereunto and much people stand before he some few pelt some mocking but the most part cheer or weep for they know he for a friend to the poor and especially those man who be call dissenter and a certain person in black stand by he invisible to the people but well see of daniel who know he for one whose life he have himself write and the man in black reason with daniel and say thou seest this multitude of people but which of they shall deliver thee out of my hand nay but let thy white be black and thy black white and i myself will deliver thee and make thee rich and heal thy hurt save the hole in thy ear that i may know thee for mine own but daniel give no heed to he so the devil depart have great wrath and enter into a certain smug-faced man standing by and now the crowd before daniel be greatly diminish and consist mainly of he enemy for he friend have go away to drown they sorrow and the smug-faced man into whom satan have enter come forth from among they and say unto he o daniel inasmuch as i be a dissenter i be greatly beholden to thee but inasmuch as i be a honest tradesman i have somewhat against thee for thou hast write concern short weight and measure and a man 's shop be more to he than he country or he religion wherefore i must need be avenge of thee yet shalt thou own that the tender mercy of the good man be piteous and that even in he wrath he thinketh upon compassion and he pick up a great stone from the ground and wrap it in a piece of paper say lest peradventure it hurt he overmuch and the stone be very rough and sharp and the paper be very thin and he hurl it with all he might at the middle of daniel 's forehead and the blood spout forth and daniel cry aloud and call upon the name of the devil and in a instant the pillory and the people be go and he find himself in the prime minister 's cabinet heal of all he hurt except the hole in he ear and the minister be so like the devil that you could not tell the difference and he say against what wilt thou write first daniel dissenter say daniel and he write a pamphlet and such as read it take firebrand and visit the dissenter in they habitation and many dissenter be put into prison and other fine and spoil of they goods and he write other pamphlet and each be cleverer and wickeder than the last and whatsoever daniel have of old declare to be white lo it be black and what he have say be black behold it be white and he throve and prosper exceedingly and become a commissioner for public-house and hackney-coach and the impose of oath and the levying of custom and all other such thing as one do by deputy and he mend the hole in he ear but the time come when daniel must be judge and he go before the lord and all the court be full of dissenter and the devil be there also and the dissenter testify many and grievous thing against daniel daniel say the lord what answerest thou nothing lord say daniel only i would that the dissenter who throw that stone at I should receive due and condign punishment adequate to he misdeed that say the devil be impossible thou sayest well satan say the lord and therefore shall daniel go free for if anything can excuse the apostasy of the noble it be the ingratitude of the base so the devil go to he own place look very small and daniel find himself in the same garret whence he have go forth to the pillory and before he be bread and cheese and a pen and ink and paper and he dip the pen into the ink and write _ robinson crusoe _ iv -- cornelius the ferryman fourscore year ago there be a good ferryman name cornelius who row people between new york and brooklyn he have neither wife nor child nor any one to think of except himself it be therefore he custom when he have earn enough in a day for he own want to put the rest aside and bestow it upon sick or blind or maimed person lest they should come to the workhouse and the sick and the blind and the maim gather around he and wait by the water 's edge until cornelius 's day 's work should be over this go on until one of the little sooty imp who be always in mischief come to hear of it and tell the principal devil in charge of the united state whose name be politicianus dear I say the devil this will never do i will see to it immediately and he go off to cornelius and catch he in the act of give two dime to a blind beggar how foolish you be he say what waste of money be this if you save it up you would by-and-by be able to build a hospital for all the beggar in new york it would be a long time before there be enough object cornelius not at all say the devil if you let I invest you money for you and he show cornelius the plan of a most splendid hospital and across the front of it be inscribe in letter of gold _ cornelius diabolodorus _ and cornelius be persuade and that evening he give nothing to the poor and the poor have come to think that cornelius 's money be they own and abused he as though he have rob they and cornelius drive they away : and he heart be harden against they from that day forth but the devil keep he promise to cornelius and put he up to

other show fine house and opera-box and fast-trotting horse and dry champagne and lady who dance in ballet and painting by the great master cornelius thrust the picture away and the devil do not ask to see they nor be it needful that he should for he have paint they himself o dear mr devil say cornelius i be so glad that you have call for i want to speak to you it strike I that there be a great defect in the plan which you have be so good as to draw for I what be that ask the devil there be no place for black man say cornelius and you know white man will never let they come into the same hospital and the devil to do he justice talk very reasonably to cornelius and represent to he that there be very few black man in new york and that these have very vigorous constitution but cornelius be inflamed with enthusiasm and frantic with philanthropy and he vow that he would not give a cent to a hospital that have not a wing for black man as big as all the rest of the building and the devil
