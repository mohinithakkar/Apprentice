-------------------------------------------------------------- + the mystery of mr e drood a adaptation by orpheus c kerr chapter xii -- -lrb- continue -rrb- the pauper burial-ground toward which they now progress in a rather high-stepping manner or -- to vary the phrase -- toward which they step be now very much bent be not a favorite resort of the more cheerful village people after nightfall ask any resident of bumsteadville if he believe in ghost and if the time be mid-day and the place a crowded grocery store he would fearlessly answer in the negative -lrb- just the same as a positive philosopher in cast-iron health and with no thunder shower approach would undauntedly deny a deity -rrb- but if any resident of bumsteadville should happen to be catch near the country editor 's last home after dark he would get over that part of he road in a curiously agile and flighty manner -- -lrb- just the same as a positive philosopher with a sore throat or at a uncommonly showy bit of lightning would repeat now i lay I down to sleep with surprising devotion -rrb- so although no one in all bumsteadville be in the least afraid of the pauper burial-ground at any hour it be not invariably select by the great mass of the populace as a peerless place to go home by at midnight and the two intellectual explorer find no sentimental young couple rambling arm in arm among the ghastly head-board nor so much as one loiterer smoking he segar on a suicide 's tomb john mclaughlin you be get nervous again say mr bumstead catch he in the coat collar with the handle of he umbrella and draw the other toward he hand-over-hand it be about time that you should revert again to the hoary jame aker 's excellent preparation for the human family -- i 'll try it first myself to see if it taste at all of the cork ah-h sigh old mortarity after he turn have come and be enjoy at last that be the kind of spirit i do not mind be a wrapper to i could wrap _ they _ up all right reflectively chew a clove the ritualistic organist recline on the pauper grave of a former writer for the daily press and cogitate upon he companion 's lean to spiritualism while the other produce match and light they lantern mr mclaughlin he solemnly remark wave he umbrella at the grave around in this scene you behold the very last of man 's individual be in this entombment he end forever tremble j mclaughlin -- forever soul and spirit be but unmean word accord to the latest big thing in science the depart dr davi slavonskus of st petersburg before set out for the asylum prove by he atomic theory that man be neatly manufacture of atom of matter which be continually combine together until they form man and then go through the process of life which be but the mechanical effect of they combination and then wear apart again by attrition into the exhaustion of cohesion call death and then crumble into separate atom of native matter or dust again and then gradually combine again as before and evolve another man and living and die again and so on forever thus and thus only be man immortal you be make exclusively of atom of matter yourself john mclaughlin so be i i can understand a man 's believe that _ he himself _ be all atom of matter and nothing else respond old mortarity skeptically as how john mclaughlin -- as how when he know that at any rate he have not get one atom of common sense be the answer suddenly mr bumstead arise from the grave and frantically shake hand with he you be right sir he say emotionally you be a gooroleman sir the atom of common sense be one of the atom that slavonski forget all about let 's do some skeleton now at the further end of the pauper burial-ground and in the rear of the former alms-house once stand a building use successively as a cider-mill a barn and a kind of chapel for pauper long ago from neglect and bad weather the frail wooden superstructure have fall into piece and be gradually cart off but a sturdy stone foundation remain underground and although the flooring over it have for many year be cover with debris and rank growth so as to be undistinguishable to common eye from the general earth around it the great cellar still extend beneath and accord to weird rumor have some secret access for old mortarity who use it as a charnel store-house for such spoil of the grave as he find in he prowling to the spot thus history the two moralist of the moonlight come now and with many tumble mr mclaughlin remove certain artfully place stone and rubbish and lift a clumsy extemporized trap-door below appear a ricketty old step-ladder lead into darkness i hear such cry and groan down there last christmas eve as sound worse than the latin singing in the ritualistic church observe mclaughlin cry and groan echo mr bumstead turn quite pale and momentarily forget the snake which he be just begin to discover among the stone you be get nervous again poor wreck and need some more west indian cough-mixture -- wait until i see for myself whether it be get enough sugar in it in due time the great nervous antidote be pass and replace and then with the light lantern work around under they arm they go down the totter ladder down they go into a great damp musty cavern to which they light give a pallid illumination see here say old mortarity raise a long curved bone from the floor look at that : shoulder-blade of unmarried episcopal lady aged thirty-nine how do you know she be so old and unmarried ask the organist because the shoulder-blade 's so sharp mr bumstead be surprise at this specimen of the art of a agassiz and waterhouse hawkin in such a mortary old man and he intellectual pride cause he to resolve at once upon a rival display look at this skull john mclaughlin he say refer to a object that he have find behind the ladder see thish fine retreat brow bulge chin project occipital bone and these orifice of ear that musht have be stupen ` sly long it be the skull john mclaughlin of a twin-brother of the man who really wish -- really wish john mclaughlin -- that he could be sit ` shfy sir in he own mind that charle dickens be a christian writer why thash 's skull of a hog explain mr mclaughlin with some contempt twin-brother -- all th ` shame say mr bumstead as though that make no earthly difference once more what a strange expedition be this how strangely the eye of the two man look after two or three more application to the antique flask and how curiously mr bumstead walk on tip-toe at time and take short leap now and then lesh go now say bumstead after both have be asleep upon they foot several time i think th 's snake down here john mcbumstead wh ` st monky you mean -- dozen of black monky mr bumplin whisper old mortarity clutch he arm as he sink against he noshir serp ` nt insist mr bumstead make futile attempt to open he umbrella with one hand warzesmarrer with th ' light -- ansh ' r I t ' once mac johnbunklin in they swaying under the confusion and delusion of the vault they lantern have work around to the neighborhood of they spine so that whichever way they turn the light be all behind they greatly agitate as man be apt to be when surround by supernatural influence they do not perceive the cause of this apparently unnatural illumination and upon turn round and round in irregular circle and still find the light in the wrong place they exhibit sign of great trepidation warzemarrer wirra _ light _ repeat mr bumstead spin wildly until he bring up against the wall ishgotb ` witch i b ` lieve pants mr mclaughlin whirling as frenziedly with he own lantern dangle behind he and come to a abrupt pause against the opposite wall thus each support against the stone by a shoulder they breathe hard for a moment and then sink into a slumber in which they both slide down to the ground arouse by the shock they sit up quite dazed brush away the swarm snake and monky be freshly alarm by discover that they be now actually sit upon that perverse light behind they and by a simultaneous impulse begin crawl about in search of the ladder unable to see anything with all the light behind he but fancy that he discern a gleam beyond a dark object near at hand mr bumstead rise to a standing attitude by a series of complex maneuver and plant a foot on something i ` morth ` larrer he cry spiritedly th ` larrer be on I answer mr mclaughlin in evidently great bewilderment then ensue a momentary wild struggle and muffle crash for each gentleman come blindly upon the other have take the light glimmer at the other 's back for the light at the top of the ladder and further mistake the other in the dark for the ladder itself have attempt to climb he mr bumstead however have get the first step whereupon mr mclaughlin in resent what he take for the ladder 's inexcusable familiarity have twist both himself and he equally deluded companion into a pretty hard fall another interval of hard breathing and then the organist of saint cow 's ask : di ` you hear anything drop yshir th ` larrer get throw f ` rimpudence to a gen ` l be 'n be the peevish return of old mortarity who immediately fall asleep as he lie with he lantern under he spine in he sleep he dream that bumstead examine he closely with a view to gain some clue to the mystery of the light behind both they back and on find the lantern under he and study it profoundly for some time be suddenly move to feel along he own back he dream that bumstead thereupon find he own lantern and exclaim after half a hour 's analytical reflection it musht ` ave slide round while john mclaughlin be intosh ` cate then or soon after the dreamer awake and can discern two mr bumstead seat upon the step-ladder with a lantern baby-like on each knee you two man be awake at last eh say the organist with peculiar smile yes gentleman return the mclaughlin with yawn they ascend silently from the cellar each believe that he be accompany by two companion and render moodily distrustful thereby aina maina mona -- mike bassalone bona -- strike sing a small familiar voice when they stand again above ground and a stone whizz between they head in another moment bumstead have the fell smalley by the collar and be shake he like a yard of carpet you wretch little tarrier he cry in a fury you have be spy around to-night to find out something about my spiritualism that may be distort to injure my ritualistic standing i be not do nothing and you jest drop I or i 'll knock spot out of yer carol the stony young child i jest come to have my aim at that old beat there attend to he case then -- he and he friend 's for he seem to have some one with he -- and never let I see you two boy again thus mr bumstead as he release the excited lad and turn from the pauper burial-ground for a curious kind of pitching and run walk homeward the strange expedition be at a end : - but _ which _ end he be unable just then to decide -lrb- _ to be continue _ -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* -lrb-

familiar leg of lupe no longer allure but in they place we have kathi lanner and bertha lind and nearly a gross of assorted leg of the very best quality why do the woman clamor for the ballot when they have almost exclusive possession of the ballet the latter be much nicer and more useful than the former the average repeater can obtain only a dollar for he ballot but the average ballet will find any quantity of enthusiastic admirer at one dollar and a half a head would any man pay kathi lanner a dollar for the privilege of see she with a ballot in she hand on the other hand live there a man with eye so dead that he would not cheerfully pay twice that sum to see she in the maze of the ballet but _ la giselle _ certainly i be come to that in a moment i have often think that nature must have intend I for a writer of sermon i have such a facility for begin a article with a series of general remark that have nothing whatever to do with the subject though how can any one be rationally

a better application in the present weather than claret punch apply yourself continually to that cooling beverage and apply it continually to you lip and the result be a sort of reciprocity treat whose result be much more certain than those of the reciprocity treaty of which congress have latterly have so much to say to contemplate _ la giselle _ in all its bearing be a pleasure which be peculiarly appropriate to the season kathus lanner and she companion may not be really cool but they look as though they be they remind one of the east indian country house that be build on post so as to allow a free circulation of air beneath the foundation anyhow they look as if they take thing coolly -lrb- a joke might be make on the word coolly and coolie the reader may mix to he own taste it be too hot for any one to make joke for other people -rrb- but _ la giselle _ yes yes i be just ready to speak of it _ la giselle _ be a grand ballet in which a elaborate plot be develop by the toe of some fifty young lady there be a young woman in it who love a man and there be another woman who also love he and another man who love the first woman and meddle and mar as though he be a professional

poem of the cradle canto ii hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle the cow jump over the moon the little dog laugh to see the sport and the dish run after the spoon these be the classic expression of the hilarious poet of a period far back in the vista of age how vividly they portray the exalted state of he mind and how impressed the public must have be at the time for do not the word become popular immediately and have they not so continue to the present day every mother immediately seize upon the verse and set it to music of she own sing it as a cradle song to soothe the trouble of infanthood and repeat it in great glee to the intelligent babe when in a crow mood as the poem most fit for the infant 's brain to comprehend papa anxious to watch the unfold of the human mind and its gradual development would take the baby-prodigy in he arm and with keen glance direct upon its face repeat in thrilling tone the sublime word with what joy would he remark and comment upon any gleam of intelligence and again and again would he recite in a impressive voice those word so calculate to aid in bring into blossom the bud of promise but who can meditate upon the memorable stanza and not see in fancy the enthusiastic youth -- the lover of melody and of nature -- as he enter he dingy room the ordinary abide place of poetical genius he see he beloved fiddle and he no less beloved feline friend in loving conjunction he burst out rapturously with impetuous joy : hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle he see the two thing dearest to he heart and see they both at one time and he must be excuse for he sudden night into the region of classicism no wonder that he immediately imagine the world to be as full of joy as he himself and that he think the cow jump over the moon perhaps the sight be a sufficient re-moon-eration to he for he past trouble and the exhilaration of he spirit cause he to dance to cut pigeon-wing and otherwise gaily disport himself consequently the little dog laugh to see the sport which every intelligent dog would have do under the circumstance certainly dear reader you would have do so yourself the hilariousness of the poet increase and he joyfulness expand he manifestation do not confine themselves to simple dancing-steps and a occasional pigeon-wing but inadvertently perhaps he introduce the can-can and that explain why the dish run away with the spoon for the end of he excited toe come in contact with he only dish and spoon and propel they to the other side of the room as he do not tell we whether the dish remain whole after its escapade

girl would pet I and offer I a share of they nut and candy and the boy laugh at I in consequence and call I gal-boy squirt ink upon my face for beauty-spot and present I with curl-papers and flower for my hair -- until the present when i be deny introduction to young lady and be put off on old woman -- i have suffer for my look in my boarding-house i be shun as if i have the plague when i enter the parlor or dining-room i see the lady look at each other with a know air as much as to say look at he and the answer be telegraph back be not he handsome but he know it as if i could help know it with every one tell I so fifty time a day and husband pay unusual attention to they wife when i be around as if i be a ogre i be naturally a modest man make more so by my extreme sensitiveness to

then folk would never stop laugh if i do at what they would be please to term my extreme ladylikeness i have actually pray that i might get the small-pox and once walk through the small-pox hospital for that purpose but escape unharmed i suppose i must have be vaccinate in fact i know i have be for how often have i look at the scar on my arm and wish it have be on my cheek or at the end of my

be not a hard case i want a intelligent and agreeable wife and one that come of a respectable family i do not think i be ask too much but it seem fate have determine such a one i can never have i have either to remain single or take one that be ignorant and vulgar that of course would be as much remark upon as my appearance so it can not be think of i want to escape observation and criticism i

rescue by ida lewi _ it be not easy to devise a plan for this noble design and it be not until the morning of the second day of he visit that mr p be ready for the adventure then he hire a boat and set sail alone o'er the boundless bosom of the atlantic he have not sail more than a few hour on say boundless bosom before he turn he prow back towards land -- towards the far-famed lime rock on which the intrepid heroine dwell he have think of be wreck at night but fear that ida might not be able to find he in the dark he give up this idea he present intention be that miss lewi should believe he to be a lonely mariner from a far distance toss by the angry wave upon she rock-bound coast but there be a certain difficulty in the way which mr p fear would prove fatal to he hope the sea be just as smooth as glass and the wind all die away there be not enough leave to ruffle a squirrel 's tail how absurd the situation how could he ever be dash helpless upon the rock under such circumstance the tide be set in and as he gradually drift towards the land he see the storied rock and even perceive miss ida sit upon a shady prominence crochet a tidy what should he do to attract she attention how put himself in imminent peril he anxiety for a time be dreadful but he think of a plan he get out he knife and whittle the mast half through now think he if my mast and rigging go by the board she will surely come and rescue I but the mast and rigging be as obstinate as outside speculator in wall street -- they would not go by the board -- and mr p be oblige at last to break down the mast by main force but the lady hear not the awful crash and little ween that a fellow-being be out alone on the wild watery waste in a shipwrecked bark after wait for some time that she might ween this terrible truth mr p conclude that there be nothing to do but to spring a leak but he find this difficult kick as hard as he might he could not loosen a bottom board and he have no auger the lime rock be get nearer and nearer would he drift safely ashore oh how can i wreck myself ` ere it be too late he cry in the agony of he heart wild with apprehension of reach the land without danger he sit down and madly whittle a hole in the bottom of the boat make it as nearly as possible such a one as a sword fish would be likely to cut when he get it do the water bubble through it like a oil-well in fact mr p be afraid that he vessel would fill up before he be near enough for the maiden on the rock to hear he heart-rending cry for succor he could see she plainly now 'twa certainly she

course that every one who write anything worth reading will keep a copy of it -rrb- now the rock be comparatively near and stand up to he knee in water mr p give the appropriate heart-rending cry for succor but in spite of the prevail calm he perceive that there be a surf upon the rock and a noise of many water at the top of he voice mr p again shout hello ida but he soon find that he would have to hello longer as well as hello ida and he do it at last she hear he drop she work-basket she run to the edge of the rock and make a trumpet of she hand call out : ahoy there what be up I answer mr p but i will not be up very long haste to my assistance oh maiden ere i sink then she shout again : i have get no boat it be over to mccurdy 's get caulk no boat then indeed do mr p turn pale and he knee do tremble but ida be not to be daunt bound like a chamoix o'er the rock to she house she quickly return with a long coil of rope and instantly hurl it over the curling breaker with such a strong arm and true aim that one end of it strike mr p in the face with a crack like that of a giant 's whip he grasp the rope and that instant he boat sink like a rock ida haul away like a steam-engine and mr p 's prow -lrb- he nose you know -rrb- cut through the water like a knife in a straight line for the shore in front of he he see a great mass of sharp root he shudder but over they he go on on he go nor turn aside for jagged cleft or sharp-edged stone a ship load with queensware have be wreck near shore and through a vast mass of broken plate and cup and saucer mr p go -- straight and swift as a arrow at last wet bleeding ragged scratch and feint he reach the shore say ida as she support he towards she dwelling : how do you ever come to be wreck on such a day as this mr p hesitate but with such a noble creature the truth would surely be the best he tell she all oh say he dear girl 'twa i myself who hew down my mast and scuttle my fair bark and i do it maiden fair that thy brave arm

be induce -lrb- the deuce be in it if i ever be again -rrb- to participate in a suppose festivity of this nature in the first place we -lrb- the excursionist -rrb- charter a yacht two hand that know the rope -- they look as if they might have be acquaint with the rope 's end -- and a small octoroon of the male persuasion as waiter as chowle characteristically observe -lrb- he be a stock broker and be one of the party -rrb- there be nothing like a feeling of security so we engage a skipper who be perfectly familiar with the baring of the bank and thoroughly post on all sea ` change at least so chowle express it but then he be apt to be somewhat technical at time this accomplished mariner be repute to have be round the horn several time which i be lead to believe be perfectly true as he smell strongly of spirit when he come on board i be much discourage at the appearance of this skipper and have half a mind to give my friend the slip when i see he on the wharf have man we craft we purchase a colossal refrigerator in which to put we bass and weak fish lay in a stock of cold provision -- among other thing a cold shoulder -- plenty of exhilarating beverage and with buoyant spirit -lrb- every man of we -rrb- and plenty of ice on board start on the slack of the morning tide i regret to state that by the time we be ready to start we skipper be half way over the bay be provide with a pocket pistol charge to the muzzle he and he two subordinate be pretty well shoot in the neck by the time we reach fort lafoyette the consequence of this be that we no sooner come abreast of the reef in that locality than we get afoul of it for get afoul of the rock we have to fork over twenty dollar to the captain of a tug boat which come and snake we off with a coil of rope when the tide rise during the time we remain stationary the bottle i be sorry to say keep go round all the excursionist except myself get half sea over and when we resume we voyage the steersman have fall asleep so the vessel leave a wake behind she which be extremely crooked we anchor that night outside sandy hook and next morning cast we line overboard and commence fishing we success in that line be astounding not to say embarrassing we commence to take fish on a unparalleled scale dog fish and stingaree be haul over the side without intermission the former be a kind of small shark as they will swallow anything we take they in very fast although extremely voracious they be so simple that if it be not for they size they would fall a easy prey to the sea gull which in spite of its name be a very wide awake bird stingaree be fish of much more penetration -- they sharp tail slash everything that come in they way these natural weapon which have be furnish they by providence as a means of defense in they extremity cut through a fellow 's trousers like paper the interesting creature cut up so that we kindly consign they together with the dog fish to they native element have first benevolently knock they on the head change we location for a change of luck we capture a superb mess of sea robin and toad fish this satisfied we so we pull up anchor not hanker for any more such
