with a sort of hardness as certain to live to be a thorn in he side be perhaps even then struggle with that watery death _ ii -- the hall farm _ it be a very fine old place of red brick the hall farm -- once the residence of a country squire and the hall plenty of life there though this be the drowsiest time of the year just before hay-harvest and it be the drowsiest time of the day too for it be half-past three by mr poyser 's handsome eight-day clock mr poyser a good-looking woman not more than eight-and-thirty of fair complexion and sandy hair well shaped light-footed have just take up she knitting and be seat with she niece dinah morri another motherless niece hetty sorrel a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen be busy in the adjoining dairy you look the image o ' you aunt judith dinah when you sit a-sewing say mr poyser i allays say that o ' judith as she would bear a pound weight any day to save anybody else carry a ounce and it make no difference in she as i could see when she take to the methodist only she talk a bit different and wear a different sort o ' cap if you would only come and live i ' this country you might get marry to some decent man and there would be plenty ready to have you if you would only leave off that preach as be ten time worse than anything you aunt judith ever do and even if you would marry seth bede as be a poor wool-gathering methodist and 's never like to have a penny beforehand i know you uncle ` ud help you with a pig and very like a cow for he be allays be good-natur have to my kin for all they be poor and make 'em welcome to the house and ` ud do for you i 'll be bind as much as ever he would do for hetty though she be he own niece the arrival of mr irwine the rector of hayslope and captain donnithorne squire donnithorne 's grandson and heir interrupted mr poyser 's flow of talk i 'll lay my life they be come to speak about you preach on the green dinah it be you must answer 'em for i be dumb i have say enough a ` ready about you bring such disgrace upo ' you uncle 's family i would not ha ' mind if you would be mr poyser 's own niece folk must put up wus ' they own kin as they put up wus ' they own nose it be they own flesh and blood mr irwine however be the last man to feel any annoyance at the methodist preaching and young arthur donnithorne 's visit be merely a excuse for exchange a few word with hetty sorrel the rector mention before he leave that thia bede have be find drown in the willow brook and dinah morri at once decide that she might be of some comfort to the widow and set out for the village as for hetty sorrel she be think more of the look captain donnithorne have cast at she than of adam and he trouble bright admire glance from a handsome young gentleman -- those be the warm ray that set poor hetty 's heart vibrate hetty be quite use to the thought that people like to look at she she be aware that mr craig the gardener at squire donnithorne 's be over head-and-ear in love with she she know still better that adam bede -- tall upright clever brave adam bede -- who carry such authority with all the people round about and whom she uncle be always delighted to see of a evening say that adam know a fine sight more o ' the natur o ' thing than those as think themselves he betters -- she know that this adam who be often rather stern to other people and not much give to run after the lassie could be make to turn pale or red any day by a word or a look from she hetty 's sphere of comparison be not large but she could not help perceive that adam be something like a man always know what to say about thing know with only look at it the value of a chestnut-tree that be blow down and why the damp come in the wall and what they must do to stop the rat and write a beautiful hand that you could read and could do figure in he head -- a degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmer of that country-side hetty be quite certain she uncle want she to encourage adam and would be please for she to marry he for the last three year -- ever since he have superintend the building of the new barn -- adam have always be make welcome at the hall farm and for the last two year at least hetty have be in the habit of hear she uncle say adam bede may be work for a wage now but he 'll be a master-man some day as sure as i sit in this chair master burge be in the right o not to want he to go partner and marry he daughter if it be true what they say the woman as marry he ` ull have a good take be ' t lady day or michaelma a remark which mr poyser always follow up with she cordial assent ah she would say it be all very fine have a ready-made rich man but may happen he 'll be a ready-made fool and it be no use fill you pocket full of money if you have get a hole in the corner it 'll do you no good to sit in a spring-cart o ' you own if you have get a soft to drive you he 'll soon turn you over into the ditch but hetty have never give adam any steady encouragement she like to feel that this strong keen-eyed man be in she power but as to marry adam that be a very different affair hetty 's dream be all of luxury she think if adam have be rich and could have give the thing of she dream -- large beautiful earring and nottingham lace and a carpeted parlor -- she love he well enough to marry he the last few week a new influence have come over hetty she have become aware that mr arthur donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble for the chance of see she and dinah morri be away preach and work in a manufacturing town _ iii -- adam 's first love _ adam bede like many other man think the sign of love for another be sign of love towards himself the time have come to he that summer as he help hetty pick currant in the orchard of the hall farm that a man can least forget in after-life -- the time when he believe that the first woman he have ever love be at least begin to love he in return he be not wrong in think that a change have come over hetty the anxiety and fear of a first passion with which she be tremble have become stronger than vanity and while adam draw near to she she be absorb in think and wonder about arthur donnithorne 's possible return for the first time hetty feel that there be something soothing to she in adam 's timid yet manly tenderness she want to be treat lovingly and arthur be away from home and oh it be very hard to bear the blank of absence she be not afraid that adam would tease she with love-making and flattering speech he have always be so reserve to she she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man love she and be near she it never enter into she mind that adam be pitiable too that adam too must suffer one day it be from adam that she find out that captain donnithorne would be back in a day or two and this knowledge make she the more kindly disposed towards he but for all the world adam would not have speak of he love to hetty yet till this commence kindness towards he should have grow into unmistakable love he do no more than pluck a rose for she and walk back to the farm with she arm in he when adam after stop a while to chat with the poyser have say good-night mr poyser remark if you can catch adam for a husband hetty you 'll ride i ' you own spring-cart some day i 'll be you warrant she uncle do not see the little toss of the head with which hetty answer he to ride in a spring-cart seem a very miserable lot indeed to she now it be on August 18 when adam go home from some work he have be do at one of the farm pass through a grove of beech and see at the end of the avenue about twenty yard before he two figure they be stand opposite to each other with clasped hand and they separate with a start at a sharp bark from adam bede 's dog one hurry away through a gate out of the grove the other arthur donnithorne look flush and excite saunter towards adam the young squire have be home for some week celebrate he twenty-first birthday and he be leave on the morrow to rejoin he regiment hitherto there have be a cordial and sincere liking and a mutual esteem between the two young man but now adam stand as if petrified and he amazement turn quickly to fierceness arthur try to pass the matter off lightly as if it have be a chance meeting with hetty but adam who feel that he have be rob treacherously by the man in whom he have trust would not so easily let he off it come to blow and arthur sink under a well-planted blow of adam 's as a steel rod be break by a iron bar before they separate arthur promise that he would

the real value of the book be the picture it give of the social and political life and for this reason it will always be read by those who want to know what english political method and custom be like at the time of the passing of the reform bill of 1832 the character of mr rufus lyon the independent minister be a admirable study of the non-conformist of that period esther 's renunciation of a brilliant fortune for a humbler lot with the man she love and admire be quite in accord with the teaching george eliot inculcate all she life the scene of the story be lay in the midland and the action cover about nine month begin in 1832 _ i -- the minister 's daughter _ the rev rufus lyon minister of the independent chapel in the old-fashioned market town of treby magna in the county of loumshire live in a small house adjoining the entry which lead to the chapel yard he sit this morning as usual in a low upstairs room call he study which serve also as a sleeping-room and from time to time get up to walk about between the pile of old book which lay around he on the floor he face look old and worn yet the curtain of hair that fall from he bald crown and hang about he neck retain much of its original auburn tint and he large brown short-sighted eye be still clear and bright at the first glance everyone think he a very odd-looking rusty old man and the free-school boy often hoot after he and call he revelation but he be too short-sighted and too absent from the world of small fact and petty impulse to notice those who titter at he he be meditate on the text for he Sunday morning sermon when old lyddy the minister 's servant open the door to tell he that mr holt be want to see he she say she come out of season but she be in trouble the minister bid she send mistress holt up and a tall elderly woman dress in black enter mr holt mr lyon say to himself be a woman who darken counsel by word without knowledge and anger the reason of the natural man and he pray for patience while he visitor ramble on concern she late husband and she son felix the minister make out that felix object to the sale of he father 's quack medicine holt 's elixir and cancer cure and want mr lyon to talk to he for after we would be to chapel he speak better of you than he do of most : he say you be a fine old fellow and a old-fashioned puritan -- he use dreadful language mr lyon but i see he do not mean you ill for all that he call most folk ' religion rottenness mr holt depart and in the evening when mr lyon be in the sitting-room felix holt knock at the door the minister accustom to the respectable air of provincial townsman feel a slight shock when he spectacles make clear to he the shaggy - head large-eyed strong-limbed person of this questionable young man without waistcoat or cravat felix speak loudly and brusquely when the minister mention the subject of mr holt 's visit as to those absurd medicine and gull advertisement that my mother have be talk of to you i have no more doubt about _ they _ than i have about pocket-picking if i allow the sale of those medicine to go on and my mother to live out of the proceeds when i can keep she by the honest labor of hand i have not the least doubt that i should be a rascal i would fain inquire more particularly into you objection to these medicine say mr lyon gravely my father be ignorant say felix bluntly i know something about these thing i be ` prentice for five miserable year to a stupid brute of a country apothecary -- my poor father leave money for that -- he think nothing could be finer for I no matter : i know that the cathartic pill may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow they and that the cancer cure might as well be bottled ditch-water i can keep my mother as well nay better than she keep herself with my watch and clock cleaning and teaching one or two little chap that i have get to come to I i can earn enough mr lyon 's suggestion that some situation might be obtain as clerk or assistant be brush aside why should i want to get into the middle class because i have some learn the most of the middle class be as ignorant as the work people about everything that do not belong to they own brummagem life the entrance of lyddy with the tea tray disturb the conversation but the minister interested in he visitor ask felix to stay for a dish of tea and felix accept my daughter who have be detain in give a lesson in the french tongue have doubtless return now say the minister on the entrance of the young lady felix be conscious she be not the sort of person he have expect the minister 's daughter to be and the incongruity repel he there be thing about she she walk the long neck and high crown of shine brown hair that suggest a fine lady to he a fine lady be always a sort of spin glass affair but a fine lady as the daughter of this rusty old puritan be especially offensive the discovery that miss lyon read byron set felix off on a tirade against the poet and he work and throughout the meal no agreement on any topic seem possible between esther and the guest felix note that mr lyon be devote to he daughter and stand in some fear of she that be a singular young man esther say the minister when felix have go i discern in he a love for whatever thing be honest and true and i feel a great enlargement in he presence i think he be very coarse and rude say esther with a touch of temper but he speak better english than most of we visitor what be he occupation watch and clock make my dear esther be disappointed she think he be something higher than that felix on he side wonder how the queer old minister have a daughter so little in he own likeness he decide that nothing should make he marry _ ii -- the election riot _ the return of mr harold transome to transome court after fifteen year ' absence and he adoption as radical candidate for the county create no little stir and excitement in treby it also assist the grow intimacy between mr lyon and felix holt for though neither possess vote in that memorable year 1832 they share the same liberal sympathy perhaps the most delightful friendship be those in which there be much agreement much disputation and yet more personal liking and the advent of the public-spirited contradictory yet affectionate felix into treby life have make a welcome epoch to the minister esther have not see so much of they new acquaintance as she father have but she have begin to find he amusing though he always oppose and criticise she and look at she as if he never see a single detail about she person it seem to esther that he think slightly of she but rude and queer as he be i can not say there be anything vulgar about he she say to herself one Sunday afternoon felix holt rap at the door of mr lyon 's house although he could hear the voice of the minister in the chapel esther be in the kitchen alone read a french romance and she open the door and invite he in he scoff at she book and as the talk go on upbraid she for she vanity finally he tell she that he want she to change of course i be a brute to say so he add i ought to say you be perfect another man would perhaps i can not bear to see you go the way of the foolish woman who spoil man 's life mortification and anger fill esther 's mind and when felix get up to say he be go she return he good-bye without even look at he only when the door close she burst into tear she revolt against he assumption of superiority do he love she one little bit and be that the reason why he want she to change but esther be quite sure she could never love anyone who be so much of a pedagogue and a master yet a few week later and esther accept willingly when felix propose a walk for the first time together that same afternoon he tell she that she be very beautiful and that he would never be rich : he intend go away to some manufacturing town to lead the people to better thing and this mean a life of poverty something esther say make felix ask suddenly can you imagine yourself choose hardship as the better lot yes i can she answer flushing over neck and brow they walk home very silently after that felix struggle as a firm man struggle with a temptation esther struggle as a woman struggle with the yearning for some expression of love on the day of the election a mob of miner prime with liquor by a unscrupulous agent of transome 's come into the town to hoot the tory voter and as the disturbance increase felix know that mr lyon be away preach go round to the minister 's house to reassure esther i be so thankful to see you she say eagerly he mention that the magistrate and constable be come and that the town would be quieter he only fear be that drinking might inflame the mob again again felix tell she of he renunciation of the ordinary hope and ambition of man and at the same time try to prove that he think very highly of she he want she to know that she love be dear to he and he feel that they must not marry -- to do so would be to ruin each other 's life when felix go out into the street in the afternoon the crowd be larger and more mischievous the constable be quite unable to cope with the mob the polling booth be close for the day and the magistrate have send to the neighbouring town of duffield for the military there be proof that the predominant will of the crowd be in favor of transome for several shop be attack and they be all of they tory shop felix be soon hotly occupy try to save a wretched publican name spratt from the fury of the crowd the man have be drag out into the street and felix have get as near he as he could when a young constable arm with a sabre rush upon he it be a choice of two evil and quick as lightning felix frustrate he the constable fall undermost and felix get he weapon tucker do not rise immediately but felix do not imagine that he be much hurt and bidding the crowd follow he try to lead they away from the town he hope that the soldier would soon arrive and feel confident that there would be no resistance to a military force suddenly a cry be raise let we go to treby manor the residence of sir maximus debarry whose son be the tory candidate from that moment felix be powerless and be carry along with the rush all he could hope to do be to get to the front terrace of the house and assure the inmate that the soldier would arrive quickly just as he approach a large window he hear the horse of the trooper and then come the word halt fire before he have time to move a bullet whiz and pass through felix holt 's shoulder -- the shoulder of the arm that bear the sabre felix fall the rioter run confusedly like terrify sheep it be a weary night for felix and the next day he wound be declare trivial and he be lodge in loumford jail there be three charge against he that he have assault a constable that he have commit manslaughter -lrb- tucker be dead from spinal concussion -rrb- and that he have lead a riotous onslaught on a dwelling house four other man be arrest one for theft and three other for riot and assault _ iii -- the trial _ a great change take place in the fortune of esther in the interval between the riot and the opening of the assizes it be find that she and not harold transome be the rightful owner of the transome estate for esther 's real name be bycliffe and not lyon and she be the step-daughter only of the minister mr lyon have find esther 's mother a french woman of great beauty in destitution -- she husband a englishman lie in some unknown prison this englishman be a bycliffe -- and heir to the transome property and on the proof of he death mr lyon know nothing of bycliffe 's family marry he widow who however die while esther be still a tiny child not till the time of the election do esther learn that she real father be dead mr transome 's lawyer -- jermyn -- be fully aware of the claim of the bycliffe but know they be powerless without money to enforce the claim and that esther and she step-father alike be ignorant of all the fact it be only when harold transome on he return quarrel with jermyn on the management of the estate and after the election -lrb- which transome lose -rrb- threaten he with a law-suit that jermyn turn round and tell harold the truth at the same time another lawyer formerly in jermyn 's confidence think the more profitable course could be find in throw jermyn over and write to esther inform she of she inheritance harold transome decide to act openly with he mother he drive to the minister 's house and mr transome persuade esther to come and stay at transome court both mother and son find esther to they liking and it appear to harold that marriage with esther would be a happy conclusion to the divide claim to the property he be rich and the transome -lrb- or bycliffe -rrb- property be heavily encumber the transome esther and mr lyon all agree that no law-suit over the property should take place but while esther stay at transome court she never forget she friend in prison mr lyon have visit felix and esther herself obtain a interview with he just before the assizes begin she have grow conscious that harold transome be make love to she that mr transome really desire she for a daughter-in-law and it seem to she as she wait with the minister in the cheerless prison room that she stand at the first and last parting of the way soon the door open and felix holt enter miss lyon -- esther and she hand be in he grasp he be just the same -- no something inexpressibly better because of the distance and separation which make he like the return of morning take no heed of I child say mr lyon i have some note to make and the old man sit down at a window with he back to they write with he head bent close to the paper felix have hear of esther 's change of fortune and feel sure she would marry harold transome it be only when the time for parting come that he could bring himself to say : i have a horrible struggle esther but you see i be right there be a fitting lot in reserve for you esther feel too miserable for tear to come she look helplessly at felix for a moment then take she hand from he and turn away mutely say father i be ready -- there be no more to say esther she hear felix say the word with a entreat cry and go towards he swiftly he clasp she and they kiss each other when the trial come on esther go under mr transome 's protection to the court the case against felix look very black when the prosecution close various respectable witness swear to the prisoner 's leadership of the mob to he fatal assault on tucker and to he attitude in front of the drawing-room window at the manor felix then give a concise narrative of he motive and conduct on the day of the riot and explain that in throw the constable down he have not foresee the possibility of death ensue it be a good straightforward speech not without a touch of defiant independence which do the prisoner little good with judge or jury mr lyon and harold transome both give evidence in favor of felix state that the prisoner have often express he hatred of rioting and have protest with indignation against the treat that go on during the election by some of the radical agent one or two witness be call who swear that felix have try to lead the mob in the opposite direction to treby manor and it be understand that the case for the defense be close then it come to esther that she must speak if felix be to be save there have be no witness to tell what have be he behavior just before the riot there be time but not too much time before harold transome be aware of esther 's intention she be on she way to the witness-box a sort of gleam shot across the face of felix holt and anyone close to the prisoner would have see that he hand tremble for the first time at esther 's beautiful aspect there be no blush on she face : she stand divest of all personal consideration whether of vanity or shyness and give she story as if she have be make a confession of faith she know felix holt well she say he come to see she on the day of the election and tell she he fear the man might collect again after drink it be the last thing he would have do to join in riot or to hurt any man if he could have help it he could never have have any intention that be not brave and good when she be back in she place felix could not help look towards she and they eye meet in one solemn glance esther stay in court till the end she hear the verdict guilty of manslaughter follow by the judge 's sentence imprisonment for four year but so great be the impression make by esther 's speech that a petition to the home secretary be at once set on foot by the lead man of the county _ iv -- felix and esther _ one April day when the sun shone on the linger raindrop lyddy be go out and esther choose to sit in the kitchen she be not read but stitch and as she finger move nimbly something play about she lip like a ray a loud rap come at the door mr lyon at home say felix in he firm tone no sir say esther : but miss lyon be if you 'll please to walk in esther exclaim felix amaze they hold each other by both hand and look into each other 's face with delight you be out of prison yes till i do something bad again but you -- how be it all be you come back to live here then yes you be not go to be marry to harold transome or to be rich no why say felix in rather a low tone lean he elbow on the table and rest he head on he hand while he look at she i do not wish to marry he or to be rich you have give it all up say felix lean forward a little and speaking in a still lower tone could you share the life of a poor man then esther if i think well enough of he she say with a smile and a pretty movement of she head have you consider well what it would be -- that it would be a very bare and simple life and the people i shall live among esther they have not just the same folly and vice as the rich but they have they own form of folly and vice it be very serious esther i know it be serious say esther look up at he since i have be at transome court i have see many thing very seriously if i have not i should not have leave what i do leave i make a deliberate choice she could not tell he that at transome court all that finally seem balance against she love for he be the offer of a silken bondage that arrest all motive and be nothing better than a well-cushioned despair a vision of be restless amidst ease of be languid among all appliance have quicken she resignation of the transome estate esther explain however that she think of retain a little of the wealth how say felix anxiously what do you mean i think even of two pound a week : one need not live up to the splendor of all that you know : we might live as simply as you like and then i think of a little income for you mother and a little income for my father to save he from be dependent when he be no longer able to preach felix put he hand on she shoulder say lift up he eye with a smile : why i shall be able to set up a great library and lend the book they laugh merrily each hold the other 's arm like girl and boy there be the ineffable sense of youth in common then felix lean forward that they lip might meet and after that he eye rove tenderly over she face and curl i be a rough severe fellow esther shall you never repent -- never be inwardly reproach I that i be not a man who could have share you wealth be you quite sure the very next may felix and esther be marry everyone in those day be marry at the parish church but mr lyon be not satisfy without a additional private solemnity so that he might have a more enlarged utterance of joy and supplication it be a very simple wedding but no wedding even the gayest ever raise so much interest and debate in treby magna even the very great people of the county go to the church to look at this bride who have renounce wealth and choose to be the wife of a man who say he would always be poor some few shake they head could not quite believe it and think there be more behind but the majority of honest trebian be affect somewhat in the same way as mr wall the brewer of the town who observe to he wife as they walk home i feel somehow as if i believe more in everything that be good felix and esther do not take up they abode in treby magna and after awhile mr lyon leave the town too and join they where they dwell as to the town in which felix holt now reside i will keep that a secret i will only say that esther have never repent felix however grumble a little that she have make he life too easy there be a young felix who have a great deal more science than he father but not much more money \* \* \* \* \* romola romola be george eliot 's fifth book and follow sila marner which be publish in 1861 it be a story of florence in the day of savonarolum and be largely the outcome of a visit the novelist pay to italy with she life-long friend george henry lewe with dim idea for the story in she mind she make exhaustive research in the florentine library gather historical and topographical detail of the city and its life as they be in the mediæval period which she be set herself to re-create after much study there and at home and after one false start she make a serious beginning in January 1862 she be engage upon it for eighteen month always in doubt and sometimes in despair of she ability to accomplish the task and by June of the following year she have thankfully write the last word of what be regard by some as she greatest book meanwhile the romance have begin to appear serially in the cornhill in July 1862 the writing of romolum be say to have plough into she more than any of she other book _ i -- tito and little tessa _ under the loggia de cerchi in the heart of old florence in the early morning of April 9 1492 two man have they eye fix on each other one be look downward with the scrutiny of curiosity the other lie on the pavement be look upward with the startled gaze of a suddenly awaken dreamer young man say the standing figure point to a ring on the finger of the other when you chin have get a stiffer crop on it you 'll know better than to take you nap in street corner with a ring like that on you forefinger by the holy ` vangel if it have be anybody but I stand over you -- but brattus ferravecchus be not the man to steal three year ago one san giovannus the saint send a dead body in my way -- a blind beggar with he cap well line with piece but how come a young man like you with the face of messer san michele to be sleep on a stone bed you tunic and hose match ill with that jewel young man anybody might say the saint have send you a dead body but if you take the jewel i hope you bury he -- and you can afford a mass or two for he into the bargain something like a painful thrill appear to dart through the frame of the listener and arrest the careless stretch of he arm but he immediately recover a air of indifference take off the red levantine cap which hang like a great purse over he left ear and push back he long dark brown curl say smile the fact be i be a stranger in florence and when i come in footsore last night i prefer fling myself in the corner of this hospitable porch to hunting for a chance hostelry which might turn out to be a nest of bloodsucker can you show I the way to a more lively quarter where i can get a meal and a lodging that i can say brattus and talk volubly as they go brattus lead the way to the mercato vecchio or the old market promise to conduct he to the prettiest damsel in the mercato for a cup of milk but as soon as they emerge from the narrow street into the old market they find the place pack with excited group of man and woman hum with gossip diavolo say brattus the mercato have go as mad as if the holy father have excommunicate we again i must know what this be he push about among the crowd inquire and dispute and be presently absorb in discuss the newest development of florentine politics the death of lorenzo de medici and whether or not this death be the beginning of the time of tribulation that savonarolum have be see in vision and foretell in sermon indifferent to this general agitation the young stranger become tired of wait for brattus 's escort and stroll on round the piazza feel on a sudden thought in the wallet that hang at he waist not a obolus by jupiter he murmur in a language that be not tuscan or even italian i must get my breakfast for love then in a corner away from any group of talker two mule be stand one carry wooden milk vessel the other a pair of pannier fill with herb and salad rest she elbow on the mule that carry the milk there lean a young girl apparently not more than sixteen with a red hood surround she face which be all the more baby-like in its prettiness from the entire concealment of she hair the poor child be weary and it seem to have go to sleep in that half-standing half-leaning posture nevertheless we stranger have no compunction in awake she she open she baby-blue eye and stare up with astonishment and confusion forgive I pretty one for awake you he say i be die with hunger and the scent of milk make breakfast seem more desirable than ever she bestir herself and in a few moment a large cup of fragrant milk be hold out to he and by the time he set the cup down she have bring bread from a bag which hang by the side of the mule and shyly and mutely insist on he take it even though he tell she he have nothing to pay she with and just as he be lean down to kiss she he be harshly interrupt by monna ghita tessa 's mother who have come upon they unobserved the handsome presence of the stranger and he charm of manner be of no avail with monna ghita she noisy rating of he draw brattus and the barber nello to the spot and with these he be glad to make good he escape have waive a furtive adieu to the pretty tessa it be not until after brattus have business at home have hand the young stranger over to nello and in the barber 's shop he have be shave and trim and make to look presentable that tito melema become more confidential and explain that he be a greek that he be return from adventure abroad have suffer shipwreck and find himself in florence with nothing save from the disaster but some few rare old gem for which he be anxious to obtain a purchaser let we see let we see say nello walk up and down he shop what you want be a man of wealth and influence and scholarly taste and that man be bartolommeo scalum the secretary of we republic he come to florence as a poor adventurer himself a miller 's son and that may be a reason why he may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strange scholar i could take you to a man who if he have a mind can help you to a chance of a favourable interview with scalum -- a man worth see for he own sake too to say nothing of he collection or of he daughter romolum who be as fair as the florentine lily before it get quarrelsome and turn red but if the father of this beautiful romolum make collection why should he not like to buy some of my gem himself nello shrug he shoulder for two good reason -- want of sight to look at the gem and want of money to pay for they _ ii -- more than a man 's ransom _ he be a moneyless blind old scholar the bardo de bardi to whom nello introduce tito melema a man who come of a proud energetic stock whose ancestor have love to play the signor have be merchant and usurer of keen daring and conspicuous among those who clutch the sword in the earliest world-famous quarrel of florentine with florentine the family passion live on in bardo under altered condition he be a man with a deep-veined hand cramp by much copying of manuscript who eat spare dinner and wear threadbare clothes at first from choice and at last from necessity who sit among he book and manuscript and see they only by the light of those far-off younger day which still shine in he memory and among he book and antiquity and rare marble fragment in a spacious room surround with laden shelf romolum be he daily companion and assistant there be a time when he have hope that he son dino would have follow in he step to be the prop of he age and to take up and continue he scholarly labor after he be dead but dino have fail he dino have give himself up to religion and enter the priesthood and the passion of bardo 's resentment have flame into fierce hatred towards this recreant son of he and none dare so much as to name he within he hearing maso the old serving-man usher in the two visitor he have announce a few minute previously and nello introduce tito to bardo and he daughter as a scholar of considerable learning romolum 's astonishment could hardly have be greater if the stranger have wear a panther-skin and carry a thyrsus for the cunning barber have say nothing of the greek age or appearance and among she father 's scholarly visitor she have hardly ever see any but gray-headed man nevertheless she return tito 's bow with the same pale proud face as ever but as he approach the snow melt and when he venture to look towards she again a pink flush overspread she face to vanish again almost immediately as if she imperious will have recall it tito 's glance on the other hand as he look at this tall maiden of seventeen or eighteen as she stand at the reading-desk with one hand on the back of she father 's chair have that gentle beseech admiration in it which be the most propitiating of appeal to a proud shy woman and be perhaps the only atonement a man can make for be too handsome messere i give you welcome say bardo with some condescension misfortune wed to learn and especially to greek learning be a letter of credit that should win the ear of every instruct florentine he proceed to question tito as to what part of greece he come from learn that he be a young man of unusual scholastic attainment and that he have a father who be himself a scholar at least say tito a father by adoption he be a neapolitan but he add after another slight pause he be lose to I -- be lose on a voyage he too rashly undertake to delo bardo forbore to speak further on so painful a topic he discourse freely upon he own study he past hope and the one great ambition that remain to he -- that he library and he magnificent collection of treasure should not be dissipate on he death but should become the property of the public and be honourably house in florence for all time with he name over the door in he eagerness he make pass reference to he son of how romolum have be fill he place to the best of she power and plainly hint -- and tito be not slow to profit by the opportunity -- that if he could have the young greek scholar to work with he instead of she he might yet look to fulfill some of the notable design he have abandon when he blindness come upon he but he resume in he original tone of condescension we be depart from what i believe be you most important business nello inform I that you have certain gem which you would fain dispose of i have one or two intaglio of much beauty say tito but they be now in the keep of messer domenico cenninus who have a strong and safe place for such thing he estimate they as worth at least five hundred ducat ah then they be fine intaglio say bardo five hundred ducat ah more than a man 's ransom tito give a slight almost imperceptible start and open he long dark eye with question surprise at bardo 's blind face as if he word -- a mere phrase of common parlance at a time when man be often be ransom from slavery or imprisonment -- have some special meaning for he but bardo have use the word in all innocence and go on to talk of superstition that attach to certain gem and to undertake that he would use he influence with the secretary of the republic in tito 's behalf both romolum and she father be attract by the charm and freshness and apparent simplicity of the young man but just as he be make ready to depart they be interrupt by the entrance of bernardo del nero one of the chief citizen of florence bardo 's oldest friend and romolum 's godfather and bernardo feel a instant instinctive distrust of the handsome ingratiating stranger and do not hesitate to say so after tito have leave they remember bardo he say at length thou hast a rare gem of thy own take care no one get it who be not like to pay a worthy price that pretty greek have a sleekness about he that seem marvelously fit for slip into any nest he fix he mind on _ iii -- the man who be wrong _ it be undeniable that tito 's come have be the dawn of a new life for both father and daughter and he grow to care for romolum supremely -- to wish to have she for he beautiful and loving wife he take she place as bardo 's assistant and serve he with a easy efficiency that have be beyond she and she happier in she father 's happiness have give she love to tito even before he venture to offer she he own he be thus sail under the fairest breeze and besides convincing fair judge that he talent square with he good fortune he wear that fortune so unpretentiously that no one seem to be offend by it and that be not the whole of tito 's good fortune for he have sell he jewel and be master of full five hundred gold florin yet the moment when he first have this sum in he possession be the crisis of the first serious struggle he facile good-humoured nature have know a man 's ransom who be it that have say five hundred florin be more than a man 's ransom if now under this mid-day sun on some hot coast far away a man somewhat stricken in year -- a man not without high thought and with the most passionate heart -- a man who long year ago have rescue a little boy from a life of beggary filth and cruel wrong and have rear he tenderly if that man be now under this summer sun toiling as a slave hew wood and draw water if he be say to himself tito will find I he have but to carry we gem to venice he will have raise money and will never rest till he find I out if that be certain could he -- tito -- see the price of the gem lie before he and say i will stay at florence where i be fan by soft air of love and prosperity i will not risk myself for he sake no surely not _ if it be certain _ but the galley have be take by a turkish vessel that be know by the report of the companion galley which have escape and there have be resistance and probable bloodsh a man have be see fall overboard he quiet he conscience with such reasoning as these and when definite tiding reach he that he father be still a prisoner he contrived to keep the knowledge to himself and still do nothing the death of the exhaust emaciated monk who have bring these tiding free he of one fear but this monk be romolum 's brother dino and obey he summons she have be in secret to see he as he lay die romolum she brother begin to speak in the deep night as i lay awake i see my father 's room and i see you and at the _ leggio _ where i use to stand stand a man whose face i could not see i see he move and take thee romolum by the hand and then i see thee take my father by the hand and you all three go down the stone step into the street the man whose face be a blank to I lead the way and you stand at the altar of santa croce and the priest who marry you have the face of death and the grave open and the dead in they shroud follow you like a bridal train and it seem to I that at last you come to a stony place where there be no water and no tree or herbage but instead of water i see write parchment unroll itself everywhere and instead of tree and herbage i see man of bronze and marble spring up and crowd round you and my father be faint and fall to the ground and the man loose thy hand and depart and as he go i could see he face and it be the face of the great tempter thrice have i have that vision romolum i believe it be a revelation mean for thee -- to warn thee against marriage as a temptation of the enemy the word die away frate say the die voice give she -- the crucifix say the voice of fra girolamo savonarolum who be stand in the shadow behind she dino say romolum with a low but piercing cry take the crucifix my daughter say fra girolamo after a few minute he eye behold it no more \* \* \* \* \* but heedless of the distrust and opposition of messer bernardo del nero and with this vision of dino 's menace he highest hope tito go gaily on he triumphant way also he have renew acquaintance with the little tessa he come upon she in the throng street during carnival time and see she a timorous tearful little _ contadin _ terrify by the burlesque threat of a boisterous conjurer take she under he protection thereafter he meet she again at interval find she naive love and humble adoration and obedience very pleasant and meet she once at a peasant 's fair he jestingly yield to the burlesque solicitation of a mountebank in a white mitre pay a small fee and go through a absurd ceremony of mock-marriage with she tessa herself believe the marriage to be real enough and he would not mar she delight by undeceive she later since she be wretched at home with she scolding mother and a brutal step-father and there be danger in allow she to go on waylay he in street when too long a period elapse between he visit to she he quietly take she away and establish she in a small house on the outskirts of the city with the deaf discreet old monna lisa as she servant and companion neither this nor the darker secret of he treachery to he adoptive father cast any cloud over he habitual cheerfulness he love for romolum be a higher and deeper passion than anything he feel for the child-like submissive little tessa and when she tell he frankly of she brother 's warning vision he set himself to convince she it be the mere nightmare of a diseased imagination and the perfect love and trust she have for he make the task easy for a while after they marriage she be ideally happy she be not even separate from she father for tito come to live with they and be to bardo in he scholastic labor all that he have wish he own son to be then come the first cloud on November 17 1494 more than eighteen month after the marriage of tito and romolum the king of france march he army into florence on he way to take possession of naple and impose peace on the war little state into which italy be divide there be those in florence who be prepare to welcome the invader but the majority the common people in particular resent they come with the soldiery come three wretched prisoner they be lead in rope by they captor and with blow from knotted cord be stimulate to beg two as they pass hold out they hand cry piteously for the love of god and the holy madonna give we something towards we ransom but the third remain obstinately silent he be old white-haired emaciate with a thick-set figure that seem to express energy in spite of age yet there be something fitful in he eye this sight be witness by the florentine with grow exasperation and presently from jeer at the french soldier and hustle they they become bent upon rescue this third prisoner from he tormentor one venturesome youth suddenly dash in cut the old man 's bond and urge he to run and the next moment he have plunge into the crowd which close behind he and hamper the pursuit with one soldier struggle desperately on he track the fugitive speed towards the duomo to seek refuge in that sanctuary but in mount the step he foot slip he be precipitated towards a group of signor who stand there with they back to he and clutch one to save himself it be tito melema who feel the clutch he turn and see the face of he adoptive father baldassarre calvo close to he own the two man look at each other silent as death tito with cheek and lip all bloodless fascinate by terror the next instant the grasp on he arm relax and baldassarre disappear within the church _ iv -- romolum 's ordeal _ with baldassarre lurk in florence tito go in hourly fear at any moment the story of he baseness might be blow abroad at any moment worse still he might be strike down by the old man in whose wild eye he have read only a fierce yearning for vengeance as a precaution tito take to wear a coat of fine chain-mail under he doublet and the discovery of this alarmed romolum for he safety and shock she with a suspicion that he be something of a coward but by now tito be deeply involve in florentine politics and easily persuade she that it be against secret political intriguer that he thus shield himself he go on to confess that he life be no longer safe in florence and he be resolve to leave the city for good but to this she demur she father have die and leave he library and he collection as a sacred trust to she and tito and until they have carry out he wish and make they over to the city authority she feel she could not go tito make light of she scruple she father 's wish he say have be a mere foolish vanity they have need of money and he intend to sell both the library and collection and when for the first time in she life she speak bitterly in scorn and anger of he faithlessness he tell she flatly it be useless to bandy word for he have sell they already and they be to be remove that day frantic with grief and resentment she think of desperate way of prevent the accomplishment of he heartless plan even to borrowing of she godfather and buy back the treasure so that tito might keep he ill-gotten gain and she father 's last wish still be fulfil but he convince she that all interference be too late for the thing have be purchase by the count di san severino and the seneschal de beaucaire who be already on they way with the french king to sienna latterly in many way romolum have be disappoint in she husband 's character she have find that he handsome face and gay air mask a cowardice a cunning meanness a sordid selfishness of disposition that be all at variance with she high ideal of he but that final unspeakable treachery of the dead man who have trust he so implicitly shatter she love for tito utterly as soon as she father 's library be dismantle and he treasure take away romolum go from the house with the old man-servant maso and would never have look upon tito 's face again but that fra girolamo intercept she i have a command to call you back he

forsake my husband ' but you can not cease to be a wife there be hunger and misery in the street and he urge upon she that if she have no other purpose in life she could stay and help the poor of she own city she pride be break and she yield _ v -- baldassarre be avenge _ meanwhile baldassarre lurk about florence have arm himself with a knife and be ravenous for revenge be homeless he call by chance at tessa 's little house and she not know who he be take pity on he age and misery give he shelter in a shed and food and drink whilst he be there tito come and too frankly simple to keep anything from he tessa confess that she have disobey he injunction against hold converse with stranger and be shelter a strange weary old man in the shed without she description of this guest leave tito in no doubt as to he identity and subdue he first perturbation he conceive that he might turn the situation to he own advantage he go out to the shed and look down upon baldassarre in the moonlight seek to propitiate he with honeyed word specious explanation and a plea for pardon but the old man answer nothing till he smouldering fury burst into a flame then he precipitate himself upon the intruder and strike with all he force but the blade of the knife break off short against the hidden coat of mail tito insist that he be welcome to remain there and say what he could to soothe he but baldassarre would stay no longer when he know whose roof cover he presently he arm himself anew and wait for another opportunity he learn all that be to be know of tito 's career since he arrival in florence ascertain that he be marry and have thought of win he wife 's sympathy and tell she of tessa then one night he contrived to get into the rucellaus garden where tito be at supper with a gathering of florentine notability and seize in time and hold back from assassinate he he passionately denounce he before the company as a scoundrel a liar and a robber there be those present who have be on the church step that day when baldassarre have clutch tito by the arm and tito have then explain away he momentary panic question now by one of these he declare that though when first he encounter he accuser he do not recognize he he now see that he be the servant who year ago accompany he and he adoptive father to greece and be dismiss on account of misdemeanor and that the story of he be rescue from beggary be the vision of a disorder brain baldassarre be give a chance to prove that he be not the servant but the great scholar to whom tito be indebted for he learn the ring i possess say rucellaus be a fine sard that i myself purchase from messer tito it be engrave with a subject from homer will you turn to the passage in homer from which that subject be take but sit to look over the book baldassarre realize that the suffering through which he have pass have unhinge he mind and he memory the word he stare at have no meaning for he and he lift he hand to he head in despair the consequence of this fresh failure be that baldassarre be cast into prison and tito be at liberty to pursue he political ambition unhaunt by that dog shadow that be to he as the shadow of death he manage he affair so cleverly that whichever party come uppermost he be secure of favor and money but by-and-by the tide begin to turn against he baldassarre be at large again and meet romolum and tell she not only of he own wrong but of tessa she see tessa and she two child and befriend they and be so far from blame that innocent little creature that she do not even disclose the truth to she but she be importunate with tito that he should make atonement to the man who have be a father to he then come a day when tito 's treachery be discover by the party he be suppose to serve and he have to flee for he life through florence scattering jewel and gold to delay he pursuer he leap from the bridge into the river and swam in the darkness leave the bellow mob to think he be drown but far down the stream there be certain eye that see he from the bank of the river and when he land and fall faint and helpless baldassarre 's hand close on he throat and next evening a passer-by find the two dead body there \* \* \* \* \* silas marner silas marner the weaver of raveloe begin about November 1860 and publish early in 1861 be in many respects the most admirable of all george eliot 's work it be not a long story but it be a most carefully finish novel -- a perfect gem a pure work of art mr oscar browning describe it mr blackwood the publisher find it rather sombre and george eliot reply to he i hope you will not find it at all a sad story as a whole since it set -- or be intend to set -- in a strong light the remedial influence of pure natural human relation i have feel all through as if the story would have lend itself best to metrical rather than to prose fiction especially in all that relate to the psychology of sila except that under that treatment there could not be a equal play of humor no novel of george eliot 's have receive more praise from man of letter than sila marner _ i -- why sila come to raveloe _ in the early year of the nineteenth century a linen-weaver name sila marner work at he vocation in a stone cottage that stand among the nutty hedgerow near the village of raveloe and not far from the edge of a desert stone-pit it be fifteen year since sila marner have first come to raveloe he be then simply a pallid young man with prominent short-sighted brown eye to the villager among whom he have come to settle he seem to have mysterious peculiarity chiefly owe to he advent from a unknown region call north ` ard he invite no comer to step across he door-sill and he never stroll into the village to drink a pint at the rainbow or to gossip at the wheel-wright ' he seek no man or woman save for the purpose of he call or in order to supply himself with necessaries at the end of fifteen year the raveloe man say just the same thing about sila marner as at the beginning there be only one important addition which the year have bring it be that master marner have lay by a fine sight of money somewhere and that he could buy up bigger man than himself but while he daily habit present scarcely any visible change marner 's inward life have be a history and a metamorphosis as that of every fervid nature must be when it have be condemn to solitude he life before he come to raveloe have be fill with the close fellowship of a narrow religious sect where the poorest layman have the chance of distinguish himself by gift of speech and marner be highly think of in that little hidden world know to itself as the church assemble in lantern yard he be believe to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith and a peculiar interest have be centre in he ever since he have fall at a prayer-meeting into a trance or cataleptic fit which last for a hour among the member of he church there be one young man name william dane with whom he live in close friendship and it seem to the unsuspecting sila that the friendship suffer no chill even after he have form a closer attachment and have become engage to a young servant-woman at this time the senior deacon be take dangerously ill and sila and william with other of the brethren take turn at night-watching on the night the old man die sila fall into one of he trance and when he awake at four o'clock in the morning death have come and further a little bag of money have be steal from the deacon 's bureau and sila 's pocket-knife be find inside the bureau for some time sila be mute with astonishment then he say god will clear I i know nothing about the knife be there or the money be go search I and my dwelling the search be make and it end in william dane find the deacon 's bag empty tuck behind the chest of drawer in sila 's chamber accord to the principle of the church in lantern yard prosecution be forbid to christian but the member be bind to take other measure for find out the truth and they resolve on pray and draw lot there be nothing unusual about such proceedings a hundred year ago sila kneel with he brethren rely on he own innocence be certify by immediate divine interference _ the lot declare that sila marner be guilty _ he be solemnly suspend from church - membership and call upon to render up the steal money only on confession and repentance could he be receive once more within the fold of the church marner listen in silence at last when everyone rise to depart he go towards william dane and say in a voice shake by agitation the last time i remember use my knife be when i take it out to cut a strap for you i do not remember put it in my pocket again _ you _ steal the money and you have weave a plot to lay the sin at my door but you may prosper for all that there be no just god but a god of lie that bear witness against the innocent there be a general shudder at this blasphemy poor marner go out with that despair in he soul -- that shake trust in god and man which be little short of madness to a loving nature in the bitterness of he wounded spirit he say to himself _ she _ will cast I off too and for a whole day he sit alone stun by despair the second day he take refuge from benumb unbelief by get into he loom and work away as usual and before many hour be past the minister and one of the deacon come to he with a message from sarah the young woman to whom he have be engage that she hold she engagement at a end in little more than a month from that time sarah be marry to william dane and not long afterwards it be know to the brethren in lantern yard that sila marner have depart from the town _ ii -- the second blow _ when sila marner first come to raveloe he seem to weave like a spider from pure impulse without reflection then there be the call of hunger and sila in he solitude have to provide he own breakfast dinner and supper to fetch he own water from the well and put he own kettle on the fire and all these immediate prompting help to reduce he life to the unquestioning activity of a spin insect he hate the thought of the past there be nothing that call out he love and fellowship towards the stranger he have come amongst and the future be all dark for there be no unseen love that care for he it be then when all purpose of life be go that sila get into the habit of look towards the money he receive for he weave and grasp it with a sense of fulfil effort gradually the guinea the crown and the half-crown grow to a heap and marner draw less and less for he own want try to solve the problem of keep himself strong enough to work sixteen hour a day on as small a outlay as possible he handle he coin he count they till they form and color be like the satisfaction of a thirst to he but it be only in the night when he work be do that he draw they out to enjoy they companionship he have take up some brick in he floor underneath he loom and here he have make a hole in which he set the iron pot that contain he guinea and silver coin cover the brick with sand whenever he replace they so year after year sila marner live in this solitude he guinea rise in the iron pot and he life narrowing and harden itself more and more as it become reduce to the function of weave and hoard this be the history of sila marner until the fifteenth year after he come to raveloe then about the christmas of that year a second great change come over he life it be a raw foggy night with rain and sila be return from the village plod along with a sack throw round he shoulder and with a horn lantern in he hand he leg be weary but he mind be at ease with the sense of security that spring from habit supper be he favorite meal because it be he time of revelry when he heart warm over he gold he reach he door in much satisfaction that he errand be do he open it and to he short-sighted eye everything remain as he have leave it except that the fire send out a welcome increase of heat as soon as he be warm he begin to think it would be a long while to wait till after supper before he draw out he guinea and it would be pleasant to see they on the table before he as he eat he food he rise and place he candle unsuspectingly on the floor near he loom sweep away the sand without notice any change and remove the brick the sight of the empty hole make he heart leap violently but the belief that he gold be go could not come at once -- only terror and the eager effort to put a end to the terror he pass he tremble hand all about the hole then he hold the candle and examine it curiously tremble more and more he search in every corner he turn he bed over and shake it and knead it he look in he brick oven and when there be no other place to be search he feel once more all round the hole he could see every object in he cottage and he gold be not there he put he tremble hand to he head and give a wild ringing scream -- the cry of desolation then the idea of a thief begin to present itself and he entertain it eagerly because a thief might be catch and make to restore the gold the robber must be lay hold of marner 's idea of legal authority be confuse but he feel that he must go and proclaim he loss and the great people in the village -- the clergyman the constable and squire cass -- would make the thief deliver up the steal money it be to the village inn sila marner go where the parish clerk and a select company be assemble and tell the story of he loss -- # 272 12 6d in all the machinery of the law be set in motion but no thief be ever capture nor could grounds be find for suspicion against any person what have really happen be that dunsey cass squire cass 's second son -- a mean boastful rascal -- on he way home on foot from hunting see the light in the weaver 's cottage and knock hope to borrow a lantern for the lane be unpleasantly slippery and the night dark but all be silence in the cottage for the weaver at that moment have not yet reach home for a minute dunsey think that old marner might be dead fall over into the stone pit and from that come the decision that he must be dead if so the question arise what would become of the money that everybody say the old miser have put by dunstan cass be in difficulty for want of money and he have kill he brother 's horse that day on the hunting-field who would know if marner be dead that anybody have come to take he hoard of money away there be only three hiding-place where he have hear of cottager ' hoard be find : the thatch the bed and a hole in the floor he eye travel eagerly over the floor note a spot where the sand have be more carefully spread dunstan find the hole and the money now hide in two leathern bag from they weight he judge they must be fill with guinea quickly he hasten out into the darkness with the bag and dunstan cass be see no more alive at the very moment when he turn he back on the cottage sila marner be not more than a hundred yard away _ iii -- sila marner 's visitor _ it be new year 's eve and squire cass be give a dance to the neighbouring gentry of raveloe there have be snow in the afternoon but at seven o'clock it have cease and a freezing wind have spring up a woman shabbily dress with a child in she arm be make she way towards raveloe seek the red house where squire cass live it be not the squire she want but he eldest son godfrey to whom she be secretly marry the marriage -- the result of rash impulse -- have be a unhappy one from the first for godfrey 's wife be the slave of opium the squire have long desire that he son should marry miss nancy lammeter and would have turn he out of house and home have he know of the unfortunate marriage already contract cold and weariness drive the woman even while she walk to the only comfort she know she raise the black remnant to she lip and then fling the empty phial away now she walk always more and more drowsily and clutch more and more automatically the sleep child at she bosom soon she feel nothing but a supreme longing to lie down and sleep and so sink down against a straggle furze-bush a easy pillow enough and the bed of snow too be soft the cold be no longer feel but she arm do not at once relax they instinctive clutch and the little one slumber on the complete torpor come at last the finger lose they tension the arm unbent then the little head fall away from the bosom and the blue eye of the child open wide on the cold starlight at first there be a little peevish cry of mammy as the child roll downward and then suddenly its eye be catch by a bright gleam light on the white ground and with the ready transition of infancy it decide the light must be catch in a instant the child have slip on all fours and after make out that the cunning gleam come from a very bright place the little one rise on its leg toddle through the snow -- toddle on to the open door of sila marner 's cottage and right up to the warm hearth where be a bright fire the little one accustom to be leave to itself for long hour without notice squat down on the old sack spread out before the fire in perfect contentment presently the little golden head sink down and the blue eye be veil by they delicate half-transparent lid but where be sila marner while this strange visitor have come to he hearth he be in the cottage but he do not see the child since he have lose he money he have contract the habit of open he door and look out from time to time as if he think that he money might somehow be come back to he that morning he have be tell by some of he neighbor that it be new year 's eve and that he must sit up and hear the old year ring out and the new ring in because that be good luck and might bring he money back again perhaps this friendly raveloe way of jest have help to throw sila into a more than usually excited state certainly he open he door again and again that night and the last time just as he put out he hand to close it the invisible wand of catalepsy arrest he and there he stand like a graven image powerless to resist either the good or evil that might enter when marner 's sensibility return he be unaware of the break in he consciousness and only notice that he be chill and faint turn towards the hearth it seem to he blur vision as if there be a heap of gold on the floor but instead of hard coin he finger encounter soft warm curl in utter amazement sila fall on he knee to examine the marvel : it be a sleep child a round fair thing with soft yellow ring all over its head could this be the little sister come back to he in a dream -- he little sister whom he have carry about in he arm for a year before she die that be the first thought _ be _ it a dream it be very much like he little sister how and when have the child come in without he knowledge but there be a cry on the hearth the child have awaken and marner stoop to lift it on to he knee he have plenty to do through the next hour the porridge sweeten with some dry brown sugar stop the cry of the little one for mammy then it occur to sila 's dull bachelor mind that the child want its wet boot off and this have be do the wet boot suggest that the child have be walk on the snow he make out the mark of the little foot in the snow and hold the child in he arm follow they track to the furze-bush then he become aware that there be something more than the bush before he -- that there be a human body half cover with the shift snow with the child in he arm sila at once go for the doctor who be spend the evening at the red house and godfrey cass recognize that it be he own child he see in marner 's arm the woman be dead -- have be dead for some hour the doctor say and godfrey who have accompany he to marner 's cottage understand that he be free to marry nancy lammeter you 'll take the child to the parish to-morrow godfrey ask speak as indifferently as he could who say so say marner sharply will they make I take she i shall keep she till anybody show they have a

sympathy be arouse amongst the woman the child be christen hephzibah after marner 's mother and be call eppie for short _ iv -- eppie 's decision _ eppie have come to link sila marner once more with

the mill on the floss in the mill on the floss publish in 1860 george eliot go to she own early life for the chief character in the story and in the relation of tom and maggie tulliver we get a picture of the youth of mary ann evan and she brother isaac lord lytton object that maggie be too passive in the scene at red deep and that the tragedy of the flood be not adequately prepare to this criticism george eliot answer now that the defect be suggest to I if the book be still in manuscript i should alter or rather expand that scene at red deep she also admit that there be a want of proportionate fulness in the conclusion but with all its fault the mill on the floss deserve the reputation it have win the reception of the story at first be disappointing and we find the authoress tell she publisher that she do not want to see any newspaper article but the book make its way and prepare a ever-growing public for sila marner _ i -- the tulliver of dorlcote mill _ what i want you know say mr tulliver what i want be to give tom a good eddication -- a eddication as 'll be a bread to he i mean to put he to a downright good school at midsummer the two year at th ' academy ` ud ha ' do well enough if i would mean to make a miller and farmer of he but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard it ` ud be a help to I wi ' these lawsuit and arbitration and thing i would not make a downright lawyer o ' the lad -- i should be sorry for he to be a raskill -- but a sort of engineer or a surveyor or a auctioneer and vallyer like riley or one o ' they smartish business as be all profit and no outlay only for a big watch-chain and a high stool they be pretty nigh all one and they be not far off be even wus ' the law i believe for riley look lawyer wakem i ' the face as hard as one cat look another _ he be _ none frighten at he mr tulliver be speak to he wife a blonde comely woman nearly forty year old well mr tulliver you know best _ i have _ no objection but if tom 's to go to a new school i should like he to go where i can wash he and mend he else he might as well have calico as linen and then when the box be goin ' backwards and forwards i could send the lad a cake or a pork-pie or a apple well well we will not send he out o ' reach o ' the carrier 's cart if other thing fit in say mr tulliver riley 's as likely a man as any to know o ' some school he be have schooling himself a ' go about to all sort o ' place -- arbitratin ' and vallyin ' and that so a day or two later mr riley the auctioneer come to dorlcote mill and stay the night the better that mr tulliver who be slow at come to a point might consult he on the all-important subject of he boy you see i want to put he to a new school at midsummer say mr tulliver when the topic have be reach i want to send he to a downright good school where they 'll make a scholard of he i do not mean tom to be a miller a ' farmer i see no fun i ' that i shall give tom a eddication and put he to a business as he may make a nest for himself a ' not want to push I out o ' mine at the sound of she brother 's name maggie the second and only other child of the tulliver who be seat on a low stool close by the fire with a large book open on she lap look up eagerly tom it appear be suppose capable of turn he father out of door this be not to be bear and maggie jump up from she stool and go up between she father 's knee say in a half-crying half-indignant voice father tom would not be naughty to you ever i know he would not mr tulliver 's heart be touch what they must not say any harm o ' tom eh he say look at maggie with a twinkling eye then in a lower voice turn to mr riley she understand what one 's talk about so as never be and you should hear she read -- straight off as if she know it all beforehand but it be bad -- it be bad a woman 's no business wus ' be so clever it 'll turn to trouble i doubt it be a pity but what she have be the lad -- she would ha ' be a match for the lawyer she would mr riley take a pinch of snuff before he say but you lad 's not stupid be he i see he when i be here last busy make fishing-tackle he seem quite up to it well he be not not to say stupid he be get a notion o ' thing out o ' door a ' a sort o ' commonsense as he would lay hold o ' thing by the right handle but he be slow with he tongue you see and read but poorly and can not abide the book and spell all wrong they tell I a ' as shy as can be wus ' stranger now what i want be to send he to a school where they 'll make he a bit nimble with he tongue and he pen to make a smart chap of he i want my son to be even wi ' these fellow as have get the start o ' I with schooling the talk end in mr riley recommend a country parson name stelling as a suitable tutor for tom and mr tulliver decide that he son should go to mr stelling at king 's lorton fifteen mile from dorlcote mill _ ii -- school-time _ tom tulliver 's suffering during the first quarter he be at king 's lorton under the distinguished care of the rev walter stelling be rather severe it have be very difficult for he to reconcile himself to the idea that he school-time be to be prolonged and that he be not to be bring up to he father 's business which he have always think extremely pleasant for it be nothing but ride about give order and go to market mr stelling be not a harsh-tempered or unkind man -- quite the contrary but he think tom a stupid boy and determine to develop he power through latin grammar and euclid to the best of he ability as for tom he have no distinct idea how there come to be such a thing as latin on this earth it would have take a long while to make it conceivable to he that there ever exist a people who buy and sell sheep and ox and transact the everyday affair of life through the medium of this language or why he should be call upon to learn it when its connection with those affair have become entirely latent he be of a very firm not to say obstinate disposition but there be no brute-like rebellion or recklessness in he nature the human sensibility predominate and he be anxious to acquire mr stelling 's approbation by show some quickness at he lesson if he have know how to accomplish it in he secret heart tom yearn to have maggie with he and before the first dreary half-year be end maggie actually come mr stell have give a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with she brother so when mr tulliver drive over to king 's lorton late in October maggie come too with the sense that she be take a great journey and begin to see the world well my lad mr tulliver say you look rarely school agree with you i do not think i _ be _ well father say tom i wish you would ask mr stelling not to let I do euclid -- it bring on the toothache i think euclid my lad -- why what be that say mr tulliver oh i do not know it be definition and axiom and triangle and thing it be a book i have get to learn in -- there be no sense in it go go say mr tulliver reprovingly you must not say so you must learn what you master tell you he know what it be right for you to learn in the second term mr stelling have a second pupil -- philip the son of lawyer wakem mr tulliver 's standing enemy philip be a very old-looking boy tom think he spine have be deform through a accident in infancy and to tom he be simply a humpback he have a vague notion that the deformity of wakem 's son have some relation to the lawyer 's rascality of which he have so often hear he father talk with hot emphasis there be a natural antipathy of temperament between the two boy for tom be a excellent bovine lad and philip be sensitive and suffer acute pain when the other blurt out offensive thing maggie on she second visit to king 's lorton pronounce philip to be a nice boy he could not choose he father you know she say to tom and i have read of very bad man who have good son as well as good parent who have bad child oh he be a queer fellow say tom curtly and he be as sulky as can be with I because i tell he he father be a rogue and i would a right to tell he so for it be true -- and he begin it with call I name a accident to tom 's foot bring the two boy nearer again and also throw philip and maggie together maggie say philip one day if you have have a brother like I do you think you should have love he as well as tom oh yes better she answer immediately no not better because i do not think i could love you better than tom but i should be so sorry -- so sorry for you philip color he have mean to imply would she love he as well in spite of he deformity and yet when she allude to it so plainly he wince under she pity maggie young as she be feel she mistake but you be so very clever philip and you can play and sing she add quickly i wish you be my brother i be very fond of you but you 'll go away soon and go to school maggie and then you 'll forget all about I and not care for I any more oh no i sha not forget you i be sure and maggie put she arm round he neck and kiss he quite earnestly _ iii -- the downfall _ when tom have turn sixteen and maggie three year younger be at board school come the downfall of the tulliver a long and expensive law-suit concern rights of water bring by mr tulliver end in defeat wakem be he opponent 's lawyer maggie break the news to tom not only would mill and land and everything be lose and nothing leave but they father have fall off he horse and know nobody and seem to have lose he sens they say mr wakem have get a mortgage or something on the land tom say maggie on they way home from king 's lorton it be the letter with that news in it that make father ill they think i believe that scoundrel 's be plan all along to ruin my father say tom leap from the vaguest impression to a definite conclusion i 'll make he feel for it when i be a man mind you never speak to philip again for more than two month mr tulliver lay ill in he room oblivious to all that be take place around he from time to time recognition come to he of he wife and family but there be no remembrance of recent event the mill and land of the tulliver be sell to wakem the lawyer and the bulk of they household goods be dispose of by public auction but the tulliver be not turn out of dorlcote mill and indeed when mr tulliver know to be a man of proud honesty be once more able to be up and about it be propose that he should remain and accept employment as manager of the mill for mr wakem it be with difficulty that poor tulliver could bring himself to accept the situation but he see the possibility by much pinching of save money out of the thirty shilling a week salary promise by wakem and pay a second dividend to he creditor the strongest influence of all be the love of the old premise where he have run about when he be a boy just as tom have do after he tom who have at once apply to he uncle deane partner in a wealthy merchant 's business for work and be now earn a pound a week have protest against entertain the proposition he should not like he father to be under wakem he think it would look nothing but mean spirited but mr tulliver have come to a decision the first evening of he new life downstairs he call he family round he and begin to speak look first at he wife i have make up my mind bessy i 'll stop in the old place and i 'll serve under wakem and i 'll serve he like a honest man there be no tulliver but what be honest mind that tom they 'll have it to throw up against I as i pay a dividend -- but it be not my fault -- it be because there be raskill in the world they have be too many for I and i must give in but i 'll serve he as honest as if he be no raskill i be a honest man though i shall never hold my head up no more i be a tree as be break -- a tree as be break he pause and look on the ground then suddenly raise he head he say in a louder yet deeper tone but i will not forgive he i know what they say -- he never mean I any harm i should not ha ' go to law they say but who make it so as there be no arbitrating and no justice to be get it signify nothing to he -- i know that he be one o ' they fine gentleman as get money by do business for poorer folk and when he be make beggar of 'em he 'll give 'em charity i will not forgive he i wish he might be punish with shame till he own son ` ud like to forget he and you mind this tom -- you never forgive he neither if you mean to be my son now write -- write it i ' the bible oh father what say maggie it be wicked to curse and bear malice it be not wicked i tell you say she father fiercely it be wicked as the raskill should prosper -- it be the devil 's do do as i tell you tom write the big bible be open at the begin where many family entry be put down what be i to write father say tom with gloomy submission write as you father edward tulliver take service under john wakem the man as have help to ruin he because i would promise my wife to make she what amends i could and because i want to die in th ' old place where i be bear and my father be bear put that i ' the right word -- you know how -- and then write as i do not forgive wakem for all that and for all i 'll serve he honest i wish evil may befall he write that there be a dead silence as tom 's pen move along the paper now let I hear what you have write say mr tulliver and tom read aloud slowly now write -- write as you 'll remember what wakem 's do to you father and you 'll make he and he feel it if ever the day come and sign you name -- thoma tulliver oh no father dear father say maggie tremble like a leaf you should not make tom write that be quiet maggie say tom impatiently i shall write it _ iv -- in death they be not divide _ the red deep be always a favorite place to maggie to walk in a old stone quarry so long exhaust that both mound and hollow be now clothe with bramble and tree and with here and there a stretch of grass which a few sheep keep close nibble this be the red deep and it be here in June that maggie once more meet philip wakem five year after they first meeting at mr stelling 's he tell she that she be much more beautiful than he have think she would be and assure she in

be anything so joyous as the spring of 1814 loui xviii be king and the war be over all except the old soldier be content and only when the noble who have flee at the revolution return and it be say that they be go to bring back all they old idea do m goulden express any dissatisfaction there be great religious procession everywhere and expiatory service and talk of rebuild all the convent and set up the noble again in they castle but these thing do not trouble I because i be marry to catherine and know nothing about politics the treatment of the old soldier enrage I on the day of the religious procession at phalsbourg half a dozen old veteran restore prisoner be set upon in we town by that rascal pinacle and the people of baraque and knock about pinacle do this to curry favor with loui xviii and m goulden warn we that if ruffian like pinacle get the upper hand it would open people 's eye sure enough pinacle receive the cross of honor in the autumn when the duc de berry come to review the troops at phalsbourg and even aunt grédel who be fond of abuse napoleon and the jacobin and applaud the king and the clergy think this a shameful thing it really be scandalous the way title and honor be give to worthless people who shout for the king worse than this be the way napoleon 's old officer be treat man who have fight and bleed for france for twenty year be now well-nigh starve drive out of the army to make room for the king 's favorite we read all this in the gazette and zébédé who have come back alive and in time for my wedding and be still in the army would often come in and tell we of the grow indignation of the soldier the whole of that winter the indignation be spread in the town at the sight of so many brave officer the hero of marengo austerlitz and wagram wander forlornly about starve on half-pay and deprive of they post how well i remember one day in January 1815 two of these officer pale and gaunt come into the workshop to sell a watch m goulden examine the watch with great care and say do not be offend gentleman i too serve france under the republic and i know it must cut to the heart to be force to sell something which recall sacred memory it be give I by prince eugène say one of the officer commandant margarot a hussar it be worth more than 1000 franc say m goulden and i can not afford to buy it but i will advance you 200 franc and the watch shall remain here if you like and shall be yours whenever you come to reclaim it the old hussar break down at this and though he comrade colonel falconette try to restrain he he pour forth thanks and bitter word against the government from that time it always seem to I that thing would end badly and that the noble have go too far the old commandant have say that the government behave like cossack to the army and this be horrible m goulden read the gazette aloud to we every day and both catherine and i be please to find there be man in paris maintain the very thing we think ourselves all this time the clergy be go on with they procession and sermon be be preach about the rebellion of 1790 the restitution of property to the landowner and the re-establishment of convent and the need for missionary for the conversion of france from such idea what good could come it be no wonder that when a report come early in march that napoleon have land at canne and be march on pari we be all very agitate at phalsbourg it be plain say m goulden that the emperor will reach paris the soldier be for he so be the peasantry whose property be threaten and so be the middle class provide he will make treaty of peace _ ii -- vive l'empereur _ for some day though all know napoleon have set foot in france no one dare talk of it aloud only the look of the half-pay officer betray they anxiety if they have possess horse and arm i be sure they would have set out to meet they emperor on march 8 zébédé enter we house and say abruptly the two first batallion be start they be go to stop he say m goulden yes they 'll stop he that be very likely zébédé answer wink at the foot of the stair he draw I aside and whisper look inside my cap joseph all the soldier have get it too sure enough it be the old tricolor cockade which have be remove on the return of loui xviii at last the papers have to admit that buonaparte have escape from elba what a scene it be in the café the night the papers arrive m goulden and i be hardly seat before the place be fill with people and it be so close the window have to be open commandant margarot mount on a table with other officer all around he and begin to read the gazette aloud it take a long time the reading and the people laugh and jeer at the passage that say the troops be faithful to the king that buonaparte be surround and would soon be take and that the illustrious ney and the other marshal have hasten to place they sword at the service of the king the commandant read on firmly in that distinct voice of he until he come to the order call upon the french to seize buonaparte and give he up dead or alive then he whole face change and he eye glitter he take the gazette up and tear it into little piece and draw himself up he long arm stretch out cry vive l'empereur with all he might immediately all the half-pay officer take up the cry and vive l'empereur be repeat again by the very soldier post outside the town hall when they hear the shout the commandant be carry shoulder high round the café and everyone be now call out vive l'empereur i see the tear in the eye of the commandant tear at hear the name he love best acclaimed once more as for I i feel as if cold water be be force down my back it be all over i say to myself it be no good talk about peace but m goulden be more hopeful and after we get home speak cheerfully of the blessing of liberty and a good constitution aunt grédel do not take this view she come to see we the morning after the scene in the café when all the town be discuss the great news and begin at once so it seem the villain have run away from he island both m goulden and i be anxious to avoid a dispute for aunt grédel be really angry and she could not leave the subject m goulden admit that he prefer napoleon to the bourbon with they noble and missionary priest because the emperor be bind to respect the national property whereas the later would have destroy all that the revolution have accomplish still i be now and always shall be till death for the republic and the rights of man m goulden conclude the old gentleman take he hat and go out to escape further argument and aunt grédel turn to I and tell I that m goulden be a old fool and always have be and that i should have to go to switzerland now unless buonaparte be take before he reach paris in the evening however when aunt grédel have go and we three be together catherine say quietly m goulden be right he know more about these thing than my mother do and we will always listen to he advice i think to myself yes that be all very well but it will be a horrible thing to have to put on one 's knapsack again and be off i would rather be in switzerland than in leipzig each day now bring news of napoleon 's advance from grenoble to lyon from lyon to macon and auxerre there be no opposition anywhere to he progress and the only question that trouble m goulden 's mind be the attitude of ney to the emperor could ney a old soldier of the revolution though he have kiss the hand of loui xviii betray the country to please the king the uneasiness disappear when we learn that ney have follow the example of the army the citizen and of all who do not wish to go back to the custom and law of twenty-five year earlier on march 21 just as it be get dark we know that something decisive must have happen at paris the drum be call to arm in the market-place and a great crowd soon assemble the soldier fall into they rank commandant gémeau who have only just recover from he wound draw he sword and give the order to form square m goulden and i get on a bench to listen we know that the fate of france depend on the message we be to hear present arm call out the commandant in the same clear voice which have bid we at lützen and leipzig close up you rank then come the news we have be wait for soldier he majesty loui xviii left pari on march 20 and the emperor napoleon enter the capital the same day for a second there be a dead silence and then the commandant speak of the banner of france the banner of marengo austerlitz and jena stain with we blood and the old sergeant draw out the tattered tricolor flag from its case i know no other flag cry the commandant raise he sword vive la france vive l'empereur what a shout there be of vive l'empereur vive la france at this the people and the soldier embrace one another and that night and for the next five or six day there be if anything even more rejoice than there have be on the return of loui xviii we still hope for the continuance of peace but who could say how long the peace would last phalsbourg be order to put itself into a state of defense a large workshop be set up at the arsenal for the repair of arm and engineer and artilleryman come over from metz to make earthwork in the fortification it seem to I that a large number of man would be require for all the gun and fort and that my watchmaking day would soon be exchange for active service i begin to think that after all religious procession be better than be send to fight against people one know nothing about _ iii -- on the road to waterloo _ aunt grédel have not be to see we for a month and it be a great comfort to catherine and I when one Sunday m goulden propose that we should all three pay she a visit at quatre vents as soon as she see we aunt grédel rush to kiss she daughter and call out you be a good man m goulden better a thousand time than i be how glad i be to see you it do not matter about be a jacobin or anything else the main thing be to have a good heart it be not until the afternoon that m goulden explain that he have know for some day that i should be call up to rejoin my old regiment and that he have arrange with the commandant of artillery that i should be receive at the arsenal as a workman what relief this be to we for i could not bear the thought of separation from catherine so from that day i go to work at the arsenal and aunt grédel come to see we again as she have be accustom to do it can be guess with what spirit i work at the arsenal and how pleased i be when the commandant express satisfaction at my work but i be not allow to stop at phalsbourg on may 23 the commandant tell I that i must go to metz with the 3rd battalion to which i belong he assure I however that i should be keep at metz in the workshop and we all do we best to believe that i be fortunate in my destination m goulden however warn I before i leave that france be threaten by she enemy that the ally would make no peace with the emperor but be determine to set loui xviii once more on the throne and that now the question be not of invade other country but of defend we own catherine be asleep when the morning come for my departure and i be glad to escape the pain of say good-bye at the barracks zébédé who be now a sergeant lead I into the soldier ' room and i put on my uniform then the battalion defile through the gate the soldier at the outwork present arm and we be on the way to waterloo it be useless to think of stop in metz we arrive in that city of jew and soldier after five day ' march and be at once after we night 's rest supply with ammunition i see that my only chance of stay at the workshop of metz would be after the campaign be over for we be on the march the very next morning zébédé be not always with I now and my closest comrade be jean buche the son of a sledge-maker at harberg who have never eat anything better than potato before he become a conscript buche turn in he foot in walk but he never seem to know the meaning of be tired and in he own fashion be a wonderful pedestrian from metz we march through thionville châtelet etain dannevoux yong vivier and cul-de-sard all we troops be pour into belgium -- cavalry infantry and artillery -- and though there be no sign of the enemy it be report that we be to attack the english i think as well english as prussian austrian or russian since we be to kill each other on the night of June 14 we bivouac outside the village of roly and general pécheux read a proclamation by the emperor remind we that this be the anniversary of marengo that the power be in coalition against france and that the hour have come for france to conquer or perish it be impossible to describe the enthusiasm at this message from the emperor we courage be stronger and the conscript be even more anxious than the veteran for the fight to begin we be up at daybreak next day and on the march eager to get a sight of the prussian who have be repulse from charlerous by the emperor we be tell at the village of châtelet we halt and hear the noise of firing away across the river sambre in the direction of gilly a old bald peasant tell we that evening that the prussian have man in the village of fleurus and lambusart that the english and belgian be on the great brussels road and that the causeway through quatre bras and ligny enable the prussian and english to communicate freely with each other he also tell we that the prussian say insulting thing of the french army and be generally hate by the people when i hear of the way the prussian boast my blood boil and i say to myself there shall be no more compassion either they or we must be utterly destroy i can recall with what splendor the sun rise next morning above a cornfield -- it be the morning of the battle of ligny zébédé and one or two comrade whom i have know in 1813 come and chatter while we light we fire we could see the prussian before we post themselves behind hedge and wall and prepare to defend the village and all the time we be keep roast in the corn wait for the signal to attack the emperor arrive and hold a short conference with the superior officer and i see he at close quarter before he ride off again to the village of fleurus already vacate by the prussian and still we wait though we know the attack on st amand have begin at last come we turn to advance on ligny forward forward cry the officer vive l'empereur we shout the prussian bullet whiz like hail upon we and then we could see or hear nothing till we be in the village no quarter be give that day we fight in house and garden in barn and lane with musket and bayonet those who fall be lose at one time fifteen of we be in possession of a barn and the prussian for a time outnumber we drive we up a ladder they fire up at we floor and finally when it seem we be lose and be all to be massacre we hear the shout of vive l'empereur and the prussian flee out of that fifteen only six be leave alive but zébédé and buche be among the survivor the battle still rage in the village street dead and die be everywhere towards nightfall it be plain we be the victor ligny and st amand be in we hand and the prussian have move away on the plateau behind ligny where we cavalry have be at work the slaughter have be terrible the dozen or so remain of we company rest for a few hour that night in the ruin of a farmhouse and next day come the roll-call of we battalion and the send off of the wound more than 360 of we man include commandant gémeau and captain vidal be disabled and we be busy all day over the wound it be wet and muddy that evening and we be hungry and dispirited when we reach quatre bras about eight o'clock we be not allow to halt here but march on to a village call jemappe and at midnight we settle down in a furrow to wait for morning the red coat of the english be visible before we when we awake next morning behind they line be the village of mont st jean and they have also the farmhouse of la haie-sainte and hougomont at six o'clock i look at they position with zébédé captain florentin and buche and it seem to I it be a difficult task before we it be Sunday and i could hear the bell of village recall phalsbourg but in a very little while we hear no more bell for at half-past eight we battalion be on its way to the high road in front and the battle of waterloo have begin _ iv -- the hour of disaster _ i have often hear veteran describe the order of battle give by the emperor but all i remember of that terrible day be that we march out with the band play that we get to close quarter with the english be repulse and be assist by regiment of cuirassier that we carry la haie-sainte with terrible slaughter at ney 's command hougomont we could not carry when we think we be win the news be spread that blücher with 60000 man be advance on we flank and that unless grouchy with he 30000 arrive in time to reinforce we the day might be lose all the world know now that grouchy do not arrive that we throw ourselves again and again upon the english square and that at last when regiment after regiment have try in vain to break the enemy 's line the old guard be call up by the emperor it be the last chance of retrieve the day the grand stroke -- and it fail the four battalion of the guard reduce from 3000 to 1200 man be assail by so fierce a fire that they be compel to retire they retire slowly defend themselves with musket and bayonet but with they retirement and the approach of night the battle end for we in the confusion of a rout it be like a flood we be surround on all side when blücher arrive the old guard form a square for the emperor and he officer and the rest of we simply straggle away back to france the most awful thing of all be the beating of the drum of the old guard in that hour of disaster it be like a fire-bell the last appeal of a burning nation buche be by my side in the retreat several time the prussian attack we we hear that the emperor have depart for pari and we struggle on only hope to escape with we life at charlerous the inhabitant shut the city gate in we face and buche share in the general rage and propose to destroy the town but i think we have have enough massacre and that it be not right we should be kill we own countryman and i persuade buche to come on with I in a few day we feel ourselves safe from pursue prussian and at the village of bouvigny i write a letter to catherine tell she i be safe in this village some officer of we regiment the 6th of the line find we and we have to rejoin presently we see all that be leave of grouchy 's army corps in retreat and a day or two later we hear of the emperor 's abdication on July 1 we reach paris and outside the city near the village of issy we once more fall in with the prussian for two day we fight they with fury and then some general announce that peace have be make we believe that this truce be to give the enemy time to leave the country and that otherwise france would rise as it rise in '92 and drive they out unhappily we soon learn that the prussian and english be to occupy pari and that the remains of the french army be to be keep beyond the loire we all feel that we have be betray and the old officer pale with anger weep in they misery pari in the hand of the prussian besides be we to go to the other side of the loire at the command of blücher desertion begin that very day and i say to buche let we return to phalsbourg and harberg and take up we work and live like honest man about fifty of we from alsace-lorraine be in the battalion and we set off together on the road to strasbourg on July 8 we hear that loui xviii be to come back and already the white banner of the bourbon be be display in the village in some place there be rascal who call we buonapartist and gendarme who take we to the town hall and make we shout vive le rous buche and some of the old soldier hate this but what do it matter who be king and what these fool want we to shout we little company get smaller and smaller as man halt in they own village and when on July 16 we reach phalsbourg buche and i be alone buche go on to break the news of my return but i could not wait and run after he i hear people say there be joseph bertha and in a moment i be in the house and in catherine 's arm then i embrace m goulden and a hour later aunt grédel arrive jean buche would not stay and dine with we but hurry home to harberg i have often see he since and zébédé too who remain in the army many insulting thing be say about we by the pinacle but i have happiness in my family circle especially when catherine present I with a little joseph i be a old man now but m goulden always say the principle of freedom and liberty would triumph and i have

regard literature as a ignoble profession when octave run away to paris in order to pursue a literary career he father refuse to help he and for some year the young writer have a very hard struggle but on take to novel-writing feuillet quickly acquire fame and fortune he romance of a poor young man -lrb- le roman d'un jeune homme pauvre -rrb- which appear in 1858 make he the most popular author of the day standing midway between the novelist of the romantic school and the writer of the realistic movement he combine a sense of the poetry of life with a gift for analyze the finer shades of feel the plot of the romance of a poor young man be certainly extraordinary but in the present case some allowance must be make for the fact that the hero be induce to accept the humble position in which he find himself by he old family lawyer who secretly design to marry he to the daughter of he new employer a scheme of this sort would not strike a french reader as improbable for marriage in france be often more a business arrangement than a love affair feuillet spend the latter part of he life in retirement and die on December 29 1890 _ i -- a nobleman in difficulty _ here i be then in the situation that lawyer laubépin obtain for I i be alone at last thank goodness sit in a gloomy room in this old breton castle in which the former steward to the laroque family use to live my position be certainly very strange but as laubépin be discreet and do not tell he client that he be send they a new steward in the person of the young marquis of champcey perhaps i shall not find my post very difficult i be afraid that the laroque be a family of the vulgarly rich sort like the dreadful person who have buy my father 's land laroque be a picturesque figure in he old age and though he widow daughter-in-law be rather more commonplace he grand-daughter marguerite laroque be a nobly beautiful girl if it be not for my accursed pride i should now feel happier than i have ever feel since that day of disaster misery and shame when laubépin tell I that my poor dead father have lose he fortune in speculation and leave nothing but he title and he debt well i have pay the debt and if i can now only earn enough money to keep my little sister hélène at school i shall not grumble at my lot i feel the loss of my friend it be true there be not a soul i can confide in and i must find some outlet for the thought and feeling that oppress I so i will keep this diary it will be at least a silent confidant and perhaps when i be older i shall be able to read with a certain pleasurable interest its record of my singular adventure no other man in france on may 1 1857 can have be transform so suddenly as by the wand of a witch from a powerful and wealthy young nobleman of ancient lineage into a humble and despise domestic servant perhaps a good fairy will appear and restore I to my proper shape but i wish she have appear at dinner this evening there be twenty guest and it be the first time since the change of my fortune that i take part in a society affair nobody speak to I except the pretty little governess of the family mlle hélouin and we be place at the end of the table the position of honor be give to a young and brilliant nobleman m de bévallan whose estate join that of the laroque family i gather from mlle hélouin that it be he ambition to unite the two estate by marry mlle marguerite laroque i be therefore surprise when the lovely heiress lead she grandfather into the room when everybody be seat place he in a chair by bévallan and come and sit by my side she can not i think to myself be much in love with she wooer and i begin to study she with a certain curiosity she fine clear-cut feature and large dark eye attract I and by way of open the conversation i speak of the wildly beautiful scenery through which i have pass on my way to the castle it be a bad beginning i see she say with a singular expression of irony that you be a poet you must talk about the forest and moorland with mlle hélouin who also adore these thing for my part i do not love they what be it then that you really love i say she give I a supercilious look and say in a hard voice nothing sir i must confess i be hurt i could not see that i have do anything to lay myself open to so harsh a answer no doubt i be only a servant but why have she come and sit beside I if she do not want to talk i be glad when the dinner be over and we go into the drawing-room madame laroque the widow mother of marguerite begin to ask m bévallan about the new opera in paris he be unable to reply so as i have see the work in italy before it be produce in france i give she a description of it i be afraid i forget myself with madame laroque -- a fine-looking cultivate woman of forty year of age flatter by the way in which she treat I entirely as she equal i insensibly glide from theatrical topic to fashionable gossip and just stop in time in a anecdote about my tour in russium a few more word and she would have learn that she humble steward maxime odiot -- as i be now call -- be a man with very aristocratic connection in order to hide my embarrassment i move towards the table where some of the guest be play whist this lead to my commit a blunder which i fear may make my position a difficult one among the whist - player be a mlle de porhoet-gael eighty-eight year of age and full of strange crotchet the last descendant of the noblest of breton family she live so madame laroque tell I on a income of forty pound a year she fortune have be spend in vainly fight for the succession to a great estate in spain she be talk about it to she partner when i come up the estate belong to I she be say my father tell I so a hundred time and the person who be try to take it from I have no more connection with my family than this handsome young gentleman have and she designate I with a look and a movement of she head no doubt she do not mean to imply that because i be a steward i be of mean birth but i be sting by she remark and forget myself i reply rather sharply you be mistaken madam in think that i be unrelated to you family you will have to prove that to I young man confuse and ashamed i withdraw into the corner and try to talk to mlle hélouin about poetry and art but at last upset and distract i arise and walk out of the room mlle de porhoet follow I monsieur odiot she say would you mind see I home my servant have not arrive and i be grow too feeble now to walk without help naturally i go with she what do you mean she say as we walk on together by claim to be a relation of mine i hope i reply very humbly that you will pardon a jest that -- a jest she interrupt be a matter touch my honor a jest i see a remark which would be a insult if address to a man become only a jest when it be level at a old unprotected woman after that nothing be leave to I as a man of honor but to entrust she with my secret there have be several marriage between we family and after listen with great interest to the story of my trouble she become wonderfully kind in she manner to I you must come and see I to-morrow cousin she say when we part my law-suit be go very badly and i should like you to go through all my papers and see if you can discover any new document in support of my claim do not despair my dear over you own misfortune i think i shall be able to help you _ ii -- love and jealousy _ i be afraid i lack the industry necessary for keep a diary it be now two month since i write the last entry if i have make every night a brief note of the event of the day i should now have a better view of my position have mlle de porhoet betray my secret there have certainly be a curious change in my relation with the laroque i fancy it begin on the day when marguerite and i meet at last on a equal footing at mlle de porhoet 's house the document which i have just then find may not be as important as we think but we common joy in what we consider be a discovery of tremendous value bring we closer together but i can not understand marguerite sometimes she still go out of she way to be insulting towards I and sometimes she treat I with a sweet frankness which have something sisterly in it one day for instance she come to my window and ask I if i would go for a walk with she bring you sketch-book monsieur odiot she call out gaily and i will take you to merlin 's tomb in the enchanted valley as a matter of fact the wood around the castle of the laroque be the remains of the famous forest of broceliande and i have always be promising myself a long ramble through this region of romance but i have never find time to explore it i be now glad i have wait for marguerite be a charming guide never have i see she so light-hearted when we reach a great block of stone in the depth of the wood under which the wizard merlin be say to be imprison by vivien marguerite make herself a garland of oak-leaf and standing like a lovely priestess clothe all in white against the druidic monument she ask I to make a sketch of she with what joy do i paint the poetic vision before I i think she be please with the drawing but on we way back to the castle a foolish word of mine bring we friendship to a end we come to a picturesque little lake at the end of which be a waterfall overgrow with bramble in order to show what a good swimmer she dog be marguerite throw something in the current and tell he to fetch it but he get carry over the waterfall and catch in the whirlpool below come away he be drown -- come away i can not bear to see it cry marguerite seize I by the arm no do not attempt to save he the pool be very dangerous i be a good swimmer however and with a little trouble i manage to rescue the dog what madness she murmur you might have be drown and just for a dog it be yours i answer in a low voice she manner at once change you have better run home monsieur odiot she say very coldly or you will get a chill do not wait for I so i return alone and for some day marguerite never speak a word to I what be still worse m bévallan appear at the castle and she go for walk with he leave I in the company of mlle hélouin i be afraid that i become very friendly with the pretty governess nothing however that i ever say to she or that she say to I prepare I for the strange scene that happen to-night as i be walk along the terrace she come up and take my arm and say be you really my friend maxime yes i say then tell I the truth she exclaim do you love I or do you love mademoiselle marguerite why do you bring in she name i say ah you love she she cry fiercely or rather you love she fortune but you shall never have it monsieur de champcey i know why you come here under a false name and so shall she with a movement of anger she depart i can not continue here under suspicion of be a fortune-hunter so i have write to laubépin to obtain another situation for I _ iii -- two on a tower _ it be all over be it because she still only half believe the slander spread against I that marguerite again ask I to go for a walk with she oh what a unfortunate wretch i be we ride through the forest together to one of the most magnificent monument in brittany the castle of elven find the door unlock we tethered we horse in the desert courtyard and climb up the narrow wind staircase to the battlements the sea of autumnal foliage below be bath in the light of the setting sun and for a long time we sit side by side in silence gaze at the infinite distance come she say at last in a low whisper as the light die out of the sky it be finish but on descend the dark staircase we find that the door of the keep be lock no doubt the shepherd boy who look after the castle have come and shut up the place while we be sit watch

marry you by compromise I in this manner do you think you will win my hand -- and what be more important to you still my wretched wealth -- by this trick rather than marry a scoundrel like you i will shut myself up in a convent carry away by my feeling i seize she two hand and say now listen marguerite i love you it be true never do man love more devotedly yes and more disinterestedly than i do but i swear that if i get out of this place alive i will never marry you until you be as poor as i be or i as rich as you be if you love I as i think you do fall on you knee and pray for unless a

of booth 's extravagance in the country that he firmly believe both the husband and wife to be the vainest silliest and most unjust people alive but no sooner do the doctor hear that booth be arrest

these ten year \* \* \* \* \* jonathan wild jonathan wild publish in 1743 be in many respects field 's most powerful piece of satire surpass only perhaps by thackeray 's barry lyndon it can hardly be call a novel and still less a serious biography though it be found on the real history of a notorious highway robber and thief the author disclaim in he preface any attempt on he part at authentic history or faithful portraiture roguery and not a rogue be my subject he write add that the idea of goodness and greatness be too often confound together a man may be great without be good or good without be great the story of jonathan wild be really a bitter satirical attack on what fielding call the greatness which be totally devoid of goodness he avow it he intention to expose the character of this bombast greatness and no one can deny the success of he achievement surely no story be ever write under more desperate circumstance the evil of poverty which at this period be at they height be aggravate by the serious illness of he wife and he own suffering from attack of gout these trouble and other may well increase we admiration for the genius which in the face of all difficulty be show in jonathan wild _ i -- mr wild 's early exploit _ mr jonathan wild who be descend from a long line of great man be bear in 1665 he father follow the fortune of mr snap who enjoy a reputable office under the sheriff of london and middlesex and he mother be the daughter of scragg hollow esq of hockley-in-the-hole he be scarce settle at school before he give mark of he lofty and aspiring temper and be regard by he schoolfellow with that deference which man generally pay to those superior genius who will exact it of they if a orchard be to be rob wild be consult and though he be himself seldom concerned in the execution of the design yet be he always concerter of it and treasurer of the booty some little part of which he would now and then with wonderful generosity bestow on those who take it he be generally very secret on these occasion but if any offer to plunder of he own head without acquaint master wild and make a deposit of the booty he be sure to have a information against he lodge with the schoolmaster and to be severely punish for he pain at the age of seventeen he father bring the young gentleman to town where he reside with he till he be of a age to travel man of great genius as easily discover one another as freemason can it be therefore no wonder that the count la ruse -- who be confine in mr snap 's house until the day when he should appear in court to answer a certain creditor -- soon conceive a inclination to a intimacy with we young hero whose vast ability could not be conceal from one of the count 's discernment for though the latter be exceedingly expert at he card he be no match for master wild who never fail to send he away from the table with less in he pocket than he bring to it with so much ingenuity indeed could we young hero extract a purse that he hand make frequent visit to the count 's pocket before the latter have entertain any suspicion of he but one night when wild imagine the count asleep he make so unguarded a attack upon he that the other catch he in the act however he do not think proper to acquaint he with the discovery he have make but only take care for the future to button he pocket and to pack the card with double industry in reality this detection recommend these two prig to each other for a wise man -- that be to say a rogue -- consider a trick in life as a gamester doth a trick at play it set he on he guard but he admire the dexterity of he who play it when we two friend meet the next morning the count begin to bewail the misfortune of he captivity and the backwardness of friend to assist each other in they necessity wild tell he that bribery be the surest means of procure he escape and advise he to apply to the maid tell he at the same time that as he have no money he must make it up with promise which he would know how to put off the maid only consent to leave the door open when wild deposit a guinea in the girl 's hand declare that he himself would swear that he see the count descend from the window by a pair of sheet thus do we young hero not only lend he rhetoric which few people care to do without a fee but he money too to procure liberty for he friend at the same time it would be highly derogatory from the great character of wild should the reader not understand that this be do because we hero have some interested view in the count 's enlargement intimacy and friendship subsist between the count and mr wild and the latter now dress in good clothes be introduce into the best company they constantly frequent the assembly auction gaming - table and play-house and wild pass for a gentleman of great fortune it be then that a accident occur that oblige wild to go abroad for seven year to he majesty 's plantation in america and there be such various account one of which only can be true of this accident that we shall pass they all over it be enough that wild go abroad and stay seven year _ ii -- a example of wild 's greatness _ the count be one night very successful at the gaming-table where wild who be just return from he travels be then present as be likewise a young gentleman whose name be bob bagshot a acquaintance of mr wild 's take therefore mr bagshot aside he advise he to provide himself with a case of pistol and to attack the count on he way home this be accordingly execute and the count oblige to surrender to savage force what he have in so genteel a manner take at play as one misfortune never come alone the count have hardly pass the examination of mr bagshot when he fall into the hand of mr snap who carry he to he house mr wild and mr bagshot go together to the tavern where mr bagshot offer to share the booty have divide the money into two unequal heap and add a golden snuffbox to the lesser heap he desire mr wild to take he choice mr wild immediately convey the larger share of the ready into he pocket accord to a excellent maxim of he -- first secure what share you can before you wrangle for the rest and then turn to he companion he ask he whether he intend to keep all that sum himself i grant you take it wild say but pray who propose or counsel the taking of it can you say that you have do more than execute my scheme the ploughman the shepherd the weaver the builder and the soldier work not for themselves but other they be contented with a poor pittance -- the labourer 's hire -- and permit we the great to enjoy the fruit of they labor why then should the state of a prig differ from all other or why should you who be the labourer only the executor of my scheme expect a share in the profit be advise therefore deliver the whole booty to I and trust to my bounty for you reward mr bagshot not be mind to yield to these argument wild adopt a fiercer tone and the other be glad to let he borrow a part of he share so that wild get three-fourth of the whole before take leave of he companion wild then return to visit he friend the count now in captivity at mr snap 's for we hero be none of those half-bred fellow who be ashamed to see they friend when they have plunder and betray they the count little suspect that wild have be the sole contriver of the misfortune which have befall he eagerly embrace he and wild return he embrace with equal warmth while they be discourse mr snap introduce mr bagshot for mr bagshot have lose what money he have from mr wild at a gaming-table and be directly afterwards arrest for debt mr wild no sooner see he friend than he immediately present he to the count who receive he with great civility but no sooner be mr bagshot out of the room than the count say to wild i be very well convince that bagshot be the person who rob I and i will apply to a justice of the peace wild reply with indignation that mr bagshot be a man of honor but as this have no weight with the count he go on more vehemently i be ashamed of my own discernment when i mistook you for a great man prosecute he and you may promise yourself to be blow up at every gaming-house in the town but leave the affair to I and if i find he have play you this trick i will engage my own honor you shall in the end be no loser the count answer if i be sure to be no loser mr wild i apprehend you have a better opinion of my understanding than to imagine i would prosecute a gentleman for the sake of the public wild have determine to make use of bagshot as long as he could and then send he to be hang go to bagshot next day and tell he the count know all and intend to prosecute he and the only thing to be do be to refund the money refund the money cry bagshot why you know what small part of it fall to my share how reply wild be this you gratitude to I for save you life for you own conscience must convince you of you guilt marry come up quoth bagshot i believe my life alone will not be in danger can you deny you share yes you rascal answer wild i do deny everything and do you find a witness to prove it i will show you the difference between commit a robbery and conniving at it so alarm be bagshot at the threat of wild that he draw forth all he find in he pocket to the amount of twenty-one guinea which he have just gain at dice wild now return to the count and inform he that he have get ten guinea of bagshot and by these mean the count be once more enlarged and enable to carry out a new plan of the great wild _ iii -- mr heartfree 's weakness _ by accident wild have meet with a young fellow who have formerly be he companion at school mr thoma heartfree -lrb- for that be he name -rrb- be of a honest and open disposition he be possess of several great weakness of mind be good-natured friendly and generous to a great excess this young man who be about wild 's age have some time before set up in the trade of a jeweller in the material for which he have lay out the greatest part of a little fortune he no sooner recognize wild than he accost he in the most friendly manner and invite he home with he to breakfast which invitation we hero with no great difficulty consent to wild after vehement profession of friendship then tell he he have a opportunity of recommend a gentleman on the brink of marriage to he custom and say he i will endeavor to prevail on he to furnish he lady with jewel at you shop have part from heartfree wild seek out the count who in order to procure credit from tradesman have take a handsome house ready-furnished in one of the new street he instruct the count to take only one of heartfree 's jewel at the first interview to reject the rest as not fine enough and order he to provide some richer the count be then to dispose of the jewel and by means of that money and he great ability at card and dice to get together as large a sum as possible which he be to pay down to heartfree at the delivery of the set of jewel this method be immediately put in execution and the count the first day take only a single brilliant worth about # 300 and order a necklace and earring of the value of # 3000 more to be prepare by that day week this interval be employ by wild in raise a gang and within a few day he have levy several bold and resolute fellow fit for any enterprise how dangerous or great soever the count dispose of he jewel for its full value and by he dexterity raise # 1000 this sum he pay down to heartfree at the end of the week and promise he the rest within a month heartfree do not in the least scruple give he credit but as he have in reality procure those jewel of another he own little stock not be able to furnish anything so valuable the count in addition to the # 1000 in gold give he he note for # 2800 more as soon as heartfree be depart wild come in and receive the casket from the count and a appointment be make to meet the next morning to come to a division of its contents two gentleman of resolution in the meantime attack heartfree on he way home accord to wild 's order and spoil the enemy of the whole sum he have receive from the count accord to agreement wild who have make haste to overtake the conqueror take nine-tenth of the booty but be himself rob of this # 900 before nightfall as for the casket when he open it the stone be but paste for the sagacious count have convey the jewel into he own pocket and in they stead have place artificial stone on wild 's departure the count hasten out of london and be well on he way to dover when wild knock at he door heartfree wound and rob have only the count 's note leave and this be return to he as worthless inquiry have prove that the count have run away so confused be poor heartfree at this that he creditor for the jewel be frightened and at once have he arrest for the debt heartfree apply in vain for money to numerous customer who be indebted to he they all reply with various excuse and the unhappy wretch be soon take to newgate he have be incline to blame wild for he misfortune but we hero boldly attack he for give credit to the count and this degree of impudence convinced both heartfree and he wife of wild 's innocence the more so as the latter promise to procure bail for he friend in this he be unsuccessful and it be long before heartfree be release and restore to happiness _ iv -- the highest pinnacle of greatness _ wild be a living instance that human greatness and happiness be not always inseparable he be under a continual alarm of fright and fear and jealousy and be thoroughly convince there be not a single man amongst he own gang who would not for the value of five shilling bring he to the gallows a clause in a act of parliament procure by a learn judge entrap wild hitherto he have always employ less gifted man to carry out he plan now by this law it be make capital in a prig to steal with the hand of other people and it be impossible for we hero to avoid the destruction so plainly calculate for he greatness wild have receive from some dutiful member of he gang a valuable piece of goods do for a consideration re-convey it to the right owner for which fact be ungratefully inform against by the say owner he be surprise in he own house and be overpower by number be hurry before a magistrate and by he commit to newgate when the day of he trial arrive we hero be notwithstanding he utmost caution and prudence convict and sentence to be hang by the neck he now suspect that the malice of he enemy would overpower he and therefore betook himself to that true support of greatness in affliction -- a bottle by means of which he be enable to curse swear and bully and brave he fate other comfort indeed he have not much for not a single friend ever come near he from the time we hero give over all hope of life he conduct be truly great and admirable instead of show any mark of contrition or dejection he rather infuse more confidence and assurance into he look he spend most of he hour in drinking with acquaintance and with the good chaplain and be ask whether he be afraid to die he answer it be only a dance without music a man can die but once zound who be afraid at length the morning come which fortune have resolutely ordain for the consummation of we hero 's greatness he have himself indeed modestly decline the public honor she intend he and have take a quantity of laudanum in order to retire quietly off the stage but it be vain to struggle against the decree of fortune and the laudanum prove insufficient to stop he breath at the usual hour he be acquaint that the cart be ready and he fetter have be knock off in a solemn and ceremonious manner after drink a bumper of brandy he ascend the cart where he be no sooner seat than he receive the acclamation of the multitude who be highly ravish with he greatness the cart now move slowly on precede by a troop of horse guard bear javelin in they hand through the street line with crowd all admire the great behavior of we hero who ride on sometimes sigh sometimes swearing sometimes singing or whistle as he humor vary when he come to the tree of glory he be welcome with a universal shout of the people but there be not want some who malign this completion of glory now about to be fulfil by we hero and endeavor to prevent it by knock he on the head as he stand under the tree while the chaplain be perform he last office they therefore begin to batter the cart with stone brick-bat dirt and all manner of mischievous weapon so that the ecclesiastic end almost in a instant and convey himself into a place of safety in a hackney coach one circumstance must not be omit whilst the chaplain be busy in he ejaculation wild in the midst of the shower of stone etc which play upon he true to he character apply he hand to the parson 's pocket and empty it of he bottle-screw which he carry out of the world in he hand the chaplain be now descend from the cart wild have just opportunity to cast he eye around the crowd and to give they a hearty curse when immediately the horse move on and with universal applause we hero swing out of this world \* \* \* \* \* joseph andrew joseph andrew fielding 's first novel be publish in 1742 and be intend to be a satire on richardson 's pamelum -lrb- see vol vii -rrb- which appear in 1740 he describe it as write in the manner of cervante and in parson adam there be the same quaint blending of the humorous and the pathetic as in the knight of la mancha although such character as lady booby and mrs slipslop be admittedly ridiculous parson adam remain a admirable study of a simple-minded clergyman of the eighteenth century _ i -- the virtue of joseph andrew _ mr joseph andrew be esteem to be the only son of gaffer and gammer andrew and brother to the illustrious pamelum at ten year old -lrb- by which time he education be advance to write and read -rrb- he be bind a apprentice to sir thoma booby a uncle of mr booby 's by the father 's side from the stable of sir thoma

wonderfully pleased mr abraham adam be a excellent scholar a man of good sense and good nature but at the same time entirely ignorant of the way of the world at the age of fifty he be provide with a handsome income of twenty - three pound a year which however he could not make any great figure with because he be a little encumber with a wife and six child adam have no nearer access to sir thoma or my lady than through mr slipslop the waiting-gentlewoman for sir thoma be too apt to estimate man merely by they dress or fortune and my lady be a woman of gaiety who never speak of any of she country neighbor by any other appellation than that of the brute mr slipslop be herself the daughter of a curate preserve some respect for adam she would frequently dispute with he and be a mighty affecter of hard word which she use in such a manner that the parson be frequently at some loss to guess she meaning adam be so much impress by the industry and application he see in young andrew that one day he mention the case to mr slipslop desire she to recommend he to my lady as a youth very susceptible of learn and one whose instruction in latin he would himself undertake by which mean he might be qualify for a higher station than that of footman he therefore desire that the boy might be leave behind under he care when sir thoma and my lady go to london la mr adam say mr slipslop do you think my lady will suffer any preamble about any such matter she be go to london very concisely and i be confidous would not leave joey behind on any account for he be one of the genteelest young fellow you may see in a summer 's day and i be confidous she would as soon think of parting with a pair of she gray mare for she value herself on one as much as the other and why be latin more necessitous for a footman than a gentleman i be confidous my lady would be angry with I for mention it and i shall draw myself into no such delemy so young andrew go to london in attendance on lady booby and become acquaint with the brethren of he profession they could not however teach he to game swear drink nor any other genteel vice the town abound with he apply most of he leisure hour to music in which he greatly improve himself so that he lead the opinion of all the other footman at a opera though he moral remain entirely uncorrupted he be at the same time smarter and genteeler than any of the beau in town either in or out of livery at this time a accident happen and this be no other than the death of sir thoma booby who leave he disconsolate lady closely confine to she house during the first six day the poor lady admit none but mr slipslop and three female friend who make a party at card but on the seventh she order joey whom we shall hereafter call joseph to bring up she teakettle lady booby 's affection for she footman have for some time be a matter of gossip in the town but it be certain that she innocent freedom have make no impression on young andrew now however he think my lady have become distract with grief at she husband 's death so strange be she conduct and write to he sister pamelum on the subject if madam be mad i shall not care for stay long in the family so i heartily wish you could get I a place at some neighbouring gentleman 's i fancy i shall be discharge very soon and the moment i be i shall return to my old master 's country seat if it be only to see parson adam who be the best man in the world london be a bad place and there be so little good fellowship that the next-door neighbor do not know one another you loving brother joseph andrew the send of this letter be quickly follow by the discharge of the writer to lady booby 's open declaration of love joseph reply that a lady have no virtue be not a reason against he have any i be out of patience cry the lady do ever mortal hear of a man 's virtue will magistrate who punish lewdness or parson who preach against it make any scruple of commit it and can a boy have the confidence to talk of he virtue madam say joseph that boy be the brother of pamelum and would be ashamed that the chastity of he family which be preserve in she should be stain in he if there be such man as you ladyship mention i be sorry for it and i wish they have a opportunity of read my sister pamelum 's letter nor do i doubt but such a example would amend they you impudent villain cry the lady in a rage get out of my sight and leave the house this night joseph have receive what wages be due and have be strip of he livery take a melancholy leave of he fellow-servant and set out at seven in the evening _ ii -- adventure on the road _ it may be wonder why joseph make such extraordinary haste to get out of london and why instead of proceed to the habitation of he father and mother or to he beloved sister pamelum he choose rather to set out full speed to lady booby 's country seat which he have leave on he journey to town be it known then that in the same parish where this seat stand there live a young girl whom joseph long more impatiently to see than he parent or he sister she be a poor girl formerly breed up in sir thoma 's house and discard by mr slipslop on account of she extraordinary beauty be now a servant to a farmer in the parish fanny be two year younger than we hero and have be always beloved by he and return he affection they have be acquaint from they infancy and mr adam have with much ado prevent they from marry and persuade they to wait till a few year ' service and thrift have a little improve they experience and enable they to live comfortably together they follow this good man 's advice as indeed he word be little less than a law in he parish for during twenty-five year he have show that he have the good of he parishioner entirely at heart so that they consult he on every occasion and very seldom act contrary to he opinion honest joseph therefore set out on he travels without delay in order that he might once more look upon he fanny from whom he have be absent for twelve month but on the road he be attack by robber and have be leave wound in a ditch be mercifully take to a inn by some later traveller it be at this same inn that to the great surprise on both side mr abraham adam find joseph the parson inform he young friend who be still sick in bed that the occasion of the journey he be make to london be to publish three volume of sermon be encourage as he say by a advertisement lately set forth by the society of bookseller but though he imagine he should get a considerable sum of money on this occasion which he family be in urgent need of he protest he would not leave joseph in he present penniless condition finally he tell he he have nine shilling and threepence-halfpenny in he pocket which he be welcome to use as he please this goodness of parson adam bring tear into joseph 's eye he have now a second reason to desire life that he might show he gratitude to such a friend before pursue he journey adam make the acquaintance of another clergyman name barnaba at the inn who in he turn hear that adam be propose to publish sermon introduce he to a stranger who he say be a bookseller adam salute the stranger answer barnaba that he be very much oblige to he that nothing could be more convenient for he have no other business to the great city and be heartily desirous of return with the young man who be just recover of he misfortune to induce the bookseller to be as expeditious as possible he assure they they meeting be extremely lucky to himself for that he have the most pressing occasion for money at that time he own be almost spend so that nothing say he could be so opportune as my make a immediate bargain with you sir sermon be mere drug say the stranger the trade be so vastly stock with they that really unless they come out with the name of whitefield or wesley or some other such great man as a bishop or those sort of people i do not care to touch however i will if you please take the manuscript with I to town and send you my opinion of it in a very short time when however adam begin to describe the nature of he sermon the bookseller draw back on the ground that the clergy would be certain to cry down such a book a accident prevent mr adam from pursue a market for he sermon any further which he would have do in spite of the advice of barnaba and the bookseller this accident be that those sermon which the parson be travel to london to publish be leave behind what he have mistake for they in the saddle-bag be three shirt which mr adam who think she husband would need shirt rather than sermon on he journey have carefully provide for he joseph concern at the disappointment to he friend beg he to pursue he journey all the same and promise he would himself return with the

when we traveller leave the ale-house that they have not travel many mile before night overtake they they move forwards where the nearest light present itself and have cross a common field they come

bid to booby hall to tell the whole story again all who hear he be well satisfied of the truth except pamelum who imagine as neither of she parent have ever mention such a incident to she it must be false and except lady booby who suspect the falsehood of the story from she ardent desire that it should be true and joseph who fear its truth from he earnest wish that it might prove false on the follow morning news come of the arrival of old mr andrew and he wife mr andrew assure mr booby that he have never lose a daughter by gypsy nor ever have any other child than joseph and pamelum but old

my life appear in six volume on February 28 1749 a short time after fielding 's appointment as justice of peace for westminster though its broad humor and coarseness of expression be perhaps hard to bear in these time it be by common consent fielding 's masterpiece and by way of be one of the greatest novel in the language for experience of life observation of character and sheer humanity it be certainly a outstanding specimen of the english novel and manners like other of he book tom jone be write during a period of great mental strain ever haunt by poverty fielding acknowledge he debt to he old schoolfellow lyttelton to whom he owe he existence during the composition of the book the story be popular from the first _ i -- mr allworthy make a discovery _ in that part of the country which be commonly call somersetshire there lately live a gentleman whose name be allworthy and who might well be call the favorite of both nature and fortune from the former of these he derive a agreeable person a sound constitution a solid understanding and a benevolent heart by the latter he be decree to the inheritance of one of the largest estate in the country mr allworthy live for the most part retire in the country with one sister for whom he have a very tender affection this lady miss bridget allworthy now somewhat past the age of thirty be of that species of woman whom you commend rather for good quality than beauty mr allworthy have be absent a full quarter of a year in london on some very particular business and have return to he house very late in the evening retire much fatigue to he chamber here after he have spend some minute on he knee -- a custom which he never break through on any account -- he be prepare to step into bed when upon open the clothes to he great surprise he behold a infant wrap up in some coarse linen in a sweet and profound sleep between he sheet he stand for some time lose in astonishment at this sight but soon begin to be touch with sentiment of compassion for the little wretch before he he then ring he bell and order a elderly woman-servant to rise immediately and come to he the consternation of mr deborah wilkin at the finding of the little infant be rather greater than she master 's have be nor could she refrain from cry out with great horror my good sir what be to be do mr allworthy answer she must take care of the child that evening and in the morning he would give order to provide it a nurse yes sir say she and i hope you worship will send out you warrant to take up the hussy its mother indeed such wicked slut can not be too severely punish for lay they sin at honest man 's door and though you worship know you own innocence yet the world be censorious and if you worship should provide for the child it may make the people after to believe if i might be so bold as to give my advice i would have it put in a basket and send out and lay at the churchwarden 's door it be a good night only a little rainy and windy and if it be well wrap up and put in a warm basket it be two to one but it live till it be find in the morning but if it should not we have discharge we duty in take care of it and it be perhaps better for such creature to die in a state of innocence than to grow up and imitate they mother but mr allworthy have now get one of he finger into the infant 's hand which by its gentle pressure seem to implore he assistance certainly outplead the eloquence of mr deborah mr allworthy give positive order for the child to be take away and provide with pap and other thing against it wake he likewise order that proper clothes should be procure for it early in the morning and that it should be bring to himself as soon as he be stir such be the respect mr wilkin bear she master under whom she enjoy a most excellent place that she scruple give way to he peremptory command and declare the child be a sweet little infant she walk off with it to she own chamber allworthy betook himself to those please slumber which a heart that hunger after goodness be apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfy in the morning mr allworthy tell he sister he have a present for she and when mr wilkin produce the little infant tell she the whole story of its appearance miss bridget take the good-natured side of the question intimate some compassion for the helpless little creature and commend she brother 's charity in what he have do the good lady subsequently give order for provide all necessaries for the child and she order be indeed so liberal that have it be a child of she own she could not have exceed they _ ii -- the foundling achieve manhood _ miss bridget have be ask in marriage by one captain blifil a half-pay officer and the nuptials duly celebrate mr blifil be in course of time deliver of a fine boy though the birth of a heir to he beloved sister be a circumstance of great joy to mr allworthy yet it do not alienate he affection from the little foundling to whom he have be godfather and have give he own name of thoma the surname of jone be add because it be believe that be the mother 's name he tell he sister if she please the newborn infant should be breed up together with little tommy to which she consent for she have truly a great complaisance for she brother the captain however could not so easily bring himself to bear what he condemn as a fault in mr allworthy for he meditation be chiefly employ on mr allworthy 's fortune and on he hope of succession he look on all the instance of he brother-in-law 's generosity as diminution of he own wealth but one day while the captain be exult in the happiness which would accrue to he by mr allworthy 's death he himself die of apoplexy so the two boy grow up together under the care of mr allworthy and mr blifil and by the time he be fourteen tom jone -- who accord to universal opinion be certainly bear to be hang -- have be already convict of three robbery -- _ viz _ of rob a orchard of steal a duck out of a farmer 's yard and of pick master blifil 's pocket of a ball the vice of this young man be moreover heighten by the disadvantageous light in which they appear when oppose to the virtue of master blifil he companion he be indeed a lad of remarkable disposition -- sober discreet and pious beyond he age and many express they wonder that mr allworthy should suffer such a lad as tom jone to be educate with he nephew lest the moral of the latter should be corrupt by he example to say the truth the whole duck and great part of the apple be convert to the use of tom 's friend the gamekeeper and he family though as jone alone be discover the poor lad bear not only the whole smart but the whole blame mr allworthy have commit the instruction of the two boy to a learn divine the reverend mr thwackum who reside in the house but though mr allworthy have give he frequent order to make no difference between the lad yet be thwackum altogether as kind and gentle to master blifil as he be harsh nay even barbarous to the other in truth blifil have greatly gain he master 's affection partly by the profound respect he always show he person but much more by the decent reverence with which he receive he doctrine for he have get by heart and frequently repeat he phrase and maintain all he master 's religious principle with a zeal which be surprising in one so young tom jone on the other hand be not only deficient in outward token of respect often forget to pull off he cap at he master 's approach but be altogether unmindful both of he master 's precept and example at the age of twenty however tom for he love of hunting have become a great favorite with mr allworthy 's neighbor squire western and sophium mr western 's only child lose she heart irretrievably to he before she suspect it be in danger on he side tom be truly sensible of the great worth of sophium he like she person extremely no less admire she accomplishment and tenderly love she goodness in reality as he have never once entertain any thought of possess she nor have ever give the least voluntary indulgence to he inclination he have a much stronger passion for she than he himself be acquaint with a accident occur on the hunting-field in save sophium from she too mettlesome horse keep jone a prisoner for some time in mr western 's house and during those week he not only find that he love sophium with a unbounded passion but he plainly see the tender sentiment she have for he yet could not this assurance lessen he despair of obtain the consent of she father nor the horror which attend he pursuit of she by any base or treacherous method hence at the approach of the young lady he grow pale and if this be sudden start if he eye accidentally meet hers the blood rush into he cheek and he countenance become all over scarlet if he touch she he hand nay he whole frame tremble all these symptom escape the notice of the squire but not so of sophium she soon perceive these agitation of mind in jone and be at no loss to discover the cause for indeed she recognize it in she own breast in a word she be in love with he to distraction it be not long before jone be able to attend she to the harpsichord where she would kindly condescend for hour together to charm he with the most delicious music the news that mr allworthy be dangerously ill -lrb- for a servant have bring word that he be die -rrb- break off tom 's stay at mr western 's and drive all the thought of love out of he head he hurry instantly into the chariot which be send for he and order the coachman to drive with all imaginable haste nor do the idea of sophium once occur to he on the way _ iii -- tom jone fall into disgrace _ on the night when the physician announce that mr allworthy be out of danger jone be throw into such immoderate excess of rapture by the news that he might be truly say to be drunk with joy -- a intoxication which greatly forwards the effect of wine and as he be very free too with the bottle on this occasion he become very soon literally drunk jone have naturally violent animal spirit and thwackum resent he speech only the doctor 's interposition prevent wrath kindling after which jone give loose to mirth sing two or three amorous song and fall into every frantic disorder which unbridled joy be apt to inspire but so far be he from any disposition to quarrel that he be ten time better-humoured if possible than when he be sober blifil whose mother have die during she brother 's illness be highly offend at a behavior which be so inconsistent with the sober and prudent reserve of he own temper the recent death of he mother he declare make such conduct very indecent it would become they better he say to express the exultation of they heart at mr allworthy 's recovery in thanksgiving than in drunkenness and riot wine have not so totally overpower jone as to prevent he recollect blifil 's loss the moment it be mention he at once offer to shake mr blifil by the hand and beg he pardon say he excessive joy for mr allworthy 's recovery have drive every other think out of he mind blifil scornfully reject he hand and with a insulting illusion to the misfortune of jone 's birth provoke the latter to blow the scuffle which ensue might have produce mischief have it not be for the interference of thwackum and the physician blifil however only wait for a opportunity to be revenge on jone and the occasion be soon forthcoming when mr allworthy be fully recover from he illness mr western have find out that he daughter be in love with tom jone and at once decide that she should marry blifil to whom sophia profess great abhorrence as for blifil the success of jone be much more grievous to he than the loss of sophium whose estate indeed be dearer to he than she person mr western swear that he daughter should not have a ha ` penny nor the twentieth part of a brass farthing if she marry jone and blifil with many sigh profess to he uncle that he could not bear the thought of sophium be ruin by she preference for jone this lady i be sure will be undo in every sense for besides the loss of most part of she own fortune she will be marry to a beggar nay that be a trifle for i know he to be one of the worst man in the world how say mr all worthy i command you to tell I what you mean you know sir say blifil i never disobey you in the very day of you utmost danger when myself and all the family be in tear he fill the house with riot and debauchery he drink and sing and roar and when i give he a gentle hint of the indecency of he action he fall into a violent passion swear many oath call I rascal and strike I i be sure i have forgive he that long ago i wish i could so easily forget he ingratitude to the best of benefactor thwackum be now send for and corroborate every circumstance which the other have depose poor jone be too full of grief at the thought that western have discover the whole affair between he and sophium to make any adequate defense he could not deny the charge of drunkenness and out of modesty sink everything that related particularly to himself mr allworthy answer that he be now resolve to banish he from he sight for ever you audacious attempt to steal away a young lady call upon I to justify my own character in punish you and there be no part of you character which i resent more than you ill-treatment of that good young man -lrb- meaning blifil -rrb- who have behave with so much tenderness and honor towards you a flood of tear now gush from the eye of jone and every faculty of speech and motion seem to have desert he it be some time before he be able to obey allworthy 's peremptory command of depart which he at length do have first kiss he hand with a passion difficult to be affect and as difficult to be describe mr allworthy however do not permit he to leave the house penniless but present he with a note for # 500 he then command he to go immediately and tell jone that he clothes and everything else should be send to he whithersoever he should order they jone have hardly set out which he do with feeling of agony and despair before sophium western decide that only in flight could she be save from marriage with the detest blifil mr western in spite of tremendous love for he daughter think she inclination of as little consequence as blifil himself conceive they to be and mr allworthy who say he would on no account be accessory to force a young lady into a marriage contrary to she own will be satisfy by he nephew 's disingenuous statement that the young lady 's behavior to he be full as forward as he wish it sophium have appoint she maid to meet she at a certain place not far from the house exactly at the ghostly and dreadful hour of twelve begin to prepare for she own departure but first she be oblige to give a painful audience to she father and he treat she in so violent and outrageous a manner that he frighten she into a affected compliance with he will which so highly pleased the good squire that he at once change he frown into smile and he menace into promise he vow he whole soul be wrap in hers that she consent have make he the happiest of mankind he then give she a large bank-bill to dispose of in any trinket she please and kiss and embrace she in the fondest manner sophium reverence she father piously and love he passionately but the thought of she beloved jone quickly destroy all the regretful prompting of filial love _ iv -- tom jone 's restoration _ after many adventure on the road mr jone reach london and as he have often hear mr allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house in bond street he use to lodge when he be in town he seek the house and be soon provide with a room there on the second floor mr miller the person who let these lodgings be the widow of a clergyman and mr allworthy have settle a annuity of # 50 a year on she in consideration of always have she first floor when he be in town tom jone 's fortune be now very soon at the lowest have be force into a quarrel in the street with a acquaintance name fitzpatrick and have wound he with he sword a number of fellow rush in and carry jone off to the civil magistrate who be inform that the wound appear to be mortal straightway commit the prisoner to the gatehouse sophium western be also in london at the house of she aunt and soon afterwards mr western mr allworthy and blifil all reach the city it be just at this time that mr allworthy consent to he nephew once more offer himself to sophium come with blifil to he accustomed lodgings in bond street mr miller to whom jone have show many kindness at once put in a good word for the unfortunate young man and on blifil exult over the manslaughter jone be allege to have commit declare that the wounded man whoever he be be in fault this indeed be shortly afterwards

and admit the aggression jone be release from custody and return to he lodgings to meet mr allworthy it be impossible to conceive a more tender or move scene than this meeting between the uncle and nephew allworthy receive jone into he arm o my child he cry how have i be to blame how have i injure you what amends can i ever make you for those unkind suspicion which i have entertain and for all

flammarion with a certain disdain as more of a poet than a astronomer but he soon vindicate by several important discovery he title to be regard as a man of science uranium which appear in 1889 be a excellent example of he ability as a thinker and of he charm as a writer the work be hardly a novel though it be far more popular than many book of fiction it be really a essay in philosophy deal with the question of the immortality of the soul and it have a especial interest for english reader owe to the fact that much in it that seem to be pure fantasy be base on research undertake by the british society for psychical research the plot and the character be of secondary importance they be only use for the purpose of illustrate certain idea _ i -- the muse of astronomy _ i be seventeen year old when i fall in love with uranium be she a fair young blue-eyed daughter of eve no she be a exquisite statue of the muse of astronomy chisel by pradier in the day of the empire she stand on the mantelpiece in the study of the famous mathematician le verrier who direct the pari observatory where i be work at four o'clock in the afternoon my illustrious chief use to depart and i would then steal into he room and sit down before uranium and dream of lovelier world than ours hide in the infinite space of the starry sky sometimes my friend and companion in study george spero would come and sit beside I and inspire by the immortal beauty of uranium we would let we young and ardent imagination play over the glory and wonder of the heaven you will be too late for jupiter say le verrier enter unexpectedly one evening and catch I in a attitude of adoration before uranium i be afraid you be more of a poet than a astronomer the great man of science himself certainly do not love beauty as much as he love wisdom for the next day he sell the lovely image of uranium in order to buy a old chinese astronomical clock i be almost heartbroken when i enter he room and find that uranium have disappear with she have go the vivify power of imagination which have transmute the abstruse calculation on which i be engage into glimpse of heavenly vision of infinite life with what wild joy then

unimaginable splendor i know the meaning of the two moon and of my strange feeling of lightness i be a disembodied spirit that have be transport to mar do you know camille that the soul be able to choose its mortal cover this be at least the case on mar for some time i wander about in a invisible form study the condition of life there animal strength i find count for nothing the martian be a aerial race with exquisite sens which respond in a way unknown on earth to spiritual influence do you remember i read you thought when we first meet and answer they before you speak that be one of the martian ' gift find that these wonderful faculty be better develop in the woman of mar than in the man i choose the feminine form for my reincarnation and iclea i say iclea say spero be re-born in a masculine shape it be partly because of the mystic attraction that i feel for she that i choose the other form neither of we remember we earthly existence but a vague yet deep sentiment of we spiritual relationship make I seek she out and unite myself to she it be you beloved muse uriana he add who reveal the tie that bind we in we former life owe to they superior faculty the martian have carry every science to a perfection undreamt of on this earth in astronomical observation for instance they employ a system of telephotography for thousand of year they instrument have be photograph on a unending roll of paper the wild spectacle of terrestrial life one day as iclea and i be examine recent photograph we see a picture of pari during the great exhibition seize a microscope we look at the figure and recognize ourselves among they strange memory stir within we and we stare at each other in silent amazement suddenly i remember the sacred word i learn at my mother 's knee yes there be many mansion in we father 's house the blood-stained planet from which we have escape be neither the cradle nor the grave of he child then we weep as we think of the cruelty ignorance misery and grossness of existence on earth it be dear camille with no joy that i recollect the promise i have make to you but you see i have carry it out i wish to convince you and through you all the rest of mankind that the soul be immortal and that the earth be only a temporary stage of existence in a spiritual progress in which the whole universe be include but how be it possible for you george i interrupted to appear to I in the body you wear on earth all this say spero touch he body be a illusion do you not recollect my say that only invisible thing be real you do not see I with you eye or

of hypnotism at the present moment as i have say i be lie asleep on mar but my spirit be in direct communication with yours the form you see sit beside you on this parapet be only a illusion of you sens my soul be speak to you soul but could you not i say give I some description of life on mar a dream he reply would be more vivid than a mere description though it would only be a shadow of the reality for since you have not my dear friend we exquisite faculty of knowledge you mind could not clearly mirror we life hark iclea be awake and call I i can not stay any longer shut you eye and i will send you a dream i turn to say good-bye but spero have vanish a deep drowsiness fall upon I and just as i get off the parapet and find a safer position i fall asleep _ iv -- the eternal progress _ i be sit under a strange tree cover with gigantic red flower in the sky above I be two moon that shed a dim brightness on the lovely and fantastic scenery a multitude of radiant shape flutter and dart through the air they be martian -- exquisite aerial and divinely beautiful figure glowing with luminous tint airy gondola which seem to be fashion from phosphorescent flower pass above my head and one of they float down to the tree under which i be lie in it be iclea and george but etherealise beyond the reach of human imagination they take I in they fly chariot as day be break and we course with a strange silent interchange of thought over the orange-coloured land of mar i could not understand everything which be communicate to I now by iclea and now by george but i perceive that all manual labor on the planet be do by means of machine direct by animal whose intelligence be on a level with my own the martian themselves live only for the thing of the mind they have twelve sens instead of five and they body in which electricity play the part that blood do in we system be so finely and yet so strongly organise that they possess a extraordinary power over the force of nature everything on they world sea mountain and river be like they wonderful canal work of art and science nature be completely plastic in they hand there be no poverty and no crime derive they food from the air which they breathe the martian be liberate from material care and immerse in the joy of intellectual pursuit you now see camille say spero resort at last to language which i could clearly understand that life on mar have develop as peacefully and nobly as it begin there be no break between we vegetable kingdom and we animal kingdom we be nourish like you plant tree and herb by the air which we breathe ten million year ago you world be also a scene of innocence and tranquil felicity the land be overgrow with a wildly beautiful vegetation that feed on the gentle wind of heaven and primitive form of animal life have spread from the depths of the sea along the shallow shore and be there learn to extract from the air a nourishment similar to that which they obtain from the water but by a woeful chance one of you primitive animal -- a deaf blind sexless clot of jelly -- then have its body pierce by a drop of sea-water thicker than usual and it find that this way of feeding be quicker than simple respiration such be the origin of the first digestive tube which have exercise so baleful a influence on the course of terrestrial life and turn the earth into a vast slaughterhouse be there no hope for we i say no he reply the earth be a shipwrecked planet none of the higher organism there will ever rise to we level how can they alter the structure of they body and empty they vein of blood and fill they with the subtle electricity which serve we as a life force and the grossness of they blood-fed sens how can all the fine power of the immortal soul ever develop along with such degraded instrument of knowledge but even if we earth be a shipwrecked planet i exclaimed there be at least some means of escape from it you and iclea for instance -- yes there be a way of escape say spero the uranian way by soar aloft into the serene region of spiritual idea a terrestrial soul can still free itself from its animality some save themselves by they high moral quality other be purify and uplift by they imagination and intellect virtue and science be the wing that enable earth-born spirit to mount the sky the destiny of a soul be determine by its work and aspiration lover of knowledge sojourn awhile on mar which be only the first stage in the eternal progress spirit animated by divine feeling rise at once into high region of starry splendor the uranian way be open to all and the day will arrive when every inhabitant of you wild dark planet will recognize that he too be a citizen of heaven then uranium will at last inspire and direct he and point out the path by which he can ascend from the blood-stained earth to the fairer mansion prepare for he in the sky as he be speak we aerial chariot float down to a fairy palace by the shore of a enchanted sea i alight and a radiant flower-like maiden who be stand by the portal unfold she rainbow wing and shadow I with they and murmur do you wish to return to earth no i cry run up to clasp she in my arm i awake with a sudden shock i be lie on the top of the tower of montlhéry the sun be rise and the vast circle of country below I shine clear and distinct in the morning light be it a dream i say to myself surely not the earth be not the only home of life in the universe uranium the celestial muse be now unfold before we astonished eye the panorama of infinity and we know at last that we be not

the room in which the safe be situate communicate with the bank by another room in which every night a try servant of the establishment sleep by a second door admittance be obtain to the private apartment of m and madame fauvel and they niece madeline as soon as m fauvel have hear the startling news he first obtain the necessary money from the bank of france settle the business with the count and then turn he attention to the elucidation of the robbery he summon the cashier to he presence bertomy be a young man of thirty to whom m fauvel have show great kindness advance he interest wherever possible until though very young for the position he be he most important and most confidential employee besides the paternal affection with which the bank manager regard he cashier another tie tend to make they relation all the stronger and more personal bertomy love m fauvel 's niece madeline and though a curious estrangement have spring up between they during the previous nine or ten month the banker always regard they marriage as practically arrange the interview between the two man be a curious one to each it appear that the other must be the thief they alone have the key of the safe they alone know the magic word which could open the massive door the banker urge bertomy to confess promising he forgiveness the other haughtily reject the suggestion and hint that he employer have convert the # 12000 to he own use in the end m fauvel lose he temper send for the police and before twenty-four hour be up prosper bertomy who but the day before have hold one of the most important and envied position in the financial world of pari be charge before a magistrate as be a common thief investigation of the case be at first entrust to a detective name fanferlot nickname by he comrade the squirrel fanferlot 's examination of the premise result in little all he discover be a scratch upon the door of the safe but certain word that pass between m fauvel and he niece which seem to indicate that the former be secretly oppose to the marriage of madeline with bertomy cause he to jump to the conclusion that the banker have rob he own safe in order to bring disgrace upon he cashier he connive however at the arrest of bertomy hope that later on he might obtain great kudos for himself by unmask the banker what might have be the result of he improper and unofficial method will never be know but in all probability great inconvenience would have be cause to a number of innocent person and the whole course of justice thwart have it not be for the intervention of the great and famous m lecoq m lecoq 's interest in the bank robbery case be largely a personal one even detective have heart and m lecoq have love with heart and soul a charming young girl name nina gipsy under the name of caldas in one of he innumerable disguise he have woo she for many month when he think at last that he have win she affection she have flee to the protection of no less a person than prosper bertomy himself the cashier care nothing for she but embittered by a estrangement that have spring up between madeline and himself he have seek forgetfulness in she society bertomy 's arrest give lecoq a opportunity for a noble revenge he determine to prove to the woman he love he superiority over he rival by save the cashier from disgrace though the case look black against bertomy for it be show that he be heavily in debt and live far beyond he means lecoq be satisfy that he have not commit the crime when fanferlot hopelessly befogged call for he advice at he house in the rue montmartre the great detective deign to explain the preliminary datum and the deduction from the datum he have make the scratch on the safe door slight and minute as it be be he starting-point how have it be make he have find by experiment that it be impossible to make such a scratch upon the varnish without the exercise of considerable force it be clear therefore that the scratch by the keyhole could not have be make by the thief in he tremble anxiety to get the business he have undertake accomplished but why be such force use for a long time lecoq puzzle over this problem then with fanferlot he try a experiment in he room be a iron box varnish like the safe take the key of this box from he pocket he order fanferlot to seize he arm just as he put it near the lock the key slip pull away from the lock and slide along the surface of the door leave upon it a diagonal scratch almost a exact reproduction of the one on the safe from this simple experiment lecoq deduce that two people be present when the safe be rob one want to take the money the other want to prevent it be take this be the basis of the case which he set out to draw up against some person or person unknown he argue with he usual clear logic that neither fauvel nor bertomy could have rob the safe both of they have key both of they know the secret word and could have rob the safe whenever they please therefore neither of they would have commit the theft in the presence of somebody else _ ii -- a mysterious journey _ lecoq 's first step after establish these preliminary deduction be to secure the release of bertomy on the grounds of insufficient evidence on the very morning of he release bertomy have receive a mysterious letter compose of print word cut out letter by letter from a book and paste on paper my dear prosper so the epistle run a friend who know the horror of you situation send you this help there be one heart at least which feel for you leave france you be yourself the future be before you go and may this money be of use enclose with this note be banknote for # 400 lecoq disguise as a m verduret a country merchant a friend of bertomy 's father secure this epistle and study it carefully he knowledge of the various type use by the printer in pari show he that the letter have be take from a book print by a well-known firm who publish volume of devotion the correctness of this conclusion be establish by the discovery on the back of one of the small cutting the word deus the word have be cut from a catholic prayer-book to find that prayer-book be he next business in another disguise he seek out nina gipsy and by ask she assistance to clear prosper induce she to take up the position of lady 's - maid in the fauvel family for it be there he conceive the mutilate book of devotion would be find again he wonderful instinct prove right in a few day nina bring he the very book -- a prayer - book belong to madeline which have be give she by bertomy why have madeline send the cashier this elaborately disguise letter why have she wish he to leave france confident as she be so she tell he of he innocence to find a answer to these important query lecoq closely question bertomy he learn that the night before the robbery the cashier have dine with he friend raoul de lagor the wealthy dissolute young nephew of m fauvel 's wife this lagor be the friend of count loui de clameran whose demand for the # 12000 leave he by he dead brother have result in the discovery of the mysterious robbery bertomy have nothing but the highest praise for lagor but on the other hand speak most disparagingly of the count the count it appear have propose for the hand of madeline and have press he suit with great determination and madeline -- and this be what provide a new problem for lecoq 's consideration -- have tacitly accept he attention through nina lecoq have arrange a meeting between bertomy and madeline and satisfied himself that the girl be whole-heartedly and devotedly attach to she uncle 's cashier then why be she favor the suit of the count lecoq at once make it he business to inquire into the count 's past he be the second son of a old and noble family he elder brother gaston have to fly the country in consequence of cause the death of several man he have inherit the property a life of dissolute pleasure have soon exhaust he patrimony and he be reduce to live by he wit some week before the robbery he have discover that he brother gaston be alive and be live on a large estate in the south of france which he have purchase with the wealth he have accumulate in business six week after the two brother meet again the elder die and the younger inherit he vast fortune raoul de lagor be the next character in the drama whose past the detective make it he business to expose lagor it have be say be the nephew of madame fauvel to he surprise lecoq discover by inquiry in she native place that the banker 's wife have never have any brother or sister lagor therefore be not she nephew fanferlot act on instruction have keep a strict watch on the movement of madeline and by this mean lecoq receive timely warning of a mysterious excursion which the girl make one night he follow she to a lonely house on the outskirts of the city when she have gain admittance the appearance of a light in one of the window on the first floor seem to indicate the room to which she have be take by the aid of a ladder lecoq be able to watch what be go on within through the shutter he see madeline standing opposite lagor evidently from she attitude plead with he for some time he listen to she with a cynical smile upon he face but after a hour he seem to decide with evident reluctance to comply with she request go to a cabinet he take out a bundle of pawn ticket and fling they on the table hastily go through the collection she select three and conceal they in she dress leave the house by follow she to a pawnshop lecoq discover that she have redeem certain valuable article of jewelry belong to madame fauvel lecoq know through nina gipsy who still fill the part of lady 's - maid in the fauvel family that m fauvel have insist on he wife accompany he on the follow evening to a great fancy-dress ball which be to be give by one of the wealthiest family in the capital obviously then the jewelry that madeline have redeem be require by madame fauvel for the occasion why have she pawn it for lagor a theory have half form itself in lecoq 's brain he determine to prove its truth disguise as a clown he attend the fancy-dress ball and in the character of a mountebank collect a group of lady and gentleman around he while he relate with the inimitable skill of a buffoon a romantic narrative to most of the people present it be simply a amusing story but to the count and lagor and madame fauvel who be among the listener it seem something much more for lecoq dress out he theory of the robbery in the trappings of romance just as he reach the climax of the story there be a cry and madame fauvel almost fall faint on the floor the count and lagor rush up furiously to lecoq master clown say lagor you tongue be too long perhaps my pretty boy retort lecoq perhaps it be but it be i can assure you not so long as my arm who be you m le clown the count exclaim angrily i be reply lecoq the best friend you brother gaston have i be he counsellor i be the confidant of he last wish though the solution of the problem seem so tantalisingly near there be still some thread in the tangle which require sort out before lecoq could say that the case be complete among other matter he inquire of bertomy the word which have be use to lock the safe on the night of the robbery the word have be gipsy bertomy be confident that he have not mention it to anybody but nina gipsy be able to throw light on this part of the problem she recollect a chance remark of bertomy 's while sit at dinner with herself and lagor on the night of the robbery she have reproach bertomy with neglect she it be too bad for you to reproach I cry the cashier for it be you name which at this very moment guard the safe of m fauvel lagor therefore have know the password what do this new discovery imply how do it fit in with the rest of the datum which lecoq have so brilliantly collect after he custom he marshal once more in he mind

together under the title of cranford meeting with wide approval and have long take rank as one of the accept english classic the town which figure here as cranford be understand to have be knutsford in cheshire which still retain something of that old-world feeling and restfulness which mr gaskell embody in the page of she most engaging book cranford be probably the direct progenitor of many latter-day book of the class to which the word idyll have be somewhat loosely apply its charm and freshness be unfade it remain unique and unrivalled as a sympathetic and kindly humorous description of english provincial life mr gaskell die in November 1865 _ i -- we society _ on the first visit i pay to cranford after i have leave it as a residence i be astonish to find a man have settle there -- a captain brown in my time cranford be in possession of the amazon if a married couple come to settle there somehow the man always disappear either he be fairly frightened to death by be the only man at the evening party or he be account for by be with he regiment he ship or closely connect in business all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of drumble distant only twenty mile on the railroad i be naturally interested to learn what opinion captain brown have manage to win for himself in cranford so with all the delicacy which the subject demand i make inquiry of my hostess miss jenkyn i be surprise to learn that captain brown not only be respect but have even gain a extraordinary place of authority among the cranford lady of course he have be force to overcome great difficulty in the first place the lady of cranford have moan over the invasion of they territory by a man and a gentleman then captain brown have start badly very badly by openly refer to he poverty if he have whisper it to a intimate friend the door and window be previously close he vulgarity -- a tremendous word in cranford -- might have be forgive but he have publish he poverty in the public street in a loud military voice allege it as a reason for not take a particular house in cranford too where it be tacitly agree to ignore that anyone with whom we associate on term of equality could ever be prevent by poverty from do anything they wish where if we walk to and from a party it be because the night be _ so _ fine or the air _ so _ refresh not because sedan-chair be so expensive so the poor captain have be send to coventry the lady of cranford have freeze he out until the day when the cow a alderney cow have break the ice it happen like this miss betsy barker have a alderney cow which she look upon as a daughter you could not pay the regulation short quarter of a hour 's call -- to stay longer be a breach of manners -- without be tell of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of this animal the whole town know and kindly regard miss betsy barker 's alderney one day the cow fall into a lime-pit and cranford grieve over the spectacle of the poor beast be draw out have lose most of she hair and look naked cold and miserable in a bare skin miss betsy barker absolutely cry with sorrow and dismay and be about to prepare a bath of oil for the sufferer when captain brown call out : get she a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawer ma'am if you wish to keep she alive but my advice be ` kill the poor creature at once ' miss betsy barker dry she eye and in a few hour the whole town turn out to see the alderney meekly go to she pasture clothe in dark-gray flannel do you ever see cow dress in gray flannel in london on that day be bear the respect of the cranford lady for captain brown soon after my arrival in cranford miss jenkyn give a party in my honor and recall the old day when we have almost persuade ourselves that to be a man be to be vulgar i be curious to see what the lady would do with captain brown the preparation be much as usual card-table with green baize top be set out by daylight and towards four when the evening close in we all stand dress in we best each with a candle-lighter in we hand ready to dart at the candle as soon as the first knock come the china be delicate egg-shell the old-fashioned silver glitter with polish but the eatables be of the slightest description while the tray be yet on the table captain brown arrive with he two daughter miss brown and miss jessie the former with a sickly pained and careworn expression the latter with a pretty round dimpled face and the look of a child which will remain with she should she live to be a hundred i could see that the captain be a favorite with all the lady present ruffle brow be smooth and sharp voice hush at he approach he immediately and quietly assume the man 's place in the room attend to everyone 's want lessen the pretty maidservant 's labor by wait on empty cup and bread-and-butterless lady and yet do it all in so easy and dignified a manner and so much as if it be a matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak that he be a true man throughout the party pass off very well in spite of one or two little hitch one be miss jessie brown 's unguarded admission -- _ à propo _ of shetland wool -- that she have a uncle she mother 's brother who be a shopkeeper in edinburgh miss jenkyn try to drown this confession by a terrible cough for the honorable mr jamieson be sit at the card-table nearest miss jessie and what would she say or think if she find out she be in the same room with a shopkeeper 's niece then there be a slight breeze between miss jenkyn and captain brown over the relative merit of dr johnson and the author of pickwick papers -- then be publish in part -- as writer of light and agreeable fiction captain brown read a account of the swarry which sam weller give at bath some of we laugh very heartily _ i _ do not dare because i be stay in the house at the conclusion miss jenkyn say to I with mild dignity fetch I ` rassela ' my dear out of the book-room after deliver one of the conversation between rassela and imlac in a majestic high-pitched voice miss jenkyn say i imagine i be now justified in my preference for dr johnson over you mr boz as a writer of fiction the captain say nothing merely screw he lip up and drum on the table but when miss jenkyn return later to the charge and recommend the doctor 's style to captain brown 's favorite the captain reply i should be very sorry for he to exchange he style for any such pompous writing miss jenkyn feel this as a personal affront in a way of which the captain have not dream how could he know that she and she friend look upon epistolary writing as they forte and that when in a letter they seize the half-hour just previous to post-time to assure they friend of this and that they be use the doctor as a model as it be miss jenkyn refuse to be mollify by captain brown 's effort later to beguile she into conversation on some more pleasing subject she be inexorable captain brown endeavor to make peace after this memorable dispute by a present to miss jenkyn of a wooden fire-shovel -lrb- he own making -rrb- have hear she say how much the grate of a iron one annoy she she receive the present with cool gratitude and thank he formally when he be go she bid I put it in the lumber-room feeling probably that no present from a man who prefer mr boz to dr johnson could be less jarring than a iron fire-shovel such be the state of affair at the time when i leave cranford and go to drumble i have however several correspondent who keep I _ au fait _ as to the proceedings of the inhabitant of the dear little town _ ii -- the captain _ my next visit to cranford be in the summer there have be neither birth death nor marriage since i be there last everybody live in the same house and wear pretty near the same well-preserved old-fashioned clothes the greatest event be that the miss jenkyn have purchase a new carpet for the drawing-room oh the busy work miss matty and i have in chase the sunbeam as they fall in a afternoon right down on this carpet through the blindless window we spread we newspaper over the place and sit down to we book or we work and lo in a quarter of a hour the sun have move and be blaze away in a fresh spot and down again we go on we knee to alter the position of the newspaper one whole morning too we spend in cut out and stitch together piece of newspaper so as to form little path to every chair lest the shoe of visitor should defile the purity of the carpet do you make paper path for every guest to walk upon in london the literary dispute between captain brown and miss jenkyn continue she have form a habit of talk _ at _ he and he retaliate by drum he finger which action miss jenkyn feel and resent as disparage to dr johnson the poor captain i notice on this visit that he look older and more worn and he clothes be very threadbare but he seem as bright and cheerful as ever unless he be ask about he daughter 's health one afternoon we perceive little group in the street all listen with face aghast to some tale or other it be some time before miss jenkyn take the undignified step of send jenny out to inquire jenny come back with a white face of terror oh ma'am oh miss jenkyn ma'am captain brown be kill by they nasty cruel railroad and she burst into tear how where -- where good god jenny do not waste time in cry but tell we something miss matty rush out into the street and presently a

strange look on she face i have be much startle -- no i have not be startle -- do not mind I my dear miss jessie only surprise -- in fact i have have a caller whom you once know my dear miss jessie miss jessie go very white then flush scarlet be it -- it be not -- stammer out miss jessie and get no farther this be he card say miss jenkyn and go through a series of wink and odd face at I and form

my new hostess at first i rather dread the change aspect of thing miss matty too begin to cry as soon as she see I she be evidently nervous from have anticipate my visit i comfort she as well as i could and i find the best consolation i could give be the honest praise that come from my heart as i speak of the deceased miss matty make I she confidante in many matter and one evening she send martha to go for egg at a farm at the other end of the town and tell I the story of she brother poor peter the sole honor he bring from shrewsbury be the reputation of be captain of the school in the art of practical joking he even think that the people of cranford might be hoax ` hoax ' be not a pretty word my dear and i hope you will not tell you father i use it for i should not like he to think i be not choice in my language after live with such a woman as deborah i do not know how it slip out of my mouth except it be that i be think of poor peter and it be always he expression one day my father have go to see some sick people in the village deborah too be away from home for a fortnight or so i do not know what possess poor peter but he go to she room and dress himself in she old gown and shawl and bonnet and he make the pillow into a little -- you be sure you lock the door my dear -- into -- into a little baby with white long clothes and he go and walk up and down in the filbert walk -- just half hide by the rail and half see and he cuddle the pillow just like a baby and talk to it all the nonsense people do oh dear and my father come step stately up the street as he always do and push past the crowd saw -- i do not know what he see -- but old clare say he face go grey-white with anger he seize hold of poor peter tear the clothes off he back -- bonnet shawl gown and all

father for life old clare say peter look as white as my father and stand still as a statue to be flog ` have you do enough sir ' he ask hoarsely when my father stop then peter bow grandly to the people outside the railing and walk slowly home he go straight to he mother look as haughty as any man and not like a boy ` mother ' he say ' i be come to say god bless you for ever ' he would say no more and by the time my mother have find out what have happen from my father and have go to she boy 's room to comfort he he have go and do not come back that spring day be the last time he ever see he mother 's face he write a passionate entreaty to she to come and see he before he ship leave the mersey for the war but the letter be delay and when she arrive it be too late it kill my mother and think my dear the day after she death -- for she do not live a twelve-month after peter leave -- come a parcel from indium from she poor boy it be a large soft white indium shawl just what my mother would have like we take it to my father in the hope it would rouse he for he have sit with she hand in he all night long at first he take no notice of it then suddenly he get up and speak ` she shall be bury in it ' he say ` peter shall have that comfort and she would have like it ' do mr peter ever come home yes once he come home a lieutenant and he and my father be such friend my father be so proud to show he to all the neighbor he never walk out without peter 's arm to lean on and then peter go to sea again and by-and-by my father die blessing we both and thank deborah for all she have be to he and we circumstance be change and from a big rectory with three servant we have come down to a small house with a servant-of-all-work but as deborah use to say we have always live genteelly even if circumstance have compel we to simplicity poor deborah and mr peter i ask oh there be some great war in indium and we have never hear of peter since then i believe he be dead myself sometimes when i sit by myself and the house be quiet i think i hear he step come up the street and my heart begin to flutter and beat but the sound go and peter never come back _ iv -- friend in need _ the year roll on i spend my time between drumble and cranford i be thankful that i happen to be stay with miss matty when the town and county bank fail which have such a disastrous effect on she little fortune it be a example to I and i fancy it might be to many other to see how immediately miss matty set about the retrenchment she know to be right under she altered circumstance i do the little i could some month back a conjuror have give a performance in the cranford assembly room by a strange set of circumstance the identity of signor brunonus be reveal he be plain samuel brown who have fall out of he cart and have to be attend by we doctor i go to visit the patient and he wife and learn that she have be india she tell I a long story about be befriend after a perilous journey by a kind englishman who live right in the midst of the native it be he name which astonish I agra jenkyns could agra jenkyn be the long lose peter i resolve to say nothing to miss matty but get the address from the signor -lrb- as we still call he from habit -rrb- spell by sound and very queer it look and post a letter to he all sort of plan be discuss for miss matty 's future i thought of all the thing by which a woman past middle age and with the education common to lady fifty year ago could earn or add to a living without materially lose caste but at length i put even this last clause on one side and wonder what in the world miss matty could do even teach be out of the question for reckoning over she accomplishment i have to come down to read write and arithmetic -- and in read the chapter every morning she always cough before come to long word i be still in a quandary the next morning when i receive a letter from miss pole so mysteriously wrap up and with so many seal on it to secure secrecy that i have to tear the paper before i could unfold it it summon I to go to miss pole at 11 be the be twice dash under as if i be likely to come at eleven at night when all cranford be usually abed and asleep by ten i go and find miss pole dress in solemn array though there be only mrs forrester cry quietly and sadly and mrs fitzadam present miss pole be arm with a card on which i imagine she have write some note miss smith she begin when i enter -lrb- i be familiarly know to all cranford as mary but this be a state occasion -rrb- i have converse in private with these lady on the misfortune which have happen to we friend and one and all have agree that while we have a superfluity it be not only a duty but a pleasure -- a true pleasure mary -- she voice be rather choke just here and she have to wipe she spectacles before she could go on -- to give what we can to assist she -- miss matilda jenkyn only in consideration of the feeling of delicate independence exist in the mind of every refine female -- i be sure she have get back to the card -- we wish to contribute we mite in a secret and conceal manner so as not to hurt the feeling i have refer to well the upshot of this solemn meeting be that each of those dear old lady write down the sum she could afford annually sign the paper and seal it mysteriously and i be commission to get my father to administer the fund in such a manner that miss jenkyn should imagine the money come from she own improved investment as i be go mr forrester take I aside and in the manner of one confess a great crime the poor old lady tell I how very very little she have to live on -- a confession she be bring to make from a dread lest we should think that the small contribution name in she paper bear any proportion to she love and regard for miss mary and yet that sum which she so eagerly relinquish be in truth more than a twentieth part of what she have to live on and when the whole income do not nearly amount to a hundred pound to give up a twentieth of it will necessitate many careful economy and many piece of self-denial -- small and insignificant in the world 's account but bear a different value in another account book that i have hear of the upshot of it all be that dear miss matty be comfortably install in she own house and add to she slender income by sell tea this last be my idea and it be a proud moment for I when it realize the small dining-room be convert into a shop without any of its degrading characteristic a table form the counter one window be retain unaltered and the other change into a glass door and there she be tea be certainly a happy commodity as it be neither greasy nor sticky grease and stickiness be two of the quality which miss matty could not endure moreover as miss matty say one good thing about it be that man do not buy it and it be of man particularly she be afraid they have such sharp loud way with they and do up account and count they change so quickly very little remain to be tell the approval of the honorable mr jamieson set the seal upon the successful career of miss matty as a purveyor of tea thus do she escape even the shadow of vulgarity one afternoon i be sit in the shop parlor with miss matty when we see a gentleman go slowly past the window and then stand opposite to the door as if look out for the name which we have so carefully hide he clothes have a out-of-the-way foreign cut and it flash across I it be the agra himself he enter miss matty look at he and something of tender relaxation in he face strike home to she heart she say : it be -- oh sir can you be peter and tremble from head to foot in a moment he have she in he arm sob the tearless cry of old age \* \* \* \* \* mary barton mary barton although not mr gaskell 's first attempt at authorship be she first literary success and although she later writings reveal a gain in skill subtlety and humor none of they equal mary barton in dramatic intensity and fervent sincerity this passionate tale of the sorrow of the manchester poor give to the world anonymously in the year 1848 be greet with a storm of mingled approval and disapproval it be praise by carlyle and landor but some critic attack it fiercely as a slander on the manchester manufacturer and there be admirer who complain that it be too heartrending the controversy have long since die down but the book hold a permanent place in literature as a vivid revelation of a dark and painful phase of english life in the middle of the last century _ i -- rich and poor _ mary say john barton to he daughter what be

April 7 1836 _ i -- mr falkland 's secret _ my life have for several year be a theater of calamity my fairest prospects have be blast my enemy have show himself inaccessible to entreaty and untired in persecution i be bear of humble parent in a remote county of england they occupation be such as usually fall to the lot of peasant and they have no portion to give I i be teach the rudiment of no science except read writing and arithmetic but i have a inquisitive mind and neglect no means of information from conversation or book the residence of my parent be within the manor of ferdinando falkland a country squire of considerable opulence at a early age i attract the favourable notice of mr collin this gentleman 's steward who use to call in occasionally at my father 's in the summer of the year -- mr falkland visit he estate in we county after a absence of several month this be a period of misfortune to I i be then eighteen year of age my father lay dead in we cottage and i have lose my mother some year before in this forlorn situation i receive a message from the squire order I to repair to the manor house my reception be as gracious and encouraging as i could possibly desire mr falkland question I respect my learning and my conception of man and thing and listen to my answer with condescension and approbation he then inform I that he be in want of a secretary and that if i approve of the employment he would take I into he house i feel highly flatter by the proposal and find my employment -- which include the duty of librarian as well as those of a secretary -- easy and agreeable mr falkland 's mode of living be in the utmost degree recluse and solitary he feature be scarcely ever relax in a smile and the distemper which afflict he with incessant gloom have its paroxysm none of the domestic except myself and mr collin approach mr falkland but at stated season and then only for a very short interval once after i have see my patron in a strange fit of intolerable anguish i could not help confide in mr collin that i fear mr falkland have some secret trouble and in answer to my communication mr collin tell I the story of tyrrel 's murder barnaba tyrrel have be a neighbouring squire insupportably brutish and arrogant tyrannical to he inferior and insolent to he equal from the first he hate falkland whose dignity and courtesy be a constant rebuke to the other 's boorish ill-humours and reject with scorn all proposal for civil intercourse the crisis come when tyrrel who have be expel from the rural assembly which meet every week at the market-town force he way in he be intoxicate and at once attack falkland knock he down and then kick he prostrate enemy before anyone have time to interfere to mr falkland disgrace be worse than death this complication of ignominy base humiliating and public sting he to the very soul and fill he mind with horror and uproar one other event close that memorable evening mr tyrrel be find dead in the street have be murder a few yard from the assembly-house from that day falkland be a changed man he cheerfulness and tranquillity give way to gloomy and unsociable melancholy and fill with the idea of chivalry the humiliating and dishonourable situation in which he have be place could never be forget to add to he misfortune it be presently whisper that he be no other than the murderer of he antagonist and even the magistrate at length decide that the matter must be investigate and request falkland to appear before they mr falkland attend and easily convince the magistrate of he innocence point out that he one desire be to have call out the man who have insult he so horribly and to have fight he to the death he be not only acquit but a public demonstration of sympathy be arrange at once to show the esteem in which he be hold a few week and the real murderer be discover this be a man name hawkin who with he son have be reduce from a honest livelihood to beggary and ruin by tyrrel on circumstantial evidence hawkin and he son be condemn and execute this be the story mr collin tell I in order that i might understand mr falkland 's unhappy state in reality it only add to my embarrassment be it possible after all that mr falkland should be the murderer it be but a pass thought and yet what be the meaning of mr falkland 's agony of mind i could not accept mr collin 's view that mr falkland be so much the slave and fool of honor that the shame of tyrrel 's savage assault alone have drive he to this melancholy and solitude and compel the violent outburst of passion _ ii -- i learn the secret _ my suspicion would not be set at rest no spark of malignity be harbour in my soul i reverenced the sublime mind of mr falkland but i have a mistaken curiosity to find out the truth of tyrrel 's murder often it seem that mr falkland be about to speak to I but the movement always end in silence at last one day he send for I to he room and after make I swear never to disclose he confidence and warn I that he have observe my suspicion tell I that he be the murderer of tyrrel and the assassin of the two hawkin this it be to be a gentleman a man of honor falkland go on in extreme distress my virtue my honesty my everlasting peace of mind all sacrifice that i may preserve my good name and i be as much the fool of fame as ever though i be the blackest of villain i will leave behind I a spotless and illustrious name why be it that i be compel to this confidence from the love of fame i have no alternative but to make you my confidant or my victim and perhaps my next murder would not have be so fortunate i do not want to shed more blood it be better to trust you with the whole truth under every seal of secrecy than to live in perpetual fear of you penetration but look what you have do with you foolishly inquisitive humor you shall continue in my service and i will benefit you in respect of fortune but i shall always hate you if ever a unguarded word escape from you lip you may expect to pay for it with you death or worse by everything that be sacred preserve you faith such be the secret i have be so desirous to know it be a wretched prospect i say to myself that he hold up to I but i will never become a informer i will never injure my patron and therefore he will not be my enemy it be no long time after this that mr forester -- mr falkland 's half-brother -- come to stay in the house while he own residence be be get ready for he and there be little in common between the two mr forester be of a peculiarly sociable disposition we visitor choose to make I he companion no sooner be this grow intimacy observe than mr falkland warn I that it be not agreeable to he and that he would not have it young man take warn he say to I one day when we be alone you little suspect the extent of my power you might as well think of escape from the power of the omnipresent god as from mine my whole soul now revolt against the treatment i endure and yet i could not utter a word i resolve to quit mr falkland 's service and when mr forester have retire to he own house i write a letter to mr falkland to that effect you shall never quit it with you life be he reply if you attempt it you shall never cease to rue you folly as long as you exist do not imagine i be afraid of you i wear a armor against which all you weapon be impotent do you not know miserable wretch that i have swear to preserve my reputation whatever it cost i have dig a pit for you and whichever way you move it be ready to swallow you this speech be the dictate of frenzy and it create in I a similar frenzy it determine I to do the very thing against which i be thus solemnly warn and fly from my patron 's house no sooner however have i set off and travel some mile than a horseman overtake I and hand I a letter from mr forester i open the letter and read as follow : william : -- my brother falkland have send the bearer in pursuit of you he expect that if find you will return with he i expect it too if you be a villain and a rascal you will perhaps endeavor to fly if you conscience tell you you be innocent you will out of all doubt come back if you come i pledge myself that if you clear you reputation you shall not only be free to go wherever you please but shall receive every assistance in my power to give valentine forester to a mind like mine such a letter be enough to draw I from one end of the earth to the other i could not recall anything out of which the shadow of a criminal accusation could be extort and i return with willingness and impatience i know the stern inflexibility of mr falkland 's mind but i also know he virtuous and magnanimous principle i could not believe my innocence could be confound with guilt _ iii -- my persecution and suffering _ mr falkland accuse I of have steal money and jewel from he and when my box which i have leave behind be open a watch and certain jewel be find in one of they my amazement yield to indignation and horror i protest my innocence i declare that mr falkland know i be innocent and that while i be wholly unable to account for the article find in my possession i firmly believe that they be there be of mr falkland 's contrivance mr falkland now express he willingness to proceed no further against I and since i have be bring to public shame to let I depart wherever i pleased i be unworthy of he resentment he say and he could afford to smile at my malice mr forester however say this be impossible and as a magistrate he thereupon commit I to prison to await my trial not one of the servant who have be present at my examination express any compassion for I the robbery appear to they atrocious and they be indignant at my recrimination on they excellent master when i have be about a month in prison the assizes be hold but my case be not bring forward and i be suffer to stand over six month longer i notice a change in my jailer 's behavior at this time he offer to make better provision for my comfort and as i have no doubt he be instigate by mr falkland i answer that he might tell he employer i would accept no favor from a man that hold a halter about my neck then the idea of a escape occur to I and as i have some proficiency in carpentry i decide to obtain tool by propose to make some chair for the jailer my offer be accept and i gradually accumulate tool of various sort -- gimlet chisel etc in the middle of the night my plan be now thoroughly digest i set about make my escape i have to get the first door from its hinge and though this be attend with considerable difficulty i be successful the second door be fasten on the inside all i have to do be to push back the bolt and unscrew the box of the lock thus far i have proceed with the happiest success but close on the other side there be a kennel with a large mastiff dog of which i have not the smallest previous knowledge however i manage to soothe the animal and go to the wall before i have gain half the ascent a voice at the garden door cry out halloa who be there at this the dog begin to bark violently and a second man come out alarm at my situation i descend on the other side too quickly and in my fall nearly dislocate my ankle in the meantime the two warder come through a door in the wall of which i have not be aware and be at the place where i have descend in no time the pain in my ankle be so intense that i could scarcely stand and i suffer myself to be retake the condition in which i be now place be totally different from that which have precede this attempt i be chained all day in my dungeon my manual labor be at a end my cell be search every night and every kind of tool carefully keep from I nevertheless a active mind which have once be force into any particular train can scarcely give it up as hopeless one day i chance to observe a nail trodden into the mud floor at no great distance from I i seize upon this new treasure and find that i could unlock with it the padlock that fasten I to the staple in the floor by this mean i have the pitiful consolation of be able to range without constraint the miserable coop in which i be confine it become my constant practice to liberate myself at night but security breed negligence one morning i overslept myself and the turnkey to he surprise find I disengage again my apartment be change i be now put in the strong-room a underground dungeon and handcuffs be add to my fetter it be at this time that thoma mr falkland 's footman and a old acquaintance of mine visit I he be of the better order of servant and my condition shock he he return again in the afternoon well master william he say you have be very wicked to be sure and i think it would have do I good to see you hang i know i be do wrong but if they hang I too i can not help it for christ 's sake get out of this place i can not bear the thought of it with that he slip into my hand a chisel a file and a saw i receive the implement with great joy and thrust they into my bosom i wait for bright moonlight it be necessary that i should work in the night and between nine and seven it be ten o'clock when i first take off my handcuffs i then file through my fetter and next perform the same service to the three iron bar that secure my window all this be the work of more than two hour but even with the bar remove the space be by no means wide enough to admit the passing of my body therefore i have to loosen the brickwork and this i do partly with the chisel and partly with one of the iron bar when the space be sufficient for my purpose i creep through the opening and step upon a shed outside the prison wall which now have to be scale be of considerable height and there be no resource for I but that of make a breach in its lower part for six hour i work at this with incredible labor and at last i have make a passage but the day be break and in ten minute ' time the keeper would probably enter my apartment and see the devastation i have leave i decide to avoid the town as much as possible and depend upon the open country for protection and so i pass along the lane beyond the wall i be free of my prison but i be destitute and have not a shilling in the world _ iv -- the doom of falkland _ mr falkland 's implacable animosity pursue I beyond the prison a hundred guinea be at once offer for my recapture and though i evade arrest for some month a man name gine who have at one time be a member of a gang of robber undertake to lay hold of I and track I to my place of hide in london by this

incredible manner and how i have travel the kingdom in disguise and be now lie conceal in london with a hundred guinea reward for my discovery it seem then that there be no end to my persecution and i think of death as my only release that very night the landlord of my humble lodgings bring gine to the house and give I up to the authority and now the result of all my labor to get out of prison and evade my pursuer have bring I back to my starting-place never be a human creature so hunt by enemy what hope be there they would ever cease they persecution my long-cherished reverence for mr falkland be change to something like abhorrence i determine to bring the real criminal to justice accordingly when i be take before the magistrate at bow street i declare that mr falkland be a murderer and that i be entirely innocent but the magistrate simply tell I they have nothing to do with such statement and that i seem a most impudent rascal to trump up such thing against my master i be conduct back to the very prison from which i have escape and my situation seem more irremediable than ever how great therefore be my astonishment at the assizes when my case be call to find neither mr falkland nor mr forester nor any individual to appear against I i who have come to the bar with the sentence of death already ring in my ear to be tell i be free to go whithersoever i pleased i be not however yet free of mr falkland i be kidnap by gine and a accomplice and carry to a inn and here mr falkland command I to sign a paper declare that the charge i have allege against he at bow street be false malicious and groundless on my refusal he tell I that he would exercise a power that should grind I to atom the impression of that memorable meeting on my understanding be indelible the deathlike weakness and decay of mr falkland he misery and rage he haggard emaciate and fleshless visage be still before I there be to be no peace or happiness for I wherever i go sooner or later gine find I and any new acquaintance turn from I with loathing after they have read the handbill contain my wonderful and surprising history this man follow I from place to place blast my reputation i now form my resolution and carry it into execution at all cost i would free myself from this overpowering tyranny i set out for the chief town of the county in which mr falkland live and there lay a formal charge of murder before the principal magistrate after a interval of three day i meet mr falkland in the presence of the magistrate it be now the appearance of a ghost before I he be bring in in a chair unable to stand fatigued and almost destroy by the journey he have just take until that moment my breast be steel to pity it be now too late to draw back i tell my story plainly declare the nobility of mr falkland 's character and admit that my own proceedings now seem to I a dreadful mistake when i have finish mr falkland rise from he seat and to my infinite astonishment throw himself into my arm william say he you have conquer all that i most ardently desire be for ever frustrated i have spend a life of the basest cruelty to cover one act of momentary passion and now -- turn to
