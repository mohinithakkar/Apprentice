may within the bound of californium mountain be ever in sight charming and glorifying every landscape yet so simple and massive be the topography of the state in general view that the main central portion display only one valley and two chain of mountain which seem almost perfectly regular in trend and height : the coast range on the west side the sierra nevada on the east these two range come together in curve on the north and south inclose a magnificent basin with a level floor more than 400 mile long and from 35 to 60 mile wide this be the grand central valley of californium the water of which have only one outlet to the sea through the golden gate but with this general simplicity of feature there be great complexity of hidden detail the coast range rise as a grand green barrier against the ocean from 2000 to 8000 foot high be compose of innumerable forest-crowned spur ridge and roll hill-wave which inclose a multitude of smaller valley some look out through long forest-lined vista to the sea other with but few tree to the central valley while a thousand other yet smaller be embosome and conceal in mild round-browed hill each with its own climate soil and production make you way through the maze of the coast range to the summit of any of the inner peak or pass opposite san francisco in the clear springtime the grandest and most tell of all californium landscape be outspread before you at you foot lie the great central valley glowing golden in the sunshine extend north and south farther than the eye can reach one smooth flowery lake-like bed of fertile soil along its eastern margin rise the mighty sierra mile in height repose like a smooth cumulous cloud in the sunny sky and so gloriously color and so luminous it seem to be not clothe with light but wholly compose of it like the wall of some celestial city along the top and extend a good way down you see a pale pearl-gray belt of snow and below it a belt of blue and dark purple mark the extension of the forest and along the base of the range a broad belt of rose-purple and yellow where lie the minor 's gold-field and the foot-hill garden all these color belt blend smoothly make a wall of light ineffably fine and as beautiful as a rainbow yet firm as adamant when i first enjoy this superb view one glowing April day from the summit of the pacheco pass the central valley but little trampled or plow as yet be one furred rich sheet of golden composita and the luminous wall of the mountain shine in all its glory then it seem to I the sierra should be call not the nevada or snowy range but the range of light and after ten year spend in the heart of it rejoice and wonder bathing in its glorious flood of light see the sunburst of morning among the icy peak the noonday radiance on the tree and rock and snow the flush of the alpenglow and a thousand dash waterfall with they marvelous abundance of irised spray it still seem to I above all other the range of light the most divinely beautiful of all the mountain-chain i have ever see the sierra be about 500 mile long 70 mile wide and from 7000 to nearly 15000 foot high in general view no mark of man be visible on it nor anything to suggest the richness of the life it cherish or the depth and grandeur of its sculpture none of its magnificent forest-crowned ridge rise much above the general level to publish its wealth no great valley or lake be see or river or group of well-marked feature of any kind stand out in distinct picture even the summit-peak so clear and high in the sky seem comparatively smooth and featureless nevertheless glacier be still at work in the shadow of the peak and thousand of lake and meadow shine and bloom beneath they and the whole range be furrow with cañons to a depth of from 2000 to 5000 foot in which once flow majestic glacier and in which now flow and sing a band of beautiful river though of such stupendous depth these famous cañons be not raw gloomy jagged-walled gorge savage and inaccessible with rough passage here and there they still make delightful pathway for the mountaineer conduct from the fertile lowland to the highest icy fountain as a kind of mountain street full of charming life and light grade and sculpture by the ancient glacier and present throughout all they course a rich variety of novel and attractive scenery the most attractive that have yet be discover in the mountain-range of the world in many place especially in the middle region of the western flank of the range the main cañons widen into spacious valley or park diversify like artificial landscape-garden with charming grove and meadow and thicket of bloom bush while the lofty retire wall infinitely vary in form and sculpture be fringe with fern flowering-plant of many species oak and evergreen which find anchorage on a thousand narrow step and bench while the whole be enliven and make glorious with rejoice stream that come dancing and foam over the sunny brow of the cliff to join the shine river that flow in tranquil beauty down the middle of each one of they the wall of these park valley of the yosemite kind be make up of rock mountain in size partly separate from each other by narrow gorge and side-cañons and they be so sheer in front and so compactly build together on a level floor that comprehensively see the park they inclose look like immense hall or temple light from above every rock seem to glow with life some lean back in majestic repose other absolutely sheer or nearly so for thousand of foot advance they brow in thoughtful attitude beyond they companion give welcome to storm and calm alike seemingly conscious yet heedless of everything go on about they awful in stern majesty type of permanence yet associate with beauty of the frailest and most fleeting form they foot set in pine-grove and gay emerald meadow they brow in the sky bath in light bath in flood of singing water while snow-clouds avalanche and the wind shine and surge and wreathe about they as the year go by as if into these mountain mansion nature have take pain to gather she choicest treasure to draw she lover into close and confide communion with she -lrb- illustration : mount tamalpai -- north of the golden gate -rrb- here too in the middle region of deepest cañons be the grandest forest-tree the sequoia king of conifer the noble sugar and yellow pine dougla spruce libocedrus and the silver fir each a giant of its kind assemble together in one and the same forest surpass all other coniferous forest in the world both in the number of its species and in the size and beauty of its tree the wind flow in melody through they colossal spire and they be vocal everywhere with the song of bird and run water mile of fragrant ceanothus and manzanita bush bloom beneath they and lily garden and meadow and damp ferny glen in endless variety of fragrance and color compelling the admiration of every observer sweep on over ridge and valley these noble tree extend a continuous belt from end to end of the range only slightly interrupt by sheer-walled cañons at interval of about fifteen and twenty mile here the great burly brown bear delight to roam harmonize with the brown bole of the tree beneath which they feed deer also dwell here and find food and shelter in the ceanothus tangle with a multitude of smaller people above this region of giant the tree grow smaller until the utmost limit of the timber line be reach on the stormy mountain-slope at a height of from ten to twelve thousand foot above the sea where the dwarf pine be so lowly and hard beset by storm and heavy snow it be press into flat tangle over the top of which we may easily walk below the main forest belt the tree likewise diminish in size frost and burning drought repress and blast alike the rose-purple zone along the base of the range comprehend nearly all the famous gold region of californium and here it be that miner from every country under the sun assemble in a wild torrent-like rush to seek they fortune on the bank of every river ravine and gully they have leave they mark every gravel - and boulder-bed have be desperately riddled over and over again but in this region the pick and shovel once wield with savage enthusiasm have be lay away and only quartz-mining be now be carry on to any considerable extent the zone in general be make up of low tawny wave foot-hill roughen here and there with brush and tree and outcrop mass of slate color gray and red with lichen the smaller mass of slate rise abruptly from the dry grassy sod in lean slab look like ancient tombstone in a desert burying-ground in early spring say from February to April the whole of this foot-hill belt be a paradise of bee and flower refreshing rain then fall freely bird be busy build they nest and the sunshine be balmy and delightful but by the end of may the soil plant and sky seem to have be baked in a oven most of the plant crumble to dust beneath the foot and the ground be full of crack while the thirsty traveler gaze with eager longing through the burning glare to the snowy summit loom like hazy cloud in the distance the tree mostly _ quercus douglasius _ and _ pinus sabiniana _ thirty to forty foot high with thin pale-green foliage stand far apart and cast but little shade lizard glide about on the rock enjoy a constitution that no drought can dry and ant in amazing number whose tiny spark of life seem to burn the brighter with the increase heat ramble industriously in long train in search of food crow raven magpie -- friend in distress -- gather on the ground beneath the best shade-tree pant with droop wing and bill wide open scarce a note from any of they during the midday hour quail too seek the shade during the heat of the day about tepid pool in the channel of the larger mid-river stream rabbit scurry from thicket to thicket among the ceanothus bush and occasionally a long-eared hare be see canter gracefully across the wider opening the night be calm and dewless during the summer and a thousand voice proclaim the abundance of life notwithstanding the desolating effect of dry sunshine on the plant and larger animal the hyla make a delightfully pure and tranquil music after sunset and coyote the little despise dog of the wilderness brave hardy fellow look like withered wisp of hay bark in chorus for hour mining-town most of they dead and a few living one with bright bit of cultivation about they occur at long interval along the belt and cottage cover with climb rose in the midst of orange and peach orchard and sweet-scented hay-field in fertile flat where water for irrigation may be have but they be mostly far apart and make scarce any mark in general view every winter the high sierra and the middle forest region get snow in glorious abundance and even the foot-hill be at time whiten then all the range look like a vast beveled wall of purest marble the rough place be then make smooth the death and decay of the year be cover gently and kindly and the ground seem as clean as the sky and though silent in its flight from the cloud and when it be take its place on rock or tree or grassy meadow how soon the gentle snow find a voice slip from the height gather in avalanche it boom and roar like thunder and make a glorious show as it sweep down the mountain-side array in long silken streamer and wreathe swirl film of crystal dust the north half of the range be mostly cover with flood of lava and dot with volcano and crater some of they recent and perfect in form other in various stage of decay the south half be compose of granite nearly from base to summit while a considerable number of peak in the middle of the range be cap with metamorphic slate among which be mount dana and gibb to the east of yosemite valley mount whitney the culminate point of the range near its southern extremity lift its helmet-shaped crest to a height of nearly 14700 foot mount shasta a colossal volcanic cone rise to a height of 14440 foot at the northern extremity and form a noble landmark for all the surrounding region within a radius of a hundred mile residual mass of volcanic rock occur throughout most of the granitic southern portion also and a considerable number of old volcano on the flank especially along the eastern base of the range near mono lake and southward but it be only to the northward that the entire range from base to summit be cover with lava from the summit of mount whitney only granite be see innumerable peak and spire but little lower than its own storm-beaten crag rise in group like forest-tree in full view segregate by cañons of tremendous depth and ruggedness on shasta nearly every feature in the vast view speak of the old volcanic fire far to the northward in oregon the icy volcano of mount pitt and the three sister rise above the dark evergreen wood southward innumerable smaller crater and cone be distribute along the axis of the range and on each flank of these lassen 's butte be the highest be nearly 11000 foot above sea-level mile of its flank be reek and bubble with hot spring many of they so boisterous and sulphurous they seem over ready to become spout geyser like those of the yellowstone the cinder cone near mark the most recent volcanic eruption in the sierra it be a symmetrical truncate cone about 700 foot high cover with gray cinder and ash and have a regular unchanged crater on its summit in which a few small two-leaved pine be grow these show that the age of the cone be not less than eighty year it stand between two lake which a short time ago be one before the cone be build a flood of rough vesicular lava be pour into the lake cut it in two and overflow its bank the fiery flood advance into the pine-wood overwhelming the tree in its way the char end of some of which may still be see project from beneath the snout of the lava-stream where it come to rest later still there be a eruption of ash and loose obsidian cinder probably from the same vent which besides form the cinder cone scatter a heavy shower over the surround wood for mile to a depth of from six inch to several foot the history of this last sierra eruption be also preserve in the tradition of the pitt river indian they tell of a fearful time of darkness when the sky be black with ash and smoke that threaten every living thing with death and that when at length the sun appear once more it be red like blood less recent crater in great number roughen the adjacent region some of they with lake in they throat other overgrown with tree and flower nature in these old hearth and fireside have literally give beauty for ash on the northwest side of mount shasta there be a subordinate cone about 3000 foot below the summit which have be active subsequent to the break up of the main ice-cap that once cover the mountain as be show by its comparatively unwasted crater and the stream of unglaciated lava radiate from it the main summit be about a mile and a half in diameter bound by small crumble peak and ridge among which we seek in vain for the outline of the ancient crater these ruinous mass and the deep glacial groove that flute the side of the mountain show that it have be considerably lower and waste by ice how much we have no sure means of know just below the extreme summit hot sulphurous gas and vapor issue from irregular fissure mix with spray derive from melting snow the last feeble expression of the mighty force that build the mountain not in one great convulsion be shasta give birth the crag of the summit and the section expose by the glacier down the side display enough of its internal framework to prove that comparatively long period of quiescence intervene between many distinct eruption during which the cool lava cease to flow and become permanent addition to the bulk of the grow mountain with alternate haste and deliberation eruption succeed eruption till the old volcano surpass even its present sublime height -lrb- illustration : mount shasta look southwest -rrb- standing on the icy top of this the grandest of all the fire-mountain of the sierra we can hardly fail to look forward to its next eruption garden vineyard home have be plant confidingly on the flank of volcano which after remain steadfast for age have suddenly blaze into violent action and pour forth overwhelming flood of fire it be know that more than a thousand year of cool calm have intervene between violent eruption like gigantic geyser spout molten rock instead of water volcano work and rest and we have no sure means of know whether they be dead when still or only sleep along the western base of the range a tell series of sedimentary rock contain the early history of the sierra be now be study but leave for the present these first chapter we see that only a very short geological time ago just before the come on of that winter of winter call the glacial period a vast deluge of molten rock pour from many a chasm and crater on the flank and summit of the range fill lake basin and river channel and obliterate nearly every exist feature on the northern portion at length these all-destroying flood cease to flow but while the great volcanic cone build up along the axis still burn and smoke the whole sierra pass under the domain of ice and snow then over the bald featureless fire-blackened mountain glacier begin to crawl cover they from the summit to the sea with a mantle of ice and then with infinite deliberation the work go on of sculpture the range anew these mighty agent of erosion halt never through unnumbered century crushed and ground the flinty lava and granite beneath they crystal fold waste and build until in the fullness of time the sierra be bear again bring to light nearly as we behold it today with glacier and snow-crushed pine at the top of the range wheat-field and orange-grove at the foot of it this change from icy darkness and death to life and beauty be slow as we count time and be still go on north and south over all the world wherever glacier exist whether in the form of distinct river as in switzerland norway the mountain of asia and the pacific coast or in continuous mantle fold as in portion of alaska greenland franz-joseph-land nova zemblum spitzbergen and the land about the south pole but in no country as far as i know may these majestic change be study to better advantage than in the plain and mountain of californium toward the close of the glacial period when the snow-cloud become less fertile and the melting waste of sunshine become greater the lower fold of the ice-sheet in californium discharging fleet of iceberg into the sea begin to shallow and recede from the lowland and then move slowly up the flank of the sierra in compliance with the change of climate the great white mantle on the mountain break up into a series of glacier more or less distinct and river-like with many tributary and these again be melt and divide into still smaller glacier until now only a few of the smallest residual topmost branch of the grand system exist on the cool slope of the summit peak plant and animal bide they time closely follow the retire ice bestow quick and joyous animation on the new-born landscape pine-tree march up the sun-warmed moraine in long hopeful file take the ground and establish themselves as soon as it be ready for they brown-spiked sedge fringe the shore of the newborn lake young river roar in the abandon channel of the glacier flower bloom around the foot of the great burnished dome -- while with quick fertility mellow bed of soil settling and warm offer food to multitude of nature 's wait child great and small animal as well as plant mouse squirrel marmot deer bear elephant etc the ground burst into bloom with magical rapidity and the young forest into bird-song : life in every form warming and sweetening and grow richer as the year pass away over the mighty sierra so lately suggestive of death and consummate desolation only it be hard without long and loving study to realize the magnitude of the work do on these mountain during the last glacial period by glacier which be only stream of closely compacted snow-crystal careful study of the phenomenon present go to show that the pre-glacial condition of the range be comparatively simple : one vast wave of stone in which a thousand mountain dome cañons ridge etc lay conceal and in the development of these nature choose for a tool not the earthquake or lightning to rend and split asunder not the stormy torrent or erode rain but the tender snow-flower noiselessly fall through unnumbered century the offspring of the sun and sea labor harmoniously in united strength they crush and ground and wear away the rock in they march make vast bed of soil and at the same time develop and fashion the landscape into the delightful variety of hill and dale and lordly mountain that mortal call beauty perhaps more than a mile in average depth have the range be thus degrade during the last glacial period -- a quantity of mechanical work almost inconceivably great and we admiration must be excite again and again as we toil and study and learn that this vast job of rockwork so far-reaching in its influence be do by agent so fragile and small as be these flower of the mountain cloud strong only by force of number they carry away entire mountain particle by particle block by block and cast they into the sea sculptured fashion model all the range and develop its predestined beauty all these new sierra landscape be evidently predestine for the physical structure of the rock on which the feature of the scenery depend be acquire while they lay at least a mile deep below the pre-glacial surface and it be while these feature be take form in the depths of the range the particle of the rock march to they appoint place in the dark with reference to the come beauty that the particle of icy vapor in the sky march to the same music assemble to bring they to the light then after they grand task be do these band of snow-flower these mighty glacier be melt and remove as if of no more importance than dew destine to last but a hour few however of nature 's agent have leave monument so noble and enduring as they the great granite dome a mile high the cañons as deep the noble peak the yosemite valley these and indeed nearly all other feature of the sierra scenery be glacier monument contemplate the work of these flower of the sky one may easily fancy they endowed with life : messenger send down to work in the mountain mine on errand of divine love silently fly through the darkened air swirl glint to they appoint place they seem to have take counsel together say come we be feeble let we help one another we be many and together we will be strong march in close deep rank let we roll away the stone from these mountain sepulcher and set the landscape free let we uncover these clustering dome here let we carve a lake basin there a yosemite valley here a channel for a river with fluted step and brow for the plunge of songful cataract yonder let we spread broad sheet of soil that man and beast may be feed and here pile train of boulder for pine and giant sequoia here make ground for a meadow there for a garden and grove make it smooth and fine for small daisy and violet and bed of heathy bryanthus spice it well with crystal garnet feldspar and zircon thus and so on it have oftentimes seem to I sing and plan and labor the hearty snow-flower crusader and nothing that i can write can possibly exaggerate the grandeur and beauty of they work like morning mist they have vanish in sunshine all save the few small company that still linger on the coolest mountainside and as residual glacier be still busily at work complete the last of the lake basin the last bed of soil and the sculpture of some of the highest peak -lrb- illustration : mount hood -rrb- chapter ii the glacier of the small residual glacier mention in the precede chapter i have find sixty-five in that portion of the range lie between latitude 36 ° 30 ' and 39 ° they occur singly or in small group on the north side of the peak of the high sierra sheltered beneath broad frosty shadow in amphitheater of they own make where the snow shooting down from the surround height in avalanche be most abundant over two third of the entire number lie between latitude 37 ° and 38 ° and form the highest fountain of the san joaquin merce tuolumne and owen 's river the glacier of switzerland like those of the sierra be mere waste remnant of mighty ice-flood that once fill the great valley and pour into the sea so also be those of norway asia and south america even the grand continuous mantle of ice that still cover greenland spitsbergen nova zemblum franz-joseph-land part of alaska and the south polar region be shallow and shrink every glacier in the world be smaller than it once be all the world be grow warmer or the crop of snow-flower be diminish but in contemplate the condition of the glacier of the world we must bear in mind while try to account for the change go on that the same sunshine that waste they build they every glacier record the expenditure of a enormous amount of sun-heat in lift the vapor for the snow of which it be make from the ocean to the mountain as tyndall strikingly show the number of glacier in the alp accord to the schlagintweit brother be 1100 of which 100 may be regard as primary and the total area of ice snow and _ névé _ be estimate at 1177 square mile or a average for each glacier of little more than one square mile on the same authority the average height above sea-level at which they melt be about 7414 foot the grindelwald glacier descend below 4000 foot and one of the mont blanc glacier reach nearly as low a point one of the largest of the himalaya glacier on the head water of the gange do not accord to captain hodgson descend below 12914 foot the largest of the sierra glacier on mount shasta descend to within 9500 foot of the level of the sea which as far as i have observe be the lowest point reach by any glacier within the bound of californium the average height of all be not far from 11000 foot the change that have take place in the glacial condition of the sierra from the time of greatest extension be well illustrate by the series of glacier of every size and form extend along the mountain of the coast to alaska a general exploration of this instructive region show that to the north of californium through oregon and washington group of active glacier still exist on all the high volcanic cone of the cascade range -- mount pitt the three sister mount jefferson hood st helen adam rainier baker and other -- some of they of considerable size though none of they approach the sea of these mountain rainier in washington be the highest and iciest its dome-like summit between 14000 and 15000 foot high be cap with ice and eight glacier seven to twelve mile long radiate from it as a center and form the source of the principal stream of the state the lowest-descending of this fine group flow through beautiful forest to within 3500 foot of the sea-level and send forth a river laden with glacier mud and sand on through british columbium and southeastern alaska the broad sustained mountain-chain extend along the coast be generally glacier-bearing the upper branch of nearly all the main cañons and fiord be occupy by glacier which gradually increase in size and descend lower until the high region between mount fairweather and mount st elia be reach where a considerable number discharge into the water of the ocean this be preëminently the ice-land of alaska and of the entire pacific coast northward from here the glacier gradually diminish in size and thickness and melt at higher level in prince william sound and cook 's inlet many fine glacier be display pour from the surround mountain but to the north of latitude 62 ° few if any glacier remain the ground be mostly low and the snowfall light between latitude 56 ° and 60 ° there be probably more than 5000 glacier not count the smallest hundred of the largest size descend through the forest to the level of the sea or near it though as far as my own observation have reach after a pretty thorough examination of the region not more than twenty-five discharge iceberg into the sea all the long high-walled fiord into which these great glacier of the first class flow be of course crowd with iceberg of every conceivable form which be detach with thunder noise at interval of a few minute from a impose ice-wall that be thrust forward into deep water but these pacific coast iceberg be small as compare with those of greenland and the antarctic region and only a few of they escape from the intricate system of channel with which this portion of the coast be fringe into the open sea nearly all of they be swash and drift by wind and tide back and forth in the fiord until finally melt by the ocean water the sunshine the warm wind and the copious rain of summer only one glacier on the coast observe by prof russell discharge its berg directly into the open sea at icy cape opposite mount st elia the southernmost of the glacier that reach the sea occupy a narrow picturesque fiord about twenty mile to the northwest of the mouth of the stikeen river in latitude 56 ° 50 ' the fiord be call by the native hutlus or thunder bay from the noise make by the discharge of the iceberg about one degree farther north there be four of these complete glacier discharge at the head of the long arm of holkam bay at the head of the tahkoo inlet still farther north there be one and at the head and around the side of glacier bay trend in a general northerly direction from cross sound in latitude 58 ° to 59 ° there be seven of these complete glacier pour berg into the bay and its branch and keep up a eternal thunder the largest of this group the muir have upward of 200 tributary and a width below the confluence of the main tributary of about twenty-five mile between the west side of this icy bay and the ocean all the ground high and low except the peak of the fairweather range be cover with a mantle of ice from 1000 to probably 3000 foot thick which discharge by many distinct mouth -lrb- illustration : mount rainier from paradise valley -- nisqually glacier -rrb- this fragmentary ice-sheet and the immense glacier about mount st elia together with the multitude of separate river-like glacier that load the slope of the coast mountain evidently once form part of a continuous ice-sheet that flow over all the region hereabouts and only a comparatively short time ago extend as far southward as the mouth of the strait of juan de fuca probably farther all the island of the alexander archipelago as well as the headland and promontory of the mainland display tell trace of this great mantle that be still fresh and unmistakable they all have the form of the greatest strength with reference to the action of a vast rigid press of oversweep ice from the north and northwest and they surface have a smooth rounded overrubbed appearance generally free from angle the intricate labyrinth of canal channel strait passage sound narrow etc between the island and extend into the mainland of course manifest in they form and trend and general characteristic the same subordination to the grind action of universal glaciation as to they origin and differ from the island and bank of the fiord only in be portion of the pre-glacial margin of the continent more deeply erode and therefore cover by the ocean water which flow into they as the ice be melt out of they the formation and extension of fiord in this manner be still go on and may be witness in many place in glacier bay yakutat bay and adjacent region that the domain of the sea be be extend over the land by the wear away of its shore be well know but in these icy region of alaska and even as far south as vancouver island the coast rock have be so short a time expose to wave-action they be but little waste as yet in these region the extension of the sea effect by its own action in post-glacial time be scarcely appreciable as compare with that effect by ice-action trace of the vanish glacier make during the period of greater extension abound on the sierra as far south as latitude 36 ° even the polished rock surface the most evanescent of glacial record be still find in a wonderfully perfect state of preservation on the upper half of the middle portion of the range and form the most striking of all the glacial phenomenon they occur in large irregular patch in the summit and middle region and though they have be subject to the action of the weather with its corrode storm for thousand of year they mechanical excellence be such that they still reflect the sunbeam like glass and attract the attention of every observer the attention of the mountaineer be seldom arrest by moraine however regular and high they may be or by cañons however deep or by rock however noble in form and sculpture but he stoop and rub he hand admiringly on the shine surface and trio hard to account for they mysterious smoothness he have see the snow descend in avalanche but conclude this can not be the work of snow for he find it where no avalanche occur nor can water have do it for he see this smoothness glowing on the side and top of the highest dome only the wind of all the agent he know seem capable of flow in the direction indicate by the score indian usually so little curious about geological phenomenon have come to I occasionally and ask I what makeum the ground so smooth at lake tenaya even horse and dog gaze wonderingly at the strange brightness of the ground and smell the polished space and place they foot cautiously on they when they come to they for the first time as if afraid of sink the most perfect of the polished pavement and wall lie at a elevation of from 7000 to 9000 foot above the sea where the rock be compact silicious granite small dim patch may be find as low as 3000 foot on the driest and most enduring portion of sheer wall with a southern exposure and on compact swell boss partially protect from rain by a covering of large boulder on the north half of the range the striated and polished surface be less common not only because this part of the chain be lower but because the surface rock be chiefly porous lava subject to comparatively rapid waste the ancient moraine also though well preserve on most of the south half of the range be nearly obliterate to the northward but then material be find scatter and disintegrate a similar blur condition of the superficial record of glacial action obtain throughout most of oregon washington british columbium and alaska due in great part to the action of excessive moisture even in southeastern alaska where the most extensive glacier on the continent be the more evanescent of the trace of they former greater extension though comparatively recent be more obscure than those of the ancient californium glacier whore the climate be drier and the rock more resist these general view of the glacier of the pacific coast will enable my reader to see something of the change that have take place in californium and will throw light on the residual glacier of the high sierra prior to the autumn of 1871 the glacier of the sierra be unknown in October of that year i discover the black mountain glacier in a shadowy amphitheater between black and rod mountain two of the peak of the merced group this group be the highest portion of a spur that straggle out from the main axis of the range in the direction of yosemite valley at the time of this interesting discovery i be explore the _ névé _ amphitheater of the group and trace the course of the ancient glacier that once pour from its ample fountain through the illilouette basin and the yosemite valley not expect to find any active glacier so far south in the land of sunshine beginning on the northwestern extremity of the group i explore the chief tributary basin in succession they moraine roch moutonnées and splendid glacier pavement take they in regular succession without any reference to the time consume in they study the monument of the tributary that pour its ice from between red and black mountain i find to be the most interesting of they all and when i see its magnificent moraine extend in majestic curve from the spacious amphitheater between the mountain i be exhilarate with the work that lay before I it be one of the golden day of the sierra indian summer when the rich sunshine glorify every landscape however rocky and cold and suggest anything rather than glacier the path of the vanish glacier be warm now and shone in many place as if wash with silver the tall pine grow on the moraine stand transfigure in the glowing light the poplar grove on the level of the basin be mass of orange-yellow and the late-blooming goldenrod add gold to gold push on over my rosy glacial highway i pass lake after lake set in solid basin of granite and many a thicket and meadow water by a stream that issue from the amphitheater and link the lake together now wade through plushy bog knee-deep in yellow and purple sphagnum now pass over bare rock the main lateral moraine that bound the view on either hand be from 100 to nearly 200 foot high and about as regular as artificial embankment and cover with a superb growth of silver fir and pine but this garden and forest luxuriance be speedily leave behind the tree be dwarf as i ascended patch of the alpine bryanthus and cassiope begin to appear and arctic willow press into flat carpet by the winter snow the lakelet which a few mile down the valley be so richly embroidered with flowery meadow have here at a elevation of 10000 foot only small brown mat of carex leave bare rock around more than half they shore yet amid this alpine suppression the mountain pine bravely toss he storm-beaten branch on the ledge and buttress of red mountain some specimen be over 100 foot high and 24 foot in circumference seemingly as fresh and vigorous as the giant of the lower zone evening come on just as i get fairly within the portal of the main amphitheater it be about a mile wide and a little less than two mile long the crumble spur and battlements of red mountain bind it on the north the somber rudely sculptured precipice of black mountain on the south and a hack splintery _ col _ curve around from mountain to mountain shut it in on the east i choose a camping-ground on the brink of one of the lake where a thicket of hemlock spruce sheltered I from the night wind then after make a tin-cupful of tea i sit by my camp-fire reflect on the grandeur and significance of the glacial record i have see as the night advance the mighty rock wall of my mountain mansion seem to come nearer while the starry sky in glorious brightness stretch across like a ceiling from wall to wall and fit closely down into all the spiky irregularity of the summit then after a long fireside rest and a glance at my note-book i cut a few leafy branch for a bed and fall into the clear death-like sleep of the tired mountaineer early next morning i set out to trace the grand old glacier that have do so much for the beauty of the yosemite region back to its farthest fountain enjoy the charm that every explorer feel in nature 's untrodden wilderness the voice of the mountain be still asleep the wind scarce stir the pine-needle the sun be up but it be yet too cold for the bird and the few burrow animal that dwell here only the stream cascade from pool to pool seem to be wholly awake yet the spirit of the opening day call to action the sunbeam come streaming gloriously through the jagged opening of the _ col _ glance on the burnished pavement and light the silvery lake while every sun-touched rock burn white on its edge like melting iron in a furnace pass round the north shore of my camp lake i follow the central stream past many cascade from lakelet to lakelet the scenery become more rigidly arctic the dwarf pine and hemlock disappear and the stream be border with icicle as the sun rise higher rock be loosen on shattered portion of the cliff and come down in rattle avalanche echo wildly from crag to crag the main lateral moraine that extend from the jaw of the amphitheater into the illilouette basin be continue in straggle mass along the wall of the amphitheater while separate boulder hundred of ton in weight be leave strand here and there out in the middle of the channel here also i observe a series of small terminal moraine range along the south wall of the amphitheater correspond in size and form with the shadow cast by the highest portion the meaning of this correspondence between moraine and shadow be afterward make plain trace the stream back to the last of its chain of lakelet i notice a deposit of fine gray mud on the bottom except where the force of the enter current have prevent its settle it look like the mud worn from a grindstone and i at once suspect its glacial origin for the stream that be carry it come gurgle out of the base of a raw moraine that seem in process of formation not a plant or weather-stain be visible on its rough unsettled surface it be from 60 to over 100 foot high and plunge forward at a angle of 38 ° cautiously pick my way i gain the top of the moraine and be delighted to see a small but well characterize glacier swoop down from the gloomy precipice of black mountain in a finely graduate curve to the moraine on which i stand the compact ice appear on all the lower portion of the glacier though gray with dirt and stone embed in it farther up the ice disappear beneath coarse granulated snow the surface of the glacier be further characterize by dirt band and the outcropping edge of the blue vein show the laminated structure of the ice the uppermost crevasse or bergschrund where the _ névé _ be attach to the mountain be from 12 to 14 foot wide and be bridge in a few place by the remains of snow avalanche creep along the edge of the schrund holding on with benumbed finger i discover clear section where the bed structure be beautifully reveal the surface snow though sprinkle with stone shoot down from the cliff be in some place almost pure gradually become crystalline and change to whitish porous ice of different shades of color and this again change at a depth of 20 or 30 foot to blue ice some of the ribbon-like band of which be nearly pure and blended with the paler band in the most gradual and delicate manner imaginable a series of rugged zigzag enable I to make my way down into the weird under-world of the crevasse its chambered hollow be hang with a multitude of cluster icicle amid which pale subdue light pulsed and shimmer with indescribable loveliness water drip and tinkle overhead and from far below come strange solemn murmuring from current that be feel they way through vein and fissure in the dark the chamber of a glacier be perfectly enchanting notwithstanding one feel out of place in they frosty beauty i be soon cold in my shirt-sleeve and the lean wall threaten to engulf I yet it be hard to leave the delicious music of the water and the lovely light come again to the surface i notice boulder of every size on they journey to the terminal moraine -- journey of more than a hundred year without a single stop night or day winter or summer the sun give birth to a network of sweet-voiced rill that run gracefully down the glacier curling and swirl in they shine channel and cut clear section through the porous surface-ice into the solid blue where the structure of the glacier be beautifully illustrate the series of small terminal moraine which i have observe in the morning along the south wall of the amphitheater correspond in every way with the moraine of this glacier and they distribution with reference to shadow be now understand when the climatic change come on that cause the melting and retreat of the main glacier that fill the amphitheater a series of residual glacier be leave in the cliff shadow under the protection of which they linger until they form the moraine we be study then as the snow become still less abundant all of they vanish in succession except the one just describe and the cause of its longer life be sufficiently apparent in the greater area of snow-basin it drain and its more perfect protection from waste sunshine how much longer this little glacier will last depend of course on the amount of snow it receive from year to year as compare with melting waste after this discovery i make excursion over all the high sierra push my exploration summer after summer and discover that what at first sight in the distance look like extensive snow-field wear in great part glacier busily at work complete the sculpture of the summit-peak so grandly block out by they giant predecessor on August 21 i set a series of stake in the maclure glacier near mount lyell and find its rate of motion to be little more than a inch a day in the middle show a great contrast to the muir glacier in alaska which near the front flow at a rate of from five to ten foot in twenty-four hour mount shasta have three glacier but mount whitney although it be the highest mountain in the range do not now cherish a single glacier small patch of lasting snow and ice occur on its northern slope but they be shallow and present no well marked evidence of glacial motion its side however be score and polish in many place by the action of its ancient glacier that flow east and west as tributary of the great glacier that once fill the valley of the kern and owen 's river chapter iii the snow the first snow that whiten the sierra usually fall about the end of October or early in November to a depth of a few inch after month of the most charming indian summer weather imaginable but in a few day this light cover mostly melt from the slope expose to the sun and cause but little apprehension on the part of mountaineer who may be linger among the high peak at this time the first general winter storm that yield snow that be to form a lasting portion of the season 's supply seldom break on the mountain before the end of November then warn by the sky caution mountaineer together with the wild sheep deer and most of the bird and bear make haste to the lowland or foot-hill and burrow marmot mountain beaver wood-rat and such people go into winter quarter some of they not again to see the light of day until the general awakening and resurrection of the spring in June or July the first heavy fall be usually from about two to four foot in depth then with interval of splendid sunshine storm succeed storm heaping snow on snow until thirty to fifty foot have fall but on account of its settling and compact and the almost constant waste from melting and evaporation the average depth actually find at any time seldom exceed ten foot in the forest region or fifteen foot along the slope of the summit peak even during the coldest weather evaporation never wholly cease and the sunshine that abound between the storm be sufficiently powerful to melt the surface more or less through all the winter month waste from melting also go on to some extent on the bottom from heat store up in the rock and give off slowly to the snow in contact with they as be show by the rising of the stream on all the higher region after the first snowfall and they steady sustained flow all winter the greater portion of the snow deposit around the lofty summit of the range fall in small crisp flake and broken crystal or when accompany by strong wind and low temperature the crystal instead of be lock together in they fall to form tufted flake be beat and break into meal and fine dust but down in the forest region the greater portion come gently to the ground light and feathery some of the flake in mild weather be nearly a inch in diameter and it be evenly distribute and keep from drift to any great extent by the shelter afford by the large tree every tree during the progress of gentle storm be load with fairy bloom at the coldest and darkest time of year bend the branch and hush every singing needle but as soon as the storm be over and the sun shine the snow at once begin to shift and settle and fall from the branch in miniature avalanche and the white forest soon become green again the snow on the ground also settle and thaw every bright day and freeze at night until it become coarsely granulated and lose every trace of its ray crystalline structure and then a man may walk firmly over its frozen surface as if on ice the forest region up to a elevation of 7000 foot be usually in great part free from snow in June but at this time the higher region be still heavy-laden and be not touch by spring weather to any considerable extent before the middle or end of July one of the most striking effect of the snow on the mountain be the burial of the river and small lake as the snow fa 's in the river a moment white then lose forever sing burn in illustrate the fleeting character of human pleasure the first snowflake that fall into the sierra river vanish thus suddenly but in great storm when the temperature be low the abundance of the snow at length chill the water nearly to the freezing-point and then of course it cease to melt and consume the snow so suddenly the fall flake and crystal form cloud-like mass of blue sludge which be sweep forward with the current and carry down to warmer climate many mile distant while some be lodge against log and rock and project point of the bank and last for day pile high above the level of the water and show white again instead of be at once lose forever while the river themselves be at length lose for month during the snowy period the snow be first build out from the bank in bossy over-curling drift compact and cement until the stream be span they then flow in the dark beneath a continuous cover across the snowy zone which be about thirty mile wide all the sierra river and they tributary in these high region be thus lose every winter as if another glacial period have come on not a drop of run water be to be see except at a few point where large fall occur though the rush and rumble of the heavier current may still be hear toward spring when the weather be warm during the day and frosty at night repeat thawing and freezing and new layer of snow render the bridging-mass dense and firm so that one may safely walk across the stream or even lead a horse across they without danger of fall through in June the thinnest part of the winter ceiling and those most expose to sunshine begin to give way form dark rugged-edged pit-like sink at the bottom of which the rush water may be see at the end of June only here and there may the mountaineer find a secure snow-bridge the most lasting of the winter bridge thaw from below as well as from above because of warm current of air pass through the tunnel be strikingly arched and sculptured and by the occasional freezing of the ooze drip water of the ceiling they become brightly and picturesquely icy in some of the reach where there be a free margin we may walk through they small skylight appear here and there these tunnel be not very dark the roar river fill all the arch way with impressively loud reverberate music which be sweeten at time by the ouzel a bird that be not afraid to go wherever a stream may go and to sing wherever a stream sing all the small alpine pool and lakelet be in like manner obliterate from the winter landscape either by be first frozen and then cover by snow or by be fill in by avalanche the first avalanche of the season shot into a lake basin may perhaps find the surface frozen then there be a grand crash of break ice and dashing of wave mingle with the low deep booming of the avalanche detach mass of the invade snow mixed with fragment of ice drift about in sludgy island-like heap while the main body of it form a talus with its base wholly or in part rest on the bottom of the basin as control by its depth and the size of the avalanche the next avalanche of course encroach still farther and so on with each in succession until the entire basin may be fill and its water sponge up or displaced this huge mass of sludge more or less mixed with sand stone and perhaps timber be freeze to a considerable depth and much sun-heat be require to thaw it some of these unfortunate lakelet be not clear of ice and snow until near the end of summer other be never quite free opening only on the side opposite the entrance of the avalanche some show only a narrow crescent of water lie between the shore and sheer bluff of icy compacted snow mass of which break off float in front like iceberg in a miniature arctic ocean while the avalanche heap lean back against the mountain look like small glacier the frontal cliff be in some instance quite picturesque and with the berg-dotted water in front of they light with sunshine be exceedingly beautiful it often happen that while one side of a lake basin be hopelessly snow-buried and frozen the other enjoy sunshine be adorn with beautiful flower-garden some of the smaller lake be extinguish in a instant by a heavy avalanche either of rock or snow the roll slide ponderous mass enter on one side sweep across the bottom and up the opposite side displace the water and even scrape the basin clean and shove the accumulate rock and sediment up the farther bank and take full possession the dislodged water be in part absorb but most of it be send around the front of the avalanche and down the channel of the outlet roaring and hurry as if frightened and glad to escape snow-banner the most magnificent storm phenomenon i ever see surpassing in showy grandeur the most impose effect of cloud flood or avalanche be the peak of the high sierra back of yosemite valley decorate with snow-banner many of the starry snow-flower out of which these banner be make fall before they be ripe while most of those that do attain perfect development as six-rayed crystal glint and chafe against one another in they fall through the frosty air and be break into fragment this dry fragmentary snow be still further prepare for the formation of banner by the action of the wind for instead of find rest at once like the snow which fall into the tranquil depths of the forest it be roll over and over beat against rock-ridge and swirl in pit and hollow like boulder pebble and sand in the pot-hole of a river until finally the delicate angle of the crystal be wear off and the whole mass be reduce to dust and whenever storm-wind find this prepared snow-dust in a loose condition on expose slope where there be a free upward sweep to leeward it be toss back into the sky and bear onward from peak to peak in the form of banner or cloudy drift accord to the velocity of the wind and the conformation of the slope up or around which it be drive while thus fly through the air a small portion make good its escape and remain in the sky as vapor but far the greater part after be drive into the sky again and again be at length lock fast in bossy drift or in the womb of glacier some of it to remain silent and rigid for century before it be finally melt and send singing down the mountainside to the sea yet notwithstanding the abundance of winter snow-dust in the mountain and the frequency of high wind and the length of time the dust remain loose and expose to they action the occurrence of well-formed banner be for cause we shall hereafter note comparatively rare i have see only one display of this kind that seem in every way perfect this be in the winter of 1873 when the snow-laden summit be sweep by a wild norther i happen at the time to be winter in yosemite valley that sublime sierra temple where every day one may see the grandest sight yet even here the wild gala-day of the north wind seem surpassingly glorious i be awaken in the morning by the rock of my cabin and the beating of pine-bur on the roof detach torrent and avalanche from the main wind-flood overhead be rush wildly down the narrow side cañons and over the precipitous wall with loud resounding roar rouse the pine to enthusiastic action and make the whole valley vibrate as though it be a instrument be play but afar on the lofty expose peak of the range standing so high in the sky the storm be express itself in still grander character which i be soon to see in all they glory i have long be anxious to study some point in the structure of the ice-cone that be form every winter at the foot of the upper yosemite fall but the blinding spray by which it be invest have hitherto prevent I from make a sufficiently near approach this morning the entire body of the fall be tear into gauzy shred and blow horizontally along the face of the cliff leave the cone dry and while make my way to the top of a overlook ledge to seize so favorable a opportunity to examine the interior of the cone the peak of the merced group come in sight over the shoulder of the south dome each wave a resplendent banner against the blue sky as regular in form and as firm in texture as if weave of fine silk so rare and splendid a phenomenon of course overbore all other consideration and i at once let the ice-cone go and begin to force my way out of the valley to some dome or ridge sufficiently lofty to command a general view of the main summit feel assure that i should find they banner still more gloriously nor be i in the least disappointed indian cañon through which i climb be choke with snow that have be shoot down in avalanche from the high cliff on either side render the ascent difficult but inspire by the roar storm the tedious wallow bring no fatigue and in four hour i gain the top of a ridge above the valley 8000 foot high and there in bold relief like a clear painting appear a most impose scene innumerable peak black and sharp rise grandly into the dark blue sky they basis set in solid white they side streak and splash with snow like ocean rock with foam and from every summit all free and unconfused be stream a beautiful silky silvery banner from half a mile to a mile in length slender at the point of attachment then widen gradually as it extend from the peak until it be about 1000 or 1500 foot in breadth as near as i could estimate the cluster of peak call the crown of the sierra at the head of the merce and tuolumne river -- mount dana gibb conness lyell maclure ritter with they nameless compeer -- each have its own refulgent banner wave with a clearly visible motion in the sunglow and there be not a single cloud in the sky to mar they simple grandeur fancy yourself stand on this yosemite ridge look eastward you notice a strange garish glitter in the air the gale drive wildly overhead with a fierce tempestuous roar but its violence be not feel for you be look through a sheltered opening in the wood as through a window there in the immediate foreground of you picture rise a majestic forest of silver fir bloom in eternal freshness the foliage yellow-green and the snow beneath the tree strew with they beautiful plume pluck off by the wind beyond and extend over all the middle ground be somber swath of pine interrupt by huge swell ridge and dome and just beyond the dark forest you see the monarch of the high sierra wave they magnificent banner they be twenty mile away but you would not wish they nearer for every feature be distinct and the whole glorious show be see in its right proportion after this general view mark how sharply the dark snowless rib and buttress and summit of the peak be define except the portion veil by the banner and how delicately they side be streak with snow where it have come to rest in narrow fluting and gorge mark too how grandly the banner wave as the wind be deflect against they side and how trimly each be attach to the very summit of its peak like a streamer at a masthead how smooth and silky they be in texture and how finely they fading fringe be pencil on the azure sky see how dense and opaque they be at the point of attachment and how filmy and translucent toward the end so that the peak back of they be see dimly as though you be look through ground glass yet again observe how some of the longest belong to the loftiest summit stream perfectly free all the way across intervene notch and pass from peak to peak while other overlap and partly hide each other and consider how keenly every particle of this wondrous cloth of snow be flash out jet of light these be the main feature of the beautiful and terrible picture as see from the forest window and it would still be surpassingly glorious be the fore - and middle-grounds obliterate altogether leave only the black peak the white banner and the blue sky glance now in a general way at the formation of snow-banner we find that the main cause of the wondrous beauty and perfection of those we have be contemplate be the favorable direction and great force of the wind the abundance of snow-dust and the peculiar conformation of the slope of the peak it be essential not only that the wind should move with great velocity and steadiness to supply a sufficiently copious and continuous stream of snow-dust but that it should come from the north no perfect banner be ever hang on the sierra peak by a south wind have the gale that day blow from the south leave other condition unchanged only a dull confused fog-like drift would have be produce for the snow instead of be spout up over the top of the peak in concentrated current to be draw out as streamer would have be shed off around the side and pile down into the glacier womb the cause of the concentrated action of the north wind be find in the peculiar form of the north side of the peak where the amphitheater of the residual glacier be in general the south side be convex and irregular while the north side be concave both in they vertical and horizontal section the wind in ascend these curve converge toward the summit carry the snow in concentrate current with it shoot it almost straight up into the air above the peak from which it be then carry away in a horizontal direction this difference in form between the north and south side of the peak be almost wholly produce by the difference in the kind and quantity of the glaciation to which they have be subject the north side have be hollow by residual shadow-glacier of a form that never exist on the sun-beaten side it appear therefore that shadow in great part determine not only the form of lofty icy mountain but also those of the snow-banner that the wild wind hang on they chapter iv a near view of the high sierra early one bright morning in the middle of indian summer while the glacier meadow be still crisp with frost crystal i set out from the foot of mount lyell on my way down to yosemite valley to replenish my exhaust store of bread and tea i have spend the past summer as many precede one explore the glacier that lie on the head water of the san joaquin tuolumne merce and owen 's river measure and study they movement trend crevasse moraine etc and the part they have play during the period of they greater extension in the creation and development of the landscape of this alpine wonderland the time for this kind of work be nearly over for the year and i begin to look forward with delight to the approach winter with its wondrous storm when i would be warmly snow-bound in my yosemite cabin with plenty of bread and book but a tinge of regret come on when i consider that possibly i might not see this favorite region again until the next summer except distant view from the height about the yosemite wall to artist few portion of the high sierra be strictly speak picturesque the whole massive uplift of the range be one great picture not clearly divisible into smaller one differ much in this respect from the older and what may be call riper mountain of the coast range all the landscape of the sierra as we have see be bear again remodel from base to summit by the develop ice-flood of the last glacial winter but all those new landscape be not bring forth simultaneously some of the highest where the ice linger longest be ten of century younger than those of the warmer region below they in general the younger the mountain-landscape -- younger i mean with reference to the time of they emergence from the ice of the glacial period -- the less separable be they into artistic bit capable of be make into warm sympathetic lovable picture with appreciable humanity in they here however on the head water of the tuolumne be a group of wild peak on which the geologist may say that the sun have but just begin to shine which be yet in a high degree picturesque and in its main feature so regular and evenly balanced as almost to appear conventional -- one somber cluster of snow-laden peak with gray pine-fringed granite boss braid around its base the whole surge free into the sky from the head of a magnificent valley whose lofty wall be bevel away on both side so as to embrace it all without admit anything not strictly belong to it the foreground be now aflame with autumn color brown and purple and gold ripe in the mellow sunshine contrast brightly with the deep cobalt blue of the sky and the black and gray and pure spiritual white of the rock and glacier down through the midst the young tuolumne be see pour from its crystal fountain now rest in glassy pool as if change back again into ice now leap in white cascade as if turn to snow glide right and leave between granite boss then sweep on through the smooth meadowy level of the valley sway pensively from side to side with calm stately gesture past dip willow and sedge and around grove of arrowy pine and throughout its whole eventful course whether flow fast or slow singing loud or low ever fill the landscape with spiritual animation and manifest the grandeur of its source in every movement and tone pursue my lonely way down the valley i turn again and again to gaze on the glorious picture throw up my arm to inclose it as in a frame after long age of growth in the darkness beneath the glacier through sunshine and storm it seem now to be ready and wait for the elect artist like yellow wheat for the reaper and i could not help wish that i might carry color and brush with I on my travels and learn to paint in the mean time i have to be content with photograph on my mind and sketch in my note-book at length after i have round a precipitous headland that put out from the west wall of the valley every peak vanish from sight and i push rapidly along the frozen meadow over the divide between the water of the merce and tuolumne and down through the forest that clothe the slope of cloud 's rest arrive in yosemite in due time -- which with I be _ any _ time and strange to say among the first people i meet here be two artist who with letter of introduction be await my return they inquire whether in the course of my exploration in the adjacent mountain i have ever come upon a landscape suitable for a large painting whereupon i begin a description of the one that have so lately excited my admiration then as i go on further and further into detail they face begin to glow and i offer to guide they to it while they declare that they would gladly follow far or near whithersoever i could spare the time to lead they since storm might come break down through the fine weather at any time bury the color in snow and cut off the artist ' retreat i advise get ready at once i lead they out of the valley by the vernal and nevada fall thence over the main divide ridge to the big tuolumne meadow by the old mono trail and thence along the upper tuolumne river to its head this be my companion ' first excursion into the high sierra and as i be almost always alone in my mountaineer the way that the fresh beauty be reflect in they face make for I a novel and interesting study they naturally be affect most of all by the color -- the intense azure of the sky the purplish gray of the granite the red and brown of dry meadow and the translucent purple and crimson of huckleberry bog the flaming yellow of aspen grove the silvery flash of the stream and the bright green and blue of the glacier lake but the general expression of the scenery -- rocky and savage -- seem sadly disappointing and as they thread the forest from ridge to ridge eagerly scan the landscape as they be unfold they say : all this be huge and sublime but we see nothing as yet at all available for effective picture art be long and art be limit you know and here be foreground middle-grounds background all alike bare rock-wave wood grove diminutive fleck of meadow and strip of glittering water never mind i reply only bide a wee and i will show you something you will like at length toward the end of the second day the sierra crown begin to come into view and when we have fairly round the project headland before mention the whole picture stand reveal in the flush of the alpenglow they enthusiasm be excite beyond bound and the more impulsive of the two a young scotchman dash ahead shout and gesticulate and toss he arm in the air like a madman here at last be a typical alpine landscape after feast awhile on the view i proceed to make camp in a sheltered grove a little way back from the meadow where pine-bough could be obtain for bed and where there be plenty of dry wood for fire while the artist run here and there along the river-bend and up the side of the cañon choose foreground for sketch after dark when we tea be make and a rousing fire have be build we begin to make we plan they decide to remain several day at the least while i conclude to make a excursion in the mean time to the untouched summit of ritter it be now about the middle of October the springtime of snow-flower the first winter-cloud have already bloom and the peak be strew with fresh crystal without however affect the climb to any dangerous extent and as the weather be still profoundly calm and the distance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day i feel that i be run no great risk of be storm-bound mount ritter be king of the mountain of the middle portion of the high sierra as shasta of the north and whitney of the south section moreover as far as i know it have never be climb i have explore the adjacent wilderness summer after summer but my study thus far have never draw I to the top of it its height above sea-level be about 13300 foot and it be fenced round by steeply inclined glacier and cañons of tremendous depth and ruggedness which render it almost inaccessible but difficulty of this kind only exhilarate the mountaineer next morning the artist go heartily to they work and i to mine former experience have give good reason to know that passionate storm invisible as yet might be brooding in the calm sun-gold therefore before bidding farewell i warn the artist not to be alarm should i fail to appear before a week or ten day and advise they in case a snow-storm should set in to keep up big fire and shelter themselves as best they could and on no account to become frightened and attempt to seek they way back to yosemite alone through the drift my general plan be simply this : to scale the cañon wall cross over to the eastern flank of the range and then make my way southward to the northern spur of mount ritter in compliance with the intervene topography for to push on directly southward from camp through the innumerable peak and pinnacle that adorn this portion of the axis of the range however interesting would take too much time besides be extremely difficult and dangerous at this time of year all my first day be pure pleasure simply mountaineer indulgence cross the dry pathway of the ancient glacier trace happy stream and learn the habit of the bird and marmot in the grove and rock before i have go a mile from camp i come to the foot of a white cascade that beat its way down a rugged gorge in the cañon wall from a height of about nine hundred foot and pour its throbbing water into the tuolumne i be acquaint with its fountain which fortunately lay in my course what a fine travel companion it prove to be what song it sing and how passionately it tell the mountain 's own joy gladly i climb along its dash border absorb its divine music and bathing from time to time in wafting of irised spray climb higher higher now beauty come streaming on the sight : paint meadow late-blooming garden peak of rare architecture lake here and there shine like silver and glimpse of the forested middle region and the yellow lowland far in the west beyond the range i see the so-called mono desert lie dreamily silent in thick purple light -- a desert of heavy sun-glare beheld from a desert of ice-burnished granite here the water divide shout in glorious enthusiasm and fall eastward to vanish in the volcanic sand and dry sky of the great basin or westward to the great valley of californium and thence through the bay of san francisco and the golden gate to the sea pass a little way down over the summit until i have reach a elevation of about 10000 foot i push on southward toward a group of savage peak that stand guard about ritter on the north and west grope my way and deal instinctively with every obstacle as it present itself here a huge gorge would be find cut across my path along the dizzy edge of which i scramble until some less precipitous point be discover where i might safely venture to the bottom and then select some feasible portion of the opposite wall reascend with the same slow caution massive flat-topped spur alternate with the gorge plunge abruptly from the shoulder of the snowy peak and plant they foot in the warm desert these be everywhere marked and adorn with characteristic sculpture of the ancient glacier that sweep over this entire region like one vast ice-wind and the polished surface produce by the ponderous flood be still so perfectly preserve that in many place the sunlight reflect from they be about as try to the eye as sheet of snow god 's glacial-mill grind slowly but they have be keep in motion long enough in californium to grind sufficient soil for a glorious abundance of life though most of the grist have be carry to the lowland leave these high region comparatively lean and bare while the post-glacial agent of erosion have not yet furnished sufficient available food over the general surface for more than a few tuft of the hardiest plant chiefly carice and eriogona and it be interesting to learn in this connection that the sparseness and repress character of the vegetation at this height be cause more by want of soil than by harshness of climate for here and there in sheltered hollow -lrb- countersunk beneath the general surface -rrb- into which a few rod of well-ground moraine chip have be dump we find grove of spruce and pine thirty to forty foot high trim around the edge with willow and huckleberry bush and oftentimes still further by a outer ring of tall grass bright with lupine larkspur and showy columbine suggest a climate by no means repressingly severe all the stream too and the pool at this elevation be furnish with little garden wherever soil can be make to lie which though make scarce any show at a distance constitute charming surprise to the appreciative observer in these bit of leanness a few bird find grateful home have no acquaintance with man they fear no ill and flock curiously about the stranger almost allow themselves to be take in the hand in so wild and so beautiful a region be spend my first day every sight and sound inspiring lead one far out of himself yet feed and build up he individuality now come the solemn silent evening long blue spiky shadow creep out across the snow-field while a rosy glow at first scarce discernible gradually deepen and suffuse every mountain-top flush the glacier and the harsh crag above they this be the alpenglow to I one of the most impressive of all the terrestrial manifestation of god at the touch of this divine light the mountain seem to kindle to a rapt religious consciousness and stand hushed and wait like devout worshiper just before the alpenglow begin to fade two crimson cloud come streaming across the summit like wing of flame render the sublime scene yet more impressive then come darkness and the star icy ritter be still mile away but i could proceed no farther that night i find a good campground on the rim of a glacier basin about 11000 foot above the sea a small lake nestle in the bottom of it from which i get water for my tea and a storm-beaten thicket near by furnished abundance of resiny fire-wood somber peak hack and shatter circle half-way around the horizon wear a savage aspect in the gloaming and a waterfall chant solemnly across the lake on its way down from the foot of a glacier the fall and the lake and the glacier be almost equally bare while the scraggy pine anchor in the rock-fissure be so dwarf and shear by storm-wind that you might walk over they top in tone and aspect the scene be one of the most desolate i ever behold but the darkest scripture of the mountain be illumine with bright passage of love that never fail to make themselves feel when one be alone i make my bed in a nook of the pine-thicket where the branch be press and crinkled overhead like a roof and bent down around the side these be the best bedchamber the high mountain afford -- snug as squirrel-nest well ventilate full of spicy odor and with plenty of wind-played needle to sing one asleep i little expected company but creep in through a low side-door i find five or six bird nestle among the tassel the night-wind begin to blow soon after dark at first only a gentle breathing but increase toward midnight to a rough gale that fall upon my leafy roof in ragged surge like a cascade bearing wild sound from the crag overhead the waterfall sing in chorus fill the old ice-fountain with its solemn roar and seem to increase in power as the night advance -- fit voice for such a landscape i have to creep out many time to the fire during the night for it be bite cold and i have no blanket gladly i welcome the morning star the dawn in the dry waver air of the desert be glorious everything encourage my undertaking and betoken success there be no cloud in the sky no storm-tone in the wind breakfast of bread and tea be soon make i fasten a hard durable crust to my belt by way of provision in case i should be compel to pass a night on the mountain-top then secure the remainder of my little stock against wolf and wood-rat i set forth free and hopeful how glorious a greet the sun give the mountain to behold this alone be worth the pain of any excursion a thousand time over the highest peak burn like island in a sea of liquid shade then the lower peak and spire catch the glow and long lance of light streaming through many a notch and pass fall thick on the frozen meadow the majestic form of ritter be full in sight and i push rapidly on over round rock-boss and pavement my iron-shod shoe make a clank sound suddenly hush now and then in rug of bryanthus and sedgy lake-margin soft as moss here too in this so-called land of desolation i meet cassiope grow in fringe among the battered rock she blossom have fade long ago but they be still cling with happy memory to the evergreen spray and still so beautiful as to thrill every fiber of one 's be winter and summer you may hear she voice the low sweet melody of she purple bell no evangel among all the mountain plant speak nature 's love more plainly than cassiope where she dwell the redemption of the coldest solitude be complete the very rock and glacier seem to feel she presence and become imbue with she own fountain sweetness all thing be warm and awaken frozen rill begin to flow the marmot come out of they nest in boulder-pile and climb sunny rock to bask and the dun-headed sparrow be flit about seek they breakfast the lake see from every ridge-top be brilliantly rippled and spangled shimmering like the thicket of the low dwarf pine the rock too seem responsive to the vital heat -- rock-crystal and snow-crystal thrilling alike i stride on exhilarate as if never more to feel fatigue limb move of themselves every sense unfold like the thaw flower to take part in the new day harmony all along my course thus far except when down in the cañons the landscape be mostly open to I and expansive at least on one side on the leave be the purple plain of mono repose dreamily and warm on the right the near peak spring keenly into the thin sky with more and more impressive sublimity but these larger view be at length lose rugged spur and moraine and huge project buttress begin to shut I in every feature become more rigidly alpine without however produce any chilling effect for go to the mountain be like go home we always find that the strangest object in these fountain wild be in some degree familiar and we look upon they with a vague sense of have see they before on the southern shore of a frozen lake i encounter a extensive field of hard granular snow up which i scamper in fine tone intend to follow it to its head and cross the rocky spur against which it lean hope thus to come direct upon the base of the main ritter peak the surface be pit with oval hollow make by stone and drift pine-needle that have melt themselves into the mass by the radiation of absorb sun-heat these afford good foothold but the surface curve more and more steeply at the head and the pit become shallower and less abundant until i find myself in danger of be shed off like avalanch snow i persist however creep on all fours and shuffling up the smoothest place on my back as i have often do on burnish granite until after slip several time i be compel to retrace my course to the bottom and make my way around the west end of the lake and thence up to the summit of the divide between the head water of rush creek and the northernmost tributary of the san joaquin arrive on the summit of this divide crest one of the most exciting piece of pure wilderness be disclose that i ever discover in all my mountaineering there immediately in front loom the majestic mass of mount ritter with a glacier swoop down its face nearly to my foot then curve westward and pour its frozen flood into a dark blue lake whose shore be bind with precipice of crystalline snow while a deep chasm draw between the divide and the glacier separate the massive picture from everything else i could see only the one sublime mountain the one glacier the one lake the whole veil with one blue shadow -- rock ice and water close together without a single leaf or sign of life after gaze spellbound i begin instinctively to scrutinize every notch and gorge and weathered buttress of the mountain with reference to make the ascent the entire front above the glacier appear as one tremendous precipice slightly recede at the top and bristle with spire and pinnacle set above one another in formidable array massive lichen-stained battlements stand forward here and there hack at the top with angular notch and separate by frosty gully and recess that have be veil in shadow ever since they creation while to right and leave as far as i could see be huge crumble buttress offer no hope to the climber the head of the glacier send up a few finger-like branch through narrow _ couloir _ but these seem too steep and short to be available especially as i have no ax with which to cut step and the numerous narrow-throated gully down which stone and snow be avalanch seem hopelessly steep besides be interrupt by vertical cliff while the whole front be render still more terribly forbid by the chill shadow and the gloomy blackness of the rock descend the divide in a hesitate mood i pick my way across the yawning chasm at the foot and climb out upon the glacier there be no meadow now to cheer with they brave color nor could i hear the dun-headed sparrow whose cheery note so often relieve the silence of we highest mountain the only sound be the gurgling of small rill down in the vein and crevasse of the glacier and now and then the rattle report of fall stone with the echo they shoot out into the crisp air i could not distinctly hope to reach the summit from this side yet i move on across the glacier as if drive by fate contend with myself the season be too far spend i say and even should i be successful i might be storm-bound on the mountain and in the cloud-darkness with the cliff and crevasse cover with snow how could i escape no i must wait till next summer i would only approach the mountain now and inspect it creep about its flank learn what i could of its history hold myself ready to flee on the approach of the first storm-cloud but we little know until try how much of the uncontrollable there be in we urge across glacier and torrent and up dangerous height let the judgment forbid as it may i succeed in gain the foot of the cliff on the eastern extremity of the glacier and there discover the mouth of a narrow avalanche gully through which i begin to climb intend to follow it as far as possible and at least obtain some fine wild view for my pain its general course be oblique to the plane of the mountain-face and the metamorphic slate of which the mountain be build be cut by cleavage plane in such a way that they weather off in angular block give rise to irregular step that greatly facilitate climb on the sheer place i thus make my way into a wilderness of crumble spire and battlements build together in bewildering combination and glaze in many place with a thin coating of ice which i have to hammer off with stone the situation be become gradually more perilous but have pass several dangerous spot i dare not think of descend for so steep be the entire ascent one would inevitably fall to the glacier in case a single misstep be make know therefore the try danger beneath i become all the more anxious concern the development to be make above and begin to be conscious of a vague foreboding of what actually befall not that i be give to fear but rather because my instinct usually so positive and true seem vitiate in some way and be lead I astray at length after attain a elevation of about 12800 foot i find myself at the foot of a sheer drop in the bed of the avalanche channel i be trace which seem absolutely to bar further progress it be only about forty-five or fifty foot high and somewhat roughen by fissure and projection but these seem so slight and insecure as foothold that i try hard to avoid the precipice altogether by scale the wall of the channel on either side but though less steep the wall be smoother than the obstruct rock and repeat effort only show that i must either go right ahead or turn back the try danger beneath seem even greater than that of the cliff in front therefore after scan its face again and again i begin to scale it pick my hold with intense caution after gain a point about halfway to the top i be suddenly bring to a dead stop with arm outspread cling close to the face of the rock unable to move hand or foot either up or down my doom appear fixed i _ must _ fall there would be a moment of bewilderment and then a lifeless rumble down the one general precipice to the glacier below when this final danger flash upon I i become nerve-shaken for the first time since set foot on the mountain and my mind seem to fill with a stifle smoke but this terrible eclipse last only a moment when life blaze forth again with preternatural clearness i seem suddenly to become possess of a new sense the other self bygone experience instinct or guardian angel -- call it what you will -- come forward and assume control then my tremble muscle become firm again every rift and flaw in the rock be see as through a microscope and my limb move with a positiveness and precision with which i seem to have nothing at all to do have i be bear aloft upon wing my deliverance could not have be more complete above this memorable spot the face of the mountain be still more savagely hack and tear it be a maze of yawning chasm and gully in the angle of which rise beetle crag and pile of detach boulder that seem to have be get ready to be launch below but the strange influx of strength i have receive seem inexhaustible i find a way without effort and soon stand upon the topmost crag in the bless light how truly glorious the landscape circle around this noble summit -- giant mountain valley innumerable glacier and meadow river and lake with the wide blue sky bent tenderly over they all but in my first hour of freedom from that terrible shadow the sunlight in which i be lave seem all in all look southward along the axis of the range the eye be first catch by a row of exceedingly sharp and slender spire which rise openly to a height of about a thousand foot above a series of short residual glacier that lean back against they basis they fantastic sculpture and the unrelieved sharpness with which they spring out of the ice render they peculiarly wild and striking these be the minaret beyond they you behold a sublime wilderness of mountain they snowy summit tower together in crowded abundance peak beyond peak swell higher higher as they sweep on southward until the culminate point of the range be reach on mount whitney near the head of the kern river at a elevation of nearly 14700 foot above the level of the sea westward the general flank of the range be see flow sublimely away from the sharp summit in smooth undulation a sea of huge gray granite wave dot with lake and meadow and flute with stupendous cañons that grow steadily deeper as they recede in the distance below this gray region lie the dark forest zone break here and there by upswell ridge and dome and yet beyond lie a yellow hazy belt mark the broad plain of the san joaquin bound on its farther side by the blue mountain of the coast turn now to the northward there in the immediate foreground be the glorious sierra crown with cathedral peak a temple of marvelous architecture a few degree to the left of it the gray massive form of mammoth mountain to the right while mount ord gibb dana conness tower peak castle peak silver mountain and a host of noble companion as yet nameless make a sublime show along the axis of the range eastward the whole region seem a land of desolation cover with beautiful light the torrid volcanic basin of mono with its one bare lake fourteen mile long owen 's valley and the broad lava table-land at its head dot with crater and the massive inyo range rival even the sierra in height these be spread map-like beneath you with countless range beyond pass and overlap one another and fading on the glowing horizon -lrb- illustration : map of the yosemite valley -rrb- at a distance of less than 3000 foot below the summit of mount ritter you may find tributary of the san joaquin and owen 's river burst forth from the ice and snow of the glacier that load its flank while a little to the north of here be find the highest affluent of the tuolumne and merce thus the fountain of four of the principal river of californium be within a radius of four or five mile lake be see gleam in all sort of place -- round or oval or square like very mirror other narrow and sinuous draw close around the peak like silver zone the highest reflect only rock snow and the sky but neither these nor the glacier nor the bit of brown meadow and moorland that occur here and there be large enough to make any marked impression upon the mighty wilderness of mountain the eye rejoice in its freedom rove about the vast expanse yet return again and again to the fountain peak perhaps some one of the multitude excite special attention some gigantic castle with turret and battlement or some gothic cathedral more abundantly spired than milan 's but generally when look for the first time from a all-embracing standpoint like this the inexperienced observer be oppress by the incomprehensible grandeur variety and abundance of the mountain rise shoulder to shoulder beyond the reach of vision and it be only after they have be study one by one long and lovingly that they far-reaching harmony become manifest then penetrate the wilderness where you may the main tell feature to which all the surround topography be subordinate be quickly perceive and the most complicated cluster of peak stand reveal harmoniously correlate and fashion like work of art -- eloquent monument of the ancient ice-river that bring they into relief from the general mass of the range the cañons too some of they a mile deep maze wildly through the mighty host of mountain however lawless and ungovernable at first sight they appear be at length recognize as the necessary effect of cause which follow each other in harmonious sequence -- nature 's poem carve on table of stone -- the simplest and most emphatic of she glacial composition could we have be here to observe during the glacial period we should have overlook a wrinkled ocean of ice as continuous as that now cover the landscape of greenland fill every valley and cañon with only the top of the fountain peak rise darkly above the rock-encumbered ice-wave like islet in a stormy sea -- those islet the only hint of the glorious landscape now smile in the sun standing here in the deep brooding silence all the wilderness seem motionless as if the work of creation be do but in the midst of this outer steadfastness we know there be incessant motion and change ever and anon avalanche be fall from yonder peak these cliff-bound glacier seemingly wedge and immovable be flow like water and grind the rock beneath they the lake be lap they granite shore and wear they away and every one of these rill and young river be fret the air into music and carry the mountain to the plain here be the root of all the life of the valley and here more simply than elsewhere be the eternal flux of nature manifest ice change to water lake to meadow and mountain to plain and while we thus contemplate nature 's method of landscape creation and read the record she have carve on the rock reconstruct however imperfectly the landscape of the past we also learn that as these we now behold have succeed those of the pre-glacial age so they in turn be wither and vanish to be succeed by other yet unborn but in the midst of these fine lesson and landscape i have to remember that the sun be wheeling far to the west while a new way down the mountain have to be discover to some point on the timber line where i could have a fire for i have not even burden myself with a coat i first scan the western spur hope some way might appear through which i might reach the northern glacier and cross its snout or pass around the lake into which it flow and thus strike my morning track this route be soon sufficiently unfold to show that if practicable at all it would require so much time that reach camp that night would be out of the question i therefore scramble back eastward descend the southern slope obliquely at the same time here the crag seem less formidable and the head of a glacier that flow northeast come in sight which i determine to follow as far as possible hope thus to make my way to the foot of the peak on the east side and thence across the intervene cañons and ridge to camp the inclination of the glacier be quite moderate at the head and as the sun have soften the _ névé _ i make safe and rapid progress run and slide and keep up a sharp outlook for crevasse about half a mile from the head there be a ice-cascade where the glacier pour over a sharp declivity and be shatter into massive block separate by deep blue fissure to thread my way through the slippery maze of this crevassed portion seem impossible and i endeavor to avoid it by climb off to the shoulder of the mountain but the slope rapidly steepen and at length fall away in sheer precipice compelling a return to the ice fortunately the day have be warm enough to loosen the ice-crystal so as to admit of hollow be dig in the rotten portion of the block thus enable I to pick my way with far less difficulty than i have anticipate continue down over the snout and along the left lateral moraine be only a confident saunter show that the ascent of the mountain by way of this glacier be easy provide one be arm with a ax to cut step here and there the lower end of the glacier be beautifully wave and bar by the outcropping edge of the bed ice-layer which represent the annual snowfall and to some extent the irregularity of structure cause by the weathering of the wall of crevasse and by separate snowfall which have be follow by rain hail thawing and freezing etc small rill be glide and swirl over the melting surface with a smooth oily appearance in channel of pure ice -- they quick compliant movement contrast most impressively with the rigid invisible flow of the glacier itself on whose back they all be ride night draw near before i reach the eastern base of the mountain and my camp lay many a rugged mile to the north but ultimate success be assure it be now only a matter of endurance and ordinary mountain-craft the sunset be if possible yet more beautiful than that of the day before the mono landscape seem to be fairly saturated with warm purple light the peak marshal along the summit be in shadow but through every notch and pass stream vivid sun-fire soothing and irradiate they rough black angle while company of small luminous cloud hover above they like very angel of light darkness come on but i find my way by the trend of the cañons and the peak project against the sky all excitement die with the light and then i be weary but the joyful sound of the waterfall across the lake be hear at last and soon the star be see reflect in the lake itself take my bearing from these i discover the little pine thicket in which my nest be and then i have a rest such as only a tired mountaineer may enjoy after lie loose and lose for awhile i make a sunrise fire go down to the lake dash water on my head and dip a cupful for tea the revival bring about by bread and tea be as complete as the exhaustion from excessive enjoyment and toil then i creep beneath the pine-tassel to bed the wind be frosty and the fire burn low but my sleep be none the less sound and the evening constellation have sweep far to the west before i awake after thaw and rest in the morning sunshine i sauntered home -- that be back to the tuolumne camp -- bear away toward a cluster of peak that hold the fountain snow of one of the north tributary of rush creek here i discover a group of beautiful glacier lake nestle together in a grand amphitheater toward evening i cross the divide separate the mono water from those of the tuolumne and enter the glacier basin that now hold the fountain snow of the stream that form the upper tuolumne cascade this stream i trace down through its many dell and gorge meadow and bog reach the brink of the main tuolumne at dusk a loud whoop for the artist be answer again and again they camp-fire come in sight and half a hour afterward i be with they they seem unreasonably glad to see I i have be absent only three day nevertheless though the weather be fine they have already be weigh chance as to whether i would ever return and try to decide whether they should wait longer or begin to seek they way back to the lowland now they curious trouble be over they pack they precious sketch and next morning we set out homeward bind and in two day enter the yosemite valley from the north by way of indian cañon chapter v the pass the sustained grandeur of the high sierra be strikingly illustrate by the great height of the pass between latitude 36 ° 20 ' and 38 ° the lowest pass gap gorge or notch of any kind cut across the axis of the range as far as i have discover exceed 9000 foot in height above the level of the sea while the average height of all that be in use either by indian or whites be perhaps not less than 11000 foot and not one of these be a carriage-pass farther north a carriage-road have be construct through what be know as the sonora pass on the head water of the stanislaus and walker 's river the summit of which be about 10000 foot above the sea substantial wagon-road have also be build through the carson and johnson pass near the head of lake tahoe over which immense quantity of freight be haul from californium to the mining region of nevada before the construction of the central pacific railroad still farther north a considerable number of comparatively low pass occur some of which be accessible to wheel vehicle and through these rugged defile during the exciting year of the gold period long emigrant-train with foot-sore cattle wearily toil after the toil-worn adventurer have escape a thousand danger and have crawl thousand of mile across the plain the snowy sierra at last loom in sight the eastern wall of the land of gold and as with shaded eye they gaze through the tremulous haze of the desert with what joy must they have descry the pass through which they be to enter the better land of they hope and dream between the sonora pass and the southern extremity of the high sierra a distance of nearly 160 mile there be only five pass through which trail conduct from one side of the range to the other these be barely practicable for animal a pass in these region mean simply any notch or cañon through which one may by the exercise of unlimited patience make out to lead a mule or a sure-footed mustang animal that can slide or jump as well as walk only three of the five pass may be say to be in use viz : the kearsarge mono and virginium creek the track lead through the other be only obscure indian trail not grade in the least and scarcely traceable by white man for much of the way be over solid rock and earthquake avalanche talus where the unshod pony of the indian leave no appreciable sign only skilled mountaineer be able to detect the mark that serve to guide the indian such as slight abrasion of the looser rock the displacement of stone here and there and bent bush and weed a general knowledge of the topography be then the main guide enable one to determine where the trail ought to go -- _ must _ go one of these indian trail cross the range by a nameless pass between the head water of the south and middle fork of the san joaquin the other between the north and middle fork of the same river just to the south of the minaret this last be about 9000 foot high be the lowest of the five the kearsarge be the highest cross the summit near the head of the south fork of king 's river about eight mile to the north of mount tyndall through the midst of the most stupendous rock-scenery the summit of this pass be over 12000 foot above sea-level nevertheless it be one of the safest of the five and be use every summer from July to October or November by hunter prospector and stock-owner and to some extent by enterprising pleasure-seeker also for besides the surpass grandeur of the scenery about the summit the trail in ascend the western flank of the range conduct through a grove of the giant sequoia and through the magnificent yosemite valley of the south fork of king 's river this be perhaps the highest travel pass on the north american continent -lrb- illustration : map of the yosemite valley show present reservation boundary -rrb- the mono pass lie to the east of yosemite valley at the head of one of the tributary of the south fork of the tuolumne this be the best know and most extensively travel of all that exist in the high sierra a trail be make through it about the time of the mono gold excitement in the year 1858 by adventurous miner and prospector -- man who would build a trail down the throat of darkest erebus on the way to gold though more than a thousand foot lower than the kearsarge it be scarcely less sublime in rock-scenery while in snowy fall water it far surpass it be so favorably situate for the stream of yosemite travel the more adventurous tourist cross over through this glorious gateway to the volcanic region around mono lake it have therefore gain a name and fame above every other pass in the range accord to the few barometrical observation make upon it its highest point be 10765 foot above the sea the other pass of the five we have be consider be somewhat lower and cross the axis of the range a few mile to the north of the mono pass at the head of the southernmost tributary of walker 's river it be use chiefly by roam band of the pah ute indian and sheepman but leave wheel and animal out of the question the free mountaineer with a sack of bread on he shoulder and a ax to cut step in ice and frozen snow can make he way across the range almost everywhere and at any time of year when the weather be calm to he nearly every notch between the peak be a pass though much patient step-cutting be at time require up and down steeply inclined glacier with cautious climb over precipice that at first sight would seem hopelessly inaccessible in pursue my study i have cross from side to side of the range at interval of a few mile all along the highest portion of the chain with far less real danger than one would naturally count on and what fine wildness be thus reveal -- storm and avalanche lake and waterfall garden and meadow and interesting animal -- only those will ever know who give the freest and most buoyant portion of they life to climb and see for themselves to the timid traveler fresh from the sedimentary level of the lowland these highway however picturesque and grand seem terribly forbid -- cold dead gloomy gash in the bone of the mountain and of all nature 's way the one to be most cautiously avoid yet they be full of the finest and most telling example of nature 's love and though hard to travel none be safer for they lead through region that lie far above the ordinary haunt of the devil and of the pestilence that walk in darkness true there be innumerable place where the careless step will be the last step and a rock fall from the cliff may crush without warn like lightning from the sky but what then accident in the mountain be less common than in the lowland and these mountain mansion be decent delightful even divine place to die in compare with the doleful chamber of civilization few place in this world be more dangerous than home fear not therefore to try the mountain-pass they will kill care save you from deadly apathy set you free and call forth every faculty into vigorous enthusiastic action even the sick should try these so-called dangerous pass because for every unfortunate they kill they cure a thousand all the pass make they steepest ascent on the eastern flank on this side the average rise be not far from a thousand foot to the mile while on the west it be about two hundred foot another marked difference between the eastern and western portion of the pass be that the former begin at the very foot of the range while the latter can hardly be say to begin lower than a elevation of from seven to ten thousand foot approach the range from the gray level of mono and owen 's valley on the east the traveler see before he the steep short pass in full view fence in by rugged spur that come plunge down from the shoulder of the peak on either side the course of the more direct be disclose from top to bottom without interruption but from the west one see nothing of the way he may be seek until near the summit after day have be spend in thread the forest grow on the main divide ridge between the river cañons it be interesting to observe how surely the alp-crossing animal of every kind fall into the same trail the more rugged and inaccessible the general character of the topography of any particular region the more surely will the trail of white man indian bear wild sheep etc be find converge into the best pass the indian of the western slope venture cautiously over the pass in settle weather to attend dance and obtain load of pine-nut and the larva of a small fly that breed in mono and owen 's lake which when dry form a important article of food while the pah ute cross over from the east to hunt the deer and obtain supplies of acorn and it be truly astonishing to see what immense load the haggard old squaw make out to carry bare-footed through these rough pass oftentimes for a distance of sixty or seventy mile they be always accompany by the man who stride on unburdened and erect a little in advance kindly stoop at difficult place to pile stepping-stone for they patient pack-animal wife just as they would prepare the way for they pony bear evince great sagacity as mountaineer but although they be tireless and enterprising traveler they seldom cross the range i have several time track they through the mono pass but only in late year after cattle and sheep have pass that way when they doubtless be follow to feed on the straggler and on those that have be kill by fall over the rock even the wild sheep the best mountaineer of all choose regular pass in make journey across the summit deer seldom cross the range in either direction i have never yet observe a single specimen of the mule-deer of the great basin west of the summit and rarely one of the black-tailed species on the eastern slope notwithstanding many of the latter ascend the range nearly to the summit every summer to feed in the wild garden and bring forth they young the glacier be the pass-maker and it be by they that the course of all mountaineer be predestine without exception every pass in the sierra be create by they without the slightest aid or predetermine guidance from any of the cataclysmic agent i have see elaborate statement of the amount of drilling and blast accomplish in the construction of the railroad across the sierra above donner lake but for every pound of rock move in this way the glacier which descend east and west through this same pass crushed and carry away more than a hundred ton the so-called practicable road-pass be simply those portion of the range more degrade by glacial action than the adjacent portion and degrade in such a way as to leave the summit round instead of sharp while the peak from the superior strength and hardness of they rock or from more favorable position have suffer less degradation be leave tower above the pass as if they have be heave into the sky by some force act from beneath the scenery of all the pass especially at the head be of the wildest and grandest description -- lofty peak mass together and laden around they basis with ice and snow chain of glacier lake cascade stream in endless variety with glorious view westward over a sea of rock and wood and eastward over strange ashy plain volcano and the dry dead-looking range of the great basin every pass however possess treasure of beauty all its own have thus in a general way indicate the height lead feature and distribution of the principal pass i will now endeavor to describe the mono pass in particular which may i think be regard as a fair example of the higher alpine pass in general the main portion of the mono pass be form by bloody cañon which begin at the summit of the range and run in a general east-northeasterly direction to the edge of the mono plain the first white man who force a way through its somber depths be as we have see eager gold-seeker but the cañon be know and travel as a pass by the indian and mountain animal long before its discovery by white man as be show by the numerous tributary trail which come into it from every direction its name accord well with the character of the early time in californium and may perhaps have be suggest by the predominant color of the metamorphic slate in which it be in great part erode or more probably by blood-stain make by the unfortunate animal which be compel to slip and shuffle awkwardly over its rough cut rock i have never know a animal either mule or horse to make its way through the cañon either in go up or down without lose more or less blood from wound on the leg occasionally one be kill outright -- fall headlong and roll over precipice like a boulder but such accident be rarer than from the terrible appearance of the trail one would be lead to expect the more experienced when drive loose find they way over the dangerous place with a caution and sagacity that be truly wonderful during the gold excitement it be at time a matter of considerable pecuniary importance to force a way through the cañon with pack-train early in the spring while it be yet heavily block with snow and then the mule with they load have sometimes to be let down over the steepest drift and avalanche bed by means of rope a good bridle-path lead from yosemite through many a grove and meadow up to the head of the cañon a distance of about thirty mile here the scenery undergo a sudden and startling condensation mountain red gray and black rise close at hand on the right whiten around they basis with bank of endure snow on the left swell the huge red mass of mount gibb while in front the eye wander down the shadowy cañon and out on the warm plain of mono where the lake be see gleam like a burnish metallic disk with cluster of lofty volcanic cone to the south of it when at length we enter the mountain gateway the somber rock seem aware of we presence and seem to come throng closer about we happily the ouzel and the old familiar robin be here to sing we welcome and azure daisy beam with trustfulness and sympathy enable we to feel something of nature 's love even here beneath the gaze of she coldest rock the effect of this expressive outspokenness on the part of the cañon-rock be greatly enhance by the quiet aspect of the alpine meadow through which we pass just before enter the narrow gateway the forest in which they lie and the mountain-top rise beyond they seem quiet and tranquil we catch they restful spirit yield to the soothing influence of the sunshine and saunter dreamily on through flower and bee scarce touch by a definite thought then suddenly we find ourselves in the shadowy cañon closet with nature in one of she wildest stronghold after the first bewildering impression begin to wear off we perceive that it be not altogether terrible for besides the reassuring bird and flower we discover a chain of shine lakelet hang down from the very summit of the pass and link together by a silvery stream the highest be set in bleak rough bowl scantily fringe with brown and yellow sedge winter storm blow snow through the cañon in blind drift and avalanche shoot from the height then be these sparkling tarn fill and bury leave not a hint of they existence in June and July they begin to blink and thaw out like sleepy eye the carice thrust up they short brown spike the daisy bloom in turn and the most profoundly bury of they all be at length warm and summer as if winter be only a dream red lake be the lowest of the chain and also the largest it seem rather dull and forbid at first sight lie motionless in its deep dark bed the cañon wall rise sheer from the water 's edge on the south but on the opposite side there be sufficient space and sunshine for a sedgy daisy garden the center of which be brilliantly light with lily castilleia larkspur and columbine sheltered from the wind by leafy willow and form a most joyful outburst of plant-life keenly emphasize by the chill baldness of the onlooking cliff after indulge here in a doze shimmering lake-rest the happy stream set forth again warble and trill like a ouzel ever delightfully confide no matter how dark the way leap glide hither thither clear or foam : manifest the beauty of its wildness in every sound and gesture one of its most beautiful development be the diamond cascade situate a short distance below red lake here the tense crystalline water be first dash into coarse granular spray mix with dusty foam and then divide into a diamond pattern by follow the diagonal cleavage-joint that intersect the face of the precipice over which it pour view in front it resemble a strip of embroidery of definite pattern vary through the season with the temperature and the volume of water scarce a flower may be see along its snowy border a few bent pine look on from a distance and small fringe of cassiope and rock-fern be grow in fissure near the head but these be so lowly and undemonstrative that only the attentive observer will be likely to notice they on the north wall of the cañon a little below the diamond cascade a glittering side stream make its appearance seem to leap directly out of the sky it first resemble a crinkled ribbon of silver hang loosely down the wall but grow wider as it descend and dash the dull rock with foam a long rough talus curve up against this part of the cliff overgrow with snow-pressed willow in which the fall disappear with many a eager surge and swirl and plashing leap finally beat its way down to its confluence with the main cañon stream below this point the climate be no longer arctic butterfly become larger and more abundant grass with impose spread of panicle wave above you shoulder and the summery drone of the bumblebee thicken the air the dwarf pine the tree-mountaineer that climb highest and brave the coldest blast be find scatter in storm-beaten clump from the summit of the pass about half-way down the cañon here it be succeed by the hardy two-leaved pine which be speedily join by the taller yellow and mountain pine these with the burly juniper and shimmering aspen rapidly grow larger as the sunshine become richer form grove that block the view or they stand more apart here and there in picturesque group that make beautiful and obvious harmony with the rock and with one another bloom underbrush become abundant -- azalea spiraea and the brier-rose weave fringe for the stream and shaggy rug to relieve the stern unflinching rock-boss through this delightful wilderness cañon creek rove without any constrain channel throbbing and waver now in sunshine now in thoughtful shade fall swirl flash from side to side in weariless exuberance of energy a glorious milky way of cascade be thus develop of which bower cascade though one of the smallest be perhaps the most beautiful of they all it be situate in the lower region of the pass just where the sunshine begin to mellow between the cold and warm climate here the glad creek grow strong with tribute gather from many a snowy fountain on the height sing richer strain and become more human and lovable at every step now you may by its side find the rose and homely yarrow and small meadow full of bee and clover at the head of a low-browed rock luxuriant dogwood bush and willow arch over from bank to bank embower the stream with they leafy branch and droop plume keep in motion by the current fringe the brow of the cascade in front from this leafy covert the stream leap out into the light in a fluted curve thick sown with sparkling crystal and fall into a pool fill with brown boulder out of which it creep gray with foam-bell and disappear in a tangle of verdure like that from which it come hence to the foot of the cañon the metamorphic slate give place to granite whose nobler sculpture call forth expression of corresponding beauty from the stream in pass over it -- bright trill of rapid boom note of fall solemn hush of smooth-gliding sheet all chant and blend in glorious harmony when at length its impetuous alpine life be do it slip through a meadow with scarce a audible whisper and fall asleep in moraine lake this water-bed be one of the finest i ever see evergreen wave soothingly about it and the breath of flower float over it like incense here we bless stream rest from its rocky wanderings all its mountaineering do -- no more foam rock-leaping no more wild exult song it fall into a smooth glassy sleep stir only by the night-wind which come down the cañon make it croon and mutter in ripple along its broidered shore leave the lake it glide quietly through the rush destine never more to touch the living rock henceforth its path lie through ancient moraine and reach of ashy sage-plain which nowhere afford rock suitable for the development of cascade or sheer fall yet this beauty of maturity though less striking be of a still higher order entice we lovingly on through gentian meadow and grove of rustling aspen to lake mono where spirit-like we happy stream vanish in vapor and float free again in the sky bloody cañon like every other in the sierra be recently occupy by a glacier which derive its fountain snow from the adjacent summit and descend into mono lake at a time when its water stand at a much higher level than now the principal character in which the history of the ancient glacier be preserve be display here in marvelous freshness and simplicity furnish the student with extraordinary advantage for the acquisition of knowledge of this sort the most striking passage be polish and striated surface which in many place reflect the ray of the sun like smooth water the dam of red lake be a elegantly model rib of metamorphic slate bring into relief because of its superior strength and because of the greater intensity of the glacial erosion of the rock immediately above it cause by a steeply inclined tributary glacier which enter the main trunk with a heavy down-thrust at the head of the lake moraine lake furnish a equally interesting example of a basin form wholly or in part by a terminal moraine dam curve across the path of a stream between two lateral moraine at moraine lake the cañon proper terminate although apparently continue by the two lateral moraine of the vanish glacier these moraine be about 300 foot high and extend unbrokenly from the side of the cañon into the plain a distance of about five mile curve and taper in beautiful line they sunward side be garden they shady side be grove the former devoted chiefly to eriogonae compositae and graminae a square rod contain five or six profusely flowered eriogonum of several species about the same number of bahium and linosyri and a few grass tuft each species be plant trimly apart with bare gravel between as if cultivate artificially my first visit to bloody cañon be make in the summer of 1869 under circumstance well calculate to heighten the impression that be the peculiar offspring of mountain i come from the bloom tangle of florida and wade out into the plant-gold of the great valley of californium when its flora be as yet untrodden never before have i beheld congregation of social flower half so extensive or half so glorious golden composite cover all the ground from the coast range to the sierra like a stratum of curdled sunshine in which i revel for week watch the rise and set of they innumerable sun then i give myself up to be bear forward on the crest of the summer wave that sweep annually up the sierra and spend itself on the snowy summit at the big tuolumne meadow i remain more than a month sketch botanize and climb among the surround mountain the mountaineer with whom i then happen to be camp be one of those remarkable man one so frequently meet in californium the hard angle and boss of whose character have be bring into relief by the grind excitement of the gold period until they resemble glacial landscape but at this late day my friend 's activity have subside and he craving for rest cause he to become a gentle shepherd and literally to lie down with the lamb recognize the unsatisfiable longing of my scotch highland instinct he throw out some hint concern bloody cañon and advise I to explore it i have never see it myself he say for i never be so unfortunate as to pass that way but i have hear many a strange story about it and i warrant you will at least find it wild enough then of course i make haste to see it early next morning i make up a bundle of bread tie my note-book to my belt and stride away in the brace air full of eager indefinite hope the plushy lawn that lay in my path serve to soothe my morning haste the sod in many place be star with daisy and blue gentian over which i linger i trace the path of the ancient glacier over many a shine pavement and mark the gap in the upper forest that tell the power of the winter avalanche climb higher i saw for the first time the gradual dwarfing of the pine in compliance with climate and on the summit discover creep mat of the arctic willow overgrow with silky catkin and patch of the dwarf vaccinium with its round flower sprinkle in the grass like purple hail while in every direction the landscape stretch sublimely away in fresh wildness -- a manuscript write by the hand of nature alone at length as i enter the pass the huge rock begin to close around in all they wild mysterious impressiveness when suddenly as i be gaze eagerly about I a drive of gray hairy being come in sight lumber toward I with a kind of boneless wallow motion like bear i never turn back though often so inclined and in this particular instance amid such surroundings everything seem singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company suppress my fear i soon discover that although as hairy as bear and as crooked as summit pine the strange creature be sufficiently erect to belong to we own species they prove to be nothing more formidable than mono indians dress in the skin of sage-rabbit both the man and the woman beg persistently for whisky and tobacco and seem so accustomed to denial that i find it impossible to convince they that i have none to give except the name of these two product of civilization they seem to understand not a word of english but i afterward learn that they be on they way to yosemite valley to feast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorn to carry back through the pass to they hut on the shore of mono lake occasionally a good countenance may be see among the mono indians but these the first specimen i have see be mostly ugly and some of they altogether hideous the dirt on they face be fairly stratified and seem so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a geological significance the older face be moreover strangely blur and divide into section by furrow that look like the cleavage-joint of rock suggest exposure on the mountain in a castaway condition for age somehow they seem to have no right place in the landscape and i be glad to see they fading out of sight down the pass then come evening and the somber cliff be inspire with the ineffable beauty of the alpenglow a solemn calm fall upon everything all the lower portion of the cañon be in gloaming shadow and i creep into a hollow near one of the upper lakelet to smooth the ground in a sheltered nook for a bed when the short twilight fade i kindle a sunny fire make a cup of tea and lay down to rest and look at the star soon the night-wind begin to flow and pour in torrent among the jagged peak mingle strange tone with those of the waterfall sound far below and as i drift toward sleep i begin to experience a uncomfortable feeling of nearness to the furred mono then the full moon look down over the edge of the cañon wall she countenance seemingly fill with intense concern and apparently so near as to produce a startling effect as if she have enter my bedroom forget all the world to gaze on I alone the night be full of strange sound and i gladly welcome the morning breakfast be soon do and i set forth in the exhilarating freshness of the new day rejoice in the abundance of pure wildness so close about I the stupendous rock hack and scar with century of storm stand sharply out in the thin early light while down in the bottom of the cañon groove and polish boss heave and glisten like swell sea-waves tell a grand old story of the ancient glacier that pour its crush flood above they here for the first time i meet the arctic daisy in all they perfection of purity and spirituality -- gentle mountaineer face to face with the stormy sky keep safe and warm by a thousand miracle i leap lightly from rock to rock glory in the eternal freshness and sufficiency of nature and in the ineffable tenderness with which she nurture she mountain darling in the very fountain of storm fresh beauty appear at every step delicate rock-fern and group of the fairest flower now another lake come to view now a waterfall never fall light in brighter spangle never fall water in whiter foam i seem to float through the cañon enchanted feeling nothing of its roughness and be out in the mono level before i be aware look back from the shore of moraine lake my morning ramble seem all a dream there curve bloody cañon a mere glacial furrow 2000 foot deep with smooth rock project from the side and braid together in the middle like bulge swell muscle here the lily be higher than my head and the sunshine be warm enough for palm yet the snow around the arctic willow be plainly visible only four mile away and between be narrow specimen zone of all the principal climate of the globe on the bank of a small brook that come gurgle down the side of the left lateral moraine i find a camp-fire still burn which no doubt belong to the gray indian i have meet on the summit and i listen instinctively and move cautiously forward half expect to see some of they grim face peer out of the bush pass on toward the open plain i notice three well-defined terminal moraine curve gracefully across the cañon stream and join by long splice to the two noble lateral these mark the halting-place of the vanish glacier when it be retreat into its summit shadow on the breaking-up of the glacial winter five mile below the foot of moraine lake just where the lateral moraine lose themselves in the plain there be a field of wild rye grow in magnificent wave bunch six to eight foot high bear head from six to twelve inch long rub out some of the grain i find they about five eighth of a inch long dark-colored and sweet indian woman be gather it in basket bend down large handful beat it out and fan it in the wind they be quite picturesque come through the rye as one catch glimpse of they here and there in wind lane and opening with splendid tuft arch above they head while they incessant chat and laughter show they heedless joy like the rye-field i find the so-called desert of mono bloom in a high state of natural cultivation with the wild rise cherry aster and the delicate abronium also innumerable gilia phlox poppy and bush-compositae i observe they gesture and the various expression of they corolla inquire how they could be so fresh and beautiful out in this volcanic desert they tell as happy a life as any plant-company i ever meet and seem to enjoy even the hot sand and the wind but the vegetation of the pass have be in great part destroy and the same may be say of all the more accessible pass throughout the range immense number of starve sheep and cattle have be drive through they into nevada trample the wild garden and meadow almost out of existence the lofty wall be untouched by any foot and the fall sing on unchanged but the sight of crushed flower and strip bitten bush go far toward destroy the charm of wildness the cañon should be see in winter a good strong traveler who know the way and the weather might easily make a safe excursion through it from yosemite valley on snow-shoe during some tranquil time when the storm be hush the lake and fall would be bury then but so also would be the trace of destructive foot while the view of the mountain in they winter garb and the ride at lightning speed down the pass between the snowy wall would be truly glorious -lrb- illustration : view of the mono plain from the foot of bloody cañon -rrb- chapter vi the glacier lake among the many unlooked-for treasure that be bind up and hide away in the depths of sierra solitude none more surely charm and surprise all kind of traveler than the glacier lake the forest and the glacier and the snowy fountain of the stream advertise they wealth in a more or less telling manner even in the distance but nothing be see of the lake until we have climb above they all the upper branch of the river be fairly laden with lake like orchard tree with fruit they lie embosome in the deep wood down in the grovy bottom of cañons high on bald tableland and around the foot of the icy peak mirroring back they wild beauty over and over again some conception of they lavish abundance may be make from the fact that from one standpoint on the summit of red mountain a day 's journey to the east of yosemite valley no fewer than forty-two be display within a radius of ten mile the whole number in the sierra can hardly be less than fifteen hundred not count the smaller pool and tarn which be innumerable perhaps two third or more lie on the western flank of the range and all be restricted to the alpine and subalpine region at the close of the last glacial period the middle and foot-hill region also abound in lake all of which have long since vanish as completely as the magnificent ancient glacier that bring they into existence though the eastern flank of the range be excessively steep we find lake pretty regularly distribute throughout even the most precipitous portion they be mostly find in the upper branch of the cañons and in the glacial amphitheater around the peak occasionally long narrow specimen occur upon the steep side of divide ridge they basin swing lengthwise like hammock and very rarely one be find lie so exactly on the summit of the range at the head of some pass that its water be discharge down both flank when the snow be melting fast but however situate they soon cease to form surprise to the studious mountaineer for like all the love-work of nature they be harmoniously related to one another and to all the other feature of the mountain it be easy therefore to find the bright lake-eye in the roughest and most ungovernable-looking topography of any landscape countenance even in the lower region where they have be close for many a century they rocky orbit be still discernible fill in with the detritus of flood and avalanche a beautiful system of group in correspondence with the glacial fountain be soon perceive also they extension in the direction of the trend of the ancient glacier and in general they dependence as to form size and position upon the character of the rock in which they basin have be erode and the quantity and direction of application of the glacial force expend upon each basin in the upper cañons we usually find they in pretty regular succession string together like bead on the bright ribbon of they feeding-stream which pour white and gray with foam and spray from one to the other they perfect mirror stillness make impressive contrast with the grand blare and glare of the connect cataract in lake hollow on the north side of the hoffman spur immediately above the great tuolumne cañon there be ten lovely lakelet lie near together in one general hollow like egg in a nest see from above in a general view feathered with hemlock spruce and fringe with sedge they seem to I the most singularly beautiful and interestingly located lake-cluster i have ever yet discover lake tahoe 22 mile long by about 10 wide and from 500 to over 1600 foot in depth be the largest of all the sierra lake it lie just beyond the northern limit of the higher portion of the range between the main axis and a spur that put out on the east side from near the head of the carson river its forested shore go curve in and out around many a emerald bay and pine-crowned promontory and its water be everywhere as keenly pure as any to be find among the highest mountain donner lake render memorable by the terrible fate of the donner party be about three mile long and lie about ten mile to the north of tahoe at the head of one of the tributary of the truckee a few mile farther north lie lake independence about the same size as donner but far the greater number of the lake lie much higher and be quite small few of they exceed a mile in length most of they less than half a mile along the lower edge of the lake-belt the smallest have disappear by the filling-in of they basin leave only those of considerable size but all along the upper freshly glaciated margin of the lake-bearing zone every hollow however small lie within reach of any portion of the close network of stream contain a bright brim pool so that the landscape view from the mountain-top seem to be sown broadcast with they many of the larger lake be encircle with smaller one like central gem girdle with sparkling brilliant in general however there be no marked divide line as to size in order therefore to prevent confusion i would state here that in give number i include none less than 500 yard in circumference in the basin of the merce river i count 131 of which 111 be upon the tributary that fall so grandly into yosemite valley pohono creek which form the fall of that name take its rise in a beautiful lake lie beneath the shadow of a lofty granite spur that put out from buena vista peak this be now the only lake leave in the whole pohono basin the illilouette have sixteen the nevada no fewer than sixty-seven the tenaya eight hoffmann creek five and yosemite creek fourteen there be but two other lake-bearing affluent of the merce viz the south fork with fifteen and cascade creek with five both of which unite with the main trunk below yosemite -lrb- illustration : lake tenaya one of the yosemite fountain -rrb- the merce river as a whole be remarkably like a elm-tree and it require but little effort on the part of the imagination to picture it stand upright with all its lake hang upon its spreading branch the topmost eighty mile in height now add all the other lake-bearing river of the sierra each in its place and you will have a truly glorious spectacle -- a avenue the length and width of the range the long slender gray shaft of the main trunk the milky way of arch branch and the silvery lake all clearly define and shine on the sky how excitedly such a addition to the scenery would be gaze at yet these lakeful river be still more excitingly beautiful and impressive in they natural position to those who have the eye to see they as they lie imbed in they meadow and forest and glacier-sculptured rock when a mountain lake be bear -- when like a young eye it first open to the light -- it be a irregular expressionless crescent inclose in bank of rock and ice -- bare glaciated rock on the lower side the rugged snout of a glacier on the upper in this condition it remain for many a year until at length toward the end of some auspicious cluster of season the glacier recede beyond the upper margin of the basin leave it open from shore to shore for the first time thousand of year after its conception beneath the glacier that excavate its basin the landscape cold and bare be reflect in its pure depths the wind ruffle its glassy surface and the sun fill it with throb spangle while its wave begin to lap and murmur around its leafless shore -- sun-spangle during the day and reflect star at night its only flower the wind and the snow its only visitor meanwhile the glacier continue to recede and numerous rill still younger than the lake itself bring down glacier-mud sand-grain and pebble give rise to margin-ring and plat of soil to these fresh soil-bed come many a wait plant first a hardy carex with arch leaf and a spike of brown flower then as the season grow warmer and the soil-bed deeper and wider other sedge take they appoint place and these be join by blue gentian daisy dodecatheon violet honeywort and many a lowly moss shrub also hasten in time to the new garden -- kalmium with its glossy leaf and purple flower the arctic willow make soft weave carpet together with the heathy bryanthus and cassiope the fairest and dearest of they all insect now enrich the air frog pipe cheerily in the shallows soon follow by the ouzel which be the first bird to visit a glacier lake as the sedge be the first of plant so the young lake grow in beauty become more and more humanly lovable from century to century grove of aspen spring up and hardy pine and the hemlock spruce until it be richly overshadow and embower but while its shore be be enrich the soil-bed creep out with incessant growth contract its area while the lighter mud-particle deposit on the bottom cause it to grow constantly shallower until at length the last remnant of the lake vanish -- close forever in ripe and natural old age and now its feeding-stream go wind on without halt through the new garden and grove that have take its place the length of the life of any lake depend ordinarily upon the capacity of its basin as compare with the carry power of the stream that flow into it the character of the rock over which these stream flow and the relative position of the lake toward other lake in a series whose basin lie in the same cañon and be feed by one and the same main stream the uppermost will of course vanish first unless some other lake-filling agent come in to modify the result because at first it receive nearly all of the sediment that the stream bring down only the finest of the mud-particle be carry through the highest of the series to the next below then the next higher and the next would be successively fill and the lowest would be the last to vanish but this simplicity as to duration be break in upon in various way chiefly through the action of side-stream that enter the lower lake direct for notwithstanding many of these side tributary be quite short and during late summer feeble they all become powerful torrent in springtime when the snow be melting and carry not only sand and pine-needle but large trunk and boulder ton in weight sweep they down they steeply inclined channel and into the lake basin with astounding energy many of these side affluent also have the advantage of access to the main lateral moraine of the vanish glacier that occupy the cañon and upon these they draw for lake-filling material while the main trunk stream flow mostly over clean glacier pavement where but little moraine matter be ever leave for they to carry thus a small rapid stream with abundance of loose transportable material within its reach may fill up a extensive basin in a few century while a large perennial trunk stream flow over clean endure pavement though ordinarily a hundred time larger may not fill a smaller basin in thousand of year the comparative influence of great and small stream as lake-filler be strikingly illustrate in yosemite valley through which the merce flow the bottom of the valley be now compose of level meadow-land and dry slope soil-bed plant with oak and pine but it be once a lake stretch from wall to wall and nearly from one end of the valley to the other form one of the most beautiful cliff-bound sheet of water that ever exist in the sierra and though never perhaps see by human eye it be but yesterday geologically speak since it disappear and the trace of its existence be still so fresh it may easily be restore to the eye of imagination and view in all its grandeur about as truly and vividly as if actually before we now we find that the detritus which fill this magnificent basin be not bring down from the distant mountain by the main stream that converge here to form the river however powerful and available for the purpose at first sight they appear but almost wholly by the small local tributary such as those of indian cañon the sentinel and the three brother and by a few small residual glacier which linger in the shadow of the wall long after the main trunk glacier have recede beyond the head of the valley have the glacier that once cover the range be melt at once leave the entire surface bare from top to bottom simultaneously then of course all the lake would have come into existence at the same time and the highest other circumstance be equal would as we have see be the first to vanish but because they melt gradually from the foot of the range upward the lower lake be the first to see the light and the first to be obliterate therefore instead of find the lake of the present day at the foot of the range we find they at the top most of the lower lake vanish thousand of year before those now brighten the alpine landscape be bear and in general owe to the deliberation of the upward retreat of the glacier the lowest of the exist lake be also the oldest a gradual transition be apparent throughout the entire belt from the older forested meadow-rimmed and contract form all the way up to those that be new bear lie bare and meadowless among the highest peak -lrb- illustration : the death of a lake -rrb- a few small lake unfortunately situate be extinguish suddenly by a single swoop of a avalanche carry down immense number of tree together with the soil they be grow upon other be obliterate by land-slips earthquake talus etc but these lake-death compare with those result from the deliberate and incessant deposition of sediment may be term accidental they fate be like that of tree strike by lightning the lake-line be of course still rise its present elevation be about 8000 foot above sea-level somewhat higher than this toward the southern extremity of the range lower toward the northern on account of the difference in time of the withdrawal of the glacier due to difference in climate specimen occur here and there considerably below this limit in basin specially protect from inwash detritus or exceptional in size these however be not sufficiently numerous to make any marked irregularity in the line the highest i have yet find lie at a elevation of about 12000 foot in a glacier womb at the foot of one of the highest of the summit peak a few mile to the north of mount hitter the basin of perhaps twenty-five or thirty be still in process of formation beneath the few linger glacier but by the time they be bear a equal or greater number will probably have die since the beginning of the close of the ice-period the whole number in the range have perhaps never be greater than at present a rough approximation to the average duration of these mountain lake may be make from datum already suggest but i can not stop here to present the subject in detail i must also forego in the mean time the pleasure of a full discussion of the interesting question of lake-basin formation for which fine clear demonstrative material abound in these mountain in addition to what have be already give on the subject i will only make this one statement every lake in the sierra be a glacier lake they basin be not merely remodel and scour out by this mighty agent but in the first place be erode from the solid i must now make haste to give some nearer view of representative specimen lie at different elevation on the main lake-belt confine myself to description of the feature most characteristic of each shadow lake this be a fine specimen of the oldest and lowest of the exist lake it lie about eight mile above yosemite valley on the main branch of the merce at a elevation of about 7350 foot above the sea and be everywhere so securely cliff-bound that without artificial trail only wild animal can get down to its rocky shore from any direction its original length be about a mile and a half now it be only half a mile in length by about a fourth of a mile in width and over the lowest portion of the basin ninety-eight foot deep its crystal water be clasp around on the north and south by majestic granite wall sculpture in true yosemitic style into dome gable and battlemented headland which on the south come plunge down sheer into deep water from a height of from 1500 to 2000 foot the south lyell glacier erode this magnificent basin out of solid porphyritic granite while force its way westward from the summit fountain toward yosemite and the expose rock around the shore and the project boss of the wall ground and burnish beneath the vast ice-flood still glow with silvery radiance notwithstanding the innumerable corroding storm that have fall upon they the general conformation of the basin as well as the moraine lay along the top of the wall and the groove and scratch on the bottom and side indicate in the most unmistakable manner the direction pursue by this mighty ice-river its great depth and the tremendous energy it exert in thrust itself into and out of the basin bear down with superior pressure upon this portion of its channel because of the greater declivity consequently erode it deeper than the other portion about it and produce the lake-bowl as the necessary result with these magnificent ice-character so vividly before we it be not easy to realize that the old glacier that make they vanish ten of century ago for except the vegetation that have spring up and the change effect by a earthquake that hurl rock-avalanche from the weaker headland the basin as a whole present the same appearance that it do when first bring to light the lake itself however have undergo marked change one see at a glance that it be grow old more than two third of its original area be now dry land cover with meadow-grass and grove of pine and fir and the level bed of alluvium stretch across from wall to wall at the head be evidently grow out all along its lakeward margin and will at length close the lake forever every lover of fine wildness would delight to saunter on a summer day through the flowery grove now occupy the filled-up portion of the basin the curving shore be clearly trace by a ribbon of white sand upon which the ripple play then come a belt of broad-leafed sedge interrupt here and there by impenetrable tangle of willow beyond this there be grove of tremble aspen then a dark shadowy belt of two-leaved pine with here and there a round carex meadow ensconce nest-like in its midst and lastly a narrow outer margin of majestic silver fir 200 foot high the ground beneath the tree be cover with a luxuriant crop of grass chiefly triticum bromus and calamagrostis with purple spike and panicle arch to one 's shoulder while the open meadow patch glow throughout the summer with showy flower -- helenium goldenrod erigeron lupine castilleia and lily and form favorite hiding and feeding-grounds for bear and deer the rugged south wall be feathered darkly along the top with a impose array of spirey silver fir while the rifted precipice all the way down to the water 's edge be adorn with picturesque old juniper they cinnamon-colored bark show finely upon the neutral gray of the granite these with a few venturesome dwarf pine and spruce lean out over fissured rib and tablet or stand erect back in shadowy niche in a indescribably wild and fearless manner moreover the white-flowered dougla spiraea and dwarf evergreen oak form graceful fringe along the narrower seam wherever the slightest hold can be effect rock-fern too be here such as allosorus pellaea and cheilanthe make handsome rosette on the drier fissure and the delicate maidenhair cistoperi and woodsium hide back in mossy grotto moisten by some trickle rill and then the orange wall-flower hold up its showy panicle here and there in the sunshine and bahium make boss of gold but notwithstanding all this plant beauty the general impression in look across the lake be of stern unflinching rockiness the fern and flower be scarcely see and not one fiftieth of the whole surface be screen with plant life the sunnier north wall be more varied in sculpture but the general tone be the same a few headland flat-topped and soil-covered support clump of cedar and pine and up-curving tangle of chinquapin and live-oak grow on rough earthquake talus girdle they basis small stream come cascade down between they they foam margin brighten with gay primula gilia and mimulus and close along the shore on this side there be a strip of rocky meadow enamel with buttercup daisy and white violet and the purple-topped grass out on its beveled border dip they leaf into the water the lower edge of the basin be a dam-like swell of solid granite heavily abrade by the old glacier but scarce at all cut into as yet by the outflow stream though it have flow on unceasingly since the lake come into existence as soon as the stream be fairly over the lake-lip it break into cascade never for a moment halt and scarce abate one jot of its glad energy until it reach the next filled-up basin a mile below then swirl and curve drowsily through meadow and grove it break forth anew into gray rapid and fall leap and glide in glorious exuberance of wild bind and dance down into another and yet another filled-up lake basin then after a long rest in the level of little yosemite it make its grandest display in the famous nevada fall out of the cloud of spray at the foot of the fall the battered roaring river grope its way make another mile of cascade and rapid rest a moment in emerald pool then plunge over the grand cliff of the vernal fall and go thunder and chafe down a boulder-choked gorge of tremendous depth and wildness into the tranquil reach of the old yosemite lake basin the color-beauty about shadow lake during the indian summer be much richer than one could hope to find in so young and so glacial a wilderness almost every leaf be tint then and the golden-rod be in bloom but most of the color be give by the ripe grass willow and aspen at the foot of the lake you stand in a tremble aspen grove every leaf paint like a butterfly and away to right and leave round the shore sweep a curving ribbon of meadow red and brown dot with pale yellow shade off here and there into hazy purple the wall too be dash with bit of bright color that gleam out on the neutral granite gray but neither the wall nor the margin meadow nor yet the gay flutter grove in which you stand nor the lake itself flash with spangle can long hold you attention for at the head of the lake there be a gorgeous mass of orange-yellow belong to the main aspen belt of the basin which seem the very fountain whence all the color below it have flow and here you eye be fill and fix this glorious mass be about thirty foot high and extend across the basin nearly from wall to wall rich boss of willow flame in front of it and from the base of these the brown meadow come forward to the water 's edge the whole be relieve against the unyielding green of the conifera while thick sun-gold be pour over all during these bless color-day no cloud darken the sky the wind be gentle and the landscape rest hushed everywhere and indescribably impressive a few duck be usually see sailing on the lake apparently more for pleasure than anything else and the ouzel at the head of the rapid sing always while robin grosbeak and the dougla squirrel be busy in the grove make delightful company and intensify the feeling of grateful sequestration without ruffle the deep hushed calm and peace this autumnal mellowness usually last until the end of November then come day of quite another kind the winter cloud grow and bloom and shed they starry crystal on every leaf and rock and all the color vanish like a sunset the deer gather and hasten down they well-known trail fearful of be snow-bound storm succeed storm heaping snow on the cliff and meadow and bend the slender pine to the ground in wide arch one over the other clustering and interlace like lodge wheat avalanche rush and boom from the shelve height pile immense heap upon the frozen lake and all the summer glory be bury and lose yet in the midst of this hearty winter the sun shine warm at time call the dougla squirrel to frisk in the snowy pine and seek out he hidden store and the weather be never so severe as to drive away the grouse and little nut-hatch and chickadee toward may the lake begin to open the hot sun send down innumerable stream over the cliff streak they round and round with foam the snow slowly vanish and the meadow show tinting of green then spring come on apace flower and fly enrich the air and the sod and the deer come back to the upper grove like bird to a old nest i first discover this charming lake in the autumn of 1872 while on my way to the glacier at the head of the river it be rejoice then in its gayest color untrodden hide in the glorious wildness like unmined gold year after year i walk its shore without discover any other trace of humanity than the remains of a indian camp-fire and the thigh-bone of a deer that have be break to get at the marrow it lie out of the regular way of indian who love to hunt in more accessible field adjacent to trail they knowledge of deer-haunt have probably entice they here some hunger-time when they wish to make sure of a feast for hunting in this lake-hollow be like hunting in a fenced park i have tell the beauty of shadow lake only to a few friend fear it might come to be trample and improve like yosemite on my last visit as i be saunter along the shore on the strip of sand between the water and sod read the track of the wild animal that live here i be startle by a human track which i at once see belong to some shepherd for each step be turn out 35 ° or 40 ° from the general course pursue and be also run over in a uncertain sprawling fashion at the heel while a row of round dot on the right indicate the staff that shepherd carry none but a shepherd could make such a track and after trace it a few minute i begin to fear that he might be seek pasturage for what else could he be seek return from the glacier shortly afterward nay worst fear be realize a trail have be make down the mountain-side from the north and all the garden and meadow be destroy by a horde of hoofed locust as if sweep by a fire the money-changers be in the temple orange lake besides these larger cañon lake feed by the main cañon stream there be many smaller one lie aloft on the top of rock bench entirely independent of the general drainage channel and of course draw they supplies from a very limited area notwithstanding they be mostly small and shallow owe to they immunity from avalanche detritus and the inwashing of powerful stream they often endure longer than other many time larger but less favorably situate when very shallow they become dry toward the end of summer but because they basin be ground out of seamless stone they suffer no loss save from evaporation alone and the great depth of snow that fall last into June make they dry season short in any case orange lake be a fair illustration of this bench form it lie in the middle of a beautiful glacial pavement near the lower margin of the lake-line about a mile and a half to the northwest of shadow lake it be only about 100 yard in circumference next the water there be a girdle of carice with wide overarching leaf then in regular order a shaggy ruff of huckleberry bush a zone of willow with here and there a bush of the mountain ash then a zone of aspen with a few pine around the outside these zone be of course concentric and together form a wall beyond which the naked ice-burnished granite stretch away in every direction leave it conspicuously relieve like a bunch of palm in a desert in autumn when the color be ripe the whole circular grove at a little distance look like a big handful of flower set in a cup to be keep fresh -- a tuft of goldenrod its feeding-stream be exceedingly beautiful notwithstanding they inconstancy and extreme shallowness they have no channel whatever and consequently be leave free to spread in thin sheet upon the shine granite and wander at will in many place the current be less than a fourth of a inch deep and flow with so little friction it be scarcely visible sometimes there be not a single foam-bell or drift pine-needle or irregularity of any sort to manifest its motion yet when observe narrowly it be see to form a web of glide lacework exquisitely weave give beautiful reflection from its minute curve ripple and eddy and differ from the water-lace of large cascade in be everywhere transparent in spring when the snow be melt the lake-bowl be brim full and send forth quite a large stream that slip glassily for 200 yard or so until it come to a almost vertical precipice 800 foot high down which it plunge in a fine cataract then it gather its scattered water and go smoothly over fold of gently dip granite to its confluence with the main cañon stream during the greater portion of the year however not a single water sound will you hear either at head or foot of the lake not oven the whisper lapping of ripple-waves along the shore for the wind be fence out but the deep mountain silence be sweeten now and then by bird that stop here to rest and drink on they way across the cañon lake stake king a beautiful variety of the bench-top lake occur just where the great lateral moraine of the main glacier have be shove forward in outswel concentric ring by small residual tributary glacier instead of be encompass by a narrow ring of tree like orange lake these lie embosome in dense moraine wood so dense that in seek they you may pass they by again and again although you may know nearly where they lie conceal -lrb- illustration : lake starr king -rrb- lake starr king lie to the north of the cone of that name above the little yosemite valley be a fine specimen of this variety the ouzel pass it by and so do the duck they could hardly get into it if they would without plump straight down inside the circle tree yet these isolate gem lie like fall fruit detach from the branch be not altogether without inhabitant and joyous animating visitor of course fish can not get into they and this be generally true of nearly every glacier lake in the range but they be all well stock with happy frog how do the frog get into they in the first place perhaps they sticky spawn be carry in on the foot of duck or other bird else they progenitor must have make some exciting excursion through the wood and up the side of the cañons down in the still pure depths of these hide lakelet you may also find the larva of innumerable insect and a great variety of beetle while the air above they be thick with hum wing through the midst of which fly-catcher be constantly dart and in autumn when the huckleberry be ripe band of robin and grosbeak come to feast form altogether delightful little byworld for the naturalist push we way upward toward the axis of the range we find lake in greater and greater abundance and more youthful in aspect at a elevation of about 9000 foot above sea-level they seem to have arrive at middle age -- that be they basin seem to be about half fill with alluvium broad sheet of meadow-land be see extend into they imperfect and boggy in many place and more nearly level than those of the older lake below they and the vegetation of they shore be of course more alpine kalmium lodum and cassiope fringe the meadow rock while the luxuriant wave grove so characteristic of the lower lake be represent only by clump of the dwarf pine and hemlock spruce these however be oftentimes very picturesquely group on rocky headland around the outer rim of the meadow or with still more striking effect crown some rocky islet moreover from cause that we can not stop here to explain the cliff about these middle-aged lake be seldom of the massive yosemite type but be more broken and less sheer and they usually stand back leave the shore comparatively free while the few precipitous rock that do come forward and plunge directly into deep water be seldom more than three or four hundred foot high i have never yet meet duck in any of the lake of this kind but the ouzel be never want where the feeding-stream be perennial wild sheep and deer may occasionally be see on the meadow and very rarely a bear one might camp on the rugged shore of these bright fountain for week without meet any animal larger than the marmot that burrow beneath glacier boulder along the edge of the meadow the highest and youngest of all the lake lie nestle in glacier womb at first sight they seem picture of pure bloodless desolation miniature arctic sea bind in perpetual ice and snow and overshadow by harsh gloomy crumble precipice they water be keen ultramarine blue in the deepest part lively grass-green toward the shore shallows and around the edge of the small berg usually float about in they a few hardy sedge frost-pinched every night be occasionally find make soft sod along the sun-touched portion of they shore and when they northern bank slope openly to the south and be soil-covered no matter how coarsely they be sure to be brighten with flower one lake in particular now come to mind which illustrate the floweriness of the sun-touched bank of these icy gem close up under the shadow of the sierra matterhorn on the eastern slope of the range lie one of the iciest of these glacier lake at a elevation of about 12000 foot a short ragged-edged glacier crawl into it from the south and on the opposite side it be embank and dam by a series of concentric terminal moraine make by the glacier when it entirely fill the basin half a mile below lie a second lake at a height of 11500 foot about as cold and as pure as a snow-crystal the water of the first come gurgle down into it over and through the moraine dam while a second stream pour into it direct from a glacier that lie to the southeast sheer precipice of crystalline snow rise out of deep water on the south keep perpetual winter on that side but there be a fine summery spot on the other notwithstanding the lake be only about 300 yard wide here on August 25 1873 i find a charming company of flower not pinch crouch dwarf scarce able to look up but warm and juicy standing erect in rich cheery color and bloom on a narrow strip of shingle close to the water 's edge there be a few tuft of carex go to seed and a little way back up the rocky bank at the foot of a crumble wall so inclined as to absorb and radiate as well as reflect a considerable quantity of sun-heat be the garden contain a thrifty thicket of cowanium cover with large yellow flower several bush of the alpine ribe with berry nearly ripe and wildly acid a few handsome grass belong to two distinct species and one goldenrod a few hairy lupine and radiant spraguea whose blue and rose-colored flower be set off to fine advantage amid green carice and along a narrow seam in the very warmest angle of the wall a perfectly gorgeous fringe of _ epilobium obcordatum _ with flower a inch wide crowd together in lavish profusion and color as royal a purple as ever be worn by any high-bred plant of the tropics and best of all and greatest of all a noble thistle in full bloom standing erect head and shoulder above he companion and thrust out he lance in sturdy vigor as if grow on a scottish brae all this brave warm bloom among the raw stone right in the face of the onlooking glacier as far as i have be able to find out these upper lake be snow-buried in winter to a depth of about thirty-five or forty foot and those most expose to avalanche to a depth of even a hundred foot or more these last are of course nearly lose to the landscape some remain bury for year when the snowfall be exceptionally great and many open only on one side late in the season the snow of the closed side be compose of coarse granule compacted and frozen into a firm faintly stratified mass like the _ névé _ of a glacier the lap wave of the open portion gradually undermine and cause it to break off in large mass like iceberg which give rise to a precipitous front like the discharging wall of a glacier enter the sea the play of the light among the crystal angle of these snow-cliff the pearly white of the outswelling boss the berg drift in front aglow in the sun and edge with green water and the deep blue disk of the lake itself extend to you foot -- this form a picture that enrich all you afterlife and be never forget but however perfect the season and the day the cold incompleteness of these young lake be always keenly feel we approach they with a kind of mean caution and steal unconfidingly around they crystal shore dash and ill at ease as if expect to hear some forbid voice but the love-song of the ouzel and the love-look of the daisy gradually reassure we and manifest the warm fountain humanity that pervade the coldest and most solitary of they all chapter vii the glacier meadow after the lake on the high sierra come the glacier meadow they be smooth level silky lawn lie embedded in the upper forest on the floor of the valley and along the broad back of the main divide ridge at a height of about 8000 to 9500 foot above the sea they be nearly as level as the lake whose place they have take and present a dry even surface free from rock-heap mossy bogginess and the frowsy roughness of rank coarse-leaved weedy and shrubby vegetation the sod be close and fine and so complete that you can not see the ground and at the same time so brightly enameled with flower and butterfly that it may well be call a garden-meadow or meadow-garden for the plushy sod be in many place so crowd with gentian daisy ivesia and various species of orthocarpus that the grass be scarcely noticeable while in other the flower be only prick in here and there singly or in small ornamental rosette the most influential of the grass compose the sod be a delicate calamagrosti with fine filiform leave and loose airy panicle that seem to float above the flowery lawn like a purple mist but write as i may i can not give anything like a adequate idea of the exquisite beauty of these mountain carpet as they lie smoothly outspread in the savage wilderness what word be fine enough to picture they i to what shall we liken they the flowery level of the prairie of the old west the luxuriant savannah of the south and the finest of cultivate meadow be coarse in comparison one may at first sight compare they with the carefully tend lawn of pleasure-grounds for they be as free from weed as they and as smooth but here the likeness end for these wild lawn with all they exquisite fineness have no trace of that painful lick snip repress appearance that pleasure-ground lawn be apt to have even when view at a distance and not to mention the flower with which they be brighten they grass be very much finer both in color and texture and instead of lie flat and motionless mat together like a dead green cloth they respond to the touch of every breeze rejoice in pure wildness bloom and fruit in the vital light glacier meadow abound throughout all the alpine and subalpine region of the sierra in still greater number than the lake probably from 2500 to 3000 exist between latitude 36 ° 30 ' and 39 ° distribute of course like the lake in concordance with all the other glacial feature of the landscape on the head water of the river there be what be call big meadow usually about from five to ten mile long these occupy the basin of the ancient ice-sea where many tributary glacier come together to form the grand trunk most however be quite small average perhaps but little more than three fourth of a mile in length one of the very finest of the thousand i have enjoy lie hide in a extensive forest of the two-leaved pine on the edge of the basin of the ancient tuolumne mer de glace about eight mile to the west of mount dana imagine yourself at the tuolumne soda spring on the bank of the river a day 's journey above yosemite valley you set off northward through a forest that stretch away indefinitely before you seemingly unbroken by opening of any kind as soon as you be fairly into the wood the gray mountain-peak with they snowy gorge and hollow be lose to view the ground be litter with fall trunk that lie cross and recross like storm-lodged wheat and besides this close forest of pine the rich moraine soil support a luxuriant growth of ribbon-leaved grass -- bromus triticum calamagrostis agrostis etc which rear they handsome spike and panicle above you waist make you way through the fertile wilderness -- find lively bit of interest now and then in the squirrel and clark crow and perchance in a deer or bear -- after the lapse of a hour or two vertical bar of sunshine be see ahead between the brown shaft of the pine show that you be approach a open space and then you suddenly emerge from the forest shadow upon a delightful purple lawn lie smooth and free in the light like a lake this be a glacier meadow it be about a mile and a half long by a quarter of a mile wide the tree come press forward all around in close serried rank plant they foot exactly on its margin and hold themselves erect strict and orderly like soldier on parade thus bound the meadow with exquisite precision yet with free curving line such as nature alone can draw with inexpressible delight you wade out into the grassy sun-lake feeling yourself contain in one of nature 's most sacred chamber withdraw from the sterner influence of the mountain secure from all intrusion secure from yourself free in the universal beauty and notwithstanding the scene be so impressively spiritual and you seem dissolve in it yet everything about you be beat with warm terrestrial human love and life delightfully substantial and familiar the resiny pine be type of health and steadfastness the robin feed on the sod belong to the same species you have know since childhood and surely these daisy larkspur and goldenrod be the very friend-flowers of the old home garden bee hum as in a harvest noon butterfly waver above the flower and like they you lave in the vital sunshine too richly and homogeneously joy-filled to be capable of partial thought you be all eye sift through and through with light and beauty saunter along the brook that meander silently through the meadow from the east special flower call you back to discriminate consciousness the sod come curve down to the water 's edge form bossy outswelling bank and in some place overlap countersunk boulder and form bridge here you find mat of the curious dwarf willow scarce a inch high yet send up a multitude of gray silky catkin illumine here and there with the purple cup and bell of bryanthus and vaccinium go where you may you everywhere find the lawn divinely beautiful as if nature have finger and adjust every plant this very day the float grass panicle be scarcely feel in brushing through they midst so flue be they and none of the flower have tall or rigid stalk in the brightest place you find three species of gentian with different shades of blue daisy pure as the sky silky leaved ivesia with warm yellow flower several species of orthocarpus with blunt bossy spike red and purple and yellow the alpine goldenrod pentstemon and clover fragrant and honeyful with they color mass and blended parting the grass and look more closely you may trace the branch of they shine stem and note the marvelous beauty of they mist of flower the glume and pale exquisitely pencil the yellow dangling stamen and feathery pistil beneath the lowest leave you discover a fairy realm of moss -- hypnum dicranum polytriclium and many other -- they precious spore-cup poise daintily on polished shaft curiously hood or open show the richly ornate peristoma wear like royal crown creep liverwort be here also in abundance and several rare species of fungus exceedingly small and frail and delicate as if make only for beauty caterpillar black beetle and ant roam the wild of this lower world make they way through miniature grove and thicket like bear in a thick wood and how rich too be the life of the sunny air every leaf and flower seem to have its winged representative overhead dragon-fly shoot in vigorous zigzag through the dancing swarm and a rich profusion of butterfly -- the leguminosa of insect -- make a fine addition to the general show many of these last be comparatively small at this elevation and as yet almost unknown to science but every now and then a familiar vanessa or papilio come sail past humming-bird too be quite common here and the robin be always find along the margin of the stream or out in the shallowest portion of the sod and sometimes the grouse and mountain quail with they brood of precious fluffy chicken swallow skim the grassy lake from end to end fly-catcher come and go in fitful flight from the top of dead spar while woodpecker swing across from side to side in graceful festoon curve -- bird insect and flower all in they own way tell a deep summer joy the influence of pure nature seem to be so little known as yet that it be generally suppose that complete pleasure of this kind permeate one 's very flesh and bone unfit the student for scientific pursuit in which cool judgment and observation be require but the effect be just the opposite instead of produce a dissipate condition the mind be fertilize and stimulate and develop like sun-fed plant all that we have see here enable we to see with surer vision the fountain among the summit-peak to the east whence flow the glacier that grind soil for the surround forest and down at the foot of the meadow the moraine which form the dam which give rise to the lake that occupy this basin before the meadow be make and around the margin the stone that be shove back and pile up into a rude wall by the expansion of the lake ice during long bygone winter and along the side of the stream the slight hollow of the meadow which mark those portion of the old lake that be the last to vanish i would fain ask my reader to linger awhile in this fertile wilderness to trace its history from its earliest glacial beginning and learn what we may of its wild inhabitant and visitor how happy the bird be all summer and some of they all winter how the pouched marmot drive tunnel under the snow and how fine and brave a life the slander coyote life here and the deer and bear but know well the difference between reading and see i will only ask attention to some brief sketch of its vary aspect as they be present throughout the more marked season of the year the summer life we have be depict last with but little abatement until October when the night frost begin to sting bronze the grass and ripen the leaf of the creep heathwort along the bank of the stream to reddish purple and crimson while the flower disappear all save the goldenrod and a few daisy that continue to bloom on unscathed until the beginning of snowy winter in still night the grass panicle and every leaf and stalk be laden with frost crystal through which the morning sunbeam sift in ravishing splendor transform each to a precious diamond radiate the color of the rainbow the brook shallows be plait across and across with slender lance of ice but both these and the grass crystal be melt before midday and notwithstanding the great elevation of the meadow the afternoon be still warm enough to revive the chill butterfly and call they out to enjoy the late-flowering goldenrod the divine alpenglow flush the surrounding forest every evening follow by a crystal night with host of lily star whose size and brilliancy can not be conceive by those who have never rise above the lowland thus come and go the bright sun-day of autumn not a cloud in the sky week after week until near December then come a sudden change cloud of a peculiar aspect with a slow crawl gait gather and grow in the azure throw out satiny fringe and become gradually darker until every lake-like rift and opening be close and the whole bent firmament be obscure in equal structureless gloom then come the snow for the cloud be ripe the meadow of the sky be in bloom and shed they radiant blossom like a orchard in the spring lightly lightly they lodge in the brown grass and in the tasseled needle of the pine fall hour after hour day after day silently lovingly -- all the wind hush -- glance and circle hither thither glint against one another ray interlock in flake as large as daisy and then the dry grass and the tree and the stone be all equally abloom again thunder-showers occur here during the summer month and impressive it be to watch the come of the big transparent drop each a small world in itself -- one unbroken ocean without island hurl free through the air like planet through space but still more impressive to I be the come of the snow-flower -- fall star winter daisy -- give bloom to all the ground alike raindrop blossom brilliantly in the rainbow and change to flower in the sod but snow come in full flower direct from the dark frozen sky the later snow-storm be oftentimes accompany by wind that break up the crystal when the temperature be low into single petal and irregular dusty fragment but there be comparatively little drift on the meadow so securely be it embosome in the wood from December to may storm succeed storm until the snow be about fifteen or twenty foot deep but the surface be always as smooth as the breast of a bird hush now be the life that so late be beat warmly most of the bird have go down below the snow-line the plant sleep and all the fly-wing be fold yet the sun beam gloriously many a cloudless day in midwinter casting long lance shadow athwart the dazzling expanse in June small fleck of the dead decaying sod begin to appear gradually widen and unite with one another cover with creep rag of water during the day and ice by night look as hopeless and unvital as crushed rock just emerge from the darkness of the glacial period walk the meadow now scarce the memory of a flower will you find the ground seem twice dead nevertheless the annual resurrection be draw near the life-giving sun pour he flood the last snow-wreath melt myriad of grow point push eagerly through the steam mold the bird come back new wing fill the air and fervid summer life come surge on seemingly yet more glorious than before this be a perfect meadow and under favorable circumstance exist without manifest any marked change for century nevertheless soon or late it must inevitably grow old and vanish during the calm indian summer scarce a sand-grain move around its bank but in flood-time and storm-time soil be wash forward upon it and lay in successive sheet around its gently slope rim and be gradually extend to the center make it dryer through a considerable period the meadow vegetation be not greatly affect thereby for it gradually rise with the rise ground keep on the surface like water-plant rise on the swell of wave but at length the elevation of the meadow-land go on so far as to produce too dry a soil for the specific meadow-plant when of course they have to give up they place to other fit for the new condition the most characteristic of the newcomer at this elevation above the sea be principally sun-loving gilia eriogona and composita and finally forest-trees henceforward the obscure change be so manifold that the original lake-meadow can be unveil and see only by the geologist generally speak glacier lake vanish more slowly than the meadow that succeed they because unless very shallow a greater quantity of material be require to fill up they basin and obliterate they than be require to render the surface of the meadow too high and dry for meadow vegetation furthermore owe to the weather to which the adjacent rock be subject material of the finer sort susceptible of transportation by rain and ordinary flood be more abundant during the meadow period than during the lake period yet doubtless many a fine meadow favorably situate exist in almost prime beauty for thousand of year the process of extinction be exceedingly slow as we reckon time this be especially the case with meadow circumstance like the one we have describe -- embosome in deep wood with the ground rise gently away from it all around the network of tree-root in which all the ground be clasped prevent any rapid torrential wash but in exceptional case beautiful lawn form with great deliberation be overwhelm and obliterate at once by the action of land-slips earthquake avalanche or extraordinary flood just as lake be in those glacier meadow that take the place of shallow lake which have be feed by feeble stream glacier mud and fine vegetable humus enter largely into the composition of the soil and on account of the shallowness of this soil and the seamless water-tight undrained condition of the rock-basin they be usually wet and therefore occupy by tall grass and sedge whose coarse appearance offer a striking contrast to that of the delicate lawn-making kind describe above these shallow-soiled meadow be oftentimes still further roughen and diversify by partially bury moraine and swell boss of the bed-rock which with the tree and shrub grow upon they produce a striking effect as they stand in relief like island in the grassy level or sweep across in rugged curve from one forest wall to the other throughout the upper meadow region wherever water be sufficiently abundant and low in temperature in basin secure from flood-washing handsome bog be form with a deep growth of brown and yellow sphagnum picturesquely ruin with patch of kalmium and ledum which ripen mass of beautiful color in the autumn between these cool spongy bog and the dry flowery meadow there be many interesting variety which be graduate into one another by the varied condition already allude to form a series of delightful study hang meadow another very well-marked and interesting kind of meadow differ greatly both in origin and appearance from the lake-meadow be find lie aslant upon moraine-covered hillside trend in the direction of greatest declivity wave up and down over rock heap and ledge like rich green ribbon brilliantly illumine with tall flower they occur both in the alpine and subalpine region in considerable number and never fail to make tell feature in the landscape they be often a mile or more in length but never very wide -- usually from thirty to fifty yard when the mountain or cañon side on which they lie dip at the require angle and other condition be at the same time favorable they extend from above the timber line to the bottom of a cañon or lake basin descend in fine fluent line like cascade break here and there into a kind of spray on large boulder or divide and flow around on either side of some project islet sometimes a noisy stream go brawl down through they and again scarcely a drop of water be in sight they owe they existence however to stream whether visible or invisible the wildest specimen be find where some perennial fountain as a glacier or snowbank or moraine spring send down its water across a rough sheet of soil in a dissipate web of feeble ooze rivulet these condition give rise to a meadowy vegetation whose extend root still more obstruct the free flow of the water and tend to dissipate they out over a yet wider area thus the moraine soil and the necessary moisture requisite for the better class of meadow plant be at time combine about as perfectly as if smoothly outspread on a level surface where the soil happen to be compose of the finer quality of glacial detritus and the water be not in excess the nearest approach be make by the vegetation to that of the lake-meadow but where as be more commonly the case the soil be coarse and bouldery the vegetation be correspondingly rank tall wide-leaved grass take they place along the side and rush and nod carice in the wetter portion mingle with the most beautiful and impose flower -- orange lily and larkspur seven or eight foot high lupine senecio alium painted-cup many species of mimulus and pentstemon the ample boat-leaved _ veratrum alba _ and the magnificent alpine columbine with spur a inch and a half long at a elevation of from seven to nine thousand foot showy flower frequently form the bulk of the vegetation then the hang meadow become hang garden in rare instance we find a alpine basin the bottom of which be a perfect meadow and the side nearly all the way round rise in gentle curve be cover with moraine soil which be saturate with melting snow from encircle fountain give rise to a almost continuous girdle of down-curving meadow vegetation that blend gracefully into the level meadow at the bottom thus form a grand smooth soft meadow-lined mountain nest it be in meadow of this sort that the mountain beaver -lrb- _ haplodon _ -rrb- love to make he home excavate snug chamber beneath the sod digging canal turn the underground water from channel to channel to suit he convenience and feed the vegetation another kind of meadow or bog occur on densely timbered hillside where small perennial stream have be dam at short interval by fall tree still another kind be find hang down smooth flat precipice while correspond lean meadow rise to meet they there be also three kind of small pot-hole meadow one of which be find along the bank of the main stream another on the summit of rocky ridge and the third on glacier pavement all of they interesting in origin and brimful of plant beauty chapter viii the forest the coniferous forest of the sierra be the grandest and most beautiful in the world and grow in a delightful climate on the most interesting and accessible of mountain-range yet strange to say they be not well know more than sixty year ago david dougla a enthusiastic botanist and tree lover wander alone through fine section of the sugar pine and silver fir wood wild with delight a few year later other botanist make short journey from the coast into the lower wood then come the wonderful multitude of miner into the foot-hill zone mostly blind with gold-dust soon follow by sheepman who with wool over they eye chase they flock through all the forest belt from one end of the range to the other then the yosemite valley be discover and thousand of admire tourist pass through section of the lower and middle zone on they way to that wonderful park and gain fine glimpse of the sugar pine and silver fir along the edge of dusty trail and road but few indeed strong and free with eye undimmed with care have go far enough and live long enough with the tree to gain anything like a loving conception of they grandeur and significance as manifest in the harmony of they distribution and vary aspect throughout the season as they stand array in they winter garb rejoice in storm put forth they fresh leaf in the spring while steam with resiny fragrance receive the thunder-shower of summer or repose heavy-laden with ripe cone in the rich sungold of autumn for knowledge of this kind one must dwell with the tree and grow with they without any reference to time in the almanac sense the distribution of the general forest in belt be readily perceive these as we have see extend in regular order from one extremity of the range to the other and however dense and somber they may appear in general view neither on the rocky height nor down in the leafiest hollow will you find anything to remind you of the dank malarial selva of the amazon and orinoco with they boundless contiguity of shade the monotonous uniformity of the deodar forest of the himalaya the black forest of europe or the dense dark wood of dougla spruce where roll the oregon the giant pine and fir and sequoia hold they arm open to the sunlight rise above one another on the mountain bench marshal in glorious array give forth the utmost expression of grandeur and beauty with inexhaustible variety and harmony -lrb- illustration : view in the sierra forest -rrb- the invite openness of the sierra wood be one of they most distinguishing characteristic the tree of all the species stand more or less apart in grove or in small irregular group enable one to find a way nearly everywhere along sunny colonnade and through opening that have a smooth park-like surface strew with brown needle and bur now you cross a wild garden now a meadow now a ferny willowy stream and ever and anon you emerge from all the grove and flower upon some granite pavement or high bare ridge command superb view above the wave sea of evergreen far and near one would experience but little difficulty in ride on horseback through the successive belt all the way up to the storm-beaten fringe of the icy peak the deep cañons however that extend from the axis of the range cut the belt more or less completely into section and prevent the mount traveler from trace they lengthwise this simple arrangement in zone and section bring the forest as a whole within the comprehension of every observer the different species be ever find occupy the same relative position to one another as control by soil climate and the comparative vigor of each species in take and hold the ground and so appreciable be these relation one need never be at a loss in determine within a few hundred foot the elevation above sea-level by the tree alone for notwithstanding some of the species range upward for several thousand foot and all pass one another more or less yet even those possess the greatest vertical range be available in this connection in as much as they take on new form correspond with the variation in altitude cross the treeless plain of the sacramento and san joaquin from the west and reach the sierra foot-hill you enter the lower fringe of the forest compose of small oak and pine grow so far apart that not one twentieth of the surface of the ground be in shade at clear noonday after advance fifteen or twenty mile and make a ascent of from two to three thousand foot you reach the lower margin of the main pine belt compose of the gigantic sugar pine yellow pine incense cedar and sequoia next you come to the magnificent silver fir belt and lastly to the upper pine belt which sweep up the rocky acclivity of the summit peak in a dwarf waver fringe to a height of from ten to twelve thousand foot -lrb- illustration : edge of the timber line on mount shasta -rrb- this general order of distribution with reference to climate dependent on elevation be perceive at once but there be other harmony as far-reaching in this connection that become manifest only after patient observation and study perhaps the most interesting of these be the arrangement of the forest in long curving band braid together into lace-like pattern and outspread in charming variety the key to this beautiful harmony be the ancient glacier where they flow the tree follow trace they waver course along cañons over ridge and over high rolling plateaus the cedar of lebanon say hooker be grow upon one of the moraine of a ancient glacier all the forest of the sierra be grow upon moraine but moraine vanish like the glacier that make they every storm that fall upon they waste they cut gap disintegrate boulder and carry away they decay material into new formation until at length they be no longer recognizable by any save student who trace they transitional form down from the fresh moraine still in process of formation through those that be more and more ancient and more and more obscure by vegetation and all kind of post-glacial weathering have the ice-sheet that once cover all the range be melt simultaneously from the foot-hill to the summit the flank would of course have be leave almost bare of soil and these noble forest would be want many grove and thicket would undoubtedly have grow up on lake and avalanche bed and many a fair flower and shrub would have find food and a dwelling-place in weathered nook and crevice but the sierra as a whole would have be a bare rocky desert -lrb- illustration : view in the main pine belt of the sierra forest -rrb- it appear therefore that the sierra forest in general indicate the extent and position of the ancient moraine as well as they do line of climate for forest properly speak can not exist without soil and since the moraine have be deposit upon the solid rock and only upon elect place leave a considerable portion of the old glacial surface bare we find luxuriant forest of pine and fir abruptly terminate by score and polish pavement on which not even a moss be grow though soil alone be require to fit they for the growth of tree 200 foot in height the nut pine -lrb- _ pinus sabiniana _ -rrb- the nut pine the first conifer meet in ascend the range from the west grow only on the torrid foothill seem to delight in the most ardent sun-heat like a palm spring up here and there singly or in scattered group of five or six among scrubby white oak and thicket of ceanothus and manzanita its extreme upper limit be about 4000 foot above the sea its lower about from 500 to 800 foot this tree be remarkable for its airy widespread tropical appearance which suggest a region of palm rather than cool resiny pine wood no one would take it at first sight to be a conifer of any kind it be so loose in habit and so widely branch and its foliage be so thin and gray full-grown specimen be from forty to fifty foot in height and from two to three foot in diameter the trunk usually divide into three or four main branch about fifteen and twenty foot from the ground which after bear away from one another shoot straight up and form separate summit while the crooked subordinate branch aspire and radiate and droop in ornamental spray the slender grayish-green needle be from eight to twelve inch long loosely tasseled and inclined to droop in handsome curve contrast with the stiff dark-colored trunk and branch in a very striking manner no other tree of my acquaintance so substantial in body be in its foliage so thin and so pervious to the light the sunbeam sift through even the leafiest tree with scarcely any interruption and the weary heated traveler find but little protection in they shade -lrb- illustration : nut pine -lrb- pinus sabiniana -rrb- -rrb- the generous crop of nutritious nut which the nut pine yield make it a favorite with indian bear and squirrel the cone be most beautiful measuring from five to eight inch in length and not much less in thickness rich chocolate-brown in color and protect by strong down-curving hook which terminate the scale nevertheless the little douglas squirrel can open they indian gather the ripe nut make a striking picture the man climb the tree like bear and beat off the cone with stick or recklessly cut off the more fruitful branch with hatchet while the squaw gather the big generous cone and roast they until the scale open sufficiently to allow the hard-shelled seed to be beat out then in the cool evening man woman and child with they capacity for dirt greatly increase by the soft resin with which they be all bedraggled form circle around camp-fire on the bank of the nearest stream and lie in easy independence crack nut and laugh and chatter as heedless of the future as the squirrel _ pinus tubercula _ this curious little pine be find at a elevation of from 1500 to 3000 foot grow in close willowy grove it be exceedingly slender and graceful in habit although tree that chance to stand alone outside the grove sweep forth long curved branch produce a striking contrast to the ordinary grove form the foliage be of the same peculiar gray-green color as that of the nut pine and be worn about as loosely so that the body of the tree be scarcely obscure by it -lrb- illustration : the grove form the isolate form -lrb- pinus tubercula -rrb- -rrb- at the age of seven or eight year it begin to bear cone not on branch but on the main axis and as they never fall off the trunk be soon picturesquely dot with they the branch also become fruitful after they attain sufficient size the average size of the older tree be about thirty or forty foot in height and twelve to fourteen inch in diameter the cone be about four inch long exceedingly hard and cover with a sort of silicious varnish and gum render they impervious to moisture evidently with a view to the careful preservation of the seed no other conifer in the range be so closely restricted to special locality it be usually find apart stand deep in chaparral on sunny hill-and cañon-side where there be but little depth of soil and where find at all it be quite plentiful but the ordinary traveler follow carriage-road and trail may ascend the range many time without meet it while explore the lower portion of the merce cañon i find a lonely miner seek he fortune in a quartz vein on a wild mountain-side plant with this singular tree he tell I that he call it the hickory pine because of the whiteness and toughness of the wood it be so little known however that it can hardly be say to have a common name most mountaineer refer to it as that queer little pine-tree cover all over with bur in my study of this species i find a very interesting and significant group of fact whose relation will be see almost as soon as state : 1st all the tree in the grove i examine however unequal in size be of the same age 2d those grove be all plant on dry hillside cover with chaparral and therefore be liable to be sweep by fire 3d there be no seedling or sapling in or about the living grove but there be always a fine hopeful crop spring up on the ground once occupy by any grove that have be destroy by the burning of the chaparral 4th the cone never fall off and never discharge they seed until the tree or branch to which they belong die -lrb- illustration : lower margin of the main pine belt show open character of wood -rrb- a full discussion of the bearing of these fact upon one another would perhaps be out of place here but i may at least call attention to the admirable adaptation of the tree to the fire-swept region where alone it be find after a grove have be destroy the ground be at once sow lavishly with all the seed ripen during its whole life which seem to have be carefully hold in store with reference to such a calamity then a young grove immediately spring up give beauty for ash sugar pine -lrb- _ pinus lambertiana _ -rrb- this be the noblest pine yet discover surpass all other not merely in size but also in kingly beauty and majesty it tower sublimely from every ridge and cañon of the range at a elevation of from three to seven thousand foot above the sea attain most perfect development at a height of about 5000 foot full-grown specimen be commonly about 220 foot high and from six to eight foot in diameter near the ground though some grand old patriarch be occasionally meet that have enjoy five or six century of storm and attain a thickness of ten or even twelve foot live on undecayed sweet and fresh in every fiber in southern oregon where it be first discover by david dougla on the head water of the umpqua it attain still grander dimension one specimen have be measure that be 245 foot high and over eighteen foot in diameter three foot from the ground the discoverer be the dougla for whom the noble dougla spruce be name and many other plant which will keep he memory sweet and fresh as long as tree and flower be love he first visit to the pacific coast be make in the year 1825 the oregon indian watch he with curiosity as he wander in the wood collect specimen and unlike the fur-gathering stranger they have hitherto know care nothing about trade and when at length they come to know he better and see that from year to year the grow thing of the wood and prairie be he only object of pursuit they call he the man of grass a title of which he be proud during he first summer on the water of the columbium he make fort vancouver he headquarters make excursion from this hudson bay post in every direction on one of he long trip he see in a indian 's pouch some of the seed of a new species of pine which he learn be obtain from a very large tree far to the southward of the columbium at the end of the next summer return to fort vancouver after the setting in of the winter rain bear in mind the big pine he have hear of he set out on a excursion up the willamette valley in search of it and how he fare and what danger and hardship he endure be best tell in he own journal from which i quote as follow : _ October _ 26 1826 weather dull cold and cloudy when my friend in england be make acquaint with my travels i fear they will think i have tell they nothing but my misery i quit my camp early in the morning to survey the neighboring country leave my guide to take charge of the horse until my return in the evening about a hour 's walk from the camp i meet a indian who on perceive I instantly string he bow place on he left arm a sleeve of raccoon skin and stand on the defensive be quite sure that conduct be prompt by fear and not by hostile intention the poor fellow have probably never see such a be as myself before i lay my gun at my foot on the ground and wave my hand for he to come to I which he do slowly and with great caution i then make he place he bow and quiver of arrow beside my gun and strike a light give he a smoke out of my own pipe and a present of a few bead with my pencil i make a rough sketch of the cone and pine tree which i want to obtain and draw he attention to it when he instantly point with he hand to the hill fifteen or twenty mile distant towards the south and when i express my intention of go thither cheerfully set out to accompany I at midday i reach my long-wished-for pine and lose no time in examine they and endeavor to collect specimen and seed new and strange thing seldom fail to make strong impression and be therefore frequently over-rated so that lest i should never see my friend in england to inform they verbally of this most beautiful and immensely grand tree i shall here state the dimension of the largest i could find among several that have be blow down by the wind at 3 foot from the ground its circumference be 57 foot 9 inch at 134 foot 17 foot 5 inch the extreme length 245 foot as it be impossible either to climb the tree or hew it down i endeavor to knock off the cone by firing at they with ball when the report of my gun bring eight indian all of they paint with red earth arm with bow arrow bone-tipped spear and flint-knife they appear anything but friendly i explain to they what i want and they seem satisfied and sit down to smoke but presently i see one of they string he bow and another sharpen he flint knife with a pair of wooden pincers and suspend it off the wrist of he right hand further testimony of they intention be unnecessary to save myself by flight be impossible so without hesitation i step back about five pace cock my gun draw one of the pistol out of my belt and hold it in my left hand and the gun in my right show myself determine to fight for my life as much as possible i endeavor to preserve my coolness and thus we stand look at one another without make any movement or utter a word for perhaps ten minute when one at last who seem to be the leader give a sign that they wish for some tobacco this i signify that they should have if they fetch a quantity of cone they go off immediately in search of they and no sooner be they all out of sight than i pick up my three cone and some twig of the tree and make the quickest possible retreat hurry back to the camp which i reach before dusk i now write lie on the grass with my gun cock beside I and pen these line by the light of my columbian candle namely a ignite piece of rosin-wood this grand pine discover under such exciting circumstance dougla name in honor of he friend dr lambert of london the trunk be a smooth round delicately taper shaft mostly without limb and color rich purplish-brown usually enliven with tuft of yellow lichen at the top of this magnificent bole long curve branch sweep gracefully outward and downward sometimes form a palm-like crown but far more nobly impressive than any palm crown i ever behold the needle be about three inch long finely temper and arrange in rather close tassel at the end of slender branchlet that clothe the long outsweeping limb how well they sing in the wind and how strikingly harmonious a effect be make by the immense cylindrical cone that depend loosely from the end of the main branch no one know what nature can do in the way of pine-bur until he have see those of the sugar pine they be commonly from fifteen to eighteen inch long and three in diameter green shaded with dark purple on they sunward side they be ripe in September and October then the flat scale open and the seed take wing but the empty cone become still more beautiful and effective for they diameter be nearly double by the spreading of the scale and they color change to a warm yellowish-brown while they remain swing on the tree all the follow winter and summer and continue effectively beautiful even on the ground many year after they fall the wood be deliciously fragrant and fine in grain and texture it be of a rich cream-yellow as if form of condensed sunbeam _ retinospora obtusa siebold _ the glory of eastern forest be call fu-si-no-ki -lrb- tree of the sun -rrb- by the japanese the sugar pine be the sun-tree of the sierra unfortunately it be greatly prize by the lumberman and in accessible place be always the first tree in the wood to feel they steel but the regular lumberman with they saw-mill have be less generally destructive thus far than the shingle-maker the wood split freely and there be a constant demand for the shingle and because a ax and saw and frow be all the capital require for the business many of that drift unsteady class of man so large in californium engage in it for a few month in the year when prospector hunter ranch hand etc touch they bottom dollar and find themselves out of employment they say well i can at least go to the sugar pine and make shingle a few post be set in the ground and a single length cut from the first tree fell produce board enough for the wall and roof of a cabin all the rest the lumberman make be for sale and he be speedily independent no gardener or haymaker be more sweetly perfumed than these rough mountaineer while engage in this business but the havoc they make be most deplorable -lrb- illustration : sugar pine on expose ridge -rrb- the sugar from which the common name be derive be to my taste the best of sweet -- better than maple sugar it exude from the heart-wood where wound have be make either by forest fire or the ax in the shape of irregular crisp candy-like kernel which be crowd together in mass of considerable size like cluster of resin-bead when fresh it be perfectly white and delicious but because most of the wound on which it be find have be make by fire the exude sap be stain on the char surface and the hardened sugar become brown indian be fond of it but on account of its laxative property only small quantity may be eat bear so fond of sweet thing in general seem never to taste it at least i have fail to find any trace of they tooth in this connection no lover of tree will ever forget he first meeting with the sugar pine nor will he afterward need a poet to call he to listen what the pine-tree saith in most pine-tree there be a sameness of expression which to most people be apt to become monotonous for the typical spiry form however beautiful afford but little scope for appreciable individual character the sugar pine be as free from conventionality of form and motion as any oak no two be alike even to the most inattentive observer and notwithstanding they be ever toss out they immense arm in what might seem most extravagant gesture there be a majesty and repose about they that preclude all possibility of the grotesque or even picturesque in they general expression they be the priest of pine and seem ever to be address the surround forest the yellow pine be find grow with they on warm hillside and the white silver fir on cool northern slope but noble as these be the sugar pine be easily king and spread he arm above they in blessing while they rock and wave in sign of recognition the main branch be sometimes find to be forty foot in length yet persistently simple seldom divide at all except near the end but anything like a bare cable appearance be prevent by the small tasseled branchlet that extend all around they and when these superb limb sweep out symmetrically on all side a crown sixty or seventy foot wide be form which gracefully poise on the summit of the noble shaft and fill with sunshine be one of the most glorious forest object conceivable commonly however there be a great preponderance of limb toward the east away from the direction of the prevail wind no other pine seem to I so unfamiliar and self-contained in approach it we feel as if in the presence of a superior being and begin to walk with a light step hold we breath then perchance while we gaze awe-stricken along come a merry squirrel chatter and laugh to break the spell run up the trunk with no ceremony and gnawing off the cone as if they be make only for he while the carpenter-woodpecker hammer away at the bark drilling hole in which to store he winter supply of acorn -lrb- illustration : young sugar pine begin to bear cone -rrb- although so wild and unconventional when full-grown the sugar pine be a remarkably proper tree in youth the old be the most original and independent in appearance of all the sierra evergreen the young be the most regular -- a strict follower of coniferous fashion -- slim erect with leafy supple branch keep exactly in place each taper in outline and terminate in a spiry point the successive transitional form present between the cautious neatness of youth and bold freedom of maturity offer a delightful study at the age of fifty or sixty year the shy fashionable form begin to be break up specialize branch push out in the most unthought-of place and bend with the great cone at once mark individual character and this be constantly augmented from year to year by the vary action of the sunlight wind snow-storms etc the individuality of the tree be never again lose in the general forest the most constant companion of this species be the yellow pine and a worthy companion it be -lrb- illustration : forest of sequoia sugar pine and dougla spruce -rrb- the dougla spruce libocedrus sequoia and the white silver fir be also more or less associate with it but on many deep-soiled mountain-side at a elevation of about 5000 foot above the sea it form the bulk of the forest fill every swell and hollow and down-plunging ravine the majestic crown approach each other in bold curve make a glorious canopy through which the temper sunbeam pour silver the needle and gilding the massive bole and flowery park-like ground into a scene of enchantment on the most sunny slope the white-flowered fragrant chamoebatium be spread like a carpet brighten during early summer with the crimson sarcode the wild rose and innumerable violet and gilia not even in the shadiest nook will you find any rank untidy weed or unwholesome darkness on the north side of ridge the bole be more slender and the ground be mostly occupy by a underbrush of hazel ceanothus and flowering dogwood but never so densely as to prevent the traveler from saunter where he will while the crowning branch be never impenetrable to the ray of the sun and never so interblended as to lose they individuality view the forest from beneath or from some commanding ridge-top each tree present a study in itself and proclaim the surpass grandeur of the species yellow or silver pine -lrb- _ pinus ponderosa _ -rrb- the silver or yellow pine as it be commonly call rank second among the pine of the sierra as a lumber tree and almost rival the sugar pine in stature and nobleness of port because of its superior power of endure variation of climate and soil it have a more extensive range than any other conifer grow on the sierra on the western slope it be first meet at a elevation of about 2000 foot and extend nearly to the upper limit of the timber line thence cross the range by the lowest pass it descend to the eastern base and push out for a considerable distance into the hot volcanic plain grow bravely upon well-watered moraine gravelly lake basin arctic ridge and torrid lava-bed plant itself upon the lip of crater flourish vigorously even there and toss ripe cone among the ash and cinder of nature 's hearth the average size of full-grown tree on the western slope where it be associate with the sugar pine be a little less than 200 foot in height and from five to six foot in diameter though specimen may easily be find that be considerably larger i measure one grow at a elevation of 4000 foot in the valley of the merce that be a few inch over eight foot in diameter and 220 foot high where there be plenty of free sunshine and other condition be favorable it present a striking contrast in form to the sugar pine be a symmetrical spire form of a straight round trunk clothe with innumerable branch that be divide over and over again about one half of the trunk be commonly branchless but where it grow at all close three fourth or more become naked the tree present then a more slender and elegant shaft than any other tree in the wood the bark be mostly arrange in massive plate some of they measure four or five foot in length by eighteen inch in width with a thickness of three or four inch form a quite marked and distinguishing feature the needle be of a fine warm yellow-green color six to eight inch long firm and elastic and crowd in handsome radiant tassel on the upturn end of the branch the cone be about three or four inch long and two and a half wide grow in close sessile cluster among the leaf -lrb- illustration : pinus ponderosa -rrb- the species attain its noblest form in filled-up lake basin especially in those of the older yosemite and so prominent a part do it form of they grove that it may well be call the yosemite pine ripe specimen favorably situate be almost always 200 foot or more in height and the branch clothe the trunk nearly to the ground as see in the illustration the jeffrey variety attain its finest development in the northern portion of the range in the wide basin of the mccloud and pitt river where it form magnificent forest scarcely invade by any other tree it differ from the ordinary form in size be only about half as tall and in its redder and more closely furrowed bark grayish-green foliage less divide branch and larger cone but intermediate form come in which make a clear separation impossible although some botanist regard it as a distinct species it be this variety that climb storm-swept ridge and wander out among the volcano of the great basin whether expose to extreme of heat or cold it be dwarf like every other tree and become all knot and angle wholly unlike the majestic form we have be sketch old specimen bear cone about as big as pineapple may sometimes be find cling to rifted rock at a elevation of seven or eight thousand foot whose highest branch scarce reach above one 's shoulder -lrb- illustration : silver pine 210 foot high -lrb- the form grow in yosemite valley -rrb- -rrb- i have oftentimes feast on the beauty of these noble tree when they be tower in all they winter grandeur laden with snow -- one mass of bloom in summer too when the brown staminate cluster hang thick among the shimmering needle and the big purple bur be ripen in the mellow light but it be during cloudless wind-storm that these colossal pine be most impressively beautiful then they bow like willow they leaf streaming forward all in one direction and when the sun shine upon they at the require angle entire grove glow as if every leaf be burnish silver the fall of tropic light on the royal crown of a palm be a truly glorious spectacle the fervid sun-flood break upon the glossy leaf in long lance-ray like mountain water among boulder but to I there be something more impressive in the fall of light upon these silver pine it seem beat to the finest dust and be shed off in myriad of minute sparkle that seem to come from the very heart of the tree as if like rain fall upon fertile soil it have be absorb to reappear in flower of light this species also give forth the finest music to the wind after listen to it in all kind of wind night and day season after season i think i could approximate to my position on the mountain by this pine-music alone if you would catch the tone of separate needle climb a tree they be well temper and give forth no uncertain sound each stand out with no interference excepting during heavy gale then you may detect the click of one needle upon another readily distinguishable from they free wing-like hum some idea of they temper may be draw from the fact that notwithstanding they be so long the vibration that give rise to the peculiar shimmering of the light be make at the rate of about two hundred and fifty per minute when a sugar pine and one of this species equal in size be observe together the latter be see to be far more simple in manners more lithely graceful and its beauty be of a kind more easily appreciate but then it be on the other hand much less dignified and original in demeanor the silver pine seem eager to shoot aloft even while it be drowse in autumn sun-gold you may still detect a skyward aspiration but the sugar pine seem too unconsciously noble and too complete in every way to leave room for even a heavenward care dougla spruce -lrb- _ pseudotsuga douglasius _ -rrb- this tree be the king of the spruce as the sugar pine be king of pine it be by far the most majestic spruce i ever behold in any forest and one of the largest and longest live of the giant that flourish throughout the main pine belt often attain a height of nearly 200 foot and a diameter of six or seven where the growth be not too close the strong spreading branch come more than halfway down the trunk and these be hung with innumerable slender sway spray that be handsomely feathered with the short leaf which radiate at right angle all around they this vigorous spruce be ever beautiful welcome the mountain wind and the snow as well as the mellow summer light and maintain its youthful freshness undiminished from century to century through a thousand storm it make its finest appearance in the month of June and July the rich brown bud with which its spray be tip swell and break about this time reveal the young leaf which at first be bright yellow make the tree appear as if cover with gay blossom while the pendulous bracted cone with they shell-like scale be a constant adornment the young tree be mostly gather into beautiful family group each sapling exquisitely symmetrical the primary branch be whorled regularly around the axis generally in fives while each be drape with long feathery spray that descend in curve as free and as finely draw as those of fall water in oregon and washington it grow in dense forest grow tall and mast-like to a height of 300 foot and be greatly prize as a lumber tree but in the sierra it be scatter among other tree or form small grove seldom ascend higher than 5500 foot and never make what would be call a forest it be not particular in its choice of soil -- wet or dry smooth or rocky it make out to live well on they all two of the largest specimen i have measure be in yosemite valley one of which be more than eight foot in diameter and be grow upon the terminal moraine of the residual glacier that occupy the south fork canon the other be nearly as large grow upon angular block of granite that have be shake from the precipitous front of the liberty cap near the nevada fall no other tree seem so capable of adapt itself to earthquake talus and many of these rough boulder-slope be occupy by it almost exclusively especially in yosemite gorge moisten by the spray of waterfall incense cedar -lrb- _ libocedrus decurren _ -rrb- the incense cedar be another of the giant quite generally distribute throughout this portion of the forest without exclusively occupy any considerable area or even make extensive grove it ascend to about 5000 foot on the warmer hillside and reach the climate most congenial to it at about from 3000 to 4000 foot grow vigorously at this elevation on all kind of soil and in particular it be capable of endure more moisture about its root than any of its companion except only the sequoia the largest specimen be about 150 foot high and seven foot in diameter the bark be brown of a singularly rich tone very attractive to artist and the foliage be tint with a warmer yellow than that of any other evergreen in the wood cast you eye over the general forest from some ridge-top the color alone of its spiry summit be sufficient to identify it in any company in youth say up to the age of seventy or eighty year no other tree form so strictly taper a cone from top to bottom the branch swoop outward and downward in bold curve except the younger one near the top which aspire while the lowest droop to the ground and all spread out in flat ferny plume beautifully frond and imbricate upon one another as it become older it grow strikingly irregular and picturesque large special branch put out at right angle from the trunk form big stubborn elbow and then shoot up parallel with the axis very old tree be usually dead at the top the main axis protrude above ample mass of green plume gray and lichen-covered and drill full of acorn hole by the woodpecker the plume be exceedingly beautiful no wave fern-frond in shady dell be more unreservedly beautiful in form and texture or half so inspiring in color and spicy fragrance in its prime the whole tree be thatch with they so that they shed off rain and snow like a roof make fine mansion for storm-bound bird and mountaineer but if you would see the _ libocedrus _ in all its glory you must go to the wood in winter then it be laden with myriad of four-sided staminate cone about the size of wheat grain -- winter wheat -- produce a golden tinge and form a noble illustration of nature 's immortal vigor and virility the fertile cone be about three fourth of a inch long bear on the outside of the plumy branchlet where they serve to enrich still more the surpass beauty of this grand winter-blooming goldenrod -lrb- illustration : incense cedar in its prime -rrb- white silver fir -lrb- _ aby concolor _ -rrb- -lrb-

fir -- _ a concolor _ and _ a magnifica _ it extend with no marked interruption for 450 mile at a elevation of from 5000 to nearly 9000 foot above the sea in its youth _ a concolor _ be a charmingly symmetrical tree with branch regularly whorl in level collar around its whitish-gray axis which terminate in a strong hopeful shoot the leaf be in two horizontal row along branchlet that commonly be less than eight year old form handsome plume pinnate like the frond of fern the cone be grayish-green when ripe cylindrical about from three to four inch long by one and a half to two inch wide and stand upright on the upper branch full-grown tree favorably situate as to soil and exposure be about 200 foot high and five or six foot in diameter near the ground though larger specimen be by no means rare as old age creep on the bark become rougher and grayer the branch lose they exact regularity many be snow-bent or break off and the main axis often become double or otherwise irregular from accident to the terminal bud or shoot but throughout all the vicissitude of its life on the mountain come what may the noble grandeur of the species be patent to every eye magnificent silver fir or red fir -lrb- _ aby magnifica _ -rrb- this be the most charmingly symmetrical of all the giant of the sierra wood far surpass its companion species in this respect and easily distinguish from it by the purplish-red bark which be also more closely furrowed than that of the white and by its larger cone more regularly whorled and fronded branch and by its leaf which be shorter and grow all around the branchlet and point upward in size these two silver fir be about equal the _ magnifica _ perhaps a little the taller specimen from 200 to 250 foot high be not rare on well-ground moraine soil at a elevation of from 7500 to 8500 foot above sea-level the largest that i measure stand back three mile from the brink of the north wall of yosemite valley fifteen year ago it be 240 foot high with a diameter of a little more than five foot happy the man with the freedom and the love to climb one of these superb tree in full flower and fruit how admirable the forest-work of nature be then see to be as one make he way up through the midst of the broad fronded branch all arrange in exquisite order around the trunk like the whorled leaf of lily and each branch and branchlet about as strictly pinnate as the most symmetrical fern-frond the staminate cone be see grow straight downward from the under side of the young branch in lavish profusion make fine purple cluster amid the grayish-green foliage on the topmost branch the fertile cone be set firmly on end like small cask they be about six inch long three wide cover with a fine gray down and streak with crystal balsam that seem to have be pour upon each cone from above both the silver fir live 250 year or more when the condition about they be at all favorable some venerable patriarch may often be see heavily storm-marked towering in severe majesty above the rise generation with a protect grove of sapling press close around he foot each dress with such loving care that not a leaf seem want other company be make up of tree near the

plushy branch overlap along the middle and a crescent of smaller plume mix with fern and flower for a pillow form the very best bed imaginable the essence of the press leaf seem to fill every pore of one 's body the sound of fall water make a soothing hush while the space between the grand spire afford noble opening through which to gaze dreamily into the starry sky even in the matter of sensuous ease any combination of cloth steel spring and feather seem vulgar in comparison the fir wood be delightful sauntering-grounds at any time of year but most so in autumn then the noble tree be hush in the hazy light and drip with balsam the cone be ripe and the seed with they ample purple wing mottle the air like flock of butterfly while deer feed in the flowery opening between the grove and bird and squirrel in the branch make a pleasant stir which enrich the deep brooding calm of the wilderness and give a peculiar impressiveness to every tree no wonder the enthusiastic dougla go wild with joy when he first discover this species even in the sierra where so many noble evergreen challenge admiration we linger among these colossal fir with fresh love and extol they beauty again and again as if no other in the world could henceforth claim we regard -lrb- illustration : silver-fir forest grow on moraine of the hoffman and tenaya glacier -rrb- it be in these wood the great granite dome rise that be so striking and characteristic a feature of the sierra and here too we find the best of the garden meadow they lie level on the top of the divide ridge or sloping on the side of they embedded in the magnificent forest some of these meadow be in great part occupy by _ veratrumalba _ which here grow rank and tall with boat-shaped leaf thirteen inch long and twelve inch wide rib like those of cypripedium columbine grow on the drier margin with tall larkspur and lupine waist-deep in grass and sedge several species of castilleium also make a bright show in bed of blue and white violet and daisy but the glory of these forest meadow be a lily -- _ l parvum _ the flower be orange-colored and quite small the smallest i ever saw of the true lily but it be showy nevertheless for it be seven to eight foot high and wave magnificent raceme of ten to twenty flower or more over one 's head while it stand out in the open ground with just enough of grass and other plant about it to make a fringe for its foot and show it off to best advantage a dry spot a little way back from the margin of a silver fir lily garden make a glorious campground especially where the slope be toward the east and open a view of the distant peak along the summit of the range the tall lily be bring forward in all they glory by the light of you blaze camp-fire relieve against the outer darkness and the nearest of the tree with they whorled branch tower above you like larger lily and the sky see through the garden opening seem one vast meadow of white lily star in the morning everything be joyous and bright the delicious purple of the dawn change softly to daffodil yellow and white while the sunbeam pour through the pass between the peak give a margin of gold to each of they then the spire of the fir in the hollow of the middle region catch the glow and you camp grove be fill with light the bird begin to stir seek sunny branch on the edge of the meadow for sun-bath after the cold night and look for they breakfast every one of they as fresh as a lily and as charmingly arrayed innumerable insect begin to dance the deer withdraw from the open glade and ridge-top to they leafy hiding-place

everything great and small big tree -lrb- _ sequoia gigantea _ -rrb- between the heavy pine and silver fir belt we find the big tree the king of all the conifer in the world the noblest of a noble race it extend in a widely interrupted belt from a small grove on the middle fork of the american river to the head of deer creek a distance of about 260 mile the northern limit be near the thirty-ninth parallel the southern a little below the thirty-sixth and the elevation of the belt above the sea vary from about 5000 to 8000 foot from the american river grove to the forest on king 's river the species occur only in small isolate group so sparsely distribute along the belt that three of the gap in it be from forty to sixty mile wide but from king 's river southward the sequoia be not restricted to mere grove but extend across the broad rugged basin of the kaweah and tule river in noble forest a distance of nearly seventy mile the continuity of this part of the belt be break only by deep cañons the fresno the largest of the northern grove occupy a area of three or four square mile a short distance to the southward of the famous mariposa grove along the beveled rim of the cañon of the south fork of king 's river there be a majestic forest of sequoia about six mile long by two wide this be the northernmost assemblage of big tree that may fairly be call a forest descend the precipitous divide between the king 's river and kaweah you enter the grand forest that form the main continuous portion of the belt advance southward the giant become more and more irrepressibly exuberant heave they massive crown into the sky from every ridge and slope and wave onward in graceful compliance with the complicated topography of the region the finest of the kaweah section of the belt be on the broad ridge between marble creek and the middle fork and extend from the granite headland overlook the hot plain to within a few mile of the cool glacial fountain of the summit peak the extreme upper limit of the belt be reach between the middle and south fork of the kaweah at a elevation of 8400 foot but the finest block of big tree forest in the entire belt be on the north fork of tule river in the northern grove there be comparatively few young tree or sapling but here for every old storm-stricken giant there be many in all the glory of prime vigor and for each of these a crowd of eager hopeful young tree and sapling grow heartily on moraine rocky ledge along watercourse and in the moist alluvium of meadow seemingly in hot pursuit of eternal life but though the area occupy by the species increase so much from north to south there be no marked increase in the size of the tree a height of 275 foot and a diameter near the ground of about 20 foot be perhaps about the average size of full-grown tree favorably situate specimen 25 foot in diameter be not very rare and a few be nearly 300 foot high in the calaveras grove there be four tree over 300 foot in height the tallest of which by careful measurement be 325 foot the largest i have yet meet in the course of my exploration be a majestic old scar monument in the king 's river forest it be 35 foot 8 inch in diameter inside the bark four foot from the ground under the most favorable condition these giant probably live 5000 year or more though few of even the larger tree be more than half as old i never see a big tree that have die a natural death bar accident they seem to be immortal be exempt from all the disease that afflict and kill other tree unless destroy by man they live on indefinitely until burn smash by lightning or cast down by storm or by the give way of the ground on which they stand the age of one that be fell in the calaveras grove for the sake of have its stump for a dancing-floor be about 1300 year and its diameter measure across the stump 24 foot inside the bark another that be cut down in the king 's river forest be about the same size but nearly a thousand year older -lrb- 2200 year -rrb- though not a very old-looking tree it be fell to procure a section for exhibition and thus a opportunity be give to count its annual ring of growth the colossal scar monument in the king 's river forest mention above be burn half through and i spend a day in make a estimate of its age clear away the char surface with a ax and carefully count the annual ring with the aid of a pocket-lens the wood-ring in the section i lay bare be so involved and contorted in some place that i be not able to determine its age exactly but i count over 4000 ring which show that this tree be in its prime sway in the sierra wind when christ walk the earth no other tree in the world as far as i know have look down on so many century as the sequoia or open such impressive and suggestive view into history so exquisitely harmonious and finely balanced be even the very mightiest of these monarch of the wood in all they proportion and circumstance there never be anything overgrown or monstrous-looking about they on come in sight of they for the first time you be likely to say oh see what beautiful noble-looking tree be tower there among the fir and pine -- they grandeur be in the mean time in great part invisible but to the living eye it will be manifest sooner or later steal slowly on the sens like the grandeur of niagara or the lofty yosemite dome they great size be hide from the inexperienced observer as long as they be see at a distance in one harmonious view when however you approach they and walk round they you begin to wonder at they colossal size and seek a measuring-rod these giant bulge considerably at the base but not more than be require for beauty and safety and the only reason that this bulge seem in some case excessive be that only a comparatively small section of the shaft be see at once in near view one that i measure in the king 's river forest be 25 foot in diameter at the ground and 10 foot in diameter 200 foot above the ground show that the taper of the trunk as a whole be charmingly fine and when you stand back far enough to see the massive column from the swell instep to the lofty summit dissolve in a dome of verdure you rejoice in the unrivaled display of combined grandeur and beauty about a hundred foot or more of the trunk be usually branchless but its massive simplicity be relieve by the bark furrow which instead of make a irregular network run evenly parallel like the fluting of a architectural column and to some extent by tuft of slender spray that wave lightly in the wind and cast fleck of shade seem to have be pin on here and there for the sake of beauty only the young tree have slender simple branch down to the ground put on with strict regularity sharply aspire at the top horizontal about half-way down and droop in handsome curve at the base by the time the sapling be five or six hundred year old this spiry feathery juvenile habit merge into the firm round dome form of middle age which in turn take on the eccentric picturesqueness of old age no other tree in the sierra forest have foliage so densely mass or present outline so firmly draw and so steadily subordinate to a special type a knotty ungovernable-looking branch five to eight foot thick may be see push out abruptly from the smooth trunk as if sure to throw the regular curve into confusion but as soon as the general outline be reach it stop short and dissolve in spread boss of law-abiding spray just as if every tree be grow beneath some huge invisible bell-glass against whose side every branch be be press and mold yet somehow indulge in so many small departure from the regular form that there be still a appearance of freedom the foliage of the sapling be dark bluish-green in color while the older tree ripen to a warm brownish-yellow tint like libocedrus the bark be rich cinnamon-brown purplish in young tree and in shady portion of the old while the ground be cover with brown leaf and bur form color-mass of extraordinary richness not to mention the flower and underbrush that rejoice about they in they season walk the sequoia wood at any time of year and you will say they be the most beautiful and majestic on earth beautiful and impressive contrast meet you everywhere : the color of tree and flower rock and sky light and shade strength and frailty endurance and evanescence tangle of supple hazel-bush tree-pillar about as rigid as granite dome rose and violet the smallest of they kind bloom around the foot of the giant and rug of the lowly chamaebatium where the sunbeam fall then in winter the tree themselves break forth in bloom myriad of small four-sided staminate cone crowd the end of the slender spray color the whole tree and when ripe dust the air and the ground with golden pollen the fertile cone be bright grass-green measure about two inch in length by one and a half in thickness and be make up of about forty firm rhomboidal scale densely pack with from five to eight seed at the base of each a single cone therefore contain from two to three hundred seed which be about a fourth of a inch long by three sixteenth wide include a thin flat margin that make they go glance and waver in they fall like a boy 's kite the fruitfulness of sequoia may be illustrate by two specimen branch one and a half and two inch in diameter on which i count 480 cone no other sierra conifer produce nearly so many seed million be ripened annually by a single tree and in a fruitful year the product of one of the northern grove would be enough to plant all the mountain-range of the world nature take care however that not one seed in a million shall germinate at all and of those that do perhaps not one in ten thousand be suffer to live through the many vicissitude of storm drought fire and snow-crushing that beset they youth the dougla squirrel be the happy harvester of most of the sequoia cone out of every hundred perhaps ninety fall to he share and unless cut off by he ivory sickle they shake out they seed and remain on the tree for many year watch the squirrel at they harvest work in the indian summer be one of the most delightful diversion imaginable the wood be calm and the ripe color be blaze in all they glory the cone-laden tree stand motionless in the warm hazy air and you may see the crimson-crested woodcock the prince of sierra woodpecker drill some dead limb or fall trunk with he bill and ever and anon fill the glen with he happy cackle the humming-bird too dwell in these noble wood and may oftentimes be see glancing among the flower or rest wing-weary on some leafless twig here also be the familiar robin of the orchard and the brown and grizzly bear so obviously fit for these majestic solitude and the dougla squirrel make more hilarious exuberant vital stir than all the bear bird and hum wing together as soon as any accident happen to the crown of these sequoia such as be stricken off by lightning or break by storm then the branch beneath the wound no matter how situate seem to be excite like a colony of bee that have lose they queen and become anxious to repair the damage limb that have grow outward for century at right angle to the trunk begin to turn upward to assist in make a new crown each speedily assume the special form of true summit even in the case of mere stump burn half through some mere ornamental tuft will try to go aloft and do its best as a leader in form a new head group of two or three of these grand tree be often find standing close together the seed from which they spring have probably grow on ground clear for they reception by the fall of a large tree of a former generation these patch of fresh mellow soil beside the upturned root of the fall giant may be from forty to sixty foot wide and they be speedily occupy by seedling out of these seedling-thicket perhaps two or three may become tree form those close group call three grace loving couple etc for even suppose that the tree should stand twenty or thirty foot apart while young by the time they be full-grown they trunk will touch and crowd against each other and even appear as one in some case it be generally believe that this grand sequoia be once far more widely distribute over the sierra but after long and careful study i have come to the conclusion that it never be at least since the close of the glacial period because a diligent search along the margin of the grove and in the gap between fail to reveal a single trace of its previous existence beyond its present bound notwithstanding i feel confident that if every sequoia in the range be to die to-day numerous monument of they existence would remain of so imperishable a nature as to be available for the student more than ten thousand year hence in the first place we might notice that no species of coniferous tree in the range keep its individual so well together as sequoia a mile be perhaps the greatest distance of any straggler from the main body and all of those straggler that have come under my observation be young instead of old monumental tree relic of a more extended growth again sequoia trunk frequently endure for century after they fall i have a specimen block cut from a fall trunk which be hardly distinguishable from specimen cut from live tree although the old trunk-fragment from which it be derive have lie in the damp forest more than 380 year probably thrice as long the time measure in the case be simply this : when the ponderous trunk to which the old vestige belong fall it sink itself into the ground thus make a long straight ditch and in the middle of this ditch a silver fir be grow that be now four foot in diameter and 380 year old as determine by cut it half through and count the ring thus demonstrate that the remnant of the trunk that make the ditch have lie on the ground _ more _ than 380 year for it be evident that to find the whole time we must add to the 380 year the time that the vanish portion of the trunk lay in the ditch before be burn out of the way plus the time that pass before the seed from which the monumental fir spring fall into the prepared soil and take root now because sequoia trunk be never wholly consume in one forest fire and those fire recur only at considerable interval and because sequoia ditch after be clear be often left unplanted for century it become evident that the trunk remnant in question may probably have lie a thousand year or more and this instance be by no mean a rare one but admit that upon those area suppose to have be once cover with sequoia every tree may have fall and every trunk may have be burn or bury leave not a remnant many of the ditch make by the fall of the ponderous trunk and the bowl make by they upturn root would remain patent for thousand of year after the last vestige of the trunk that make they have vanish much of this ditch-writing would no doubt be quickly efface by the flood-action of overflow stream and rain-washing but no inconsiderable portion would remain enduringly engrave on ridge-top beyond such destructive action for where all the condition be favorable it be almost imperishable _ now these historic ditch and root bowl occur in all the present sequoia grove and forest but as far as i have observe not the faintest vestige of one present itself outside of they _ we therefore conclude that the area cover by sequoia have not be diminish during the last eight or ten thousand year and probably not at all in post-glacial time _ be the species verge to extinction what be its relation to climate soil and associate tree _ all the phenomenon bear on these question also throw light as we shall endeavor to show upon the peculiar distribution of the species and sustain the conclusion already arrive at on the question of extension in the northern group as we have see there be few young tree or sapling grow up around the fail old one to perpetuate the race and in as much as those aged sequoia so nearly childless be the only one commonly know the species to most observer seem doom to speedy extinction as be nothing more than a expire remnant vanquish in the so-called struggle for life by pine and fir that have drive it into its last stronghold in moist glen where climate be exceptionally favorable but the language of the majestic continuous forest of the south create a very different impression no tree of all the forest be more enduringly establish in concordance with climate and soil it grow heartily everywhere -- on moraine rocky ledge along watercourse and in the deep moist alluvium of meadow with a multitude of seedling and sapling crowd up around the aged seemingly abundantly able to maintain the forest in prime vigor for every old storm-stricken tree there be one or more in all the glory of prime and for each of these many young tree and crowd of exuberant sapling so that if all the tree of any section of the main sequoia forest be range together accord to age a very promising curve would be present all the way up from last year 's seedling to giant and with the young and middle-aged portion of the curve many time longer than the old portion even as far north as the fresno i count 536 sapling and seedling grow promisingly upon a piece of rough avalanche soil not exceed two acre in area this soil bed be about seven year old and have be seed almost simultaneously by pine fir libocedrus and sequoia present a simple and instructive illustration of the struggle for life among the rival species and it be interesting to note that the condition thus far affect they have enable the young sequoia to gain a marked advantage in every instance like the above i have observe that the seedling sequoia be capable of grow on both drier and wetter soil than its rival but require more sunshine than they the latter fact be clearly show wherever a sugar pine or fir be grow in close contact with a sequoia of about equal age and size and equally expose to the sun the branch of the latter in such case be always less leafy toward the south however where the sequoia become _ more _ exuberant and numerous the rival tree become _ less _ so and where they mix with sequoia they mostly grow up beneath they like slender grass among stalk of indian corn upon a bed of sandy flood-soil i count ninety-four sequoia from one to twelve foot high on a patch of ground once occupy by four large sugar pine which lay crumble beneath they -- a instance of condition which have enable sequoia to crowd out the pine i also note eighty-six vigorous sapling upon a piece of fresh ground prepare for they reception by fire thus fire the great destroyer of sequoia also furnish bare virgin ground one of the condition essential for its growth from the seed fresh ground be however furnish in sufficient quantity for the constant renewal of the forest without fire viz by the fall of old tree the soil be thus upturned and mellow and many tree be plant for every one that fall land-slip and flood also give rise to bare virgin ground and a tree now and then owe its existence to a burrow wolf or squirrel but the most regular supply of fresh soil be furnish by the fall of aged tree the climatic change in progress in the sierra bearing on the tenure of tree life be entirely misapprehend especially as to the time and the means employ by nature in effect they it be constantly assert in a vague way that the sierra be vastly wetter than now and that the increase drought will of itself extinguish sequoia leave its ground to other tree suppose capable of nourish in a drier climate but that sequoia can and do grow on as dry ground as any of its present rival be manifest in a thousand place why then it will be ask be sequoia always find in greatest abundance in well-watered place where stream be exceptionally abundant simply because a growth of sequoia create those stream the thirsty mountaineer know well that in every sequoia grove he will find run water but it be a mistake to suppose that the water be the cause of the grove be there on the contrary the grove be the cause of the water be there drain off the water and the tree will remain but cut off the tree and the stream will vanish never be cause more completely mistake for effect than in the case of these related phenomenon of sequoia wood and perennial stream and i confess that at first i share in the blunder when attention be call to the method of sequoia stream-making it will be apprehend at once the root of this immense tree fill the ground form a thick sponge that absorb and hold back the rain and melting snow only allow they to ooze and flow gently indeed every fall leaf and rootlet as well as long clasping root and prostrate trunk may be regard as a dam hoard the bounty of storm-cloud and dispense it as blessing all through the summer instead of allow it to go headlong in short-lived flood evaporation be also check by the dense foliage to a greater extent than by any other sierra tree and the air be entangled in mass and broad sheet that be quickly saturate while thirsty wind be not allow to go sponge and lick along the ground so great be the retention of water in many place in the main belt that bog and meadow be create by the killing of the tree a single trunk fall across a stream in the wood form a dam 200 foot long and from ten to thirty foot high give rise to a pond which kill the tree within its reach these dead tree fall in turn thus make a clearing while sediment gradually accumulate change the pond into a bog or meadow for a growth of carice and sphagnum in some instance a series of small bog or meadow rise above one another on a hillside which be gradually merge into one another form sloping bog or meadow which make striking feature of sequoia wood and since all the tree that have fall into they have be preserve they contain record of the generation that have pass since they begin to form since then it be a fact that thousand of sequoia be grow thriftily on what be term dry ground and even cling like mountain pine to rift in granite precipice and since it have also be show that the extra moisture find in connection with the denser growth be a effect of they presence instead of a cause of they presence then the notion as to the former extension of the species and its near approach to extinction base upon its suppose dependence on greater moisture be see to be erroneous the decrease in the rain - and snow-fall since the close of the glacial period in the sierra be much less than be commonly guess the highest post-glacial watermark be well preserve in all the upper river channel and they be not greatly higher than the spring floodmark of the present show conclusively that no extraordinary decrease have take place in the volume of the upper tributary of post-glacial sierra stream since they come into existence but in the mean time eliminate all this complicated question of climatic change the plain fact remain that _ the present rain - and snow-fall be abundantly sufficient for the luxuriant growth of sequoia forest _ indeed all my observation tend to show that in a prolonged drought the sugar pine and fir would perish before the sequoia not alone because of the greater longevity of individual tree but because the species can endure more drought and make the most of whatever moisture fall again if the restriction and irregular distribution of the species be interpret as a result of the desiccation of the range then instead of increase as it do in individual toward the south where the rainfall be less it should diminish if then the peculiar distribution of sequoia have not be govern by superior condition of soil as to fertility or moisture by what have it be govern in the course of my study i observe that the northern grove the only one i be at first acquaint with be locate on just those portion of the general forest soil-belt that be first lay bare toward the close of the glacial period when the ice-sheet begin to break up into individual glacier and while search the wide basin of the san joaquin and try to account for the absence of sequoia where every condition seem favorable for its growth it occur to I that this remarkable gap in the sequoia belt be located exactly in the basin of the vast ancient _ mer de glace _ of the san joaquin and king 's river basin which pour its frozen flood to the plain feed by the snow that fall on more than fifty mile of the summit i then perceive that the next great gap in the belt to the northward forty mile wide extend between the calavera and tuolumne grove occur in the basin of the great ancient _ mer de glace _ of the tuolumne and stanislaus basin and that the smaller gap between the merce and mariposa grove occur in the basin of the smaller glacier of the merce _ the wider the ancient glacier the wider the corresponding gap in the sequoia belt _ finally pursue my investigation across the basin of the kaweah and tule i discover that the sequoia belt attain its greatest development just where owe to the topographical peculiarity of the region the ground have be most perfectly protect from the main ice-river that continue to pour past from the summit fountain long after the smaller local glacier have be melt take now a general view of the belt beginning at the south we see that the majestic ancient glacier be shed off right and leave down the valley of kern and king 's river by the lofty protective spur outspread embracingly above the warm sequoia-filled basin of the kaweah and tule then next northward occur the wide sequoia-less channel or basin of the ancient san joaquin and king 's river _ mer de glace _ then the warm protected spot of fresno and mariposa grove then the sequoia-less channel of the ancient merced glacier next the warm sheltered ground of the merce and tuolumne grove then the sequoia-less channel of the grand ancient _ mer de glace _ of the tuolumne and stanislaus then the warm old ground of the calavera and stanislaus grove it appear therefore that just where at a certain period in the history of the sierra the glacier be not there the sequoia be and just where the glacier be there the sequoia be not what the other condition may have be that enable sequoia to establish itself upon these oldest and warmest portion of the main glacial soil-belt i can not say i might venture to state however in this connection that since the sequoia forest present a more and more ancient aspect as they extend southward i be incline to think that the species be distribute from the south while the sugar pine its great rival in the northern grove seem to have come around the head of the sacramento valley and down the sierra from the north consequently when the sierra soil-bed be first throw open to preemption on the melting of the ice-sheet the sequoia may have establish itself along the available portion of the south half of the range prior to the arrival of the sugar pine while the sugar pine take possession of the north half prior to the arrival of sequoia but however much uncertainty may attach to this branch of the question there be no obscuring shadow upon the grand general relationship we have point out between the present distribution of sequoia and the ancient glacier of the sierra and when we bear in mind that all the present forest of the sierra be young grow on moraine soil recently deposit and that the flank of the range itself with all its landscape be new-born recently sculpture and bring to the light of day from beneath the ice mantle of the glacial winter then a thousand lawless mystery disappear and broad harmony take they place but although all the observe phenomenon bear on the post-glacial history of this colossal tree point to the conclusion that it never be more widely distribute on the sierra since the close of the glacial epoch that its present forest be scarcely past prime if indeed they have reach prime that the post-glacial day of the species be probably not half do yet when from a wider outlook the vast antiquity of the genus be consider and its ancient richness in species and individual compare we sierra giant and _ sequoia semperviren _ of the coast range the only other live species of sequoia with the twelve fossil species already discover and describe by heer and lesquereux some of which seem to have flourish over vast area in the arctic region and in europe and we own territory during tertiary and cretaceous time -- then indeed it become plain that we two survive species restricted to narrow belt within the limit of californium be mere remnant of the genus both as to species and individual and that they probably be verge to extinction but the verge of a period beginning in cretaceous time may have a breadth of ten of thousand of year not to mention the possible existence of condition calculate to multiply and reëxtend both species and individual this however be a branch of the question into which i do not now purpose to enter in study the fate of we forest king we have thus far consider the action of purely natural cause only but unfortunately _ man _ be in the wood and waste and pure destruction be make rapid headway if the importance of forest be at all understand even from a economic standpoint they preservation would call forth the most watchful attention of government only of late year by means of forest reservation have the simplest groundwork for available legislation be lay while in many of the finest grove every species of destruction be still move on with accelerate speed in the course of my exploration i find no fewer than five mill located on or near the lower edge of the sequoia belt all of which be cut considerable quantity of big tree lumber most of the fresno group be doom to feed the mill recently erect near they and a company of lumberman be now cut the magnificent forest on king 's river in these mill operation waste far exceed use for after the choice young manageable tree on any give spot have be fell the wood be fire to clear the ground of limb and refuse with reference to further operation and of course most of the seedling and sapling be destroy these mill ravages however be small as compare with the comprehensive destruction cause by sheepman incredible number of sheep be drive to the mountain pasture every summer and they course be ever mark by desolation every wild garden be trodden down the shrub be strip of leaf as if devour by locust and the wood be burn run fire be set everywhere with a view to clear the ground of prostrate trunk to facilitate the movement of the flock and improve the pasture the entire forest belt be thus sweep and devastate from one extremity of the range to the other and with the exception of the resinous _ pinus contorta _ sequoia suffer most of all indian burn off the underbrush in certain locality to facilitate deer-hunting mountaineer and lumberman carelessly allow they camp-fire to run but the fire of the sheepman or _ muttoneer _ form more than ninety per cent of all destructive fire that range the sierra forest it appear therefore that notwithstanding we forest king might live on gloriously in nature 's keep it be rapidly vanish before the fire and steel of man and unless protective measure be speedily invent and apply in a few decade at the farthest all that will be leave of _ sequoia gigantea _ will be a few hack and scar monument two-leaved or tamarack pine -lrb- _ pinus contorta _ var_marrayana _ -rrb- this species form the bulk of the alpine forest extend along the range above the fir zone up to a height of from 8000 to 9500 foot above the sea grow in beautiful order upon moraine that be scarcely change as yet by post-glacial weather compare with the giant of the lower zone this be a small tree seldom attain a height of a hundred foot the largest specimen i ever measure be ninety foot in height and a little over six in diameter four foot from the ground the average height of mature tree throughout the entire belt be probably not far from fifty or sixty foot with a diameter of two foot it be a well-proportioned rather handsome little pine with grayish-brown bark and crooked much-divided branch which cover the greater portion of the trunk not so densely however as to prevent its be see the lower limb curve downward gradually take a horizontal position about half-way up the trunk then aspire more and more toward the summit thus form a sharp conical top the foliage be short and rigid two leaf in a fascicle arrange in comparatively long cylindrical tassel at the end of the tough up-curving branchlet the cone be about two inch long grow in stiff cluster among the needle without make any striking effect except while very young when they be of a vivid crimson color and the whole tree appear to be dot with brilliant flower the sterile cone be still more showy on account of they great abundance often give a reddish-yellow tinge to the whole mass of the foliage and fill the air with pollen no other pine on the range be so regularly plant as this one moraine forest sweep along the side of the high rocky valley for mile without interruption still strictly speak they be not dense for fleck of sunshine and flower find they way into the darkest place where the tree grow tallest and thickest tall nutritious grass be specially abundant beneath they grow over all the ground in sunshine and shade over extensive area like a farmer 's crop and serve as pasture for the multitude of sheep that be drive from the arid plain every summer as soon as the snow be melt the two-leaved pine more than any other be subject to destruction by fire the thin bark be streak and sprinkle with resin as though it have be shower down upon it like rain so that even the green tree catch fire readily and during strong wind whole forest be destroy the flame leap from tree to tree form one continuous belt of roar fire that go surge and race onward above the bend wood like the grass-fire of a prairie during the calm dry season of indian summer the fire creep quietly along the ground feeding on the dry needle and bur then arrive at the foot of a tree the resiny bark be ignite and the heated air ascend in a powerful current increase in velocity and drag the flame swiftly upward then the leaf catch fire and a immense column of flame beautifully spire on the edge and tint a rose-purple hue rush aloft thirty or forty foot above the top of the tree form a grand spectacle especially on a dark night it last however only a few seconds vanish with magical rapidity to be succeed by other along the fire-line at irregular interval for week at a time -- tree after tree flash and darken leave the trunk and branch hardly scar the heat however be sufficient to kill the tree and in a few year the bark shrivel and fall off belt mile in extent be thus kill and leave standing with the branch on peel and rigid appear gray in the distance like misty cloud later the branch drop off leave a forest of bleached spar at length the root decay and the forlorn trunk be blow down during some storm and pile one upon another encumber the ground until they be consume by the next fire and leave it ready for a fresh crop the endurance of the species be show by its wander occasionally out over the lava plain with the yellow pine and climb moraineless mountain-side with the dwarf pine cling to any chance support in rift and crevice of storm-beaten rock -- always however show the effect of such hardship in every feature down in sheltered lake hollow on bed of rich alluvium it vary so far from the common form as frequently to be take for a distinct species here it grow in dense sod like grass from forty to eighty foot high bend all together to the breeze and whirling in eddy gust more lithely than any other tree in the wood i have frequently find specimen fifty foot high less than five inch in diameter be thus slender and at the same time well clad with leafy bough it be oftentimes bent to the ground when laden with soft snow form beautiful arch in endless variety some of which last until the melting of the snow in spring mountain pine -lrb- _ pinus monticolum _ -rrb- the mountain pine be king of the alpine wood brave hardy and long-lived tower grandly above its companion and become stronger and more impose just where other species begin to crouch and disappear at its best it be usually about ninety foot high and five or six in diameter though a specimen be often meet considerably larger than this the trunk be as massive and as suggestive of enduring strength as that of a oak about two third of the trunk be commonly free of limb but close fringy tuft of spray occur all the way down like those which adorn the colossal shaft of sequoia the bark be deep reddish-brown upon tree that occupy expose situation near its upper limit and furrowed rather deeply the main furrow run nearly parallel with each other and connect by conspicuous cross furrow which with one exception be as far as i have notice peculiar to this species the cone be from four to eight inch long slender cylindrical and somewhat curved resemble those of the common white pine of the atlantic coast they grow in cluster of about from three to six or seven become pendulous as they increase in weight chiefly by the bend of the branch this species be nearly related to the sugar pine and though not half so tall it constantly suggest its noble relative in the way that it extend its long arm and in general habit the mountain pine be first meet on the upper margin of the fir zone grow singly in a subdue inconspicuous form in what appear as chance situation without make much impression on the general forest continue up through the two-leaved pine in the same scattered growth it begin to show its character and at a elevation of about 10000 foot attain its noblest development near the middle of the range toss its tough arm in the frosty air welcome storm and feed on they and reach the grand old age of 1000 year juniper or red cedar -lrb- _ juniperus occidentali _ -rrb- the juniper be preëminently a rock tree occupy the baldest dome and pavement where there be scarcely a handful of soil at a height of from 7000 to 9500 foot in such situation the trunk be frequently over eight foot in diameter and not much more in height the top be almost always dead in old tree and great stubborn limb push out horizontally that be mostly broken and bare at the end but densely cover and embed here and there with bossy mound of gray foliage some be mere weathered stump as broad as long decorate with a few leafy spray remind one of the crumble tower of some ancient castle scantily drape with ivy only upon the head water of the carson have i find this species establish on good moraine soil here it flourish with the silver and two-leaved pine in great beauty and luxuriance attain a height of from forty to sixty foot and manifest but little of that rocky angularity so characteristic a feature throughout the greater portion of its range two of the largest grow at the head of hope valley measure twenty-nine foot three inch and twenty-five foot six inch in circumference respectively four foot from the ground the bark be of a bright cinnamon color and in thrifty tree beautifully braid and reticulate flake off in thin lustrous ribbon that be sometimes use by indian for tent-mat its fine color and odd picturesqueness always catch a artist 's eye but to I the juniper seem a singularly dull and taciturn tree never speak to one 's heart i have spend many a day and night in its company in all kind of weather and have ever find it silent cold and rigid like a column of ice its broad stumpiness of course preclude all possibility of wave or even shake but it be not this rocky steadfastness that constitute its silence in calm sun-day the sugar pine preach the grandeur of the mountain like a apostle without move a leaf -lrb- illustration : juniper or red cedar -rrb- on level rock it die standing and waste insensibly out of existence like granite the wind exert about as little control over it alive or dead as it do over a glacier boulder some be undoubtedly over 2000 year old all the tree of the alpine wood suffer more or less from avalanche the two-leaved pine most of all gap two or three hundred yard wide extend from the upper limit of the tree-line to the bottom of valley and lake basin be of common occurrence in all the upper forest resemble the clearing of settler in the old backwoods scarcely a tree be spare even the soil be scrape away while the thousand of uproot pine and spruce be pile upon one another head downward and tuck snugly in along the side of the clearing in two windrow like lateral moraine the pine lie with branch wilt and droop like weed not so the burly juniper after brave in silence the storm of perhaps a dozen or twenty century they seem in this they last calamity to become somewhat communicative make sign of a very unwilling acceptance of they fate hold themselves well up from the ground on knee and elbow seemingly ill at ease and anxious like stubborn wrestler to rise again hemlock spruce -lrb- _ tsuga pattoniana _ -rrb- the hemlock spruce be the most singularly beautiful of all the californium conifera so slender be its axis at the top that it bend over and droop like the stalk of a nodding lily the branch droop also and divide into innumerable slender wave spray which be arrange in a varied eloquent harmony that be wholly indescribable its cone be purple and hang free in the form of little tassel two inch long from all the spray from top to bottom though exquisitely delicate and feminine in expression it grow best where the snow lie deepest far up in the region of storm at a elevation of from 9000 to 9500 foot on frosty northern slope but it be capable of grow considerably higher say 10500 foot the tallest specimen grow in sheltered hollow somewhat beneath the heaviest wind-current be from eighty to a hundred foot high and from two to four foot in diameter the very largest specimen i ever find be nineteen foot seven inch in circumference four foot from the ground grow on the edge of lake hollow at a elevation of 9250 foot above the level of the sea at the age of twenty or thirty year it become fruitful and hang out its beautiful purple cone at the end of the slender spray where they swing free in the breeze and contrast delightfully with the cool green foliage they be translucent when young and they beauty be delicious after they be fully ripe they spread they shell-like scale and allow the brown-winged seed to fly in the mellow air while the empty cone remain to beautify the tree until the come of a fresh crop -lrb- illustration : storm-beaten hemlock spruce forty foot high -rrb- the staminate cone of all the conifera be beautiful grow in bright cluster yellow and rise and crimson those of the hemlock spruce be the most beautiful of all form little conelet of blue flower each on a slender stem under all condition sheltered or storm-beaten well-fed or ill-fed this tree be singularly graceful in habit even at its highest limit upon expose ridge-top though compel to crouch in dense thicket huddle close together as if for mutual protection it still manage to throw out its spray in irrepressible loveliness while on well-ground moraine soil it develop a perfectly tropical luxuriance of foliage and fruit and be the very loveliest tree in the forest poise in thin white sunshine clothe with branch from head to foot yet not in the faintest degree heavy or bunchy it tower in unassuming majesty drooping as if unaffected with the aspiring tendency of its race love the ground while transparently conscious of heaven and joyously receptive of its blessing reach out its branch like sensitive tentacle feel the light and revel in it no other of we alpine conifer so finely veil its strength its delicate branch yield to the mountain ' gentlest breath yet be it strong to meet the wildest onset of the gale -- strong not in resistance but compliance bow snow-laden to the ground gracefully accept burial month after month in the darkness beneath the heavy mantle of winter when the first soft snow begin to fall the flake lodge in the leaf weigh down the branch against the trunk then the axis bend yet lower and lower until the slender top touch the ground thus form a fine ornamental arch the snow still fall lavishly and the whole tree be at length bury to sleep and rest in its beautiful grave as though dead entire grove of young tree from ten to forty foot high be thus bury every winter like slender grass but like the violet and daisy which the heaviest snow crush not they be safe it be as though this be only nature 's method of put she darling to sleep instead of leave they expose to the bite storm of winter thus warmly wrap they await the summer resurrection the snow become soft in the sunshine and freeze at night make the mass hard and compact like ice so that during the month of April and may you can ride a horse over the prostrate grove without catch sight of a single leaf at length the down-pouring sunshine set they free first the elastic top of the arch begin to appear then one branch after another each spring loose with a gentle rustling sound and at length the whole tree with the assistance of the wind gradually unbend and rise and settle back into its place in the warm air as dry and feathery and fresh as young fern just out of the coil some of the finest grove i have yet find be on the southern slope of lassen 's butte there be also many charming company on the head water of the tuolumne merce and san joaquin and in general the species be so far from be rare that you can scarcely fail to find grove of considerable extent in cross the range choose what pass you may the mountain pine grow beside it and more frequently the two-leaved species but there be many beautiful group numbering 1000 individual or more without a single intruder i wish i have space to write more of the surpass beauty of this favorite spruce every tree-lover be sure to regard it with special admiration apathetic mountaineer even seek only game or gold stop to gaze on first meeting it and mutter to themselves : that be a mighty pretty tree some of they add d -- d pretty in autumn when its cone be ripe the little striped tamia and the dougla squirrel and the clark crow make a happy stir in its grove the deer love to lie down beneath its spreading branch bright stream from the snow that be always near ripple through its grove and bryanthus spread precious carpet in its shade but the best word only hint its charm come to the mountain and see dwarf pine -lrb- _ pinus albicauli _ -rrb- this species form the extreme edge of the timber line throughout nearly the whole extent of the range on both flank it be first meet grow in company with _ pinus contorta _ var _ murrayana _ on the upper margin of the belt as a erect tree from fifteen to thirty foot high and from one to two foot in thickness thence it go straggle up the flank of the summit peak upon moraine or crumble ledge wherever it can obtain a foothold to a elevation of from 10000 to 12000 foot where it dwarf to a mass of crumpled prostrate branch cover with slender upright shoot each tip with a short close-packed tassel of leave the bark be smooth and purplish in some place almost white the fertile cone grow in rigid cluster upon the upper branch dark chocolate in color while young and bear beautiful pearly seed about the size of pea most of which be eat by two species of tamia and the notable clark crow the staminate cone occur in cluster about a inch wide down among the leaf and as they be color bright rose-purple they give rise to a lively flowery appearance little look for in such a tree -lrb- illustration : group of erect dwarf pine -rrb- pine be commonly regard as sky-loving tree that must necessarily aspire or die this species form a marked exception creep lowly in compliance with the most rigorous demand of climate yet endure bravely to a more advanced age than many of its lofty relative in the sun-land below see from a distance it would never be take for a tree of any kind yonder for example be cathedral peak some three mile away with a scatter growth of this pine creep like moss over the roof and around the beveled edge of the north gable nowhere give any hint of a ascend axis when approach quite near it still appear matted and heathy and be so low that one experience no great difficulty in walk over the top of it yet it be seldom absolutely prostrate at its lowest usually attain a height of three or four foot with a main trunk and branch outspread and intertangle above it as if in ascend they have be check by a ceiling against which they have grow and be compel to spread horizontally the winter snow be indeed such a ceiling lasting half the year while the press shear surface be make yet smoother by violent wind arm with cut sand-grain that beat down any shoot that offer to rise much above the general level and carve the dead trunk and branch in beautiful pattern during stormy night i have often camp snugly beneath the interlace arch of this little pine the needle which have accumulate for century make fine bed a fact well know to other mountaineer such as deer and wild sheep who paw out oval hollow and lie beneath the larger tree in safe and comfortable concealment -lrb- illustration : a dwarf pine -rrb- the longevity of this lowly dwarf be far greater than would be guess here for example be a specimen grow at a elevation of 10700 foot which seem as though it might be pluck up by the root for it be only three and a half inch in diameter and its topmost tassel be hardly three foot above the ground cut it half through and count the annual ring with the aid of a lens we find its age to be no less than 255 year here be another tell specimen about the same height 426 year old whose trunk be only six inch in diameter and one of its supple branchlet hardly a eighth of a inch in diameter inside the bark be seventy-five year old and so fill with oily balsam and so well seasoned by storm that we may tie it in knot like a whip-cord white pine -lrb- _ pinus flexili _ -rrb- this species be widely distribute throughout the rocky mountain and over all the higher of the many range of the great basin between the wahsatch mountain and the sierra where it be know as white pine in the sierra it be sparsely scatter along the eastern flank from bloody cañon southward nearly to the extremity of the range opposite the village of lone pine nowhere form any appreciable portion of the general forest from its peculiar position in loose straggle party it seem to have be derive from the basin range to the eastward where it be abundant it be a larger tree than the dwarf pine at a elevation of about 9000 foot above the sea it often attain a height of forty or fifty foot and a diameter of from three to five foot the cone open freely when ripe and be twice as large as those of the _ albicauli _ and the foliage and branch be more open have a tendency to sweep out in free wild curve like those of the mountain pine to which it be closely ally it be seldom find lower than 9000 foot above sea-level but from this elevation it push upward over the roughest ledge to the extreme limit of tree-growth where in its dwarf storm-crushed condition it be more like the white-barked species throughout utah and nevada it be one of the principal timber-tree great quantity be cut every year for the mine the famous white pine mining district white pine city and the white pine mountain have derive they name from it needle pine -lrb- _ pinus arista _ -rrb- this species be restrict in the sierra to the southern portion of the range about the head water of king and kern river where it form extensive forest and in some place accompany the dwarf pine to the extreme limit of tree-growth it be first meet at a elevation of between 9000 and 10000 foot and run up to 11000 without seem to suffer greatly from the climate or the leanness of the soil it be a much finer tree than the dwarf pine instead of grow in clump and low heathy mat it manage in some way to maintain a erect position and usually stand single wherever the young tree be at all sheltered they grow up straight and arrowy with delicately taper bole and ascend branch terminate with glossy bottle-brush tassel at middle age certain limb be specialize and push far out for the bearing of cone after the manner of the sugar pine and in old age these branch droop and cast about in every direction give rise to very picturesque effect the trunk become deep brown and rough like that of the mountain pine while the young cone be of a strange dull blackish-blue color cluster on the upper branch when ripe they be from three to four inch long yellowish brown resemble in every way those of the mountain pine except the sugar pine no tree on the mountain be so capable of individual expression while in grace of form and movement it constantly remind one of the hemlock spruce -lrb- illustration : oak grow among yellow pine -rrb- the largest specimen i measure be a little over five foot in diameter and ninety foot in height but this be more than twice the ordinary size this species be common throughout the rocky mountain and most of the short range of the great basin where it be call the fox-tail pine from its long dense leaf-tassel on the hot creek white pine and golden gate range it be quite abundant about a foot or eighteen inch of the end of the branch be densely pack with stiff outstanding needle which radiate like a electric fox or squirrel 's tail the needle have a glossy polish and the sunshine sift through they make they burn with silvery luster while they number and elastic temper tell delightfully in the wind this tree be here still more original and picturesque than in the sierra far surpass not only its companion conifer in this respect but also the most note of the lowland oak some stand firmly erect feathered with radiant tassel down to the ground form slender taper tower of shine verdure other with two or three specialize branch push out at right angle to the trunk and densely clothe with tasseled spray take the form of beautiful ornamental cross again in the same wood you find tree that be make up of several bole unite near the ground spreading at the side in a plane parallel to the axis of the mountain with the elegant tassel hang in charming order between they make a harp hold against the main wind line where they be most effective in play the grand storm harmony and besides these there be many variable arching form alone or in group with innumerable tassel droop beneath the arch or radiant above they and many lowly giant of no particular form that have brave the storm of a thousand year but whether old or young sheltered or expose to the wildest gale this tree be ever find irrepressibly and extravagantly picturesque and offer a richer and more varied series of form to the artist than any other conifer i know of nut pine -lrb- _ pinus monophyllum _ -rrb- the nut pine cover or rather dot the eastern flank of the sierra to which it be mostly restricted in grayish bush-like patch from the margin of the sage-plain to a elevation of from 7000 to 8000 foot a more contentedly fruitful and unaspiring conifer could not be conceive all the species we have be sketch make departure more or less distant from the typical spire form but none go so far as this without any apparent exigency of climate or soil it remain near the ground throw out crooked divergent branch like a orchard apple-tree and seldom push a single shoot higher than fifteen or twenty foot above the ground the average thickness of the trunk be perhaps about ten or twelve inch the leaf be mostly undivided like round awl instead of be separate like those of other pine into two and three and five the cone be green while grow and be usually find over all the tree form quite a marked feature as see against the bluish-gray foliage they be quite small only about two inch in length and give no promise of edible nut but when we come to open they we find that about half the entire bulk of the cone be make up of sweet nutritious seed the kernel of which be nearly as large as those of hazel-nut this be undoubtedly the most important food-tree on the sierra and furnish the mono carson and walker river indian with more and better nut than all the other species take together it be the indian ' own tree and many a white man have they kill for cut it down in its development nature seem to have aim at the formation of as great a fruit-bearing surface as possible be so low and accessible the cone be readily beat off with pole and the nut procure by roast they until the scale open in bountiful season a single indian will gather thirty or forty bushel of they -- a fine squirrelish employment of all the conifer along the eastern base of the sierra and on all the many mountain group and short range of the great basin this foodful little pine be the commonest tree and the most important nearly every mountain be plant with it to a height of from 8000 to 9000 foot above the sea some be cover from base to summit by this one species with only a sparse growth of juniper on the lower slope to break the continuity of its curious wood which though dark-looking at a distance be almost shadeless and have none of the damp leafy glen and hollow so characteristic of other pine wood ten of thousand of acre occur in continuous belt indeed view comprehensively the entire basin seem to be pretty evenly divide into level plain dot with sage-bush and mountain-chain cover with nut pine no slope be too rough none too dry for these bountiful orchard of the red man the value of this species to nevada be not easily overestimate it furnish charcoal and timber for the mine and with the juniper supply the ranch with fuel and rough fencing in fruitful season the nut crop be perhaps greater than the californium wheat crop which exert so much influence throughout the food market of the world when the crop be ripe the indian make ready the long beating-pole bag basket mat and sack be collect the woman out at service among the settler wash or drudge assemble at the family hut the man leave they ranch work old and young all be mount on pony and start in great glee to the nut-lands form curiously picturesque cavalcade flame scarf and calico skirt stream loosely over the knotty pony two squaw usually astride of each with baby midget bandage in basket sling on they back or balance on the saddle-bow while nut-basket and water-jar project from each side and the long beating-pole make angle in every direction arrive at some well-known central point where grass and water be find the squaw with basket the man with pole ascend the ridge to the laden tree follow by the child then the beating begin right merrily the bur fly in every direction roll down the slope lodge here and there against rock and sage-bush chase and gather by the woman and child with fine natural gladness smoke-column speedily mark the joyful scene of they labor as the roasting-fire be kindle and at night assemble in gay circle garrulous as jay they begin the first nut feast of the season the nut be about half a inch long and a quarter of a inch in diameter point at the top round at the base light brown in general color and like many other pine seed handsomely dot with purple like bird ' egg the shell be thin and may be crush between the thumb and finger the kernel be white become brown by roast and be sweet to every palate be eat by bird squirrel dog horse and man perhaps less than one bushel in a thousand of the whole crop be ever gather still besides supply they own want in time of plenty the indian bring large quantity to market then they be eat around nearly every fireside in the state and be even feed to horse occasionally instead of barley of other tree grow on the sierra but form a very small part of the general forest we may briefly notice the following : _ chamoecypari lawsoniana _ be a magnificent tree in the coast range but small in the sierra it be find only well to the northward along the bank of cool stream on the upper sacramento toward mount shasta only a few tree of this species as far as i have see have as yet gain a place in the sierra wood it have evidently be derive from the coast range by way of the tangle of connect mountain at the head of the sacramento valley in shady dell and on cool stream bank of the northern sierra we also find the yew -lrb- _ taxus brevifolium _ -rrb- the interesting nutmeg tree -lrb- _ torreya californica _ -rrb- be sparsely distribute along the western flank of the range at a elevation of about 4000 foot mostly in gulch and cañons it be a small prickly leaved glossy evergreen like a conifer from twenty to fifty foot high and one to two foot in diameter the fruit resemble a green-gage plum and contain one seed about the size of a acorn and like a nutmeg hence the common name the wood be fine-grained and of a beautiful creamy yellow color like box sweet-scented when dry though the green leaf emit a disagreeable odor _ betulum occidentali _ the only birch be a small slender tree restricted to the eastern flank of the range along stream-side below the pine-belt especially in owen 's valley alder maple and nuttall 's flowering dogwood make beautiful bower over swift cool stream at a elevation of from 3000 to 5000 foot mix more or less with willow and cottonwood and above these in lake basin the aspen form fine ornamental grove and let its light shine gloriously in the autumn month the chestnut oak -lrb- _ quercus densiflora _ -rrb- seem to have come from the coast range around the head of the sacramento valley like the _ chamaecypari _ but as it extend southward along the lower edge of the main pine-belt it grow smaller until it finally dwarf to a mere chaparral bush in the coast mountain it be a fine tall rather slender tree about from sixty to seventy-five foot high grow with the grand _ sequoia semperviren _ or redwood but unfortunately it be too good to live and be now be rapidly destroy for tan-bark besides the common dougla oak and the grand _ quercus wislizenus _ of the foot-hill and several small one that make dense growth of chaparral there be two mountain-oak that grow with the pine up to a elevation of about 5000 foot above the sea and greatly enhance the beauty of the yosemite park these be the mountain live oak and the kellogg oak name in honor of the admirable botanical pioneer of californium kellogg 's oak -lrb- _ quercus kelloggius _ -rrb- be a firm bright beautiful tree reach a height of sixty foot four to seven foot in diameter with wide-spreading branch and grow at a elevation of from 3000 to 5000 foot in sunny valley and flat among the evergreen and higher in a dwarf state in the cliff-bound park about 4000 foot above the sea it be so abundant and effective it might fairly be call the yosemite oak the leaf make beautiful mass of purple in the spring and yellow in ripe autumn while its acorn be eagerly gather by indian squirrel and woodpecker the mountain live oak -lrb- _ q chrysolepi _ -rrb- be a tough rugged mountaineer of a tree grow bravely and attain noble dimension on the roughest earthquake talus in deep cañons and yosemite valley the trunk be usually short divide near the ground into great wide-spreading limb and these again into a multitude of slender spray many of they cord-like and droop to the ground like those of the great white oak of the lowland -lrb- _ q lobata _ -rrb- the top of the tree where there be plenty of space be broad and bossy with a dense covering of shine leaf make delightful canopy the complicated system of gray interlace arch branch as see from beneath be exceedingly rich and picturesque no other tree that i know dwarf so regularly and completely as this under change of climate due to change in elevation at the foot of a cañon 4000 foot above the sea you may find magnificent specimen of this oak fifty foot high with craggy bulge trunk five to seven foot in diameter and at the head of the cañon 2500 foot higher a dense soft low shrubby growth of the same species while all the way up the cañon between these extreme of size and habit a perfect gradation may be trace the largest i have see be fifty foot high eight foot in diameter and about seventy-five foot in spread the trunk be all knot and buttress gray like granite and about as angular and irregular as the boulder on which it be grow -- a type of steadfast unwedgeable strength chapter ix the douglas squirrel -lrb- _ sciurus douglasius _ -rrb- the dougla squirrel be by far the most interesting and influential of the californium sciurida surpass every other species in force of character number and extent of range and in the amount of influence he bring to bear upon the health and distribution of the vast forest he inhabit go where you will throughout the noble wood of the sierra nevada among the giant pine and spruce of the lower zone up through the towering silver fir to the storm-bent thicket of the summit peak you everywhere find this little squirrel the master-existence though only a few inch long so intense be he fiery vigor and restlessness he stir every grove with wild life and make himself more important than even the huge bear that shuffle through the tangled underbrush beneath he every wind be fret by he voice almost every bole and branch feel the sting of he sharp foot how much the growth of the tree be stimulate by this mean it be not easy to learn but he action in manipulate they seed be more appreciable nature have make he master forester and commit most of she coniferous crop to he paw probably over fifty per cent of all the cone ripen on the sierra be cut off and handle by the dougla alone and of those of the big tree perhaps ninety per cent pass through he hand : the greater portion be of course store away for food to last during the winter and spring but some of they be tuck separately into loosely cover hole where some of the seed germinate and become tree but the sierra be only one of the many province over which he hold sway for he dominion extend over all the redwood belt of the coast mountain and far northward throughout the majestic forest of oregon washington and british columbium i make haste to mention these fact to show upon how substantial a foundation the importance i ascribe to he rest the dougla be closely ally to the red squirrel or chickaree of the eastern wood ours may be a lineal descendant of this species distribute westward to the pacific by way of the great lake and the rocky mountain and thence southward along we forested range this view be suggest by the fact that we species become redder and more chickaree-like in general the farther it be trace back along the course indicate above but whatever they relationship and the evolutionary force that have act upon they the dougla be now the larger and more beautiful animal from the nose to the root of the tail he measure about eight inch and he tail which he so effectively use in interpret he feeling be about six inch in length he wear dark bluish-gray over the back and half-way down the side bright buff on the belly with a stripe of dark gray nearly black separate the upper and under color this divide stripe however be not very sharply define he have long black whisker which give he a rather fierce look when observe closely strong claw sharp as fish-hook and the brightest of bright eye full of tell speculation a king 's river indian tell I that they call he pillillooeet which rapidly pronounce with the first syllable heavily accented be not unlike the lusty exclamation he utter on he way up a tree when excite most mountaineer in californium call he the pine squirrel and when i ask a old trapper whether he know we little forester he reply with brighten countenance : oh yes of course i know he everybody know he when i be huntin ' in the wood i often find out where the deer be by he barkin ' at 'em i call 'em lightnin ' squirrel because they be so mighty quick and peert all the true squirrel be more or less birdlike in speech and movement but the dougla be preëminently so possess as he do every attribute peculiarly squirrelish enthusiastically concentrate he be the squirrel of squirrel flash from branch to branch of he favorite evergreen crisp and glossy and undiseased as a sunbeam give he wing and he would outfly any bird in the wood he big gray cousin be a looser animal seemingly light enough to float on the wind yet when leap from limb to limb or out of one tree-top to another he sometimes halt to gather strength as if make effort concern the upshot of which he do not always feel exactly confident but the dougla with he denser body leap and glide in hidden strength seemingly as independent of common muscle as a mountain stream he thread the tasseled branch of the pine stir they needle like a rustling breeze now shoot across opening in arrowy line now launch in curve glint deftly from side to side in sudden zigzag and swirl in giddy loop and spiral around the knotty trunk get into what seem to be the most impossible situation without sense of danger now on he haunch now on he head yet ever graceful and punctuate he most irrepressible outburst of energy with little dot and dash of perfect repose he be without exception the wildest animal i ever see -- a fiery sputter little bolt of life luxuriate in quick oxygen and the wood ' best juice one can hardly think of such a creature be dependent like the rest of we on climate and food but after all it require no long acquaintance to learn he be human for he work for a live he busiest time be in the indian summer then he gather bur and hazel-nut like a plodding farmer work continuously every day for hour say not a word cut off the ripe cone at the top of he speed as if employ by the job and examine every branch in regular order as if careful that not one should escape he then descend he store they away beneath log and stump in anticipation of the pinch hunger day of winter he seem himself a kind of coniferous fruit -- both fruit and flower the resiny essence of the pine pervade every pore of he body and eat he flesh be like chew gum one never tire of this bright chip of nature -- this brave little voice cry in the wilderness -- of observe he many work and way and listen to he curious language he musical piny gossip be as savory to the ear as balsam to the palate and though he have not exactly the gift of song some of he note be as sweet as those of a linnet -- almost flute-like in softness while other prick and tingle like thistle he be the mocking-bird of squirrel pour forth mixed chatter and song like a perennial fountain bark like a dog scream like a hawk chirp like a blackbird or a sparrow while in bluff audacious noisiness he be a very jay -lrb- illustration : track of dougla squirrel once down and up a pine-tree when show off to a spectator -rrb- in descend the trunk of a tree with the intention of alight on the ground he preserve a cautious silence mindful perhaps of fox and wildcat but while rock safely at home in the pine-top there be no end to he caper and noise and woe to the gray squirrel or chipmunk that venture to set foot on he favorite tree no matter how slyly they trace the furrow of the bark they be speedily discover and kick down-stair with comic vehemence while a torrent of angry note come rush from he whiskered lip that sound remarkably like swearing he will even attempt at time to drive away dog and man especially if he have have no previous knowledge of they see a man for the first time he approach nearer and nearer until within a few foot then with a angry outburst he make a sudden rush all tooth and eye as if about to eat you up but find that the big fork animal do not scare he prudently beat a retreat and set himself up to reconnoiter on some overhang branch scrutinize every movement you make with ludicrous solemnity gathering courage he venture down the trunk again chur and chirp and jerk nervously up and down in curious loop eye you all the time as if snow off and demand you admiration finally grow calmer he settle down in a comfortable posture on some horizontal branch command a good view and beat time with he tail to a steady chee-up chee-up or when somewhat less excited pee-ah with the first syllable keenly accented and the second draw out like the scream of a hawk -- repeat this slowly and more emphatically at first then gradually faster until a rate of about 150 word a minute be reach usually sit all the time on he haunch with paw rest on he breast which pulse visibly with each word it be remarkable too that though articulate distinctly he keep he mouth shut most of the time and speak through he nose i have occasionally observe he even eat sequoia seed and nibble a troublesome flea without cease or in any way confuse he pee-ah pee-ah for a single moment while ascend tree all he claw come into play but in descend the weight of he body be sustained chiefly by those of the hind foot still in neither case do he movement suggest effort though if you be near enough you may see the bulge strength of he short bear-like arm and note he sinewy fist clinch in the bark whether go up or down he carry he tail extend at full length in line with he body unless it be require for gesture but while run along horizontal limb or fall trunk it be frequently fold forward over the back with the airy tip daintily upcurl in cool weather it keep he warm then after he have finish he meal you may see he crouch close on some level limb with he tail-robe neatly spread and reach forward to he ear the electric outstanding hair quiver in the breeze like pine-needle but in wet or very cold weather he stay in he nest and while curl up there he comforter be long enough to come forward around he nose it be seldom so cold however as to prevent he go out to he store when hungry once as i lay storm-bound on the upper edge of the timber line on mount shasta the thermometer nearly at zero and the sky thick with drive snow a dougla come bravely out several time from one of the lower hollow of a dwarf pine near my camp face the wind without seem to feel it much frisk lightly about over the mealy snow and dig he way down to some hidden seed with wonderful precision as if to he eye the thick snow-covering be glass no other of the sierra animal of my acquaintance be better feed not even the deer amid abundance of sweet herb and shrub or the mountain sheep or omnivorous bear he food consist of grass-seed berry hazel-nut chinquapin and the nut and seed of all the coniferous tree without exception -- pine fir spruce libocedrus juniper and sequoia -- he be fond of they all and they all agree with he green or ripe no cone be too large for he to manage none so small as to be beneath he notice the smaller one such as those of the hemlock and the dougla spruce and the two-leaved pine he cut off and eat on a branch of the tree without allow they to fall begin at the bottom of the cone and cut away the scale to expose the seed not gnawing by guess like a bear but turn they round and round in regular order in compliance with they spiral arrangement when thus employ he location in the tree be betray by a dribble of scale shell and seed-wing and every few minute by the fall of the strip axis of the cone then of course he be ready for another and if you be watch you may catch a glimpse of he as he glide silently out to the end of a branch and see he examine the cone-cluster until he find one to he mind then lean over pull back the springy needle out of he way grasp the cone with he paw to prevent its fall snip it off in a incredibly short time seize it with jaw grotesquely stretch and return to he chosen seat near the trunk but the immense size of the cone of the sugar pine -- from fifteen to twenty inch in length -- and those of the jeffrey variety of the yellow pine compel he to adopt a quite different method he cut they off without attempt to hold they then go down and drag they from where they have chance to fall up to the bare swell ground around the instep of the tree where he demolish they in the same methodical way begin at the bottom and follow the scale-spiral to the top -lrb- illustration : seed wing and scale of sugar pine -lrb- nat size -rrb- -rrb- from a single sugar pine cone he get from two to four hundred seed about half the size of a hazel-nut so that in a few minute he can procure enough to last a week he seem however to prefer those of the two silver first above all other perhaps because they be most easily obtain as the scale drop off when ripe without need to be cut both species be fill with a exceedingly pungent aromatic oil which spice all he flesh and be of itself sufficient to account for he lightning energy you may easily know this little workman by he chip on sunny hillside around the principal tree they lie in big pile -- bushel and basketful of they all fresh and clean make the most beautiful kitchen-midden imaginable the brown and yellow scale and nut-shell be as abundant and as delicately pencil and tint as the shell along the sea-shore while the beautiful red and purple seed-wing mingle with they would lead one to fancy that innumerable butterfly have there meet they fate he feast on all the species long before they be ripe but be wise enough to wait until they be mature before he gather they into he barn this be in October and November which with he be the two busiest month of the year all kind of bur big and little be now cut off and shower down alike and the ground be speedily cover with they a constant thudding and bumping be keep up some of the larger cone chance to fall on old log make the forest reëcho with the sound other nut-eater less industrious know well what be go on and hasten to carry away the cone as they fall but however busy the harvester may be he be not slow to descry the pilferer below and instantly leave he work to drive they away the little striped tamia be a thorn in he flesh steal persistently punish he as he may the large gray squirrel give trouble also although the dougla have be accuse of steal from he generally however just the opposite be the case the excellence of the sierra evergreen be well know to nurserymen throughout the world consequently there be considerable demand for the seed the greater portion of the supply have hitherto be procure by chop down the tree in the more accessible section of the forest alongside of bridle-path that cross the range sequoia seed at first bring from twenty to thirty dollar per pound and therefore be eagerly seek after some of the smaller fruitful tree be cut down in the grove not protect by government especially those of fresno and king 's river most of the sequoia however be of so gigantic a size that the seedsman have to look for the greater portion of they supplies to the dougla who soon learn he be no match for these freebooter he be wise enough however to cease work the instant he perceive they and never fail to embrace every opportunity to recover he bur whenever they happen to be store in any place accessible to he and the busy seedsman often find on return to camp that the little dougla have exhaustively spoil the spoiler i know one seed-gatherer who whenever he rob the squirrel scatter wheat or barley beneath the tree as conscience-money the want of appreciable life remark by so many traveler in the sierra forest be never feel at this time of year banish all the hum insect and the bird and quadruped leave only sir dougla and the most solitary of we so-called solitude would still throb with ardent life but if you should go impatiently even into the most populous of the grove on purpose to meet he and walk about look up among the branch you would see very little of he but lie down at the foot of one of the tree and straightway he will come for in the midst of the ordinary forest sound the fall of bur piping of quail the scream of the clark crow and the rustling of deer and bear among the chaparral he be quick to detect you strange footstep and will hasten to make a good close inspection of you as soon as you be still first you may hear he sound a few note of curious inquiry but more likely the first intimation of he approach will be the prickly sound of he foot as he descend the tree overhead just before he make he savage onrush to frighten you and proclaim you presence to every squirrel and bird in the neighborhood if you remain perfectly motionless he will come nearer and nearer and probably set you flesh a-tingle by frisk across you body once while i be seat at the foot of a hemlock spruce in one of the most inaccessible of the san joaquin yosemite engage in sketch a reckless fellow come up behind I pass under my bended arm and jump on my paper and one warm afternoon while a old friend of mine be read out in the shade of he cabin one of he dougla neighbor jump from the gable upon he head and then with admirable assurance run down over he shoulder and on to the book he hold in he hand we dougla enjoy a large social circle for besides he numerous relative _ sciurus fossor tamia quadrivitatus t townsendius spermophilus beccheyus s douglasii _ he maintain intimate relation with the nut-eating bird particularly the clark crow -lrb- _ picicorvus columbianus _ -rrb- and the numerous woodpecker and jay the two spermophile be astonishingly abundant in the lowland and lower foot-hill but more and more sparingly distribute up through the douglas domain -- seldom venture higher than six or seven thousand foot above the level of the sea the gray sciurus range but little higher than this the little striped tamia alone be associate with he everywhere in the lower and middle zone where they all meet they be tolerably harmonious -- a happy family though very amusing skirmish may occasionally be witness wherever the ancient glacier have spread forest soil there you find we wee hero most abundant where depth of soil and genial climate have give rise to a corresponding luxuriance in the tree but follow every kind of growth up the curving moraine to the highest glacial fountain though i can not of course expect all my reader to sympathize fully in my admiration of this little animal few i hope will think this sketch of he life too long i can not begin to tell here how much he have cheer my lonely wanderings during all the year i have be pursue my study in these glorious wild or how much unmistakable humanity i have find in he take this for example : one calm creamy indian summer morning when the nut be ripe i be camp in the upper pine-wood of the south fork of the san joaquin where the squirrel seem to be about as plentiful as the ripe bur they be take a early breakfast before go to they regular harvest-work while i be busy with my own breakfast i hear the thudding fall of two or three heavy cone from a yellow pine near I i steal noiselessly forward within about twenty foot of the base of it to observe in a few moment down come the dougla the breakfast-bur he have cut off have roll on the gently slope ground into a clump of ceanothus bush but he seem to know exactly where they be for he find they at once apparently without search for they they be more than twice as heavy as himself but after turn they into the right position for get a good hold with he long sickle-tooth he manage to drag they up to the foot of the tree from which he have cut they move backward then seat himself comfortably he hold they on end bottom up and demolish they at he ease a good deal of nibble have to be do before he get anything to eat because the lower scale be barren but when he have patiently work he way up to the fertile one he find two sweet nut at the base of each shape like trim ham and spot purple like bird ' egg and notwithstanding these cone be drip with soft balsam and cover with prickle and so strongly put together that a boy would be puzzle to cut they open with a jack-knife he accomplish he meal with easy dignity and cleanliness make less effort apparently than a man would in eat soft cookery from a plate breakfast do i whistle a tune for he before he go to work curious to see how he would be affect by it he have not see I all this while but the instant i begin to whistle he dart up the tree nearest to he and come out on a small dead limb opposite I and compose himself to listen i sing and whistle more than a dozen air and as the music change he eye sparkle and he turn he head quickly from side to side but make no other response other squirrel hear the strange sound come around on all side also chipmunk and bird one of the bird a handsome speckle-breasted thrush seem even more interested than the squirrel after listen for awhile on one of the lower dead spray of a pine he come swoop forward within a few foot of my face and remain flutter in the air for half a minute or so sustain himself with whir wing-beat like a humming-bird in front of a flower while i could look into he eye and see he innocent wonder by this time my performance must have last nearly half a hour i sing or whistle bonnie boon lass o ' gowrie o'er the water to charlie bonnie wood o ' cragie lee etc all of which seem to be listen to with bright interest my first dougla sit patiently through it all with he tell eye fix upon I until i ventured to give the old hundredth when he scream he indian name pillillooeet turn tail and dart with ludicrous haste up the tree out of sight he voice and action in the case leave a somewhat profane impression as if he have say i 'll be hang if you get I to hear anything so solemn and unpiny this act as a signal for the general dispersal of the whole hairy tribe though the bird seem willing to wait further development music be naturally more in they line what there can be in that grand old church-tune that be so offensive to bird and squirrel i can not imagine a year or two after this high sierra concert i be sit one fine day on a hill in the coast range where the common ground squirrel be abundant they be very shy on account of be hunt so much but after i have be silent and motionless for half a hour or so they begin to venture out of they hole and to feed on the seed of the grass and thistle around I as if i be no more to be fear than a tree-stump then it occur to I that this be a good opportunity to find out whether they also dislike old hundredth therefore i begin to whistle as nearly as i could remember the same familiar air that have please the mountaineer of the sierra they at once stop eat stand erect and listen patiently until i come to old hundredth when with ludicrous haste every one of they rush to they hole and bolt in they foot twinkle in the air for a moment as they vanish no one who make the acquaintance of we forester will fail to admire he but he be far too self-reliant and warlike ever to be take for a darling how long the life of a douglas squirrel may be i do not know the young seem to sprout from knot-hole perfect from the first and as endure as they own tree it be difficult indeed to realize that so condensed a piece of sun-fire should ever become dim or die at all he be seldom kill by hunter for he be too small to encourage much of they attention and when pursue in settle region become excessively shy and keep close in the furrow of the highest trunk many of which be of the same color as himself indian boy however lie in wait with unbounded patience to shoot they with arrow in the lower and middle zone a few fall a prey to rattlesnake occasionally he be pursue by hawk and wildcat etc but upon the whole he dwell safely in the deep bosom of the wood the most highly favor of all he happy tribe may he tribe increase -lrb- illustration : try the bow -rrb- chapter x a wind-storm in the forest the mountain wind like the dew and rain sunshine and snow be measure and bestow with love on the forest to develop they strength and beauty however restricted the scope of other forest influence that of the wind be universal the snow bend and trim the upper forest every winter the lightning strike a single tree here and there while avalanche mow down thousand at a swoop as a gardener trim out a bed of flower but the wind go to every tree finger every leaf and branch and furrowed bole not one be forget the mountain pine tower with outstretch arm on the rugged buttress of the icy peak the lowliest and most retire tenant of the dell they seek and find they all caress they tenderly bend they in lusty exercise stimulate they growth pluck off a leaf or limb as require or remove a entire tree or grove now whisper and coo through the branch like a sleepy child now roar like the ocean the wind blessing the forest the forest the wind with ineffable beauty and harmony as the sure result -lrb- illustration : a wind-storm in the californium forest -lrb- after a sketch by the author -rrb- -rrb- after one have see pine six foot in diameter bend like grass before a mountain gale and ever and anon some giant fall with a crash that shake the hill it seem astonishing that any save the lowest thickset tree could ever have find a period sufficiently stormless to establish themselves or once establish that they should not sooner or later have be blow down but when the storm be over and we behold the same forest tranquil again tower fresh and unscathed in erect majesty and consider what century of storm have fall upon they since they be first plant -- hail to break the tender seedling lightning to scorch and shatter snow wind and avalanche to crush and overwhelm -- while the manifest result of all this wild storm-culture be the glorious perfection we behold then faith in nature 's forestry be establish and we cease to deplore the violence of she most destructive gale or of any other storm-implement whatsoever there be two tree in the sierra forest that be never blow down so long as they continue in sound health these be the juniper and the dwarf pine of the summit peak they stiff crooked root grip the storm-beaten ledge like eagle ' claw while they lithe cord-like branch bend round compliantly offer but slight hold for wind however violent the other alpine conifer -- the needle pine mountain pine two-leaved pine and hemlock spruce -- be never thin out by this agent to any destructive extent on account of they admirable toughness and the closeness of they growth in general the same be true of the giant of the lower zone the kingly sugar pine tower aloft to a height of more than 200 foot offer a fine mark to storm-wind but it be not densely foliage and its long horizontal arm swing round compliantly in the blast like tress of green fluent alga in a brook while the silver fir in most place keep they rank well together in united strength the yellow or silver pine be more frequently overturn than any other tree on the sierra because its leaf and branch form a larger mass in proportion to its height while in many place it be plant sparsely leave open lane through which storm may enter with full force furthermore because it be distribute along the lower portion of the range which be the first to be leave bare on the break up of the ice-sheet at the close of the glacial winter the soil it be grow upon have be longer expose to post-glacial weathering and consequently be in a more crumble decayed condition than the fresher soil farther up the range and therefore offer a less secure anchorage for the root while explore the forest zone of mount shasta i discover the path of a hurricane strew with thousand of pine of this species great and small have be uproot or wrench off by sheer force make a clean gap like that make by a snow avalanche but hurricane capable of do this class of work be rare in the sierra and when we have explore the forest from one extremity of the range to the other we be compel to believe that they be the most beautiful on the face of the earth however we may regard the agent that have make they so there be always something deeply exciting not only in the sound of wind in the wood which exert more or less influence over every mind but in they varied waterlike flow as manifest by the movement of the tree especially those of the conifer by no other tree be they render so extensively and impressively visible not even by the lordly tropic palm or tree-fern responsive to the gentlest breeze the wave of a forest of the giant sequoia be indescribably impressive and sublime but the pine seem to I the best interpreter of wind they be mighty wave goldenrod ever in tune singing and write wind-music all they long century live little however of this noble tree-waving and tree-music will you see or hear in the strictly alpine portion of the forest the burly juniper whose girth sometimes more than equal its height be about as rigid as the rock on which it grow the slender lash-like spray of the dwarf pine stream out in waver ripple but the tallest and slenderest be far too unyielding to wave even in the heaviest gale they only shake in quick short vibration the hemlock spruce however and the mountain pine and some of the tallest thicket of the two-leaved species bow in storm with considerable scope and gracefulness but it be only in the lower and middle zone that the meeting of wind and wood be to be see in all its grandeur one of the most beautiful and exhilarating storm i ever enjoy in the sierra occur in December 1874 when i happen to be explore one of the tributary valley of the yuba river the sky and the ground and the tree have be thoroughly rain-washed and be dry again the day be intensely pure one of those incomparable bit of californium winter warm and balmy and full of white sparkling sunshine redolent of all the purest influence of the spring and at the same time enliven with one of the most brace wind-storm conceivable instead of camp out as i usually do i then chance to be stop at the house of a friend but when the storm begin to sound i lose no time in push out into the wood to enjoy it for on such occasion nature have always something rare to show we and the danger to life and limb be hardly greater than one would experience crouch deprecatingly beneath a roof it be still early morning when i find myself fairly adrift delicious sunshine come pour over the hill light the top of the pine and set free a steam of summery fragrance that contrast strangely with the wild tone of the storm the air be mottle with pine-tassel and bright green plume that go flash past in the sunlight like bird pursue but there be not the slightest dustiness nothing less pure than leaf and ripe pollen and fleck of withered bracken and moss i hear tree fall for hour at the rate of one every two or three minute some uproot partly on account of the loose water-soaked condition of the ground other broken straight across where some weakness cause by fire have determine the spot the gesture of the various tree make a delightful study young sugar pine light and feathery as squirrel-tail be bow almost to the ground while the grand old patriarch whose massive bole have be try in a hundred storm wave solemnly above they they long arching branch streaming fluently on the gale and every needle thrilling and ringing and shed off keen lance of light like a diamond the dougla spruce with long spray draw out in level tress and needle mass in a gray shimmering glow present a most striking appearance as they stand in bold relief along the hilltop the madroños in the dell with they red bark and large glossy leaf tilted every way reflect the sunshine in throb spangle like those one so often see on the rippled surface of a glacier lake but the silver pine be now the most impressively beautiful of all colossal spire 200 foot in height wave like supple golden-rod chant and bow low as if in worship while the whole mass of they long tremulous foliage be kindle into one continuous blaze of white sun-fire the force of the gale be such that the most steadfast monarch of they all rock down to its root with a motion plainly perceptible when one lean against it nature be hold high festival and every fiber of the most rigid giant thrill with glad excitement i drift on through the midst of this passionate music and motion across many a glen from ridge to ridge often halt in the lee of a rock for shelter or to gaze and listen even when the grand anthem have swell to its highest pitch i could distinctly hear the vary tone of individual tree -- spruce and fir and pine and leafless oak -- and even the infinitely gentle rustle of the withered grass at my foot each be express itself in its own way -- singing its own song and make its own peculiar gesture -- manifest a richness of variety to be find in no other forest i have yet see the coniferous wood of canada and the carolina and florida be make up of tree that resemble one another about as nearly as blade of grass and grow close together in much the same way coniferous tree in general seldom possess individual character such as be manifest among oak and elm but the californium forest be make up of a greater number of distinct species than any other in the world and in they we find not only a marked differentiation into special group but also a marked individuality in almost every tree give rise to storm effect indescribably glorious toward midday after a long tingling scramble through copse of hazel and ceanothus i gain the summit of the highest ridge in the neighborhood and then it occur to I that it would be a fine thing to climb one of the tree to obtain a wider outlook and get my ear close to the aeolian music of its topmost needle but under the circumstance the choice of a tree be a serious matter one whose instep be not very strong seem in danger of be blow down or of be strike by other in case they should fall another be branchless to a considerable height above the ground and at the same time too large to be grasp with arm and leg in climb while other be not favorably situate for clear view after cautiously cast about i make choice of the tallest of a group of dougla spruce that be grow close together like a tuft of grass no one of which seem likely to fall unless all the rest fall with it though comparatively young they be about 100 foot high and they lithe brushy top be rock and swirl in wild ecstasy be accustom to climb tree in make botanical study i experience no difficulty in reach the top of this one and never before do i enjoy so noble a exhilaration of motion the slender top fairly flap and swish in the passionate torrent bend and swirl backward and forward round and round trace indescribable combination of vertical and horizontal curve while i clung with muscle firm brace like a bobolink on a reed in its widest sweep my tree-top describe a arc of from twenty to thirty degree but i feel sure of its elastic temper have see other of the same species still more severely try -- bent almost to the ground indeed in heavy snow -- without break a fiber i be therefore safe and free to take the wind into my pulse and enjoy the excited forest from my superb outlook the view from here must be extremely beautiful in any weather now my eye rove over the piny hill and dale as over field of wave grain and feel the light run in ripple and broad swell undulation across the valley from ridge to ridge as the shine foliage be stir by correspond wave of air oftentimes these wave of reflect light would break up suddenly into a kind of beaten foam and again after chase one another in regular order they would seem to bend forward in concentric curve and disappear on some hillside like sea-wave on a shelve shore the quantity of light reflect from the bent needle be so great as to make whole grove appear as if cover with snow while the black shadow beneath the tree greatly enhance the effect of the silvery splendor except only the shadow there be nothing somber in all this wild sea of pine on the contrary notwithstanding this be the winter season the color be remarkably beautiful the shaft of the pine and libocedrus be brown and purple and most of the foliage be well tinge with yellow the laurel grove with the pale underside of they leaf turn upward make mass of gray and then there be many a dash of chocolate color from clump of manzanita and jet of vivid crimson from the bark of the madroños while the ground on the hillside appear here and there through opening between the grove display mass of pale purple and brown the sound of the storm correspond gloriously with this wild exuberance of light and motion the profound bass of the naked branch and bole boom like waterfall the quick tense vibration of the pine-needle now rise to a shrill whistle hiss now fall to a silky murmur the rustling of laurel grove in the dell and the keen metallic click of leaf on leaf -- all this be hear in easy analysis when the attention be calmly bent the varied gesture of the multitude be see to fine advantage so that one could recognize the different species at a distance of several mile by this mean alone as well as by they form and color and the way they reflect the light all seem strong and comfortable as if really enjoy the storm while respond to its most enthusiastic greeting we hear much nowadays concern the universal struggle for existence but no struggle in the common meaning of the word be manifest here no recognition of danger by any tree no deprecation but rather a invincible gladness as remote from exultation as from fear i keep my lofty perch for hour frequently close my eye to enjoy the music by itself or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that be streaming past the fragrance of the wood be less marked than that produce during warm rain when so many balsamic bud and leaf be steep like tea but from the chafing of resiny branch against each other and the incessant attrition of myriad of needle the gale be spice to a very tonic degree and besides the fragrance from these local source there be trace of scent bring from afar for this wind come first from the sea rub against its fresh briny wave then distil through the redwood thread rich ferny gulch and spread itself in broad undulating current over many a flower-enameled ridge of the coast mountain then across the golden plain up the purple foot-hill and into these piny wood with the varied incense gather by the way wind be advertisement of all they touch however much or little we may be able to read they tell they wanderings even by they scent alone mariner detect the flowery perfume of land-wind far at sea and sea-wind carry the fragrance of dulse and tangle far inland where it be quickly recognize though mingle with the scent of a thousand land-flower as a illustration of this i may tell here that i breathe sea-air on the firth of forth in scotland while a boy then be take to wisconsin where i remain nineteen year then without in all this time have breathe one breath of the sea i walk quietly alone from the middle of the mississippus valley to the gulf of mexico on a botanical excursion and while in florida far from the coast my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation about I i suddenly recognize a sea-breeze as it come sift through the palmetto and bloom vine-tangle which at once awaken and set free a thousand dormant association and make I a boy again in scotland as if all the intervene year have be annihilate most people like to look at mountain river and bear they in mind but few care to look at the wind though far more beautiful and sublime and though they become at time about as visible as flow water when the north wind in winter be make upward sweep over the curving summit of the high sierra the fact be sometimes publish with fly snow-banner a mile long those portion of the wind thus embody can scarce be wholly invisible even to the darkest imagination and when we look around over a agitate forest we may see something of the wind that stir it by its effect upon the tree yonder it descend in a rush of water-like ripple and sweep over the bend pine from hill to hill nearer we see detach plume and leave now speed by on level current now whirling in eddy or escape over the edge of the whirl soar aloft on grand upswell dome of air or toss on flame-like crest smooth deep current cascade fall and swirl eddy sing around every tree and leaf and over all the varied topography of the region with tell change of form like mountain river conform to the feature of they channel after trace the sierra stream from they fountain to the plain mark where they bloom white in fall glide in crystal plume surge gray and foam-filled in boulder-choked gorge and slip through the wood in long tranquil reach -- after thus learn they language and form in detail we may at length hear they chant all together in one grand anthem and comprehend they all in clear inner vision cover the range like lace but even this spectacle be far less sublime and not a whit more substantial than what we may behold of these storm-stream of air in the mountain wood we all travel the milky way together tree and man but it never occur to I until this storm-day while swing in the wind that tree be traveler in the ordinary sense they make many journey not extensive one it be true but we own little journey away and back again be only little more than tree-waving -- many of they not so much when the storm begin to abate i dismount and saunter down through the calming wood the storm-tone die away and turn toward the east i beheld the countless host of the forest hush and tranquil towering above one another on the slope of the hill like a devout audience the setting sun fill they with amber light and seem to say while they listen my peace i give unto you as i gazed on the impressive scene all the so-called ruin of the storm be forget and never before do these noble wood appear so fresh so joyous so immortal chapter xi the river flood the sierra river be flood every spring by the melting of the snow as regularly as the famous old nile they begin to rise in may and in June high-water mark be reach but because the melting do not go on rapidly over all the fountain high and low simultaneously and the melted snow be not reinforce at this time of year by rain the spring flood be seldom very violent or destructive the thousand fall however and the cascade in the cañons be then in full bloom and sing song from one end of the range to the other of course the snow on the lower tributary of the river be first melted then that on the higher fountain most expose to sunshine and about a month later the cooler shadowy fountain send down they treasure thus allow the main trunk stream nearly six week to get they water hurry through the foot-hill and across the lowland to the sea therefore very violent spring flood be avoid and will be as long as the shade restrain forest last the river of the north half of the range be still less subject to sudden flood because they upper fountain in great part lie protect from the change of the weather beneath thick fold of lava just as many of the river of alaska lie beneath fold of ice come to the light farther down the range in large spring while those of the high sierra lie on the surface of solid granite expose to every change of temperature more than ninety per cent of the water derive from the snow and ice of mount shasta be at once absorb and drain away beneath the porous lava fold of the mountain where mumble and grope in the dark they at length find larger fissure and tunnel-like cave from which they emerge filter and cool in the form of large spring some of they so large they give birth to river that set out on they journey beneath the sun without any visible intermediate period of childhood thus the shasta river issue from a large lake-like spring in shasta valley and about two third of the volume of the mccloud river gush forth suddenly from the face of a lava bluff in a roar spring seventy-five yard wide these spring river of the north be of course shorter than those of the south whose tributary extend up to the top of the mountain fall river a important tributary of the pitt or upper sacramento be only about ten mile long and be all fall cascade and spring from its head to its confluence with the pitt bountiful spring charmingly embowered issue from the rock at one end of it a snowy fall a hundred and eighty foot high thunder at the other and a rush of crystal rapid sing and dance between of course such stream be but little affect by the weather sheltered from evaporation they flow be nearly as full in the autumn as in the time of general spring flood while those of the high sierra diminish to less than the hundredth part of they springtime prime shallow in autumn to a series of silent pool among the rock and hollow of they channel connect by feeble creep thread of water like the sluggish sentence of a tired writer connect by a drizzle of and and but strange to say the greatest flood occur in winter when one would suppose all the wild water would be muffle and chained in frost and snow the same long all-day storm of the so-called rainy season in californium that give rain to the lowland give dry frosty snow to the mountain but at rare interval warm rain and warm wind invade the mountain and push back the snow line from 2000 foot to 8000 or even higher and then come the big flood i be usually drive down out of the high sierra about the end of November but the winter of 1874 and 1875 be so warm and calm that i be tempt to seek general view of the geology and topography of the basin of feather river in January and i have just complete a hasty survey of the region and make my way down to winter quarter when one of the grandest flood-storm that i ever see break on the mountain i be then in the edge of the main forest belt at a small foot-hill town call knoxville on the divide between the water of the feather and yuba river the cause of this notable flood be simply a sudden and copious fall of warm wind and rain on the basin of these river at a time when they contain a considerable quantity of snow the rain be so heavy and long-sustained that it be of itself sufficient to make a good wild flood while the snow which the warm wind and rain melt on the upper and middle region of the basin be sufficient to make another flood equal to that of the rain now these two distinct harvest of flood water be gather simultaneously and pour out on the plain in one magnificent avalanche the basin of the yuba and feather like many other of the sierra be admirably adapt to the growth of flood of this kind they many tributary radiate far and wide comprehend extensive area and the tributary be steeply incline while the trunk be comparatively level while the flood-storm be in progress the thermometer at knoxville range between 44 ° and 50 ° and when warm wind and warm rain fall simultaneously on snow contain in basin like these both the rain and that portion of the snow which the rain and wind melt be at first sponge up and hold back until the combined mass become sludge which at length suddenly dissolve slip and descend all together to the trunk channel and since the deeper the stream the faster it flow the flood portion of the current above overtake the slower foot-hill portion below it and all sweeping forward together with a high overcurling front debouch on the open plain with a violence and suddenness that at first seem wholly unaccountable the destructiveness of the lower portion of this particular flood be somewhat augment by mine gravel in the river channel and by levee which give way after have at first restrained and hold back the accumulate water these exaggerate condition do not however greatly influence the general result the main effect have be cause by the rare combination of flood factor indicate above it be a pity that but few people meet and enjoy storm so noble as this in they home in the mountain for spend themselves in the open level of the plain they be likely to be remember more by the bridge and house they carry away than by they beauty or the thousand blessing they bring to the field and garden of nature on the morning of the flood January 19th all the feather and yuba landscape be cover with run water muddy torrent fill every gulch and ravine and the sky be thick with rain the pine have long be sleep in sunshine they be now awake roar and wave with the beating storm and the wind sweep along the curve of hill and dale streaming through the wood surge and gurgle on the top of rocky ridge make the wildest of wild storm melody it be easy to see that only a small part of the rain reach the ground in the form of drop most of it be thrash into dusty spray like that into which small waterfall be divide when they dash on shelve rock never have i see water come from the sky in denser or more passionate stream the wind chase the spray forward in choke drift and compel I again and again to seek shelter in the dell copse and back of large tree to rest and catch my breath wherever i go on ridge or in hollow enthusiastic water still flash and gurgle about my ankle recall a wild winter flood in yosemite when a hundred waterfall come booming and chant together and fill the grand valley with a sea-like roar after drift a hour or two in the lower wood i set out for the summit of a hill 900 foot high with a view to get as near the heart of the storm as possible in order to reach it i have to cross dry creek a tributary of the yuba that go crawl along the base of the hill on the northwest it be now a booming river as large as the tuolumne at ordinary stage its current brown with mining-mud wash down from many a claim and mottle with sluice-boxes fence-rail and log that have long lain above its reach a slim foot-bridge stretch across it now scarcely above the swollen current here i be glad to linger gaze and listen while the storm be in its richest mood -- the gray rain-flood above the brown river-flood beneath the language of the river be scarcely less enchanting than that of the wind and rain the sublime overboom of the main bounce exult current the swash and gurgle of the eddy the keen dash and clash of heavy wave break against rock and the smooth downy hush of shallow current feel they way through the willow thicket of the margin and amid all this vary throng of sound i hear the smother bumping and rumble of boulder on the bottom as they be shove and roll forward against one another in a wild rush after have lain still for probably 100 year or more the glad creek rise high above its bank and wander from its channel out over many a briery sand-flat and meadow alder and willow waist-deep be bear up against the current with nervous tremble gesture as if afraid of be carry away while supple branch bend confidingly dip lightly and rise again as if stroke the wild water in play leave the bridge and pass on through the storm-thrashed wood all the ground seem to be move pine-tassel flake of bark soil leave and broken branch be be sweep forward and many a rock-fragment weather from expose ledge be now receive its first rounding and polishing in the wild stream of the storm on they rush through every gulch and hollow leap glide work with a will and rejoice like live creature nor be the flood confine to the ground every tree have a water system of its own spreading far and wide like miniature amazon and mississippi toward midday cloud wind and rain reach they highest development the storm be in full bloom and form from my commanding outlook on the hilltop one of the most glorious view i ever behold as far as the eye could reach above beneath around wind-driven rain fill the air like one vast waterfall detach cloud sweep imposingly up the valley as if they be endow with independent motion and have special work to do in replenish the mountain well now rise above the pine-top now descend into they midst fondle they arrowy spire and soothing every branch and leaf with gentleness in the midst of all the savage sound and motion other keep near the ground glide behind separate grove and bring they forward into relief with admirable distinctness or pass in front eclipsed whole grove in succession pine after pine melting in they gray fringe and burst forth again seemingly clearer than before the form of storm be in great part measure and control by the topography of the region where they rise and over which they pass when therefore we attempt to study they from the valley or from gap and opening of the forest we be confound by a multitude of separate and apparently antagonistic impression the bottom of the storm be break up into innumerable wave and current that surge against the hillside like sea-wave against a shore and these react on the nether surface of the storm erode immense cavernous hollow and cañons and sweep forward the result detritus in long train like the moraine of glacier but as we ascend these partial confusing effect disappear and the phenomenon be beheld unite and harmonious the longer i gaze into the storm the more plainly visible it become the drift cloud detritus give it a kind of visible body which explain many perplexing phenomenon and publish its movement in plain term while the texture of the fall mass of rain round it out and render it more complete because raindrop differ in size they fall at different velocity and overtake and clash against one another produce mist and spray they also of course yield unequal compliance to the force of the wind which give rise to a still greater degree of interference and passionate gust sweep off cloud of spray from the grove like that tear from wave-top in a gale all these factor of irregularity in density color and texture of the general rain mass tend to make it the more appreciable and tell it be then see as one grand flood rush over bank and bra bend the pine like weed curve this way and that whirling in huge eddy in hollow and dell while the main current pour grandly over all like ocean current over the landscape that lie hide at the bottom of the sea i watch the gesture of the pine while the storm be at its height and it be easy to see that they be not distressed several large sugar pine stand near the thicket in which i be sheltered bow solemnly and toss they long arm as if interpret the very word of the storm while accept its wildest onset with passionate exhilaration the lion be feed those who have observe sunflower feast on sunshine during the golden day of indian summer know that none of they gesture express thankfulness they celestial food be too heartily give too heartily take to leave room for thanks the pine be evidently accept the benefaction of the storm in the same whole-souled manner and when i look down among the bud hazel and still lower to the young violet and fern-tuft on the rock i notice the same divine method of give and take and the same exquisite adaptation of what seem a outbreak of violent and uncontrollable force to the purpose of beautiful and delicate life calm like sleep come upon landscape just as they do on people and tree and storm awaken they in the same way in the dry midsummer of the lower portion of the range the withered hill and valley seem to lie as empty and expressionless as dead shell on a shore even the highest mountain may be find occasionally dull and uncommunicative as if in some way they have lose countenance and shrink to less than half they real stature but when the lightning crash and echo in the cañons and the cloud come down wreathing and crowning they bald snowy head every feature beam with expression and they rise again in all they impose majesty storm be fine speaker and tell all they know but they voice of lightning torrent and rush wind be much less numerous than the nameless still small voice too low for human ear and because we be poor listener we fail to catch much that be fairly within reach we best rain be hear mostly on roof and wind in chimney and when by choice or compulsion we be push into the heart of a storm the confusion make by cumbersome equipment and nervous haste and mean fear prevent we hear any other than the loudest expression yet we may draw enjoyment from storm sound that be beyond hearing and storm movement we can not see the sublime whirl of planet around they sun be as silent as raindrop ooze in the dark among the root of plant in this great storm as in every other there be tone and gesture inexpressibly gentle manifest in the midst of what be call violence and fury but easily recognize by all who look and listen for they the rain bring out the color of the wood with delightful freshness the rich brown of the bark of the tree and the fall bur and leave and dead fern the gray of rock and lichen the light purple of swell bud and the warm yellow green of the libocedrus and moss the air be steam with delightful fragrance not rise and waft past in separate mass but diffuse through all the atmosphere pine wood be always fragrant but most so in spring when the young tassel be open and in warm weather when the various gum and balsam be soften by the sun the wind be now chafe they innumerable needle and the warm rain be steep they monardellum grow here in large bed in the opening and there be plenty of laurel in dell and manzanita on the hillside and the rosy fragrant chamoebatium carpet the ground almost everywhere these with the gum and balsam of the wood form the main local fragrance-fountain of the storm the ascend cloud of aroma wind-rolled and rain-washed become pure like light and travel with the wind as part of it toward the middle of the afternoon the main flood cloud lift along its western border reveal a beautiful section of the sacramento valley some twenty or thirty mile away brilliantly sun-lighted and glister with rain-sheet as if pave with silver soon afterward a jagged bluff-like cloud with a sheer face appear over the valley of the yuba dark-colored and roughen with numerous furrow like some huge lava-table the blue coast range be see stretch along the sky like a beveled wall and the somber craggy marysville butte rise impressively out of the flood plain like island out of the sea then the rain begin to abate and i saunter down through the drip bush revel in the universal vigor and freshness that inspire all the life about I how clean and unworn and immortal the wood seem to be -- the lofty cedar in full bloom laden with golden pollen and they wash plume shine the pine rock gently and settle back into rest and the evening sunbeam spangle on the broad leaf of the madroños they tracery of yellow bough relieve against dusky thicket of chestnut oak liverwort lycopodium fern be exult in glorious revival and every moss that have ever live seem to be come crowd back from the dead to clothe each trunk and stone in live green the steam ground seem fairly to throb and tingle with life smilax fritillarium saxifrage and young violet be push up as if already conscious of the summer glory and innumerable green and yellow bud be peep and smile everywhere as for the bird and squirrel not a wing or tail of they be to be see while the storm be blow squirrel dislike wet weather more than cat do therefore they be at home rock in they dry nest the bird be hide in the dell out of the wind some of the strongest of they peck at acorn and manzanita berry but most be perch on low twig they breast feather puff out and keep one another company through the hard time as best they could when i arrive at the village about sundown the good people bestir themselves pity my bedraggled condition as if i be some benumb castaway snatch from the sea while i in turn warm with excitement and reek like the ground pity they for be dry and defraud of all the glory that nature have spread round about they that day chapter xii sierra thunder-storm the weather of spring and summer in the middle region of the sierra be usually well fleck with rain and light dusting of snow most of which be far too obviously joyful and life-giving to be regard as storm and in the picturesque beauty and clearness of outline of they cloud they offer striking contrast to those boundless all-embracing cloud-mantle of the storm of winter the smallest and most perfectly individualized specimen present a richly model cumulous cloud rise above the dark wood about 11 be swell with a visible motion straight up into the calm sunny sky to a height of 12000 to 14000 foot above the sea its white pearly boss relieve by gray and pale purple shadow in the hollow and show outline as keenly define as those of the glacier-polished dome in less than a hour it attain full development and stand poise in the blaze sunshine like some colossal mountain as beautiful in form and finish as if it be to become a permanent addition to the landscape presently a thunderbolt crash through the crisp air ringing like steel on steel sharp and clear its startling detonation break into a spray of echo against the cliff and cañon wall then down come a cataract of rain the big drop sift through the pine-needles plash and patter on the granite pavement and pour down the side of ridge and dome in a network of gray bubble rill in a few minute the cloud withers to a mesh of dim filament and disappear leave the sky perfectly clear and bright every dust-particle wipe and wash out of it everything be refresh and invigorate a steam of fragrance rise and the storm be finish -- one cloud one lightning-stroke and one dash of rain this be the sierra mid-summer thunder-storm reduce to its lowest term but some of they attain much larger proportion and assume a grandeur and energy of expression hardly surpass by those breed in the depths of winter produce those sudden flood call cloud-burst which be local and to a considerable extent periodical for they appear nearly every day about the same time for week usually about eleven o'clock and last from five minute to a hour or two one soon become so accustomed to see they that the noon sky seem empty and abandon without they as if nature be forget something when the glorious pearl and alabaster cloud of these noonday storm be be build i never give attention to anything else no mountain or mountain-range however divinely clothe with light have a more enduring charm than those fleeting mountain of the sky -- float fountain bear water for every well the angel of the stream and lake brood in the deep azure or sweeping softly along the ground over ridge and dome over meadow over forest over garden and grove linger with cool shadow refresh every flower and soothing rugged rock-brow with a gentleness of touch and gesture wholly divine the most beautiful and impose of the summer storm rise just above the upper edge of the silver fir zone and all be so beautiful that it be not easy to choose any one for particular description the one that i remember best fall on the mountain near yosemite valley July 19 1869 while i be encamp in the silver fir wood a range of bossy cumulus take possession of the sky huge dome and peak rise one beyond another with deep cañons between they bend this way and that in long curve and reach interrupted here and there with white upboiling mass that look like the spray of waterfall zigzag lance of lightning follow each other in quick succession and the thunder be so gloriously loud and massive it seem as if surely a entire mountain be be shatter at every stroke only the tree be touch however so far as i could see -- a few fir 200 foot high perhaps and five to six foot in diameter be split into long rail and sliver from top to bottom and scatter to all point of the compass then come the rain in a hearty flood cover the ground and make it shine with a continuous sheet of water that like a transparent film or skin fit closely down over all the rugged anatomy of the landscape it be not long geologically speak since the first raindrop fall on the present landscape of the sierra and in the few ten of thousand of year of stormy cultivation they have be bless with how beautiful they have become the first rain fall on raw crumble moraine and rock without a plant now scarcely a drop can fail to find a beautiful mark : on the top of the peak on the smooth glacier pavement on the curve of the dome on moraine full of crystal on the thousand form of yosemitic sculpture with they tender beauty of balmy flowery vegetation laving plashing glint patter some fall softly on meadow creep out of sight seek and find every thirsty rootlet some through the spire of the wood sift in dust through the needle and whisper good cheer to each of they some fall with blunt tap sound drum on the broad leaf of veratrum cypripedium saxifrage some fall straight into fragrant corolla kiss the lip of lily glint on the side of crystal on shine grain of gold some fall into the fountain of snow to swell they well-saved store some into the lake and river pat the smooth glassy level make dimple and bell and spray wash the mountain window wash the wander wind some plashing into the heart of snowy fall and cascade as if eager to join in the dance and the song and beat the foam yet finer good work and happy work for the merry mountain raindrop each one of they a brave fall in itself rush from the cliff and hollow of the cloud into the cliff and hollow of the mountain away from the thunder of the sky into the thunder of the roar river and how far they have to go and how many cup to fill -- cassiope-cup hold half a drop and lake basin between the hill each replenish with equal care -- every drop god 's messenger send on its way with glorious pomp and display of power -- silvery new-born star with lake and river mountain and valley -- all that the landscape hold -- reflect in they crystal depths chapter xiii the water-ouzel the waterfall of the sierra be frequent by only one bird -- the ouzel or water thrush -lrb- _ cinclus mexicanus _ sw -rrb- he be a singularly joyous and lovable little fellow about the size of a robin clothe in a plain waterproof suit of bluish gray with a tinge of chocolate on the head and shoulder in form he be about as smoothly plump and compact as a pebble that have be whirl in a pot-hole the flow contour of he body be interrupt only by he strong foot and bill the crisp wing-tip and the up-slanted wren-like tail among all the countless waterfall i have meet in the course of ten year ' exploration in the sierra whether among the icy peak or warm foot-hill or in the profound yosemitic cañons of the middle region not one be find without its ouzel no cañon be too cold for this little bird none too lonely provide it be rich in fall water find a fall or cascade or rush rapid anywhere upon a clear stream and there you will surely find its complementary ouzel flit about in the spray diving in foam eddy whirling like a leaf among beaten foam-bell ever vigorous and enthusiastic yet self-contained and neither seek nor shun you company -lrb- illustration : water-ouzel diving and feeding -rrb- if disturb while dip about in the margin shallow he either set off with a rapid whir to some other feeding-ground up or down the stream or alight on some half-submerged rock or snag out in the current and immediately begin to nod and courtesy like a wren turn he head from side to side with many other odd dainty movement that never fail to fix the attention of the observer he be the mountain stream ' own darling the humming-bird of bloom water loving rocky ripple-slope and sheet of foam as a bee love flower as a lark love sunshine and meadow among all the mountain bird none have cheer I so much in my lonely wanderings -- none so unfailingly for both in winter and summer he sing sweetly cheerily independent alike of sunshine and of love require no other inspiration than the stream on which he dwell while water sing so must he in heat or cold calm or storm ever attune he voice in sure accord low in the drought of summer and the drought of winter but never silent during the golden day of indian summer after most of the snow have be melt and the mountain stream have become feeble -- a succession of silent pool link together by shallow transparent current and strip of silvery lacework -- then the song of the ouzel be at its lowest ebb but as soon as the winter cloud have bloom and the mountain treasury be once more replenish with snow the voice of the stream and ouzel increase in strength and richness until the flood season of early summer then the torrent chant they noblest anthem and then be the flood-time of we songster 's melody as for weather dark day and sun day be the same to he the voice of most song-bird however joyous suffer a long winter eclipse but the ouzel sing on through all the season and every kind of storm indeed no storm can be more violent than those of the waterfall in the midst of which he delight to dwell however dark and boisterous the weather snow blowing or cloudy all the same he sing and with never a note of sadness no need of spring sunshine to thaw _ he _ song for it never freeze never shall you hear anything wintry from _ he _ warm breast no pinched cheeping no waver note between sorrow and joy he mellow fluty voice be ever tune to downright gladness as free from dejection as cock-crowing it be pitiful to see wee frost-pinched sparrow on cold morning in the mountain grove shake the snow from they feather and hop about as if anxious to be cheery then hasten back to they hiding out of the wind puff out they breast-feather over they toe and subside among the leaf cold and breakfastless while the snow continue to fall and there be no sign of clearing but the ouzel never call forth a single touch of pity not because he be strong to endure but rather because he seem to live a charmed life beyond the reach of every influence that make endurance necessary one wild winter morning when yosemite valley be sweep its length from west to east by a cordial snow-storm i sallied forth to see what i might learn and enjoy a sort of gray gloaming-like darkness fill the valley the huge wall be out of sight all ordinary sound be smother and even the loudest booming of the fall be at time bury beneath the roar of the heavy-laden blast the loose snow be already over five foot deep on the meadow make extended walk impossible without the aid of snow-shoe i find no great difficulty however in make my way to a certain ripple on the river where one of my ouzel live he be at home busily glean he breakfast among the pebble of a shallow portion of the margin apparently unaware of anything extraordinary in the weather presently he fly out to a stone against which the icy current be beat and turn he back to the wind sing as delightfully as a lark in springtime after spend a hour or two with my favorite i make my way across the valley boring and wallow through the drift to learn as definitely as possible how the other bird be spend they time the yosemite bird be easily find during the winter because all of they except the ouzel be restricted to the sunny north side of the valley the south side be constantly eclipse by the great frosty shadow of the wall and because the indian cañon grove from they peculiar exposure be the warmest the bird congregate there more especially in severe weather i find most of the robin cower on the lee side of the larger branch where the snow could not fall upon they while two or three of the more enterprising be make desperate effort to reach the mistletoe berry by cling nervously to the under side of the snow-crowned mass back downward like woodpecker every now and then they would dislodge some of the loose fringe of the snow-crown which would come sift down on they and send they scream back to camp where they would subside among they companion with a shiver mutter in low querulous chatter like hungry child some of the sparrow be busy at the foot of the larger tree glean seed and benumbed insect join now and then by a robin weary of he unsuccessful attempt upon the snow-covered berry the brave woodpecker be cling to the snowless side of the larger bole and overarching branch of the camp tree make short night from side to side of the grove pecking now and then at the acorn they have store in the bark and chatter aimlessly as if unable to keep still yet evidently put in the time in a very dull way like storm-bound traveler at a country tavern the hardy nut-hatch be thread the open furrow of the trunk in they usual industrious manner and utter they quaint note evidently less distressed than they neighbor the steller jay be of course make more noisy stir than all the other bird combine ever come and go with loud bluster scream as if each have a lump of melting sludge in he throat and take good care to improve the favorable opportunity afford by the storm to steal from the acorn store of the woodpecker i also notice one solitary gray eagle brave the storm on the top of a tall pine-stump just outside the main grove he be stand bolt upright with he back to the wind a tuft of snow pile on he square shoulder a monument of passive endurance thus every snow-bound bird seem more or less uncomfortable if not in positive distress the storm be reflect in every gesture and not one cheerful note not to say song come from a single bill they cower joyless endurance offer a striking contrast to the spontaneous irrepressible gladness of the ouzel who could no more help exhale sweet song than a rose sweet fragrance he _ must _ sing though the heaven fall i remember notice the distress of a pair of robin during the violent earthquake of the year 1872 when the pine of the valley with strange movement flap and wave they branch and beetle rock-brow come thunder down to the meadow in tremendous avalanche it do not occur to I in the midst of the excitement of other observation to look for the ouzel but i doubt not they be sing straight on through it all regard the terrible rock-thunder as fearlessly as they do the booming of the waterfall what may be regard as the separate song of the ouzel be exceedingly difficult of description because they be so variable and at the same time so confluent though i have be acquaint with my favorite ten year and during most of this time have hear he sing nearly every day i still detect note and strain that seem new to I nearly all of he music be sweet and tender lapsing from he round breast like water over the smooth lip of a pool then break farther on into a sparkling foam of melodious note which glow with subdue enthusiasm yet without express much of the strong gush ecstasy of the bobolink or skylark the more striking strain be perfect arabesque of melody compose of a few full round mellow note embroider with delicate trill which fade and melt in long slender cadence in a general way he music be that of the stream refine and spiritualize the deep booming note of the fall be in it the trill of rapid the gurgling of margin eddy the low whispering of level reach and the sweet tinkle of separate drop ooze from the end of moss and fall into tranquil pool the ouzel never sing in chorus with other bird nor with he kind but only with the stream and like flower that bloom beneath the surface of the ground some of we favorite 's best song-blossom never rise above the surface of the heavier music of the water i have often observe he singing in the midst of beaten spray he music completely bury beneath the water 's roar yet i know he be surely singing by he gesture and the movement of he bill he food as far as i have notice consist of all kind of water insect which in summer be chiefly procure along shallow margin here he wade about duck he head under water and deftly turn over pebble and fall leaf with he bill seldom choose to go into deep water where he have to use he wing in diving he seem to be especially fond of the larva of mosquito find in abundance attach to the bottom of smooth rock channel where the current be shallow when feed in such place he wade up-stream and often while he head be under water the swift current be deflect upward along the glossy curve of he neck and shoulder in the form of a clear crystalline shell which fairly inclose he like a bell-glass the shell be break and re-form as he lift and dip he head while ever and anon he sidle out to where the too powerful current carry he off he foot then he dexterously rise on the wing and go glean again in shallower place but during the winter when the stream-bank be emboss in snow and the stream themselves be chill nearly to the freezing-point so that the snow fall into they in stormy weather be not wholly dissolve but form a thin blue sludge thus render the current opaque -- then he seek the deeper portion of the main river where he may dive to clear water beneath the sludge or he repair to some open lake or mill-pond at the bottom of which he feed in safety when thus compel to betake himself to a lake he do not plunge into it at once like a duck but always alight in the first place upon some rock or fall pine along the shore then fly out thirty or forty yard more or less accord to the character of the bottom he alight with a dainty glint on the surface swim about look down finally make up he mind and disappear with a sharp stroke of he wing after feed for two or three minute he suddenly reappear shower the water from he wing with one vigorous shake and rise abruptly into the air as if push up from beneath come back to he perch sing a few minute and go out to dive again thus come and go singing and diving at the same place for hour -lrb- illustration : one of the late-summer feeding-grounds of the ouzel -rrb- the ouzel be usually find singly rarely in pair except during the breed season and _ very _ rarely in three or fours i once observe three thus spend a winter morning in company upon a small glacier lake on the upper merce about 7500 foot above the level of the sea a storm have occur during the night but the morning sun shine unclouded and the shadowy lake gleam darkly in its setting of fresh snow lay smooth and motionless as a mirror my camp chance to be within a few foot of the water 's edge opposite a fall pine some of the branch of which lean out over the lake here my three dearly welcome visitor take up they station and at once begin to embroider the frosty air with they delicious melody doubly delightful to I that particular morning as i have be somewhat apprehensive of danger in break my way down through the snow-choked cañons to the lowland the portion of the lake bottom select for a feeding-ground lie at a depth of fifteen or twenty foot below the surface and be cover with a short growth of alga and other aquatic plant -- fact i have previously determine while sailing over it on a raft after alight on the glassy surface they occasionally indulge in a little play chase one another round about in small circle then all three would suddenly dive together and then come ashore and sing the ouzel seldom swim more than a few yard on the surface for not be web-footed he make rather slow progress but by means of he strong crisp wing he swim or rather fly with celerity under the surface often to considerable distance but it be in withstand the force of heavy rapid that he strength of wing in this respect be most strikingly manifest the follow may be regard as a fair illustration of he power of sub-aquatic flight one stormy morning in winter when the merce river be blue and green with unmelted snow i observe one of my ouzel perch on a snag out in the midst of a swift-rushing rapid singing cheerily as if everything be just to he mind and while i stand on the bank admire he he suddenly plunge into the sludgy current leave he song abruptly break off after feed a minute or two at the bottom and when one would suppose that he must inevitably be sweep far down-stream he emerge just where he go down alight on the same snag shower the water-bead from he feather and continue he unfinished song seemingly in tranquil ease as if it have suffer no interruption -lrb- illustration : ouzel enter a white current -rrb- the ouzel alone of all bird dare to enter a white torrent and though strictly terrestrial in structure no other be so inseparably related to water not even the duck or the bold ocean albatross or the stormy-petrel for duck go ashore as soon as they finish feed in undisturbed place and very often make long flight over land from lake to lake or field to field the same be true of most other aquatic bird but the ouzel bear on the brink of a stream or on a snag or boulder in the midst of it seldom leave it for a single moment for notwithstanding he be often on the wing he never fly overland but whir with rapid quail-like beat above the stream trace all its winding even when the stream be quite small say from five to ten foot wide he seldom shorten he flight by cross a bend however abrupt it may be and even when disturb by meet some one on the bank he prefer to fly over one 's head to dodge out over the ground when therefore he flight along a crooked stream be view endwise it appear most strikingly waver -- a description on the air of every curve with lightning-like rapidity the vertical curve and angle of the most precipitous torrent he trace with the same rigid fidelity swoop down the incline of cascade drop sheer over dizzy fall amid the spray and ascend with the same fearlessness and ease seldom seek to lessen the steepness of the acclivity by begin to ascend before reach the base of the fall no matter though it may be several hundred foot in height he hold straight on as if about to dash headlong into the throng of booming rocket then dart abruptly upward and after alight at the top of the precipice to rest a moment proceed to feed and sing he flight be solid and impetuous without any intermission of wing-beat -- one homogeneous buzz like that of a laden bee on its way home and while thus buzz freely from fall to fall he be frequently hear give utterance to a long outdrawn train of unmodulated note in no way connect with he song but correspond closely with he flight in sustained vigor be the flight of all the ouzel in the sierra trace on a chart they would indicate the direction of the flow of the entire system of ancient glacier from about the period of the break up of the ice-sheet until near the close of the glacial winter because the stream which the ouzel so rigidly follow be with the unimportant exception of a few side tributary all flow in channel erode for they out of the solid flank of the range by the vanish glacier -- the stream trace the ancient glacier the ouzel trace the stream nor do we find so complete compliance to glacial condition in the life of any other mountain bird or animal of any kind bear frequently accept the pathway lay down by glacier as the easiest to travel but they often leave they and cross over from cañon to cañon so also most of the bird trace the moraine to some extent because the forest be grow on they but they wander far cross the cañons from grove to grove and draw exceedingly angular and complicated course the ouzel 's nest be one of the most extraordinary piece of bird architecture i ever see odd and novel in design perfectly fresh and beautiful and in every way worthy of the genius of the little builder it be about a foot in diameter round and bossy in outline with a neatly arched opening near the bottom somewhat like a old-fashioned brick oven or hottentot 's hut it be build almost exclusively of green and yellow moss chiefly the beautiful fronded hypnum that cover the rock and old drift-log in the vicinity of waterfall these be deftly interwoven and felt together into a charming little hut and so situate that many of the outer moss continue to flourish as if they have not be pluck a few fine silky-stemmed grass be occasionally find interwoven with the moss but with the exception of a thin layer line the floor they presence seem accidental as they be of a species find grow with the moss and be probably pluck with they the site choose for this curious mansion be usually some little rock-shelf within reach of the lighter particle of the spray of a waterfall so that its wall be keep green and grow at least during the time of high water no harsh line be present by any portion of the nest as see in place but when remove from its shelf the back and bottom and sometimes a portion of the top be find quite sharply angular because it be make to conform to the surface of the rock upon which and against which it be build the little architect always take advantage of slight crevice and protuberance that may chance to offer to render he structure stable by means of a kind of grip and dovetail in choose a building-spot concealment do not seem to be take into consideration yet notwithstanding the nest be large and guilelessly expose to view it be far from be easily detect chiefly because it swell forward like any other bulge moss-cushion grow naturally in such situation this be more especially the case where the nest be keep fresh by be well sprinkle sometimes these romantic little hut have they beauty enhance by rock-fern and grass that spring up around the mossy wall or in front of the door-sill drip with crystal bead furthermore at certain hour of the day when the sunshine be pour down at the require angle the whole mass of the spray envelop the fairy establishment be brilliantly irise and it be through so glorious a rainbow atmosphere as this that some of we bless ouzel obtain they first peep at the world ouzel seem so completely part and parcel of the stream they inhabit they scarce suggest any other origin than the stream themselves and one might almost be pardon in fancy they come direct from the living water like flower from the ground at least from whatever cause it never occur to I to look for they nest until more than a year after i have make the acquaintance of the bird themselves although i find one the very day on which i begin the search in make my way from yosemite to the glacier at the head of the merce and tuolumne river i camped in a particularly wild and romantic portion of the nevada cañon where in previous excursion i have never fail to enjoy the company of my favorite who be attract here no doubt by the safe nesting-place in the shelve rock and by the abundance of food and fall water the river for mile above and below consist of a succession of small fall from ten to sixty foot in height connect by flat plume-like cascade that go flash from fall to fall free and almost channelless over wave fold of glacier-polished granite on the south side of one of the fall that portion of the precipice which be bath by the spray present a series of little shelf and tablet cause by the development of plane of cleavage in the granite and by the consequent fall of mass through the action of the water now here say i of all place be the most charming spot for a ouzel 's nest then carefully scan the fret face of the precipice through the spray i at length notice a yellowish moss-cushion grow on the edge of a level tablet within five or six foot of the outer fold of the fall but apart from the fact of its be situate where one acquaint with the life of ouzel would fancy a ouzel 's nest ought to be there be nothing in its appearance visible at first sight to distinguish it from other boss of rock-moss similarly situate with reference to perennial spray and it be not until i have scrutinize it again and again and have remove my shoe and stocking and creep along the face of the rock within eight or ten foot of it that i could decide certainly whether it be a nest or a natural growth in these moss hut three or four egg be lay white like foam-bubble and well may the little bird hatch from they sing water song for they hear they all they life and even before they be bear i have often observe the young just out of the nest make they odd gesture and seem in every way as much at home as they experienced parent like young bee on they first excursion to the flower field no amount of familiarity with people and they way seem to change they in the least to all appearance they behavior be just the same on see a man for the first time as when they have see he frequently -lrb- illustration : the ouzel at home -rrb- on the lower reach of the river where mill be build they sing on through the din of the machinery and all the noisy confusion of dog cattle and workman on one occasion while a wood-chopper be at work on the river-bank i observe one cheerily singing within reach of the fly chip nor do any kind of unwonted disturbance put he in bad humor or frighten he out of calm self-possession in pass through a narrow gorge i once drive one ahead of I from rapid to rapid disturbing he four time in quick succession where he could not very well fly past I on account of the narrowness of the channel most bird under similar circumstance fancy themselves pursue and become suspiciously uneasy but instead of grow nervous about it he make he usual dipping and sing one of he most tranquil strain when observe within a few yard they eye be see to express remarkable gentleness and intelligence but they seldom allow so near a view unless one wear clothing of about the same color as the rock and tree and know how to sit still on one occasion while ramble along the shore of a mountain lake where the bird at least those bear that season have never see a man i sit down to rest on a large stone close to the water 's edge upon which it seem the ouzel and sandpiper be in the habit of alight when they come to feed on that part of the shore and some of the other bird also when they come down to wash or drink in a few minute along come a whir ouzel and alight on the stone beside I within reach of my hand then suddenly observe I he stoop nervously as if about to fly on the instant but as i remain as motionless as the stone he gain confidence and look I steadily in the face for about a minute then fly quietly to the outlet and begin to sing next come a sandpiper and gaze at I with much the same guileless expression of eye as the ouzel lastly down with a swoop come a steller 's jay out of a fir-tree probably with the intention of moisten he noisy throat but instead of sit confidingly as my other visitor have do he rush off at once nearly tumble heel over head into the lake in he suspicious confusion and with loud scream rouse the neighborhood love for song-bird with they sweet human voice appear to be more common and unfailing than love for flower every one love flower to some extent at least in life 's fresh morning attract by they as instinctively as humming-bird and bee even the young digger indian have sufficient love for the brightest of those find grow on the mountain to gather they and braid they as decoration for the hair and i be glad to discover through the few indian that could be induce to talk on the subject that they have name for the wild rose and the lily and other conspicuous flower whether available as food or otherwise most man however whether savage or civilized become apathetic toward all plant that have no other apparent use than the use of beauty but fortunately one 's first instinctive love of song-bird be never wholly obliterate no matter what the influence upon we life may be i have often be delight to see a pure spiritual glow come into the countenance of hard business-man and old miner when a song-bird chance to alight near they nevertheless the little mouthful of meat that swell out the breast of some song-bird be too often the cause of they death lark and robin in particular be bring to market in hundred but fortunately the ouzel have no enemy so eager to eat he little body as to follow he into the mountain solitude i never know he to be chase even by hawk a acquaintance of mine a sort of foot-hill mountaineer have a pet cat a great dozy overgrown creature about as broad-shouldered as a lynx during the winter while the snow lay deep the mountaineer sit in he lonely cabin among the pine smoke he pipe and wear the dull time away tom be he sole companion share he bed and sit beside he on a stool with much the same drowsy expression of eye as he master the good-natured bachelor be content with he hard fare of soda-bread and bacon but tom the only creature in the world acknowledge dependence on he must need be provide with fresh meat accordingly he bestir himself to contrive squirrel-trap and wade the snowy wood with he gun make sad havoc among the few winter bird spare neither robin sparrow nor tiny nuthatch and the pleasure of see tom eat and grow fat be he great reward one cold afternoon while hunting along the river-bank he notice a plain-feathered little bird skip about in the shallows and immediately raise he gun but just then the confide songster begin to sing and after listen to he summery melody the charm hunter turn away say bless you little heart i can not shoot you not even for tom -lrb- illustration : yosemite bird snow-bound at the foot of indian cañon -rrb- even so far north as icy alaska i have find my glad singer when i be explore the glacier between mount fairweather and the stikeen river one cold day in November after try in vain to force a way through the innumerable iceberg of sum dum bay to the great glacier at the head of it i be weary and baffled and sit rest in my canoe convince at last that i would have to leave this part of my work for another year then i begin to plan my escape to open water before the young ice which be begin to form should shut I in while i thus linger drift with the berg in the midst of these gloomy foreboding and all the terrible glacial desolation and grandeur i suddenly hear the well-known whir of a ouzel 's wing and look up see my little comforter come straight across the ice from the shore in a second or two he be with I fly three time round my head with a happy salute as if say cheer up old friend you see i be here and all 's well then he fly back to the shore alight on the topmost jag of a stranded iceberg and begin to nod and bow as though he be on one of he favorite boulder in the midst of a sunny sierra cascade the species be distribute all along the mountain-range of the pacific coast from alaska to mexico and east to the rocky mountain nevertheless it be as yet comparatively little known audubon and wilson do not meet it swainson be i believe the first naturalist to describe a specimen from mexico specimen be shortly afterward procure by drummond near the source of the athabasca river between the fifty-fourth and fifty-sixth parallel and it have be collect by nearly all of the numerous explore expedition undertake of late through we western state and territory for it never fail to engage the attention of naturalist in a very particular manner such then be we little cinclus beloved of every one who be so fortunate as to know he trace on strong wing every curve of the most precipitous torrent from one extremity of the sierra to the other not fear to follow they through they darkest gorge and coldest snow-tunnel acquaint with every waterfall echo they divine music and throughout the whole of they beautiful life interpret all that we in we unbelief call terrible in the utterance of torrent and storm as only varied expression of god 's eternal love chapter xiv the wild sheep -lrb- _ ovi montana _ -rrb- the wild sheep rank highest among the animal mountaineer of the sierra possess of keen sight and scent and strong limb he dwell secure amid the loftiest summit leap unscathed from crag to crag up and down the front of giddy precipice cross foam torrent and slope of frozen snow expose to the wildest storm yet maintain a brave warm life and develop from generation to generation in perfect strength and beauty nearly all the lofty mountain-chain of the globe be inhabit by wild sheep most of which on account of the remote and all but inaccessible region where they dwell be imperfectly know as yet they be classify by different naturalist under from five to ten distinct species or variety the best know be the burrhel of the himalaya -lrb- _ ovi burrhel _ blyth -rrb- the argalus the large wild sheep of central and northeastern asia -lrb- _ o ammon _ linn or _ caprovis argali _ -rrb- the corsican mouflon -lrb- _ o musimon _ pal -rrb- the aoudad of the mountain of northern africa -lrb- _ ammotragus tragelaphus _ -rrb- and the rocky mountain bighorn -lrb- _ o montana _ cuv -rrb- to this last-named species belong the wild sheep of the sierra its range accord to the late professor baird of the smithsonian institution extend from the region of the upper missourus and yellowstone to the rocky mountain and the high grounds adjacent to they on the eastern slope and as far south as the rio grande westward it extend to the coast range of washington oregon and californium and follow the highland some distance into mexico -lrb- 1 -rrb- throughout the vast region bound on the east by the wahsatch mountain and on the west by the sierra there be more than a hundred subordinate range and mountain group trend north and south range beyond range with summit rise from eight to twelve thousand foot above the level of the sea probably all of which accord to my own observation be or have be inhabit by this species compare with the argalus which consider its size and the vast extent of its range be probably the most important of all the wild sheep we species be about the same size but the horn be less twisted and less divergent the more important characteristic be however essentially the same some of the best naturalist maintain that the two be only varied form of one species in accordance with this view cuvier conjecture that since central asia seem to be the region where the sheep first appear and from which it have be distribute the argalus may have be distribute over this continent from asia by cross ber strait on ice this conjecture be not so ill found as at first sight would appear for the strait be only about fifty mile wide be interrupt by three island and be jam with ice nearly every winter furthermore the argalus be abundant on the mountain adjacent to the strait at east cape where it be well know to the tschuckchus hunter and where i have see many of they horn on account of the extreme variability of the sheep under culture it be generally suppose that the innumerable domestic breed have all be derive from the few wild species but the whole question be involve in obscurity accord to darwin sheep have be domesticate from a very ancient period the remains of a small breed differ from any now know have be find in the famous swiss lake-dwelling compare with the best-known domestic breed we find that we wild species be much larger and instead of a all-wool garment wear a thick over-coat of hair like that of the deer and a under-covering of fine wool the hair though rather coarse be comfortably soft and spongy and lie smooth as if carefully tend with comb and brush the predominant color during most of the year be brownish-gray vary to bluish-gray in the autumn the belly and a large conspicuous patch on the buttock be white and the tail which be very short like that of a deer be black with a yellowish border the wool be white and grow in beautiful spiral down out of sight among the shine hair like delicate climb vine among stalk of corn the horn of the male be of immense size measure in they greater diameter from five to six and a half inch and from two and a half to three foot in length around the curve they be yellowish-white in color and ridge transversely like those of the domestic ram they cross-section near the base be somewhat triangular in outline and flatten toward the tip rise boldly from the top of the head they curve gently backward and outward then forward and outward until about three fourth of a circle be describe and until the flatten blunt tip be about two foot or two and a half foot apart those of the female be flatten throughout they entire length be less curved than those of the male and much smaller measure less than a foot along the curve a ram and ewe that i obtain near the modoc lava-bed to the northeast of mount shasta measure as follow : _ ram ewe _ _ ft in ft in _ height at shoulder 3 6 3 0 girth around shoulder 3 11 3 3-3\/4 length from nose to root of tail 5 10-1\/4 4 3-1\/2 length of ear 0 4-3\/4 0 5 length of tail 0 4-1\/2 0 4-1\/2 length of horn around curve 2 9 0 11-1\/2 distance across from tip to tip of horn 2 5-1\/2 circumference of horn at base 1 4 0 6 the measurement of a male obtain in the rocky mountain by audubon vary but little as compare with the above the weight of he specimen be 344 pound -lrb- 2 -rrb- which be perhaps about a average for full-grown male the female be about a third lighter besides these difference in size color hair etc as note above we may observe that the domestic sheep in a general way be expressionless like a dull bundle of something only half alive while the wild be as elegant and graceful as a deer every movement manifest admirable strength and character the tame be timid the wild be bold the tame be always more or less ruffle and dirty while the wild be as smooth and clean as the flower of he mountain pasture the earliest mention that i have be able to find of the wild sheep in america be by father picolo a catholic missionary at monterey in the year 1797 who after describe it oddly enough as a kind of deer with a sheep-like head and about as large as a calf one or two year old naturally hurry on to remark : i have eat of these beast they flesh be very tender and delicious mackenzie in he northern travels hear the species speak of by the indian as white buffalo and lewi and clark tell we that in a time of great scarcity on the head water of the missourus they see plenty of wild sheep but they be too shy to be shoot a few of the more energetic of the pah ute indian hunt the wild sheep every season among the more accessible section of the high sierra in the neighborhood of pass where from have be pursue they have become extremely wary but in the rugged wilderness of peak and cañons where the foam tributary of the san joaquin and king 's river take they rise they fear no hunter save the wolf and be more guileless and approachable than they tame kindred while engage in the work of explore high region where they delight to roam i have be greatly interested in study they habit in the month of November and December and probably during a considerable portion of midwinter they all flock together male and female old and young i once find a complete band of this kind numbering upward of fifty which on be alarm go bound away across a jagged lava-bed at admirable speed lead by a majestic old ram with the lamb safe in the middle of the flock in spring and summer the full-grown ram form separate band of from three to twenty and be usually find feed along the edge of glacier meadow or rest among the castle-like crag of the high summit and whether quietly feed or scale the wild cliff they noble form and the power and beauty of they movement never fail to strike the beholder with lively admiration they resting-place seem to be choose with reference to sunshine and a wide outlook and most of all to safety they feeding-grounds be among the most beautiful of the wild garden bright with daisy and gentian and mat of purple bryanthus lie hide away on rocky headland and cañon side where sunshine be abundant or down in the shady glacier valley along the bank of the stream and lake where the plushy sod be greenest here they feast all summer the happy wanderer perhaps relish the beauty as well as the taste of the lovely flora on which they feed -lrb- illustration : snow-bound on mount shasta -rrb- when the winter storm set in load they highland pasture with snow then like the bird they gather and go to lower climate usually descend the eastern flank of the range to the rough volcanic table-land and treeless range of the great basin adjacent to the sierra they never make haste however and seem to have no dread of storm many of the strongest only go down leisurely to bare wind-swept ridge to feed on bush and dry bunch-grass and then return up into the snow once i be snow-bound on mount shasta for three day a little below the timber line it be a dark and stormy time well calculate to test the skill and endurance of mountaineer the snow-laden gale drive on night and day in hiss blind flood and when at length it begin to abate i find that a small band of wild sheep have weather the storm in the lee of a clump of dwarf pine a few yard above my storm-nest where the snow be eight or ten foot deep i be warm back of a rock with blanket bread and fire my brave companion lay in the snow without food and with only the partial shelter of the short tree yet they make no sign of suffer or faint-heartedness in the month of may and June the wild sheep bring forth they young in solitary and almost inaccessible crag far above the nesting-rock of the eagle i have frequently come upon the bed of the ewe and lamb at a elevation of from 12000 to 13000 foot above sea-level these bed be simply oval-shaped hollow paw out among loose disintegrate rock-chip and sand upon some sunny spot command a good outlook and partially sheltered from the wind that sweep those lofty peak almost without intermission such be the cradle of the little mountaineer aloft in the very sky rock in storm curtain in cloud sleep in thin icy air but wrap in he hairy coat and nourish by a strong warm mother defend from the talon of the eagle and the tooth of the sly coyote the bonny lamb grow apace he soon learn to nibble the tufted rock-grass and leaf of the white spirsea he horn begin to shoot and before summer be do he be strong and agile and go forth with the flock watch by the same divine love that tend the more helpless human lamb in its cradle by the fireside nothing be more commonly remark by noisy dusty trail-traveler in the sierra than the want of animal life -- no song-bird no deer no squirrel no game of any kind they say but if such could only go away quietly into the wilderness saunter afoot and alone with natural deliberation they would soon learn that these mountain mansion be not without inhabitant many of whom confide and gentle would not try to shun they acquaintance -lrb- illustration : head of the merino ram -lrb- domestic -rrb- -rrb- in the fall of 1873 i be trace the south fork of the san joaquin up its wild cañon to its farthest glacier fountain it be the season of alpine indian summer the sun beam lovingly the squirrel be nut in the pine-tree butterfly hover about the last of the goldenrod the willow and maple thicket be yellow the meadow brown and the whole sunny mellow landscape glow like a countenance in the deepest and sweetest repose on my way over the glacier-polished rock along the river i come to a expand portion of the cañon about two mile long and half a mile wide which form a level park inclose with picturesque granite wall like those of yosemite valley down through the middle of it pour the beautiful river shine and spangle in the golden light yellow grove on its bank and strip of brown meadow while the whole park be astir with wild life some of which even the noisiest and least observe of traveler must have see have they be with I deer with they supple well-grown fawn bound from thicket to thicket as i advanced grouse keep rise from the brown grass with a great whir of wing and alight on the lower branch of the pine and poplar allow a near approach as if curious to see I farther on a broad-shouldered wildcat show himself come out of a grove and cross the river on a flood-jamb of log halt for a moment to look back the bird-like tamia frisk about my foot everywhere among the pine-needle and seedy grass-tuft crane wade the shallows of the river-bend the kingfisher rattle from perch to perch and the bless ouzel sing amid the spray of every cascade where may lonely wanderer find a more interesting family of mountain-dwellers earth-born companion and fellow-mortal it be afternoon when i join they and the glorious landscape begin to fade in the gloaming before i awake from they enchantment then i seek a camp-ground on the river-bank make a cupful of tea and lay down to sleep on a smooth place among the yellow leaf of a aspen grove next day i discover yet grander landscape and grander life follow the river over huge swell rock-boss through a majestic cañon and past innumerable cascade the scenery in general become gradually wilder and more alpine the sugar pine and silver fir give place to the hardier cedar and hemlock spruce the cañon wall become more rugged and bare and gentian and arctic daisy become more abundant in the garden and strip of meadow along the stream toward the middle of the afternoon i come to another valley strikingly wild and original in all its feature and perhaps never before touch by human foot as regard area of level bottom-land it be one of the very smallest of the yosemite type but its wall be sublime rise to a height of from 2000 to 4000 foot above the river at the head of the valley the main cañon fork as be find to be the case in all yosemite the formation of this one be due chiefly to the action of two great glacier whose fountain lay to the eastward on the flank of mount humphrey and emerson and a cluster of nameless peak farther south -lrb- illustration : head of rocky mountain wild sheep -rrb- the gray boulder-chafed river be singing loudly through the valley but above its massy roar i hear the booming of a waterfall which draw I eagerly on and just as i emerge from the tangled grove and brier-thicket at the head of the valley the main fork of the river come in sight fall fresh from its glacier fountain in a snowy cascade between granite wall 2000 foot high the steep incline down which the glad water thunder seem to bar all farther progress it be not long however before i discover a crooked seam in the rock by which i be enable to climb to the edge of a terrace that cross the cañon and divide the cataract nearly in the middle here i sit down to take breath and make some entry in my note-book take advantage at the same time of my elevated position above the tree to gaze back over the valley into the heart of the noble landscape little know the while what neighbor be near after spend a few minute in this way i chance to look across the fall and there stand three sheep quietly observe I never do the sudden appearance of a mountain or fall or human friend more forcibly seize and rivet my attention anxiety to observe accurately hold I perfectly still eagerly i mark the flow undulation of they firm braided muscle they strong leg ear eye head they graceful rounded neck the color of they hair and the bold upsweeping curve of they noble horn when they move i watch every gesture while they in no wise disconcerted either by my attention or by the tumultuous roar of the water advance deliberately alongside the rapid between the two division of the cataract turn now and then to look at I presently they come to a steep ice-burnished acclivity which they ascend by a succession of quick short stiff-legged leap reach the top without a struggle this be the most startling feat of mountaineering i have ever witness and consider only the mechanic of the thing my astonishment could hardly have be greater have they display wing and take to flight surefooted mule on such ground would have fall and roll like loosen boulder many a time where the slope be far lower i have be compel to take off my shoe and stocking tie they to my belt and creep barefoot with the utmost caution no wonder then that i watch the progress of these animal mountaineer with keen sympathy and exult in the boundless sufficiency of wild nature display in they invention construction and keep a few minute later i catch sight of a dozen more in one band near the foot of the upper fall they be stand on the same side of the river with I only twenty-five or thirty yard away look as unworn and perfect as if create on the spot it appear by they track which i have see in the little yosemite and by they present position that when i come up the cañon they be all feed together down in the valley and in they haste to reach high ground where they could look about they to ascertain the nature of the strange disturbance they be divide three ascend on one side the river the rest on the other the main band head by a experienced chief now begin to cross the wild rapid between the two division of the cascade this be another exciting feat for among all the varied experience of mountaineer the cross of boisterous rock-dashed torrent be find to be one of the most try to the nerve yet these fine fellow walk fearlessly to the brink and jump from boulder to boulder hold themselves in easy poise above the whirling confusing current as if they be do nothing extraordinary -lrb- illustration : cross a cañon stream -rrb- in the immediate foreground of this rare picture there be a fold of ice-burnished granite traverse by a few bold line in which rock-fern and tuft of bryanthus be grow the gray cañon wall on the side nobly sculpture and adorn with brown cedar and pine lofty peak in the distance and in the middle ground the snowy fall the voice and soul of the landscape fringing bush beat time to its thunder-tone the brave sheep in front of it they gray form slightly obscure in the spray yet stand out in good heavy relief against the close white water with they huge horn rise like the upturned root of dead pine-tree while the evening sunbeam streaming up the cañon color all the picture a rosy purple and make it glorious after cross the river the dauntless climber lead by they chief at once begin to scale the cañon wall turn now right now leave in long single file keep well apart out of one another 's way and leap in regular succession from crag to crag now ascend slippery dome-curve now walk leisurely along the edge of precipice stop at time to gaze down at I from some flat-topped rock with head hold aslant as if curious to learn what i think about it or whether i be likely to follow they after reach the top of the wall which at this place be somewhere between 1500 and 2000 foot high they be still visible against the sky as they linger look down in group of two or three throughout the entire ascent they do not make a single awkward step or a unsuccessful effort of any kind i have frequently see tame sheep in mountain jump upon a slope rock-surface hold on tremulously a few seconds and fall back baffle and irresolute but in the most try situation where the slightest want or inaccuracy would have be fatal these always seem to move in comfortable reliance on they strength and skill the limit of which they never appear to know moreover each one of the flock while follow the guidance of the most experienced yet climb with intelligent independence as a perfect individual capable of separate existence whenever it should wish or be compel to withdraw from the little clan the domestic sheep on the contrary be only a fraction of a animal a whole flock be require to form a individual just as numerous floweret be require to make one complete sunflower those shepherd who in summer drive they flock to the mountain pasture and while watch they night and day have see they frightened by bear and storm and scatter like wind-driven chaff will in some measure be able to appreciate the self-reliance and strength and noble individuality of nature 's sheep like the alp-climbing ibex of europe we mountaineer be say to plunge headlong down the face of sheer precipice and alight on he big horn i know only two hunter who claim to have actually witness this feat i never be so fortunate they describe the act as a diving head-foremost the horn be so large at the base that they cover the upper portion of the head down nearly to a level with the eye and the skull be exceedingly strong i strike a old bleached specimen on mount ritter a dozen blow with my ice-ax without break it such skull would not fracture very readily by the wildest rock-diving but other bone could hardly be expect to hold together in such a performance and the mechanical difficulty in the way of control they movement after strike upon a irregular surface be in themselves sufficient to show this boulder-like method of progression to be impossible even in the absence of all other evidence on the subject moreover the ewe follow wherever the ram may lead although they horn be mere spike i have find many pair of the horn of the old ram considerably batter doubtless a result of fight i be particularly interested in the question after witness the performance of this san joaquin band upon the glaciated rock at the foot of the fall and as soon as i procured specimen and examine they foot all the mystery disappear the secret consider in connection with exceptionally strong muscle be simply this : the wide posterior portion of the bottom of the foot instead of wear down and become flat and hard like the foot of tame sheep and horse bulge out in a soft rubber-like pad or cushion which not only grip and hold well on smooth rock but fit into small cavity and down upon or against slight protuberance even the hardest portion of the edge of the hoof be comparatively soft and elastic furthermore the toe admit of a extraordinary amount of both lateral and vertical movement allow the foot to accommodate itself still more perfectly to the irregularity of rock surface while at the same time increase the gripping power at the base of sheep rock one of the winter stronghold of the shasta flock there live a stock-raiser who have have the advantage of observe the movement of wild sheep every winter and in the course of a conversation with he on the subject of they diving habit he point to the front of a lava headland about 150 foot high which be only eight or ten degree out of the perpendicular there say he i follow a band of they fellow to the back of that rock yonder and expect to capture they all for i think i have a dead thing on they i get behind they on a narrow bench that run along the face of the wall near the top and come to a end where they could not get away without fall and be kill but they jump off and land all right as if that be the regular thing with they what say i jump 150 foot perpendicular do you see they do it no he reply i do not see they go down for i be behind they but i see they go off over the brink and then i go below and find they track where they strike on the loose rubbish at the bottom they just _ sail right off _ and land on they foot right side up that be the kind of animal _ they _ be -- beat anything else that go on four leg -lrb- illustration : wild sheep jump over a precipice -rrb- on another occasion a flock that be pursue by hunter retreat to another portion of this same cliff where it be still higher and on be follow they be see jump down in perfect order one behind another by two man who happen to be chop where they have a fair view of they and could watch they progress from top to bottom of the precipice both ewe and ram make the frightful descent without evince any extraordinary concern hug the rock closely and control the velocity of they half fall half leap movement by strike at short interval and hold back with they cushion rubber foot upon small ledge and roughen incline until near the bottom when they sail off into the free air and alight on they foot but with they body so nearly in a vertical position that they appear to be diving it appear therefore that the method of this wild mountaineer become clearly comprehensible as soon as we make ourselves acquaint with the rock and the kind of foot and muscle bring to bear upon they the modoc and pah ute indian be or rather have be the most successful hunter of the wild sheep in the region that have come under my own observation i have see large number of head and horn in the cave of mount shasta and the modoc lava-bed where the indian have be feast in stormy weather also in the cañons of the sierra opposite owen 's valley while the heavy obsidian arrow-head find on some of the highest peak show that this warfare have long be go on in the more accessible range that stretch across the desert region of western utah and nevada considerable number of indian use to hunt in company like pack of wolf and be perfectly acquaint with the topography of they hunting-grounds and with the habit and instinct of the game they be pretty successful on the top of nearly every one of the nevada mountain that i have visit i find small nest-like inclosure build of stone in which as i afterward learn one or more indian would lie in wait while they companion scour the ridge below know that the alarmed sheep would surely run to the summit and when they could be make to approach with the wind they be shoot at short range -lrb- illustration : indian hunting wild sheep -rrb- still larger band of indian use to make extensive hunt upon some dominant mountain much frequent by the sheep such as mount grant on the wassuck range to the west of walker lake on some particular spot favorably situate with reference to the well-known trail of the sheep they build a high-walled corral with long guide wing diverge from the gateway and into this inclosure they sometimes succeed in drive the noble game great number of indian be of course require more indeed than they could usually muster count in squaws child and all they be compel therefore to build row of dummy hunter out of stone along the ridge-top which they wish to prevent the sheep from cross and without discrediting the sagacity of the game these dummy be find effective for with a few live indian move about excitedly among they they could hardly be distinguish at a little distance from man by any one not in the secret the whole ridge-top then seem to be alive with hunter the only animal that may fairly be regard as a companion or rival of the sheep be the so-called rocky mountain goat -lrb- _ aplocerus montana _ rich -rrb- which as its name indicate be more antelope than goat he too be a brave and hardy climber fearlessly cross the wildest summit and brave the severest storm but he be shaggy short-legged and much less dignified in demeanor than the sheep he jet-black horn be only about five or six inch in length and the long white hair with which he be cover obscure the expression of he limb i have never yet see a single specimen in the sierra though possibly a few flock may have live on mount shasta a comparatively short time ago the range of these two mountaineer be pretty distinct and they see but little of each other the sheep be restricted mostly to the dry inland mountain the goat or chamoix to the wet snowy glacier-laden mountain of the northwest coast of the continent in oregon washington british columbium and alaska probably more than 200 dwell on the icy volcanic cone of mount rainier and while i be explore the glacier of alaska i saw flock of these admirable mountaineer nearly every day and often follow they trail through the maze of bewildering crevasse in which they be excellent guide three species of deer be find in californium -- the black-tailed white-tailed and mule deer the first mention -lrb- _ cervus columbianus _ -rrb- be by far the most abundant and occasionally meet the sheep during the summer on high glacier meadow and along the edge of the timber line but be a forest animal seek shelter and rear its young in dense thicket it seldom visit the wild sheep in its higher home the antelope though not a mountaineer be occasionally meet in winter by the sheep while feed along the edge of the sage-plain and bare volcanic hill to the east of the sierra so also be the mule deer which be almost restricted in its range to this eastern region the white-tailed species belong to the coast range perhaps no wild animal in the world be without enemy but highlander as a class have fewer than lowlander the wily panther slip and crouch among long grass and bush pounce upon the antelope and deer but seldom cross the bald craggy threshold of the sheep neither can the bear be regard as enemy for though they seek to vary they every-day diet of nut and berry by a occasional meal of mutton they prefer to hunt tame and helpless flock eagle and coyote no doubt capture a unprotected lamb at time or some unfortunate beset in deep soft snow but these case be little more than accident so also a few perish in long-continued snow-storm though in all my mountaineering i have not find more than five or six that seem to have meet they fate in this way a little band of three be discover snow-bound in bloody canon a few year ago and be kill with a ax by mountaineer who chance to be cross the range in winter man be the most dangerous enemy of all but even from he we brave mountain-dweller have little to fear in the remote solitude of the high sierra the golden plain of the sacramento and san joaquin be lately throng with band of elk and antelope but be fertile and accessible they be require for human pasture so also be many of the feeding-grounds of the deer -- hill valley forest and meadow -- but it will be long before man will care to take the highland castle of the sheep and when we consider here how rapidly entire species of noble animal such as the elk moose and buffalo be be push to the very verge of extinction all lover of wildness will rejoice with I in the rocky security of _ ovi montana _ the bravest of all the sierra mountaineer -lrb- 1 -rrb- pacific railroad survey vol viii page 678 -lrb- 2 -rrb- audubon and bachman 's quadruped of north america chapter xv in the sierra foot-hill murphy 's camp be a curious old mining-town in calaveras county at a elevation of 2400 foot above the sea situate like a nest in the center of a rough gravelly region rich in gold granite slate lavas limestone iron ore quartz vein auriferous gravel remnant of dead fire-river and dead water-river be develop here side by side within a radius of a few mile and place invitingly open before the student like a book while the people and the region beyond the camp furnish mine of study of never-failing interest and variety when i discover this curious place i be trace the channel of the ancient pre-glacial river instructive section of which have be lay bare here and in the adjacent region by the miner river accord to the poet go on forever but those of the sierra be young as yet and have scarcely learn the way down to the sea while at least one generation of they have die and vanish together with most of the basin they drain all that remain of they to tell they history be a series of interrupted fragment of channel mostly choke with gravel and bury beneath broad thick sheet of lava these be know as the dead river of californium and the gravel deposit in they be comprehensively call the blue lead in some place the channel of the present river trend in the same direction or nearly so as those of the ancient river but in general there be little correspondence between they the entire drainage have be change or rather make new many of the hill of the ancient landscape have become hollow and the old hollow have become hill therefore the fragmentary channel with they load of auriferous gravel occur in all kind of unthought-of place trend obliquely or even at right angle to the present drainage across the top of lofty ridge or far beneath they present impressive illustration of the magnitude of the change accomplish since those ancient stream be annihilate the last volcanic period precede the regeneration of the sierra landscape seem to have come on over all the range almost simultaneously like the glacial period notwithstanding lava of different age occur together in many place indicate numerous period of activity in the sierra fire-fountain the most important of the ancient river-channel in this region be a section that extend from the south side of the town beneath coyote creek and the ridge beyond it to the cañon of the stanislaus but on account of its depth below the general surface of the present valley the rich gold gravel it be know to contain can not be easily work on a large scale they extraordinary richness may be infer from the fact that many claim be profitably work in they by sink shaft to a depth of 200 foot or more and hoist the dirt by a windlass should the dip of this ancient channel be such as to make the stanislaus cañon available as a dump then the grand deposit might be work by the hydraulic method and although a long expensive tunnel would be require the scheme might still prove profitable for there be million in it the importance of these ancient gravel as gold fountain be well know to miner even the superficial placer of the present stream have derive much of they gold from they accord to all account the murphy placer have be very rich -- terrific rich as they say here the hill have be cut and scalp and every gorge and gulch and valley tear to piece and disemboweled express a fierce and desperate energy hard to understand still any kind of effort-making be better than inaction and there be something sublime in see man work in dead earnest at anything pursue a object with glacier-like energy and persistence many a brave fellow have record a most eventful chapter of life on these calaveras rock but most of the pioneer miner be sleep now they wild day do while the few survivor linger languidly in the washed-out gulch or sleepy village like harry bee around the ruin of they hive we have no industry leave _ now _ they tell I and no man everybody and everything hereabouts have go to decay we be only bummer -- out of the game a thin scatterin ' of poor dilapidated cuss compare with what we use to be in the grand old gold-day we be giant then and you can look around here and see we track but although these linger pioneer be perhaps more exhaust than the mine and about as dead as the dead river they be yet a rare and interesting set of man with much gold mix with the rough rocky gravel of they character and they manifest a breeding and intelligence little look for in such surroundings as theirs as the heavy long-continued grind of the glacier bring out the feature of the sierra so the intense experience of the gold period have bring out the feature of these old miner form a richness and variety of character little known as yet the sketch of bret harte haye and miller have not exhaust this field by any mean it be interesting to note the extreme possible in one and the same character : harshness and gentleness manliness and childishness apathy and fierce endeavor man who twenty year ago would not cease they shoveling to save they life now play in the street with child they long micawber-like wait after the exhaustion of the placer have bring on a exaggerated form of dotage i hear a group of brawny pioneer in the street eagerly discuss the quantity of tail require for a boy 's kite and one graybeard undertake the sport of fly it volunteer the information that he be a boy always be a boy and d -- n a man who be not a boy inside however ancient outside mine moral politics the immortality of the soul etc be discuss beneath shade-tree and in saloon the time for each be govern apparently by the temperature contact with nature and the habit of observation acquire in gold-seeking have make they all to some extent collector and like wood-rat they have gather all kind of odd specimen into they cabin and now require I to examine they they be themselves the oddest and most interesting specimen one of they offer to show I around the old digging give I fair warning before set out that i might not like he because say he people say i be eccentric i notice everything and gather beetle and snake and anything that be queer and so some do not like I and call I eccentric i be always try to find out thing now there be a weed the indian eat it for green what do you call those long-bodied fly with big head dragon-fly i suggest well they jaw work sidewise instead of up and down and grasshopper ' jaw work the same way and therefore i think they be the same species i always notice everything like that and just because i do they say i be eccentric etc anxious that i should miss none of the wonder of they old gold-field the good people have much to say about the marvelous beauty of cave city cave and advise I to explore it this i be very glad to do and find a guide who know the way to the mouth of it i set out from murphy the next morning the most beautiful and extensive of the mountain cave of californium occur in a belt of metamorphic limestone that be pretty generally develop along the western flank of the sierra from the mccloud river on the north to the kaweah on the south a distance of over 400 mile at a elevation of from 2000 to 7000 foot above the sea besides this regular belt of cave the californium landscape be diversify by long impose rank of sea-caves rugged and variable in architecture carve in the coast headland and precipice by century of wave-dashing and innumerable lava-cave great and small originate in the unequal flow and harden of the lava sheet in which they occur fine illustration of which be present in the famous modoc lava bed and around the base of icy shasta in this comprehensive glance we may also notice the shallow wind-worn cave in stratified sandstone along the margin of the plain and the cave-like recess in the sierra slate and granite where bear and other mountaineer find shelter during the fall of sudden storm in general however the grand massive uplift of the sierra as far as it have be laid-bare to observation be about as solid and caveless as a boulder fresh beauty open one 's eye wherever it be really see but the very abundance and completeness of the common beauty that beset we step prevent its be absorb and appreciate it be a good thing therefore to make short excursion now and then to the bottom of the sea among dulse and coral or up among the cloud on mountain-top or in balloon or even to creep like worm into dark hole and cavern underground not only to learn something of what be go on in those out-of-the-way place but to see better what the sun see on we return to common every-day beauty we way from murphy 's to the cave lay across a series of picturesque moory ridge in the chaparral region between the brown foot-hill and the forest a flowery stretch of roll hill-wave break here and there into a kind of rocky foam on the higher summit and sink into delightful bosky hollow embower with vine the day be a fine specimen of californium summer pure sunshine unshaded most of the time by a single cloud as the sun rise higher the heated air begin to flow in tremulous wave from every southern slope the sea-breeze that usually come up the foot-hill at this season with cool on its wing be scarcely perceptible the bird be assemble beneath leafy shade or make short languid flight in search of food all save the majestic buzzard with broad wing outspread he sail the warm air unwearily from ridge to ridge seem to enjoy the fervid sunshine like a butterfly squirrel too whose spicy ardor no heat or cold may abate be nutting among the pine and the innumerable host of the insect kingdom be throb and waver unwearied as sunbeam this brushy berry-bearing region use to be a deer and bear pasture but since the disturbance of the gold period these fine animal have almost wholly disappear here also once roam the mastodon and elephant whose bone be find entomb in the river gravel and beneath thick fold of lava toward noon as we be ride slowly over bank and bra basking in the unfeverish sun-heat we witness the upheaval of a new mountain-range a sierra of cloud abound in landscape as truly sublime and beautiful -- if only we have a mind to think so and eye to see -- as the more ancient rocky sierra beneath it with its forest and waterfall remind we that as there be a lower world of cave so also there be a upper world of cloud huge bossy cumulus develop with astonishing rapidity from mere bud swell with visible motion into colossal mountain and pile higher higher in long massive range peak beyond peak dome over dome with many a picturesque valley and shadowy cave between while the dark fir and pine of the upper bench of the sierra be project against they pearl boss with exquisite clearness of outline these cloud mountain vanish in the azure as quickly as they be develop leave no detritus but they be not a whit less real or interesting on this account the more enduring hill over which we ride be vanish as surely as they only not so fast a difference which be great or small accord to the standpoint from which it be contemplate at the bottom of every dell we find little homestead embosome in wild brush and vine wherever the recession of the hill leave patch of arable ground these secluded flat be settle mostly by italian and german who plant a few vegetable and grape-vine at odd time while they main business be mine and prospect in spite of all the natural beauty of these dell cabin they can hardly be call home they be only a better kind of camp gladly abandon whenever the hoped-for gold harvest have be gather there be a air of profound unrest and melancholy about the best of they they beauty be thrust upon they by exuberant nature apart from which they be only a few log and board rudely joint and without either ceiling or floor a rough fireplace with corresponding cooking utensil a shelf-bed and stool the ground about they be strew with battered prospecting-pan pick sluice-box and quartz specimen from many a ledge indicate the trend of they owner ' hard life the ride from murphy 's to the cave be scarcely two hour long but we linger among quartz-ledge and bank of dead river gravel until long after noon at length emerge from a narrow-throated gorge a small house come in sight set in a thicket of fig-tree at the base of a limestone hill that say my guide point to the house be cave city and the cave be in that gray hill arrive at the one house of this one-house city we be boisterously welcome by three drunken man who have come to town to hold a spree the mistress of the house try to keep order and in reply to we inquiry tell we that the cave guide be then in the cave with a party of lady and must we wait until he return we ask no that be unnecessary we might take candle and go into the cave alone provide we shout from time to time so as to be find by the guide and be careful not to fall over the rock or into the dark pool accordingly take a trail from the house we be lead around the base of the hill to the mouth of the cave a small inconspicuous archway mossy around the edge and shape like the door of a water-ouzel 's nest with no appreciable hint or advertisement of the grandeur of the many crystal chamber within light we candle which seem to have no illuminating power in the thick darkness we grope we way onward as best we could along narrow lane and alley from chamber to chamber around rustic column and heap of fall rock stop to rest now and then in particularly beautiful place -- fairy alcove furnish with admirable variety of shelf and table and round bossy stool cover with sparkling crystal some of the corridor be muddy and in plod along these we seem to be in the street of some prairie village in spring-time then we would come to handsome marble stairway conduct right and leave into upper chamber range above one another three or four story high floor ceiling and wall lavishly decorate with innumerable crystalline form after thus wander exploringly and alone for a mile or so fairly enchant a murmur of voice and a gleam of light betray the approach of the guide and he party from whom when they come up we receive a most hearty and natural stare as we stand half conceal in a side recess among stalagmite i venture to ask the drip crouch company how they have enjoy they saunter anxious to learn how the strange sunless scenery of the underworld have impress they ah it be nice it be splendid they all reply and echo the bridal chamber back here be just glorious this morning we come down from the calaveras big tree grove and the tree be nothing to it after make this curious comparison they hasten sunward the guide promise to join we shortly on the bank of a deep pool where we be to wait for he this be a charming little lakelet of unknown depth never yet stir by a breeze and its eternal calm excite the imagination even more profoundly than the silvery lake of the glacier rim with meadow and snow and reflect sublime mountain we guide a jolly rollicking italian lead we into the heart of the hill up and down right and left from chamber to chamber more and more magnificent all a-glitter like a glacier cave with icicle-like stalactite and stalagmite combine in form of indescribable beauty we be show one large room that be occasionally use as a dancing-hall another that be use as a chapel with natural pulpit and cross and pew sermon in every stone where a priest have say mass mass-saying be not so generally develop in connection with natural wonder as dance one of the first conceit excite by the giant sequoia be to cut one of they down and dance on its stump we have also see dancing in the spray of niagara dancing in the famous bower cave above coulterville and nowhere have i see so much dancing as in yosemite a dance on the inaccessible south dome would likely follow the making of a easy way to the top of it it be delightful to witness here the infinite deliberation of nature and the simplicity of she method in the production of such mighty result such perfect repose combine with restless enthusiastic energy though cold and bloodless as a landscape of polar ice building be go on in the dark with incessant activity the archway and ceiling be everywhere hang with down-growing crystal like inverted grove of leafless sapling some of they large other delicately attenuate each tip with a single drop of water like the terminal bud of a pine-tree the only appreciable sound be the drip and tinkle of water fail into pool or faintly plash on the crystal floor in some place the crystal decoration be arrange in graceful flow fold deeply plicate like stiff silken drapery in other straight line of the ordinary stalactite form be combine with reference to size and tone in a regularly graduate system like the string of a harp with musical tone correspond thereto and on these stone harp we play by strike the crystal string with a stick the delicious liquid tone they give forth seem perfectly divine as they sweetly whisper and waver through the majestic hall and die away in faintest cadence -- the music of fairy-land here we linger and revel rejoice to find so much music in stony silence so much splendor in darkness so many mansion in the depths of the mountain building ever in process of construction yet ever finish develop from perfection to perfection profusion without overabundance every particle visible or invisible in glorious motion march to the music of the sphere in a region regard as the abode of eternal stillness and death the outer chamber of mountain cave be frequently select as home by wild beast in the sierra however they seem to prefer home and hiding-place in chaparral and beneath shelve precipice as i have never see they track in any of the cave this be the more remarkable because notwithstanding the darkness and ooze water there be nothing uncomfortably cellar-like or sepulchral about they when we emerge into the bright landscape of the sun everything look brighter and we feel we faith in nature 's beauty strengthen and see more clearly that beauty be universal and immortal above beneath on land and sea mountain and plain in heat and cold light and darkness chapter xvi the bee-pasture when californium be wild it be one sweet bee-garden throughout its entire length north and south and all the way across from the snowy sierra to the ocean wherever a bee might fly within the bound of this virgin wilderness -- through the redwood forest along the bank of the river along the bluff and headland front the sea over valley and plain park and grove and deep leafy glen or far up the piny slope of the mountain -- throughout every belt and section of climate up to the timber line bee-flower bloom in lavish abundance here they grow more or less apart in special sheet and patch of no great size there in broad flow fold hundred of mile in length -- zone of polleny forest zone of flowery chaparral stream-tangle of rubus and wild rise sheet of golden composite bed of violet bed of mint bed of bryanthus and clover and so on certain species bloom somewhere all the year round but of late year plow and sheep have make sad havoc in these glorious pasture destroy ten of thousand of the flowery acre like a fire and banish many species of the best honey-plant to rocky cliff and fence-corner while on the other hand cultivation thus far have give no adequate compensation at least in kind only acre of alfalfa for mile of the richest wild pasture ornamental rose and honeysuckle around cottage door for cascade of wild rose in the dell and small square orchard and orange-grove for broad mountain-belt of chaparral the great central plain of californium during the month of march April and may be one smooth continuous bed of honey-bloom so marvelously rich that in walk from one end of it to the other a distance of more than 400 mile you foot would press about a hundred flower at every step mint gilias nemophila castilleia and innumerable composita be so crowd together that have ninety-nine per cent of they be take away the plain would still have seem to any but californian extravagantly flowery the radiant honeyful corolla touch and overlap and rise above one another glow in the living light like a sunset sky -- one sheet of purple and gold with the bright sacramento pour through the midst of it from the north the san joaquin from the south and they many tributary sweep in at right angle from the mountain divide the plain into section fringe with tree along the river there be a strip of bottom-land countersunk beneath the general level and wider toward the foot-hill where magnificent oak from three to eight foot in diameter cast grateful mass of shade over the open prairie-like level and close along the water 's edge there be a fine jungle of tropical luxuriance compose of wild-rose and bramble bush and a great variety of climb vine wreathe and interlace the branch and trunk of willow and alder and swing across from summit to summit in heavy festoon here the wild bee revel in fresh bloom long after the flower of the drier plain have wither and go to seed and in midsummer when the blackberry be ripe the indian come from the mountain to feast -- man woman and baby in long noisy train often join by the farmer of the neighborhood who gather this wild fruit with commendable appreciation of its superior flavor while they home orchard be full of ripe peach apricot nectarine and fig and they vineyard be laden with grape but though these luxuriant shaggy river-bed be thus distinct from the smooth treeless plain they make no heavy divide line in general view the whole appear as one continuous sheet of bloom bound only by the mountain when i first saw this central garden the most extensive and regular of all the bee-pasture of the state it seem all one sheet of plant gold hazy and vanish in the distance distinct as a new map along the foot-hill at my foot descend the eastern slope of the coast range through bed of gilia and lupine and around many a breezy hillock and bush-crowned headland i at length wade out into the midst of it all the ground be cover not with grass and green leaf but with radiant corolla about ankle-deep next the foot-hill knee-deep or more five or six mile out here be bahium madium madarium burrielium chrysopsis corethrogyne grindelium etc grow in close social congregation of various shades of yellow blending finely with the purple of clarkium orthocarpus and oenothera whose delicate petal be drink the vital sunbeam without give back any sparkling glow -lrb- illustration : a bee-ranch in lower californium -rrb- because so long a period of extreme drought succeed the rainy season most of the vegetation be compose of annual which spring up simultaneously and bloom together at about the same height above the ground the general surface be but slightly ruffle by the taller phacelia pentstemon and group of _ salvia carduacea _ the king of the mint saunter in any direction hundred of these happy sun-plant brush against my foot at every step and close over they as if i be wade in liquid gold the air be sweet with fragrance the lark sing they bless song rise on the wing as i advance then sink out of sight in the polleny sod while myriad of wild bee stir the lower air with they monotonous hum -- monotonous yet forever fresh and sweet as every-day sunshine hare and spermophile show themselves in considerable number in shallow place and small band of antelope be almost constantly in sight gaze curiously from some slight elevation and then bound swiftly away with unrivaled grace of motion yet i could discover no crushed flower to mark they track nor indeed any destructive action of any wild foot or tooth whatever the great yellow day circle by uncounted while i drift toward the north observe the countless form of life throng about I lie down almost anywhere on the approach of night and what glorious botanical bed i have oftentimes on awake i would find several new species lean over I and look I full in the face so that my study would begin before rise about the first of may i turn eastward cross the san joaquin river between the mouth of the tuolumne and merce and by the time i have reach the sierra foot-hill most of the vegetation have go to seed and become as dry as hay all the season of the great plain be warm or temperate and bee-flower be never wholly want but the grand springtime -- the annual resurrection -- be govern by the rain which usually set in about the middle of November or the beginning of December then the seed that for six month have lie on the ground dry and fresh as if they have be gather into barn at once unfold they treasured life the general brown and purple of the ground and the dead vegetation of the preceding year give place to the green of moss and liverwort and myriad of young leaf then one species after another come into flower gradually overspread the green with yellow and purple which last until may the rainy season be by no mean a gloomy soggy period of constant cloudiness and rain perhaps nowhere else in north america perhaps in the world be the month of December January February and march so full of bland plant-building sunshine refer to my note of the winter and spring of 1868-69 every day of which i spend out of door on that section of the plain lie between the tuolumne and merce river i find that the first rain of the season fall on December 18th January have only six rainy day -- that be day on which rain fall February three march five April three and may three complete the so-called rainy season which be about a average one the ordinary rain-storm of this region be seldom very cold or violent the wind which in settle weather come from the northwest veer round into the opposite direction the sky fill gradually and evenly with one general cloud from which the rain fall steadily often for day in succession at a temperature of about 45 ° or 50 ° more than seventy-five per cent of all the rain of this season come from the northwest down the coast over southeastern alaska british columbium washington and oregon though the local wind of these circular storm blow from the southeast one magnificent local storm from the northwest fall on march 21 a massive round-browed cloud come swell and thunder over the flowery plain in most impose majesty its bossy front burning white and purple in the full blaze of the sun while warm rain pour from its ample fountain like a cataract beat down flower and bee and flood the dry watercourse as suddenly as those of nevada be flood by the so-called cloudburst but in less than half a hour not a trace of the heavy mountain-like cloud-structure be leave in the sky and the bee be on the wing as if nothing more gratefully refresh could have be send they by the end of January four species of plant be in flower and five or six moss have already adjust they hood and be in the prime of life but the flower be not sufficiently numerous as yet to affect greatly the general green of the young leaf violet make they appearance in the first week of February and toward the end of this month the warmer portion of the plain be already golden with myriad of the flower of rayed composite this be the full springtime the sunshine grow warmer and richer new plant bloom every day the air become more tuneful with hum wing and sweeter with the fragrance of the opening flower ant and ground squirrel be get ready for they summer work rub they benumbed limb and sun themselves on the husk-pile before they door and spider be busy mend they old web or weave new one in march the vegetation be more than double in depth and color claytonium calandrinium a large white gilium and two nemophila be in bloom together with a host of yellow composite tall enough now to bend in the wind and show waver ripple of shade in April plant-life as a whole reach its greatest height and the plain over all its varied surface be mantle with a close furred plush of purple and golden corolla by the end of this month most of the species have ripen they seed but undecayed still seem to be in bloom from the numerous corolla-like involucre and whorl of chaffy scale of the composite in may the bee find in flower only a few deep-set liliaceous plant and eriogonum June July August and September be the season of rest and sleep -- a winter of dry heat -- follow in October by a second outburst of bloom at the very driest time of the year then after the shrunken mass of leaf and stalk of the dead vegetation crinkle and turn to dust beneath the foot as if it have be baked in a oven _ hemizonium virga _ a slender unobtrusive little plant from six inch to three foot high suddenly make its appearance in patch mile in extent like a resurrection of the bloom of April i have count upward of 3000 flower five eighth of a inch in diameter on a single plant both its leaf and stem be so slender as to be nearly invisible at a distance of a few yard amid so showy a multitude of flower the ray and disk flower be both yellow the stamen purple and the texture of the ray be rich and velvety like the petal of garden pansy the prevailing wind turn all the head round to the southeast so that in face northwestward we have the flower look we in the face in my estimation this little plant the last bear of the brilliant host of composita that glorify the plain be the most interesting of all it remain in flower until November unite with two or three species of wiry eriogonum which continue the floral chain around December to the spring flower of January thus although the main bloom and honey season be only about three month long the floral circle however thin around some of the hot rainless month be never completely break how long the various species of wild bee have live in this honey-garden nobody know probably ever since the main body of the present flora gain possession of the land toward the close of the glacial period the first brown honey-bee bring to californium be say to have arrive in san francisco in march 1853 a bee-keeper by the name of shelton purchase a lot consist of twelve swarm from some one at aspinwall who have bring they from new york when land at san francisco all the hive contain live bee but they finally dwindle to one hive which be take to san josé the little immigrant flourish and multiply in the bountiful pasture of the santa clara valley send off three swarm the first season the owner be kill shortly afterward and in settle up he estate two of the swarm be sell at auction for $ 105 and $ 110 respectively other importation be make from time to time by way of the isthmus and though great pain be take to insure success about one half usually die on the way four swarm be bring safely across the plain in 1859 the hive be place in the rear end of a wagon which be stop in the afternoon to allow the bee to fly and feed in the floweriest place that be within reach until dark when the hive be close in 1855 two year after the time of the first arrival from new york a single swarm be bring over from san josé and let fly in the great central plain bee-culture however have never gain much attention here notwithstanding the extraordinary abundance of honey-bloom and the high price of honey during the early year a few hive be find here and there among settler who chance to have learn something about the business before come to the state but sheep cattle grain and fruit raising be the chief industry as they require less skill and care while the profit thus far have be greater in 1856 honey sell here at from one and a half to two dollar per pound twelve year later the price have fall to twelve and a half cent in 1868 i sit down to dinner with a band of ravenous sheep-shearer at a ranch on the san joaquin where fifteen or twenty hive be keep and we host advise we not to spare the large pan of honey he have place on the table as it be the cheapest article he have to offer in all my walk however i have never come upon a regular bee-ranch in the central valley like those so common and so skilfully manage in the southern county of the state the few pound of honey and wax produce be consume at home and be scarcely take into account among the coarser product of the farm the swarm that escape from they careless owner have a weary perplexing time of it in seek suitable home most of they make they way to the foot-hill of the mountain or to the tree that line the bank of the river where some hollow log or trunk may be find a friend of mine while out hunting on the san joaquin come upon a old coon trap hide among some tall grass near the edge of the river upon which he sit down to rest shortly afterward he attention be attract to a crowd of angry bee that be fly excitedly about he head when he discover that he be sit upon they hive which be find to contain more than 200 pound of honey out in the broad swampy delta of the sacramento and san joaquin river the little wanderer have be know to build they comb in a bunch of rush or stiff wiry grass only slightly protect from the weather and in danger every spring of be carry away by flood they have the advantage however of a vast extent of fresh pasture accessible only to themselves the present condition of the grand central garden be very different from that we have sketch about twenty year ago when the gold placer have be pretty thoroughly exhaust the attention of fortune-seeker -- not home-seeker -- be in great part turn away from the mine to the fertile plain and many begin experiment in a kind of restless wild agriculture a load of lumber would be haul to some spot on the free wilderness where water could be easily find and a rude box-cabin build then a gang-plow be procure and a dozen mustang pony worth ten or fifteen dollar apiece and with these hundred of acre be stir as easily as if the land have be under cultivation for year tough perennial root be almost wholly absent thus a ranch be establish and from these bare wooden hut as center of desolation the wild flora vanish in ever-widening circle but the arch destroyer be the shepherd with they flock of hoofed locust sweep over the ground like a fire and trample down every rod that escape the plow as completely as if the whole plain be a cottage garden-plot without a fence but notwithstanding these destroyer a thousand swarm of bee may be pasture here for every one now gather honey the greater portion be still cover every season with a repress growth of bee-flower for most of the species be annual and many of they be not relish by sheep or cattle while the rapidity of they growth enable they to develop and mature they seed before any foot have time to crush they the ground be therefore keep sweet and the race be perpetuate though only as a suggestive shadow of the magnificence of its wildness the time will undoubtedly come when the entire area of this noble valley will be till like a garden when the fertilize water of the mountain now flow to the sea will be distribute to every acre give rise to prosperous town wealth art etc then i suppose there will be few leave even among botanist to deplore the vanish primeval flora in the mean time the pure waste go on -- the wanton destruction of the innocent -- be a sad sight to see and the sun may well be pity in be compel to look on the bee-pasture of the coast range last longer and be more varied than those of the great plain on account of difference of soil and climate moisture and shade etc some of the mountain be upward of 4000 foot in height and small stream spring oozy bog etc occur in great abundance and variety in the wooded region while open park flood with sunshine and hill-girt valley lie at different elevation each with its own peculiar climate and exposure possess the required condition for the development of species and family of plant widely vary next the plain there be first a series of smooth hill plant with a rich and showy vegetation that differ but little from that of the plain itself -- as if the edge of the plain have be lift and bent into flow fold with all its flower in place only tone down a little as to they luxuriance and a few new species introduce such as the hill lupine mint and gilia the color show finely when thus hold to view on the slope patch of red purple blue yellow and white blend around the edge the whole appear at a little distance like a map color in section above this lie the park and chaparral region with oak mostly evergreen plant wide apart and bloom shrub from three to ten foot high manzanita and ceanothus of several species mix with rhamnus cerci pickeringium cherry amelanchier and adenostoma in shaggy interlocking thicket and many species of hosackium clover monardellum castilleium etc in the opening the main range send out spur somewhat parallel to they axis inclose level valley many of they quite extensive and contain a great profusion of sun-loving bee-flower in they wild state but these be in great part already lose to the bee by cultivation nearer the coast be the giant forest of the redwood extend from near the oregon line to santa cruz beneath the cool deep shade of these majestic tree the ground be occupy by fern chiefly woodwardium and aspidium with only a few flowering plant -- oxali trientali erythronium fritillarium smilax and other shade-lover but all along the redwood belt there be sunny opening on hill-slope look to the south where the giant tree stand back and give the ground to the small sunflower and the bee around the lofty redwood wall of these little bee-acre there be usually a fringe of chestnut oak laurel and madroño the last of which be a surpassingly beautiful tree and a great favorite with the bee the trunk of the largest specimen be seven or eight foot thick and about fifty foot high the bark red and chocolate color the leaf plain large and glossy like those of _ magnolia grandiflora _ while the flower be yellowish-white and urn-shaped in well-proportioned panicle from five to ten inch long when in full bloom a single tree seem to be visit at time by a whole hive of bee at once and the deep hum of such a multitude make the listener guess that more than the ordinary work of honey-winning must be go on how perfectly enchanting and care-obliterating be these withdraw garden of the wood -- long vista open to the sea -- sunshine sifting and pour upon the flowery ground in a tremulous shift mosaic as the light-way in the leafy wall open and close with the sway breeze -- shine leaf and flower bird and bee mingle together in springtime harmony and soothing fragrance exhale from a thousand thousand fountain in these balmy dissolve day when the deep heart-beat of nature be feel thrilling rock and tree and everything alike common business and friend be happily forget and even the natural honey-work of bee and the care of bird for they young and mother for they child seem slightly out of place to the northward in humboldt and the adjacent county whole hillside be cover with rhododendron make a glorious melody of bee-bloom in the spring and the western azalea hardly less flowery grow in massy thicket three to eight foot high around the edge of grove and wood as far south as san lui obispo usually accompany by manzanita while the valley with they vary moisture and shade yield a rich variety of the smaller honey-flower such as mentha lycopus micromerium audibertium trichostema and other mint with vaccinium wild strawberry geranium calai and goldenrod and in the cool glen along the stream-bank where the shade of tree be not too deep spiraea dog-wood heteromele and calycanthus and many species of rubus form interlace tangle some portion of which continue in bloom for month though the coast region be the first to be invade and settle by white man it have suffer less from a bee point of view than either of the other main division chiefly no doubt because of the unevenness of the surface and because it be own and protect instead of lie expose to the flock of the wander sheepman these remark apply more particularly to the north half of the coast farther south there be less moisture less forest shade and the honey flora be less vary the sierra region be the largest of the three main division of the bee-land of the state and the most regularly vary in its subdivision owe to they gradual rise from the level of the central plain to the alpine summit the foot-hill region be about as dry and sunful from the end of may until the setting in of the winter rain as the plain there be no shady forest no damp glen at all like those lie at the same elevation in the coast mountain the social composita of the plain with a few add species form the bulk of the herbaceous portion of the vegetation up to a height of 1500 foot or more shaded lightly here and there with oak and sabine pine and interrupt by patch of ceanothus and buckeye above this and just below the forest region there be a dark heath-like belt of chaparral compose almost exclusively of _ adenostoma fascicula _ a bush belong to the rose family from five to eight foot high with small round leaf in fascicle and bear a multitude of small white flower in panicle on the end of the upper branch where it occur at all it usually cover all the ground with a close impenetrable growth scarcely break for mile up through the forest region to a height of about 9000 foot above sea-level there be ragged patch of manzanita and five or six species of ceanothus call deer-brush or california lilac these be the most important of all the honey-bearing bush of the sierra _ chamaebatium foliolosa _ a little shrub about a foot high with flower like the strawberry make handsome carpet beneath the pine and seem to be a favorite with the bee while pine themselves furnish unlimited quantity of pollen and honey-dew the product of a single tree ripen its pollen at the right time of year would be sufficient for the want of a whole hive along the stream there be a rich growth of lily larkspur pediculari castilleia and clover the alpine region contain the flowery glacier meadow and countless small garden in all sort of place full of potentillum of several species spraguea ivesium epilobium and goldenrod with bed of bryanthus and the charming cassiope cover with sweet bell even the top of the mountain be bless with flower -- dwarf phlox polemonium ribe hulsea etc i have see wild bee and butterfly feed at a height of 13000 foot above the sea many however that go up these dangerous height never come down again some undoubtedly perish in storm and i have find thousand lie dead or benumb on the surface of the glacier to which they have perhaps be attract by the white glare take they for bed of bloom from swarm that escape they owner in the lowland the honey-bee be now generally distribute throughout the whole length of the sierra up to a elevation of 8000 foot above sea-level at this height they flourish without care though the snow every winter be deep even higher than this several bee-tree have be cut which contain over 200 pound of honey the destructive action of sheep have not be so general on the mountain pasture as on those of the great plain but in many place it have be more complete owing to the more friable character of the soil and its sloping position the slant digging and down-raking action of hoof on the steeper slope of moraine have uproot and bury many of the tender plant from year to year without allow they time to mature they seed the shrub too be badly bite especially the various species of ceanothus fortunately neither sheep nor cattle care to feed on the manzanita spiraea or adenostoma and these fine honey-bush be too stiff and tall or grow in place too rough and inaccessible to be trodden under foot also the cañon wall and gorge which form so considerable a part of the area of the range while inaccessible to domestic sheep be well fringed with honey-shrub and contain thousand of lovely bee-garden lie hide in narrow side-cañons and recess fence with avalanche talus and on the top of flat project headland where only bee would think to look for they but on the other hand a great portion of the woody plant that escape the foot and tooth of the sheep be destroy by the shepherd by means of run fire which be set everywhere during the dry autumn for the purpose of burn off the old fall trunk and underbrush with a view to improve the pasture and make more open way for the flock these destructive sheep-fire sweep through nearly the entire forest belt of the range from one extremity to the other consume not only the underbrush but the young tree and seedling on which the permanence of the forest depend thus set in motion a long train of evil which will certainly reach far beyond bee and beekeeper -lrb- illustration : wild bee garden -rrb- the plow have not yet invade the forest region to any appreciable extent neither have it accomplish much in the foot-hill thousand of bee-ranch might be establish along the margin of the plain and up to a height of 4000 foot wherever water could be

the head water of the yuba feather and pitt river the extensive tableland of lava be sparsely plant with pine through which the sunshine reach the ground with little interruption here flourish a scattered tufted growth of golden applopappus linosyri bahium wyetheium arnica artemisia and similar plant with manzanita cherry plum and thorn in ragged patch on the cooler hill-slope at the extremity of the great central plain the sierra and coast range curve around and lock together in a labyrinth of mountain and valley throughout which they flora be mingled make at the north with its temperate climate and copious rainfall a perfect paradise for bee though strange to say scarcely a single regular bee-ranch have yet be establish in it of all the upper flower field of the sierra shasta be the most honeyful and may yet surpass in fame the celebrated honey hill of hyblum and hearthy hymettus regard this noble mountain from a bee point of view encircle by its many climate and sweeping aloft from the torrid plain into the frosty azure we find the first 5000 foot from the summit generally snow-clad and therefore about as honeyless as the sea the base of this arctic region be girdle by a belt of crumble lava measure about 1000 foot in vertical breadth and be mostly free from snow in summer beautiful lichen enliven the face of the cliff with they bright color and in some of the warmer nook there be a few tuft of alpine daisy wall-flower and pentstemon but notwithstanding these bloom freely in the late summer the zone as a whole be almost as honeyless as the icy summit and its lower edge may be take as the honey-line immediately below this come the forest zone cover with a rich growth of conifer chiefly silver fir rich in pollen and honey-dew and diversify with countless garden opening many of they less than a hundred yard across next in orderly succession come the great bee zone its area far surpass that of the icy summit and both the other zone combine for it go sweeping majestically around the entire mountain with a breadth of six or seven mile and a circumference of nearly a hundred mile shasta as we have already see be a fire-mountain create by a succession of eruption of ash and molten lava which flow over the lip of its several crater grow outward and upward like the trunk of a knotty exogenous tree then follow a strange contrast the glacial winter come on load the cooling mountain with ice which flow slowly outward in every direction radiate from the summit in the form of one vast conical glacier -- a down-crawling mantle of ice upon a fountain of smolder fire crush and grind for century its brown flinty lava with incessant activity and thus degrading and remodel the entire mountain when at length the glacial period begin to draw near its close the ice-mantle be gradually melt off around the bottom and in recede and break into its present fragmentary condition irregular ring and heap of moraine matter be store upon its flank the glacial erosion of most of the shasta lava produce detritus compose of rough sub-angular boulder of moderate size and of porous gravel and sand which yield freely to the transport power of run water magnificent flood from the ample fountain of ice and snow work with sublime energy upon this prepared glacial detritus sort it out and carry down immense quantity from the higher slope and reform it in smooth delta-like bed around the base and it be these flood-bed join together that now form the main honey-zone of the old volcano thus by force seemingly antagonistic and destructive have mother nature accomplish she beneficent design -- now a flood of fire now a flood of ice now a flood of water and at length a outburst of organic life a milky way of snowy petal and wing girdle the rugged mountain like a cloud as if the vivify sunbeam beat against its side have break into a foam of plant-bloom and bee as sea-wave break and bloom on a rock shore in this flowery wilderness the bee rove and revel rejoice in the bounty of the sun clamber eagerly through bramble and hucklebloom ring the myriad bell of the manzanita now hum aloft among polleny willow and fir now down on the ashy ground among gilia and buttercup and anon plunging deep into snowy bank of cherry and buckthorn they consider the lily and roll into they and like lily they toil not for they be impel by sun-power as water-wheel by water-power and when the one have plenty of high-pressure water the other plenty of sunshine they hum and quiver alike saunter in the shasta bee-land in the sun-day of summer one may readily infer the time of day from the comparative energy of bee-movement alone -- drowsy and moderate in the cool of the morning increase in energy with the ascend sun and at high noon thrilling and quiver in wild ecstasy then gradually decline again to the stillness of night in my excursion among the glacier i occasionally meet bee that be hungry like mountaineer who venture too far and remain too long above the bread-line then they droop and wither like autumn leave the shasta bee be perhaps better fed than any other in the sierra they field-work be one perpetual feast but however exhilarating the sunshine or bountiful the supply of flower they be always dainty feeder humming-moth and hummingbird seldom set foot upon a flower but poise on the wing in front of it and reach forward as if they be suck through straw but bee though as dainty as they hug they favorite flower with profound cordiality and push they blunt polleny face against they like baby on they mother 's bosom and fondly too with eternal love do mother nature clasp she small bee-baby and suckle they multitude at once on she warm shasta breast besides the common honey-bee there be many other species here -- fine mossy burly fellow who be nourish on the mountain thousand of sunny season before the advent of the domestic species among these be the bumblebee mason-bee carpenter-bee and leaf-cutter butterfly too and moth of every size and pattern some broad-winged like bat flap slowly and sailing in easy curve other like small fly violet shake about loosely in short crooked flight close to the flower feast luxuriously night and day great number of deer also delight to dwell in the brushy portion of the bee-pasture bear too roam the sweet wilderness they blunt shaggy form harmonize well with the tree and tangled bush and with the bee also notwithstanding the disparity in size they be fond of all good thing and enjoy they to the utmost with but little troublesome discrimination -- flower and leave as well as berry and the bee themselves as well as they honey though the californium bear have as yet have but little experience with honeybee they often succeed in reach they bountiful store and it seem doubtful whether bee themselves enjoy honey with so great a relish by means of they powerful tooth and claw they can gnaw and tear open almost any hive conveniently accessible most honey-bee however in search of a home be wise enough to make choice of a hollow in a living tree a considerable distance above the ground when such place be to be have then they be pretty secure for though the smaller black and brown bear climb well they be unable to break into strong hive while compel to exert themselves to keep from fall and at the same time to endure the sting of the fight bee

in some exceptional case a much greater yield in san diego county at the beginning of the season of 1878 there be about 24000 hive and the shipment from the one port of san diego for the same year

occasionally occur in the southern and middle portion of the state if the rainfall amount only to three or four inch instead of from twelve to twenty as in ordinary season then sheep and cattle die in thousand and so do these small winged cattle unless they be carefully feed or remove to other pasture the year 1877 will long be remember as exceptionally rainless and distressing scarcely a flower

san jacinto and san bernardino range be almost untouched as yet save by the wild bee some idea of they resource and of the advantage and disadvantage they offer to bee-keeper may be form from a excursion that i make into the san gabriel range about the beginning of August of the dry year this range contain most of the characteristic feature of the other range just mention overlook the lo angele vineyard and orange grove from the north and be more rigidly inaccessible in the ordinary meaning of the word than any other that i ever attempt to penetrate the slope be exceptionally steep and insecure to the foot and they be cover with thorny bush from five to ten foot high with the exception of little spot not visible in general view the entire surface be cover with they mass in close hedge growth sweeping gracefully down into every gorge and hollow and swell over every ridge and summit in shaggy ungovernable exuberance offer more honey to the acre for half the year than the most crowded clover-field but when behold from the open san gabriel valley beat with dry sunshine all that be see of the range seem to wear a forbid aspect from base to summit all seem gray barren silent its glorious chaparral appear like dry moss creep over its dull wrinkled ridge and hollow set out from pasadena i reach the foot of the range about sundown and be weary and heated with my walk across the shadeless valley conclude to camp for the night after rest a few moment i begin to look about among the flood-boulder of eaton creek for a camp-ground when i come upon a strange dark-looking man who have be chop cord-wood he seem surprise at see I so i sit down with he on the live-oak log he have be cut and make haste to give a reason for my appearance in he solitude explain that i be anxious to find out something about the mountain and mean to make my way up eaton creek next morning then he kindly invite I to camp with he and lead I to he little cabin situate at the foot of the mountain where a small spring ooze out of a bank overgrown with wild-rose bush after supper when the daylight be go he explain that he be out of candle so we sit in the dark while he give I a sketch of he life in a mixture of spanish and english he be bear in mexico he father irish he mother spanish he have be a miner rancher prospector hunter etc rambling always and wear he life away in mere waste but now he be go to settle down he past life he say be of no account but the future be promising he be go to make money and marry a spanish woman people mine here for water as for gold he have be run a tunnel into a spur of the mountain back of he cabin my prospect be good he say and if i chance to strike a good strong flow i 'll soon be worth $ 5000 or $ 10000 for that flat out there refer to a small irregular patch of bouldery detritus two or three acre in size that have be deposit by eaton creek during some flood season -- that flat be large enough for a nice orange-grove and the bank behind the cabin will do for a vineyard and after water my own tree and vine i will have some water leave to sell to my neighbor below I down the valley and then he continue i can keep bee and make money that way too for the mountain above here be just full of honey in the summer-time and one of my neighbor down here say that he will let I have a whole lot of hive on share to start with you see i have a good thing i be all right now all this prospective affluence in the sunken boulder-choked flood-bed of a mountain-stream leave the bee out of the count most fortune-seeker would as soon think of settle on the summit of mount shasta next morning wish my hopeful entertainer good luck i set out on my shaggy excursion -lrb- illustration : a bee-pasture on the moraine desert spanish bayonet -rrb- about half a hour 's walk above the cabin i come to the fall famous throughout the valley settlement as the finest yet discover in the san gabriel mountain it be a charming little thing with a low sweet voice singing like a bird as it pour from a notch in a short ledge some thirty-five or forty foot into a round mirror-pool the face of the cliff back of it and on both side be smoothly cover and emboss with moss against which the white water shine out in showy relief like a silver instrument in a velvet case hither come the san gabriel lad and lassie to gather fern and dabble away they hot holiday in the cool water glad to escape from they commonplace palm-garden and orange-grove the delicate maidenhair grow on fissured rock within reach of the spray while broad-leaved maple and sycamore cast soft mellow shade over a rich profusion of bee-flower grow among boulder in front of the pool -- the fall the flower the bee the ferny rock and leafy shade form a charming little poem of wildness the last of a series extend down the flowery slope of mount san antonio through the rugged foam-beaten boss of the main eaton canon from the base of the fall i follow the ridge that form the western rim of the eaton basin to the summit of one of the principal peak which be about 5000 foot above sea-level then turn eastward i cross the middle of the basin force a way over its many subordinate ridge and across its eastern rim have to contend almost everywhere with the floweriest and most impenetrable growth of honey-bush i have ever encounter since first my mountaineering begin most of the shasta chaparral be leafy nearly to the ground here the main stem be naked for three or four foot and interspike with dead twig form a stiff _ chevaux de frise _ through which even the bear make they way with difficulty i be compel to creep for mile on all fours and in follow the bear-trail often find tuft of hair on the bush where they have force themselves through for 100 foot or so above the fall the ascent be make possible only by tough cushion of club-moss that cling to the rock above this the ridge weather away to a thin knife-blade for a few hundred yard and thence to the summit of the range it carry a bristly mane of chaparral here and there small opening occur on rocky place command fine view across the cultivate valley to the ocean these i find by the track be favorite outlook and resting-place for the wild animal -- bear wolf fox wildcat etc -- which abound here and would have to be take into account in the establishment of bee-ranch in the deepest thicket i find wood-rat village -- group of hut four to six foot high build of stick and leave in rough taper pile like musk-rat cabin i notice a good many bee too most of they wild the tame honey-bee seem languid and wing-weary as if they have come all the way up from the flowerless valley after reach the summit i have time to make only a hasty survey of the basin now glowing in the sunset gold before hasten down into one of the tributary cañons in search of water emerge from a particularly tedious breadth of chaparral i find myself free and erect in a beautiful park-like grove of mountain live oak where the ground be plant with aspidium and brier-rose while the glossy foliage make a close canopy overhead leave the gray divide trunk bare to show the beauty of they interlace arch the bottom of the cañon be dry where i first reach it but a bunch of scarlet mimulus indicate water at no great distance and i soon discover about a bucketful in a hollow of the rock this however be full of dead bee wasp beetle and leave well steeped and simmer and would therefore require boiling and filter through fresh charcoal before it could be make available trace the dry channel about a mile farther down to its junction with a larger tributary cañon i at length discover a lot of boulder pool clear as crystal brimming full and link together by glisten streamlet just strong enough to sing audibly flower in full bloom adorn they margin lily ten foot high larkspur columbine and luxuriant fern lean and overarching in lavish abundance while a noble old live oak spread its rugged arm over all here i camped make my bed on smooth cobblestone -lrb- illustration : a bee-keeper 's cabin -- burrielium -lrb- above -rrb- -- madium -lrb- below -rrb- -rrb- next day in the channel of a tributary that head on mount san antonio i pass about fifteen or twenty garden like the one in which i sleep -- lily in every one of they in the full pomp of bloom my third camp be make near the middle of the general

cascade the main stream pass through a series of open sunny level the largest of which be about a acre in size where the wild bee and they companion be feast on a showy growth of zauschnerium paint cup and monardellum and gray squirrel be busy harvest the bur of the dougla spruce the only conifer i meet in the basin the eastern slope of the basin be in every way similar to those we have describe

forest or the rocky outcrop of hilltop and ridge behind the san bernardino range lie the wild sage-brush country bound on the east by the colorado river and extend in a general northerly direction to nevada and along the eastern base of the sierra beyond mono lake the greater portion of this immense region include owen 's valley death valley and the sink of the mohave the area of which be nearly
