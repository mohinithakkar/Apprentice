approve allopathic remedy see that he still sleep profoundly though appear by occasional movement of he arm to entertain certain pass dream of single combat the quick womanly wit of mr smythe finally hit upon the homoeopathic expedient of softly shake he familiar antique flask at he right ear scarcely have the soft liquid sound therefrom result be address for a minute to the auricular orifice when a singularly please smile wreathe the countenance of the ritualistic organist he eyelid fly up like the spring-cover of two valuable hunting-case watch and he suddenly arise to a sit position upon the rug and begin feel around for the bed-clothes there cry mr smythe greatly affect by he pathetic expression of countenance you be all right now sir how worn-out you must have be to sleep so do you always go to sleep with such alarming suddenness ask mr dibble when i have to go anywhere i make it a rule to go at once : -- similarly when go to sleep be the answer excuse I however for keep you wait mr dibble we have have quite a rain sir he hair collar and shoulder be very wet from the water which have be pour upon he during he slumber mr bumstead in he present newly-awake frame of mind believe that a hard shower have take place and thereupon turn moody we have have quite a rain sir since i see you last he repeat gloomily and i be freshly remind of my irreparable loss such a open

right-thinking man i can no longer suspect you of have kill edwin drood suspect I scream the aged lawyer almost leap into the air calm yourself observe mr bumstead quietly the while he eat a sedative clove i say that i can _ not _ longer suspect you i can not think that a person of you age would wantonly destroy a human life merely to obtain a umbrella absolutely purple in the face mr dibble snatch he hat from a chair just as the ritualistic organist be about to sit upon it and be on the point of hurry wrathfully from the room when the entrance of gospeler simpson arrest he note he agitation mr bumstead instantly resolve to clear he from suspicion in the new-comer 's mind also reverend sir he say to the gospeler quickly in this sad affair we must be just as well as vigilant i believe mr dibble to be as innocent as ourselves whatever may be he failing so far as liquor be concerned i wholly acquit he of all guilty knowledge of my nephew and umbrella too apoplectic with suffocating emotion to speak mr dibble foam slightly at the month and tear out a lock or two of he hair and i believe that my unhappy pupil mr pendragon be as guiltless respond the puzzle gospeler i do not deny that he have a quarrel with mr drood in the earlier part of they acquaintance but as you mr bumstead yourself admit they meeting at the christmas-eve dinner be amicable as i firmly believe they last mysterious parting to have be the organist raise he fine head from the shadow of he right hand in which it have rest for a moment and say gravely : i can not deny gentleman that i have have my terrible distrust of you all even now while in my deepest heart i release mr dibble and mr pendragon from all suspicion i can not entirely rid my mind of the impression that you mr simpson in a hour when from undue indulgence in stimulant you be not wholly yourself may have be tempt by the superior fineness of the alpaca to slay a young man inexpressibly dear to we all great heaven mr bumstead pant the gospeler livid with horror i never -- -- not a word sir interrupt the ritualistic organist -- not a word reverend sir or it may be use against you at you trial pause not to see whether the equally overwhelmed old lawyer follow he the horribly astounded gospeler burst precipitately from the house in wild dismay and be presently hurry past the pauper burial-ground whether he

hurry at any rate when a shine object lie upon the ground beside the broken fence cause he to stop suddenly and pick up the glittering thing it be a oroide watch marked ed and a few step further on a

pendragon convey he beloved pupil at once before judge sweeney and make affidavit of find the jewelry the jeweler who have wind edwin drood 's watch for he on the day of the dinner promptly identify the timepiece by the innumerable scratch around the keyhole mr bumstead though at first ecstatic with the idea that the seal-ring be a ferule from a umbrella at length allow himself to be persuade into a gloomy recognition of it as a part of he nephew and montgomery be detain in custody for further revelation news of the event circulate the public mind of bumsteadville lose no time in deplore the incorrigible depravity of southern character and recollect several horror of human slavery it be now clearly remember that there have once be rumor of terrible cruelty by a pendragon family to a aged color man of great piety who because he incessantly sing hymn in the cotton-field be send to a field farther from the pendragon mansion and ultimately die citizen remind each other that when during the rebellion a certain pendragon of the celebrated southern confederacy meet a former religious chattel of he confront he with a bayonet in the loyal rank and immediately afterwards feel a cold tickle sensation under one of he rib he draw a pistol upon the member of the injured race who subsequently die in ohio of fever and ague what wonder be it then that this young pendragon with a indian club and a swell head should secretly slaughter the nephew and appropriate the umbrella of one of the most loyal and devoted ritualist that ever send a substitute to battle in the mighty metropolis too the great daily -- those ponderous engine of varied and inaccurate intelligence -- publish detailed and mistaken report of the whole affair and have subtle editorial theory as to the nature of the crime the _ sun _ after give a cut of a old-fashioned parlor-grate as a diagram of mr bumstead 's house and a portrait of mr john russell young as a correct photograph of the alleged murderer by rockwood say : -- the retention of mr fish as secretary of state by the present venal administration and the official countenance otherwise corruptly give to friend of spanish tyranny who

therefrom that at least three different young southerner have kill three different young northerner in three different place on christmas-eve judge sweeney have a rush of blood to the brain and discharge montgomery pendragon as a person of undistinguishable identity but when set at large the helpless youth could not turn a corner without meet some bald-headed reporter who raise the cry of

claim the whole adirondack region by right of discovery have fence it entirely in and demand entrance money of all visitor this be bad to be sure but there be no help for it and mr p buy he ticket and pass in the adirondack scenery be peculiar in the first place there be no pavement or gravel walk this be a grievous evil and should be remedy by mr murray as soon as possible the majority of the path be lay out in the follow manner the scenery however would be very fine if the bug be transparent the multitude of insectivorous carnivora which arise to greet mr p effectually prevent he from see anything more than a yard distant but if this have be all mr p would not have utter a word of complaint it be not all by any means these hungry creature these black-fly midge mosquito yellow

panther blister and swollen by poisonous insect nearly starve tired to death and present the most pitiable appearance in the world mr p reach the encampment of mr murray proprietor and exhibitor of the adirondack know that there be quite a large company in the camp mr p be almost ashamed to show himself in such a doleful plight but he soon find that there be no need for any scruple on that account as they be all as wretched look as himself mr murray welcome he cordially and after build a smudge around he to keep off the fly he give mr p some boston brown-bread and a glass of pure water from a rill this with a sip from mr p 's little flask revive he considerably and after a night 's rest on the lee side of a tree where the rain do not wet he nearly so much as if he have be on the other side mr p feel himself equal to the task of enjoy the adirondack that morning mr murray conduct a melancholy party of disconsolate pleasure-seeker to a neighbor stream where he instruct they to fish for trout he tell they they must revel in the delight of the scene and should tremble with the wild rapture of draw from the rush water the bound trout mr p try very hard to do this he put he

these spring differ from the european spring in that they be not discover by the roman the latin conqueror never roam so far and it be perhaps a good thing for they that they do not sulphur water could not have agree with roman any more than it agree with yankee who take whiskey with it i be ask if i would like to analyze the water -lrb- as everything here be do by analysis under the eye of the resident physician -rrb- _ my _ analysis be do entirely under the nose i raise a glass of the enchanted fluid to my lip : but my nose say very positively do not do it and i do not i tell my conductor i have analyze it and he seem not a little astonished at the rapidity and simplicity of the method he ask I if i would be kind enough to write out a statement of the result after the manner of dr haye prof roger and other who have examine these water and testify that they would cure everything but hydrophobia i tell he i would and retire to my room write as follow : sulphur water contain mineral property of a sulphuric character owe to the fact that the water run over bed of sulphur nobody have ever see these bed but they be suppose to constitute the cooler portion of those dominion correspond to the christian location of purgatory sinner preliminary to be plunge into the fiery furnace be lay out on these bed and wrap in damp sheet by chambermaid regularly attach to the

surface of the earth -- it be to give patient and other _ miserable _ who drink they a foretaste of future horror pass from this branch of the subject to the analysis proper i find that fifty thousand
