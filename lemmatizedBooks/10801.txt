-rrb- i can not meditate too often too deeply or too devotionally on the personeity of god and he personality in the word -lrb- greek : gío to monogeneus -rrb- and thence on the individuity of the responsible creature -- that it be a perfection which not indeed in my intellect but yet in my habit of feeling i have too much confound with that ` complexus ' of visual image cycle or custom of sensation and fellow-travelling circumstance -lrb- as the ship to the mariner -rrb- which make up we empirical self : thence to bring myself to apprehend livelily the exceed mercifulness and love of the act of the son of god in descend to seek after the prodigal child and to house with they in the sty likewise by the relation of my own understanding to the light of reason and -lrb- the most important of all the truth that have be vouchsafe to I -rrb- to the will which be the reason -- will in the form of reason -- i can form a sufficient gleam of the possibility of the subsistence of the human soul in jesus to the eternal word and how it might perfect itself so as to merit glorification and abide union with the divinity and how this give a humanity to we lord 's righteousness no less than to he suffering doubtless as god as the absolute alterity of the absolute he could not suffer but that he could not lay aside the absolute and by union with the creaturely become affectible and a second but spiritual adam and so as afterwards to be partaker of the absolute in the absolute even as the absolute have partake of passion -lrb- -lrb- greek : tou páschein -rrb- -rrb- and infirmity in it that be the finite and fall creature -- this can be assert only by one who -lrb- unconsciously perhaps -rrb- have accustom himself to think of god as a thing -- have a necessity of constitution that will or rather tend and incline to this or that because it be this or that not as be that which be that which it will to be such a necessity be truly compulsion nor be it in the least altered in its nature by be assume to be eternal in virtue of a endless remotion or retrusion of the constituent cause which be manifest by the understanding become a foresee despair of a cause Sunday 11th February 1826 one argument strike I in favor of the tenet of apostolic succession in the ordination of bishop and presbyter as teach by the church of rome and by the larger part of the earlier divine of the church of england which i have not see in any of the book on this subject namely that in strict analogy with other part of christian history the miracle itself contain a check upon the inconvenient consequence necessarily attach to all miracle as miracle narrow the possible claim to any rights not proveable at the bar of universal reason and experience every man among the sectary however ignorant may justify himself in scatter stone and fire squib by a alleged unction of the spirit the miracle become perpetual still begin never end now on the church doctrine the original miracle provide for the future recurrence to the ordinary and calculable law of the human understanding and moral sense instead of leave every man a judge of he own gift and of he right to act publicly on that judgment the initiative alone be supernatural but all beginning be necessarily miraculous that be have either no antecedent or one -lrb- greek : hetérou genous -rrb- which therefore be not its but merely a antecedent -- or a incausative alien co-incident in time as if for instance jack 's shout be follow by a flash of lightning which should strike and precipitate the ball on st paul 's cathedral this would be a miracle as long as no causative ` nexus ' be conceivable between the antecedent the noise of the shout and the consequent the atmospheric discharge the epistle dedicatory but this will be you glory and inexpugnable if you cleave in truth and practice to god 's holy service worship and religion : that religion and faith of the lord jesus christ which be pure and undefiled before god even the father which be to visit the fatherless and widow in they affliction and to keep yourselve unspotted from the world jame i 27 few mistranslation -lrb- unless indeed the word use by the translator of st jame mean differently from its present meaning -rrb- have lead astray more than this rendering of -lrb- greek : thraeskeía -rrb- -lrb- outward or ceremonial worship ` cultus ' divine service -rrb- by the english ` religion ' st jame sublimely say : what the ` ceremony ' of the law be to morality ` that ' morality itself be to the faith in christ that be its outward symbol not the substance itself chap i p 1 2 that the bible be the word of god -lrb- say luther -rrb- the same i prove as followeth : all thing that have be and now be in the world also how it now goeth and standeth in the world the same be write altogether particularly at the beginning in the first book of mose concern the creation and even as god make and create it even so it be even so it be and even so doth it stand to this present day and although king alexander the great the kingdom of egypt the empire of babel the persian grecian and roman monarch the emperor julius and augustus most fiercely do rage and swell against this book utterly to suppress and destroy the same yet notwithstanding they could prevail nothing they be all go and vanish but this book from time to time have remain and will remain unremoved in full and ample manner as it be write at the first a proof worthy of the manly mind of luther and compare with which the grotian pretended demonstration from grotius himself to paley be mischievous undermining of the faith pleading fitter for a old bailey thief ' counsellor than for a christian divine the true evidence of the bible be the bible -- of christianity the living fact of christianity itself as the manifest ` archeus ' or predominant of the life of the planet ib p 4 the art of the school divine -lrb- say luther -rrb- with they speculation in the holy scripture be merely vain and human cogitation spin out of they own natural wit and understand they talk much of the union of the will and understanding but all be mere fantasy and fondness the right and true speculation -lrb- say luther -rrb- be this believe in christ do what thou oughtest to do in thy vocation & c this be the only practice in divinity also ` mystica theologia dionysii ' be a mere fable and a lie like to plato 's fable ` omnia sunt non en et omnia sunt ens ' all be something and all be nothing and so he leaveth all hang in frivolous and idle sort still however ` du theure mann gotte mein verehrter luther ' reason will understand be word to which real entity correspond and we may in a sound and good sense say that reason be the ray the project disk or image from the sun of righteousness a echo from the eternal word -- ` the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world ' and that when the will placeth itself in a right line with the reason there ariseth the spirit through which the will of god floweth into and actuate the will of man so that it willeth the thing of god and the understanding be enliven and thenceforward useth the material supply to it by the sens symbolically that be with a insight into the true substance thereof ib p 9 the pope usurpeth and taketh to himself the power to expound and to construe the scripture accord to he pleasure what he saith must stand and be speak as from heaven therefore let we love and preciously value the divine word that thereby we may be able to resist the devil and he swarm as often as i use in prayer the 16th verse of the 71st psalm -lrb- in we prayer-book version -rrb- my thought especially revert to the subject of the right appreciation of the scripture and in what sense the bible may be call the word of god and how and under what condition the unity of the spirit be translucent through the letter which read as the letter merely be the word of this and that pious but fallible and imperfect man alas for the superstition where the word themselves be make to be the spirit o might i live but to utter all my meditation on this most concern point ib p 12 bullinger say once in my hearing -lrb- say luther -rrb- that he be earnest against the anabaptist as contemner of god 's word and also against those which attribute too much to the literal word for -lrb- say he -rrb- such do sin against god and he almighty power as the jew do in name the ark god but -lrb- say he -rrb- whoso holdeth a mean between both the same be teach what be the right use of the word and sacrament whereupon -lrb- say luther -rrb- i answer he and say bullinger you err you know neither yourself nor what you hold i mark well you trick and fallacy : zuinglius and oecolampadius likewise proceed too far in the ungodly meaning : but when brentius withstand they they then lessen they opinion allege they do not reject the literal word but only condemn certain gross abuse by this you error you cut in sunder and separate the word and the spirit & c in my present state of mind and with what light i now enjoy -- -lrb- may god increase it and cleanse it from the dark mist into the ` luman siccum ' of sincere knowledge -rrb- -- i can not persuade myself that this vehemence of we dear man of god against bullinger zuinglius and oecolampadius on this point could have have other origin than he misconception of what they intend but luther speak often -lrb- i like he and love he all the better therefor -rrb- in he mood and accord to the mood be not that a different mood in which he call st jame 's epistle a ` jack-straw poppet ' and even in this work select one verse as the best in the whole letter -- evidently mean the only verse of any great value besides he accustom himself to use the term ` the word ' in a very wide sense when the narrower would have cramp he when he be on the point of reject the apocalypse then ` the word ' mean the spirit of the scripture collectively ib p 21 i -lrb- say luther -rrb- do not hold that child be without faith when they be baptize for inasmuch as they be bring to christ by he command and that the church prayeth for they therefore without all doubt faith be give unto they although with we natural sense and reason we neither see nor understand it nay but dear honor luther be this fair if christ or scripture have say in one place ` believe and thou mayest be baptize ' and in another place ` baptize infant ' then we might perhaps be allow to reconcile the two seemingly jarring text by such word as faith be give to they although & c but when no such text as the latter be to be find nor any one instance as a substitute then you conclusion seem arbitrary ib p 25 this argument -lrb- say luther -rrb- concludeth so much as nothing for although they have be angel from heaven yet that troubleth I nothing at all we be now deal about god 's word and with the truth of the gospel that be a matter of far greater weight to have the same keep and preserve pure and clear therefore we -lrb- say luther -rrb- neither care nor trouble ourselves for and about the greatness of saint peter and the other apostle or how many and great miracle they work : the thing which we strive for be that the truth of the holy gospel may stand for god regardeth not man 's reputation nor person oh that the dear man luther have but tell we here what he mean by the term gospel that st paul have see even st luke 's be but a conjecture ground on a conjectural interpretation of a single text doubly equivocal namely that the luke mention be the same with the evangelist luke and that the ` evangelium ' signify a book the latter of itself improbable derive its probability from the undoubtedly very strong probability of the former if then not any book much less the four book now call the four gospel be mean by paul but the contents of those book as far as they be veracious and whatever else be know on equal authority at that time though not contain in those book if in short the whole sum of christ 's act and discourse be what paul mean by the gospel then the argument be circuitous and return to the first point -- what ` be ' the gospel shall we believe you and not rather the companion of christ the eye and ear witness of he doings and saying now i should require strong inducement to make I believe that st paul have be guilty of such palpably false logic and i therefore feel myself compel to infer that by the gospel paul intend the eternal truth know ideally from the beginning and historically realize in the manifestation of the word in christ jesus and that he use the ideal immutable truth as the canon and criterion of the oral tradition for example a greek mathematician standing in the same relation of time and country to euclid as that in which st paul stand to jesus christ might have exclaim in the same spirit : what do you talk to I of this that and the other intimate acquaintance of euclid 's my object be to convey the sublime system of geometry which he realize and by that must i decide i say st paul have be teach by the spirit of christ a teaching susceptible of no addition and for which no personal anecdote however reverendly attest can be a substitute but dearest luther be a translator he could not must not see this ib p 32 that god 's word and the christian church be preserve against the rage of the world the papist have lose the cause with god 's word they be not able to resist or withstand we \* \* \* ` the king of the earth stand up and the ruler take counsel together & c ' god will deal well enough with these angry gentleman and will give they but small thanks for they labor in go about to suppress he word and servant he have sit in counsel above these five thousand five hundred year have rule and make law good sir be not so choleric go further from the wall lest you knock you pate against it ` kiss the son lest he be angry & c ' that be take hold on christ or the devil will take hold on you & c the second psalm -lrb- say luther -rrb- be a proud psalm against those fellow it begin mild and simply but it endeth stately and rattle \* \* \* i have now anger the pope about he image of idolatry o how the sow raiseth she bristle \* \* the lord saith : ` ego suscitabo vo in novissimo die ' : and then he will call and say : ho martin luther philip melancthon justus jona john calvin & c arise come up \* \* \* well on -lrb- say luther -rrb- let we be of good comfort a delicious paragraph how we fine preacher would turn up they tom-tit beak and flirt with they tail at it but this be the way in which the man of life the man of power set the dry bone in motion chap ii p 37 this be the thanks that god have for he grace for create for redeeming sanctify nourishing and for preserve we : such a seed fruit and godly child be the world o woe be to it too true ib p 54 that out of the best come the worst out of the patriarch and holy father come the jew that crucify christ out of the apostle come juda the traitor out of the city alexandrium -lrb- where a fair illustrious and famous school be and from whence proceed many upright and godly learn man -rrb- come arius and origene poor origen surely luther be put to it for a instance and have never read the work of that very best of the old father and eminently upright and godly learn man ib the sparrow be the least bird and yet they be very hurtful and have the best nourishment ` ergo digni sunt omnus persecutione ' poor little philip sparrow luther do not know that they more than earn they good wages by destroy grub and other small vermin ib p 61 he that without danger will know god and will speculate of he let he look first into the manger that be let he begin below and let he first learn to know the son of the virgin mary bear at bethlehem that lie and suck in he mother 's bosom or let one look upon he hang on the cross \*\* but take good heed in any case of high climb cogitation to clamber up to heaven without this ladder namely the lord christ in he humanity to know god as god -lrb- -lrb- greek : tòn zaena -rrb- the living god -rrb- we must assume he personality : otherwise what be it but a ether a gravitation -- but to assume he personality we must begin with he humanity and this be impossible but in history for man be a historical -- not a eternal be ` ergo ' christianity be of necessity historical and not philosophical only ib p 62 ` what be that to thee ' say christ to peter ` follow thou I ' -- I follow I and not thy question or cogitation lord keep we look to and humbly follow thee chap vi p 103 the philosopher and learn heathen -lrb- say luther -rrb- have describe god that he be as a circle the point whereof in the midst be every where but the circumference which on the outside goeth round about be no where : herewith they would shew that god be all and yet be nothing what a huge difference the absence of a blank space which be nothing or next to nothing may make the word here should have be print god be all and yet be no thing for what do ` thing ' mean itself that be the ` ing ' or inclosure that which be contain within a outline or circumscribe so likewise to ` think ' be to inclose to determine confine and define to think a infinite be a contradiction in term equal to a boundless bind so in german ` ding denken ' in latin ` re reor ' chap vii p 113 helvidius allege the mother of christ be not a virgin so that accord to he wicked allegation christ be bear in original sin o what a tangle of impure whimsy have this notion of a immaculate conception a ebionite tradition as i think bring into the christian church i have sometimes suspect that the apostle john have a particular view to this point in the first half of the first chapter of he gospel not that i suppose we present matthew then in existence or that if john have see the gospel accord to luke the ` christopædia ' have be already prefix to it but the rumor might have be whisper about and as the purport be to give a psilanthropic explanation and solution of the phrase son of god and son of man -- so saint john meet it by the true solution namely the eternal filiation of the word ib p 120 of christ 's ride into jerusalem but i hold -lrb- say luther -rrb- that christ himself do not mention that prophecy of zechariah but rather that the apostle and evangelist do use it for a witness worth remember for the purpose of apply it to the text in which we lord be represent in the first -lrb- or matthew 's -rrb- gospel and by that alone as cite daniel by name it be this text that so sorely but i think very unnecessarily perplexed and gravelled bentley who be too profound a scholar and too acute a critic to admit the genuineness of the whole of that book ib the prophet -lrb- say luther -rrb- do set speak and preach of the second come of christ in manner as we now do i regret that mr irving should have blended such extravagancy and presumptuous prophesying with he support and vindication of the millennium and the return of jesus in he corporeal individuality -- because these have furnish divine in general both churchman and dissent with a pretext for treat he doctrine with silent contempt have he follow the example of he own ben ezra and argue temperately and learnedly the controversy must have force the momentous question on we clergy : -- be christian bind to believe whatever a apostle believe -- and in the same way and sense i think saint paul himself live to doubt the solidity of he own literal interpretation of we lord 's word the whole passage in which we lord describe he come be so evidently and so intentionally express in the diction and image of the prophet that nothing but the carnal literality common to the jew at that time and most strongly mark in the disciple who be among the least educate of they countryman could have prevent the symbolic import and character of the word from be see the whole gospel and the epistle of john be a virtual confutation of this reign error -- and no less be the apocalypse whether write by or under the authority of the evangelist the unhappy effect which st paul 's -lrb- may i not say -rrb- incautious language respect christ 's return produce on the thessalonian lead he to reflect on the subject and he instantly in the second epistle to they qualify the doctrine and never afterwards resume it but on the contrary in the first epistle to the corinthian c 15 substitute the doctrine of immortality in a celestial state and a spiritual body on the nature of we lord 's future epiphany or phenomenal person i be not ashamed to acknowledge that my view approach very nearly to those of emanuel swedenborg ib p 121 doctor jacob schenck never preacheth out of he book but i do -lrb- say luther -rrb- though not of necessity but i do it for example 's sake to other as many note ` memorandum ' cue of connection and transition as the preacher may find expedient or serviceable to he well and good but to read in a manuscript book as we clergy now do be not to preach at all preach out of a book if you must but do not read in it or even from it a read sermon of twenty minute will seem longer to the hearer than a free discourse of a hour ib my simple opinion be -lrb- say luther -rrb- and i do believe that christ for we descend into hell to the end he might break and destroy the same as in psalm xvi and act ii be shewed and prove could luther have be ignorant that this clause be not insert into the apostle 's creed till the sixth century after christ i believe the original intention of the clause be no more than ` vere mortuus est ' -- in contradiction to the hypothesis of a trance or state of suspend animation chap vii p 122 when christ -lrb- say luther -rrb- forbiddeth to spread abroad or to make known he work of wonder there he speaketh as be send from the father and doth well and right therein in forbid they to the end that thereby he might leave we a example not to seek we own praise and honor in that wherein we do good but we ought to seek only and alone the honor of god not satisfactory doubtless the command be in connection with the silence enjoin respect he messiahship chap viii p 147 doctor hennage say to luther sir where you say that the holy spirit be the certainty in the word towards god that be that a man be certain of he own mind and opinion then it must need follow that all sect have the holy ghost for they will need be most certain of they doctrine and religion luther might have answer positive you mean not certain chap ix p 160 but who have power to forgive or to detain sin answer the apostle and all church servant and -lrb- in case of necessity -rrb- every christian christ giveth they not power over money wealth kingdom & c but over sin and the conscience of human creature over the power of the devil and the throat of hell few passage in the sacred writings have occasion so much mischief abject slavishness bloated pride tyrannous usurpation bloody persecution with king even against they will the drudge false soul-destroying quiet of conscience as this text ` john ' xx 23 misinterpret it be really a tremendous proof of what the misunderstanding of a few word can do that even luther partook of the delusion this paragraph give proof but that a delusion it be that the commission give to the seventy whom christ send out to proclaim and offer the kingdom of god and afterwards to the apostle refer either to the power of make rule and ordinance in the church or otherwise to the gift of miraculous healing which we lord at that time confer on they and that ` per figuram causce pro effecto ' ` sin ' here mean disease seem to I more than probable at all event the text surely do not mean that the salvation of a repentant and believe christian depend upon the will of a priest in absolution ib p 161 and again they be able to absolve and make a human creature free and loose from all he sin if in case he repenteth and believeth in christ and on the contrary they be able to detain all he sina if he doth not repent and believeth not in christ in like manner if he sincerely repent and believe he sin be forgive whether the minister absolve he or not now if m + 5 = 5 and 5-m = 5 m = o if he be impenitent and unbelieving he sin be detain no doubt whether the minister do or do not detain they ib p 163 adam be create of god in such sort righteous as that he become of a righteous a unrighteous person as paul himself argueth and withall instructeth himself where he saith the law be not give for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient this follow from the very definition or idea of righteousness-it be itself the law -- -lrb- greek : pas gàr díkais autonomo -rrb- ib the scripture saith god maketh the ungodly righteous there he calleth we all one with another despairing and wicked wretch for what will a ungodly creature not dare to accomplish if he may but have occasion place and opportunity that be with a lust within correspondent to the temptation from without a christian 's conscience methink ought to be a ` janus bifron ' -- a gospel-face retrospective and smile through penitent tear on the sin of the past and a moses-face look forward in frown and menace frightening the harlot will into a holy abortion of sin conceive but not yet bear perchance not yet quicken the fanatic antinomian reverse this for the past he require all the horror of remorse and despair till the moment of assurance thenceforward he may do what he like for he can not sin ib p 165 all natural inclination -lrb- say luther -rrb- be either against or without god therefore none be good we see that no man be so honest as to marry a wife only thereby to have child to love and to bring they up in the fear of god this be a very weak instance if a man have be command to marry by god be so form as that no sensual delight accompany and refuse to do so unless this appetite and gratification be add -- then indeed chap x p 168 9 ah lord god -lrb- say luther -rrb- why should we any way boast of we free-will as if it be able to do anything in divine and spiritual matter be they never so small \* \* \* i confess that mankind have a free-will but it be to milk kine to build house & c and no further : for so long as a man sitteth well and in safety and sticketh in no want so long he thinketh he have a free-will which be able to do something but when want and need appeareth that there be neither to eat nor to drink neither money nor provision where be then the free will it be utterly lose and can not stand when it cometh to the pinch but faith only standeth fast and sure and seeketh christ luther confound free-will with efficient power which neither do nor can exist save where the finite will be one with the absolute will that luther be practically on the right side in this famous controversy and that he be drive at the truth i see abundant reason to believe but it be no less evident that he see it in a mist or rather as a mist with dissolve outline and as he see the thing as a mist so he ever and anon mistake a mist for the thing but erasmus and saavedra be equally indistinct and shallow and unsubstantial to boot in fact till the appearance of kant 's ` kritique ' of the pure and of the practical reason the problem have never be accurately or adequately state much less solve 26 June 1826 ib p 174 loving friend -lrb- say luther -rrb- we doctrine that free-will be dead and nothing at all be ground powerfully in holy scripture it be of vital importance for a theological student to understand clearly the utter diversity of the lutheran which be likewise the calvinistic denial of free-will in the unregenerate and the doctrine of the modern necessitarian and -lrb- ` proh pudor ' -rrb- of the later calvinist which deny the proper existence of will altogether the former be sound scriptural compatible with the divine justice a new yea a mighty motive to morality and finally the dictate of common sense ground on common experience the latter the very contrary of all these chap xii p 187 this be now -lrb- say luther -rrb- the first instruction concern the law namely that the same must be use to hinder the ungodly from they wicked and mischievous intention for the devil who be a abbot and a prince of this world driveth and allureth people to work all manner of sin and wickedness for which cause god have ordain magistrate elder schoolmaster law and statute to the end if they can not do more yet at least that they may bind the claw of the devil and to hinder he from rage and swell so powerfully -lrb- in those which be he -rrb- accord to he will and pleasure and -lrb- say luther -rrb- although thou hadst not commit this or that sin yet nevertheless thou art a ungodly creature & c but what be do can not he undo he that have steal let he henceforward steal no more secondly we use the law spiritually which be do in this manner that it maketh the transgression greater as saint paul saith that be that it may reveal and discover to people they sin blindness misery and ungodly doings wherein they be conceive and bear namely that they be ignorant of god and be he enemy and therefore have justly deserve death hell god 's judgment he everlasting wrath and indignation saint paul -lrb- say luther -rrb- expoundeth such spiritual office and work of the law with many word rom vii nothing can be more sound or more philosophic than the contents of these two paragraph they afford a sufficient answer to the pretence of the romanist and arminian that by the law st paul mean only the ceremonial law ib p 189 and if mose have not cashier and put himself out of he office and have not take it away with these word -lrb- where he saith ` the lord thy god will raise up unto thee another prophet out of thy brethren he shall thou hear ' -lrb- deut xviii -rrb- -rrb- who then at any time would or could have believe the gospel and forsake mose if i could be persuade that this passage -lrb- deut xviii 15-19 -rrb- primarily refer to christ and that christ not joshua and he successor be the prophet here promise i must either become a unitarian psilanthrophist and join priestley and belsham -- or abandon to the jew they own messiah as yet to come and cling to the religion of john and paul without further reference to mose than to lycurgus solon and numa all of whom in they different sphere no less prepared the way for the come of the lord ` the desire of the nation ' ib p 190 it be therefore most evident -lrb- say luther -rrb- that the law can but only help we to know we sin and to make we afraid of death now sin and death be such thing as belong to the world and which be therein both in paul and luther -lrb- name which i can never separate -rrb- -- not indeed peculiar to these for it be the same in the psalm ezekiel and throughout the scripture but which i feel most in paul and luther -- there be one fearful blank the wisdom or necessity of which i do not doubt yet can not help grope and strain after like one that stare in the dark and this be death the law make we afraid of death what be death -- a unhappy life who do not feel the insufficiency of this answer what analogy do immortal suffering bear to the only death which be know to we since i write the above god have i humbly trust give I a clearer light as to the true nature of the ` death ' so often mention in the scripture ib it be -lrb- say luther -rrb- a very hard matter : yea a impossible thing for thy human strength whosoever thou art -lrb- without god 's assistance -rrb- that -lrb- at such a time when mose setteth upon thee with he law and fearfully affrighteth thee accuseth and condemneth thee threateneth thee with god 's wrath and death -rrb- thou shouldest as then be of such a mind namely as if no law nor sin have ever be at any time : -- i say it be in a manner a thing impossible that a human creature should carry himself in such a sort when he be and feeleth himself assault with trial and temptation and when the conscience have to do with god as then to think no otherwise than that from everlasting nothing have be but only and alone christ altogether grace and deliverance yea verily amen and aman for this short heroic paragraph contain the sum and substance the heighth and the depth of all true philosophy most assuredly right difficult it be for we while we be yet in the narrow chamber of death with we face to the dusky falsify looking-glass that cover the scant end-side of the blind passage from floor to ceiling -- right difficult for we so wedge between its wall that we can not turn round nor have other escape possible but by walk backward to understand that all we behold or have any memory of have ever beholden yea we very selve as see by we be but shadow and when the form that we love vanish impossible not to feel as if they be real ib p 197 nothing that be good proceedeth out of the work of the law except grace be present for what we be force to do the same goeth not from the heart neither be acceptable a law suppose a law-giver and imply a actuator and executor and consequently reward and punishment publicly announce and distinctly assign to the deed enjoin or forbid and correlatively in the subject of the law there be suppose first assurance of the be the power the veracity and seeingness of the law-giver in whom i here comprise the legislative judicial and executive function and secondly self-interest desire hope and fear now from this view it be evident that the deed or work of the law be themselves null and dead derive they whole significance from they attachment or alligation to the reward and punishment even as this diversely shaped and ink color paper have its value wholly from the word or meaning which have be arbitrarily connect therewith or as a ladder or flight of stair of a provision-loft or treasury if the architect or master of the house have choose to place the store-room or treasury on the ground floor the ladder or step would have be useless the life be divide between the reward and punishment on the one hand and the hope and fear on the other : namely the active life or excitancy belong to the former the passive life or excitability to the latter call the former the afficient the latter the affection the deed be merely the sign or impress of the former as the seal on the latter as the wax equally evident be it that the affection be wholly form by the deed which be themselves but the lifeless unsubstantial shape of the actual form -lrb- ` formæ formante ' -rrb- namely the reward and punishment now contrast with this the process of the gospel there the affection be form in the first instance not by any reference to work or deed but by a unmerited rescue from death liberation from slavish task-work by faith gratitude love and affectionate contemplation of the exceed goodness and loveliness of the savior redeemer benefactor : from the affection flow the deed or rather the affection overflow in the deed and the reward be but a continuance and continue increase of the free grace in the state of the soul and in the growth and gradual perfecting of that state which be themselves gift of the same free grace and one with the reward for in the kingdom of christ which be the realm of love and inter-community the joy and grace of each regenerated spirit become double and thereby augment the joy and the grace of the other and the joy and grace of all unite in each -- christ the head and by he spirit the bond or unitive ` copula ' of all be the spiritual sun whose entire image be reflect in every individual of the myriad of dew-drop while under the law the all be but a aggregate of subject each strive after a reward for himself -- not as include in and result from the state -- but as the stipulate wages of the task-work as a loaf of bread may be the pay or bounty promise for the hewing of wood or the breaking of stone ib he -lrb- say luther -rrb- that will dispute with the devil & c query i abstractedly from and independently of all sensible substance and the body will faculty and affection of man have the devil or would the devil have a personal self-subsistence do he or can he exist as a conscious individual agent or person should the answer to this query be in the negative : then -- ii do there exist finite and personal being whether with composite and decomponible body that be embody or with simple and indecomponible body -lrb- which be all that can be mean by disembodied as apply to finite creature -rrb- so eminently wicked or wicked and mischievous in so peculiar a kind as to constitute a distinct ` genus ' of being under the name of devil iii be this second ` hypothesis ' compatible with the act and function attribute to the devil in scripture o to have have these three question put by melancthon to luther and to have hear he reply ib p 200 if -lrb- say luther -rrb- god should give unto we a strong and a unwavering faith then we should he proud yea also we should at last contemn he again if he should give we the right knowledge of the law then we should be dismayed and faintheart we should not know which way to wind ourselves the main reason be because in this instance the change in the relation constitute the difference of the thing a consider as act ` ab extra ' on the selfish fear and desire of man be the law : the same a : act ` ab intra ' as a new nature infuse by grace as the mind of christ prompt to all obedience be the gospel yet what luther say be likewise very true could we reduce the great spiritual truth or idea of we faith to comprehensible conception or -lrb- for the thing itself be impossible -rrb- fancy we have do so we should inevitably be ` proud vain ass ' ib p 203 and as to know he work and action be not yet rightly to know the gospel -lrb- for thereby we know not as yet that he have overcome sin death and the devil -rrb- even so likewise it be not as yet to know the gospel when we know such doctrine and commandment but when the voice soundeth which saith christ be thine own with life with doctrine with work death resurrection and with all that he have doth and may do most true ib p 205 the ancient father say : ` distingue tempora et concordabis scripturas ' distinguish the time then may we easily reconcile the scripture together yea and not only so but we shall reconcile truth that seem to repeal this or that passage of scripture with the scripture for christ be with he church even to the end ib i verily believe -lrb- say luther -rrb- it -lrb- the abolition of the law -rrb- vex to the heart the beloved st paul himself before he conversion how dearly martin luther love st paul how dearly would st paul have love martin luther and how impossible that either should not have do so ib in this case touch the distinguish the law from the gospel we must utterly expel all human and natural wisdom reason and understand all reason be above nature therefore by reason in luther or rather in he translator you must understand the reasoning faculty : -- that be the logical intellect or the intellectual understanding for the understanding be in all respects a medial and mediate faculty and have therefore two extremity or pole the sensual in which form it be st paul 's -lrb- greek : phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- and the intellectual pole or the hemisphere -lrb- as it be -rrb- turn towards the reason now the reason -lrb- ` lux ideali seu spirituali ' -rrb- shine down into the understanding which recognize the light ` id est luman a luce spiritualus quasi alienigenum aliquid ' which it can only comprehend or describe to itself by attribute opposite to its own essential property now these latter be contingency and -lrb- for though the immediate object of the understanding be ` genus et species ' still they be particular ` genus et species ' -rrb- particularity it distinguish the formal light -lrb- ` luman ' -rrb- -lrb- not the substantial light ` lux ' -rrb- of reason by the attribute of the necessary and the universal and by irradiation of this ` luman ' or ` shine ' the understanding become a conclusive or logical faculty as such it be -lrb- greek : lógos anthrôpinos -rrb- ib 206 when satan saith in thy heart god will not pardon thy sin nor be gracious unto thee i pray -lrb- say luther -rrb- how wilt thou then as a poor sinner raise up and comfort thyself especially when other sign of god 's wrath besides do beat upon thee as sickness poverty & c and that thy heart beginneth to preach and say behold here thou livest in sickness thou art poor and forsake of every one & c oh how true how affectingly true be this and when too satan the tempter become satan the accuser say in thy heart : -- this sickness be the consequence of sin or sinful infirmity and thou hast bring thyself into a fearful dilemma thou canst not hope for salvation as long as thou continuest in any sinful practice and yet thou canst not abandon thy daily dose of this or that poison without suicide for the sin of thy soul have become the necessity of thy body daily torment thee without yield thee any the least pleasurable sensation but goad thee on by terror without hope under such evidence of god 's wrath how canst thou expect to be save well may the heart cry out who shall deliver I from the ` body of this death ' -- from this death that live and tyrannize in my body but the gospel answer -- there be a redemption from the body promise only cling to christ call on he continually with all thy heart and all thy soul to give thee strength and be strong in thy weakness and what christ doth not see good to relieve thee from suffer in hope it may be better for thee to be keep humble and in self-abasement the thorn in the flesh may remain and yet the grace of god through christ prove sufficient for thee only cling to christ and do thy best in all love and well-doing gird thyself up to improve and use aright what remain free in thee and if thou doest ought aright say and thankfully believe that christ have do it for thee o what a miserable despairing wretch should i become if i believe the doctrine of bishop jeremy taylor in he treatise on repentance or those i hear preach by dr -- if i give up the faith that the life of christ would precipitate the remain dregs of sin in the crisis of death and that i shall rise in purer capacity of christ blind to be irradiate by he light empty to be possess by he fullness naked of merit to be clothe with he righteousness ib p 207 the nobility the gentry citizen and farmer & c be now become so haughty and ungodly that they regard no minister nor preacher and -lrb- say luther -rrb- if we be not holpen somewhat by great prince and person we could not long subsist : therefore isaiah saith well ` and king shall be they nurse ' & c corpulent nurse too often that overlay the babe distempered nurse that convey poison in they milk chap xiii p 208 philip melancthon say to luther the opinion of st austin of justification -lrb- as it seemeth -rrb- be more pertinent fit and convenient when he dispute not than it be when he use to speak and dispute for thus he saith we ought to censure and hold that we be justify by faith that be by we regeneration or by be make new creature now if it be so then we be not justified only by faith but by all the gift and virtue of god give unto we now what be you opinion sir do you hold that a man be justify by this regeneration as be st austin 's opinion luther answer and say i hold this and be certain that the true meaning of the gospel and of the apostle be that we be justified before god ` gratis ' for nothing only by god 's mere mercy wherewith and by reason whereof he imputeth righteousness unto we in christ true but be it more than a dispute about word be not the regeneration likewise ` gratis ' only by god 's mere mercy we accord to the necessity of we imperfect understanding must divide and distinguish but surely justification and sanctification be one act of god and only different perspective of redemption by and through and for christ they be one and the same plant justification the root sanctification the flower and -lrb- may i not venture to add -rrb- transubstantiation into christ the celestial fruit ib p 210-11 melancthon 's sixth reply sir you say paul be justified that be be receive to everlasting life only for mercy 's sake against which i say if the piece-meal or partial cause namely we obedience followeth not then we be not save accord to these word ` woe be I if i preach not the gospel ' 1 cor ix luther 's answer no piecing or partial cause -lrb- say luther -rrb- approacheth thereupto : for faith be powerful continually without cease otherwise it be no faith therefore what the work be or of what value the same they be through the honor and power of faith which undeniably be the sun or sun-beam of this shine this be indeed a difficult question and one i be dispose to think which can receive its solution only by the idea or the act and fact of justification by faith self-reflected but humanly consider this position of luther 's provoke the mind to ask be there no receptivity of faith consider as a free gift of god prerequisite in the individual do faith commence by generate the receptivity of itself if so there be no difference either in kind or in degree between the receiver and the rejector of the word at the moment preceed this reception or rejection and a stone be a subject as capable of faith as a man how can obedience exist where disobedience be not possible surely two or three text from st paul detach from the total ` organismus ' of he reasoning ought not to out-weigh the plain fact that the contrary position be imply in or be a immediate consequent of we lord 's own invitation and assurance every where a something be attribute to the will -lrb- 2 -rrb- chap xiii p 211 to conclude a faithful person be a new creature a new tree therefore all these speech which in the law be usual belong not to this case as to say ' a faithful ' person must do good work neither be it rightly speak to say the sun shall shine : a good tree shall bring forth good fruit & c for the sun ` shall ' not shine but it doth shine by nature unbidden it be thereunto create this important paragraph be obscure by the translator 's ignorance of the true import of the german ` soll ' which do not answer to we ` shall ' but rather to we ` ought ' that be ` should ' do this or that -- be under a obligation to do it ib p 213 and i my loving brentius to the end i may better understand this case do use to think in this manner namely as if in my heart be no quality or virtue at all which be call faith and love -lrb- as the sophist do speak and dream thereof -rrb- but i set all on christ and say my ` formalis justitia ' that be my sure my constant and complete righteousness -lrb- in which be no want nor fail but be as before god it ought to be -rrb- be christ my lord and savior aye this this be indeed to the purpose in this doctrine my soul can find rest i hope to be save by faith not by my faith but by the faith of christ in I ib p 214 the scripture nameth the faithful a people of god 's saint but here one may say the sin which daily we commit do offend and anger god how then can we be holy ` answer ' a mother 's love to she child be much stronger than be the excrement and scurf thereof even so god 's love towards we be far stronger than we filthiness and uncleanness yea one may say again we sin without cease and where sin be there the holy spirit be not : therefore we be not holy because the holy spirit be not in we who maketh holy ` answer ' -lrb- john xvi 14 -rrb- now where christ be there be the holy spirit the text saith plainly ` the holy ghost shall glorify I & c ' now christ be in the faithful -lrb- although they have and feel sin do confess the same and with sorrow of heart do complain thereover -rrb- therefore sin do not separate christ from those that believe all in this page be true and necessary to be preach but o what need be there of holy prudence to preach it aright that be at right time to the right ear now this be when the doctrine be necessary and thence comfortable but where it be not necessary but only very comfortable in such case it would be a narcotic poison kill the soul by infuse a stupor or counterfeit peace of conscience where there be no sinking of self-abasement no gripe sense of sin and worthlessness but perhaps the contrary reckless confidence and self-valuing for good quality suppose a overbalance for the sin -- there it be not necessary in short these be not the truth that can be preach -lrb- greek : eukaírôs akaírôs -rrb- _ in season and out of season _ in decline life or at any time in the hour of sincere humiliation these truth may be apply in reference to past sin collectively but a christian must not a true however infirm christian will not can not administer they to himself immediately after sin least of all immediately before we ought fervently to pray thus : -- most holy and most merciful god by the grace of thy holy spirit make these promise profitable to I to preserve I from despair of thy forgiveness through christ my savior but o save I from presumptuously pervert they into a pillow for a stupified conscience give I grace so to contrast my sin with thy transcendant goodness and long-suffering love as to hate it with a unfeigned hatred for its own exceed sinfulness ib p 219-20 faith be and consisteth in a person 's understanding but hope consisteth in the will \* \* faith inditeth distinguisheth and teacheth and it be the knowledge and acknowledgment \* \* faith fighteth against error and heresy it proveth censureth and judgeth the spirit and doctrine \* \* faith in divinity be the wisdom and providence and belongeth to the doctrine \* \* faith be the ` dialectica ' for it be altogether wit and wisdom luther in he postill discourseth far better and more genially of faith than in these paragraph unfortunately the german have but one word for faith and belief -- ` glaube ' and what luther here say be speak of belief of faith he speak in the next article but one ib p 226 that regeneration only maketh god 's child the article of we justification before god -lrb- say luther -rrb- be as it useth to be with a son which be bear a heir of all he father 's goods and cometh not thereunto by desert i will here record my experience ever when i meet with the doctrine of regeneration and faith and free grace simply announce -- so it be -- then i believe my heart leap forth to welcome it but as soon as a explanation nation or reason be add such explanation namely and reasoning as i have any where meet with then my heart leap back again recoil and i exclaim nay nay but not so 25th of September 1819 ib p 227 doctor carlestad -lrb- say luther -rrb- argueth thus : true it be that faith justifieth but faith be a work of the first commandment therefore it justifieth as a work moreover all that the law commandeth the same be a work of the law now faith be command therefore faith be a work of the law again what god will have the same be command : god will have faith therefore faith be command st paul -lrb- say luther -rrb- speaketh in such sort of the law that he separateth it from the promise which be far another thing than the law the law be terrestrial but the promise be celestial god giveth the law to the end we may thereby be rouse up and make pliant for the commandment do go and proceed against the proud and haughty which contemn god 's gift now a gift or present can not be a commandment therefore we must answer accord to this rule ` verba sunt accipienda secundum subjectam materiam ' \* \* st paul calleth that the work of the law which be do and act through the knowledge of the law by a constrain will without the holy spirit so that the same be a work of the law which the law earnestly requireth and strictly will have do it be not a voluntary work but a forced work of the rod and wherein do carlestad and luther differ not at all or essentially and irreconcilably accord as the feeling of carlestad be if he mean the particular deed the latter if the total act the agent include then the former chap xiv p 230 the love towards the neighbor -lrb- say luther -rrb- must be like a pure chaste love between bride and bridegroom where all fault be connive at covered and bear with and only the virtue regard in how many little escape and corner-hole do the sensibility the fineness -lrb- that of which refinement be but a counterfeit at best but a reflex -rrb- the geniality of nature appear in this ` son of thunder ' o for a luther in the present age why charle -lrb- 3 -rrb- with the very handcuffs of he prejudice he would knock out the brain -lrb- nay that be impossible but -rrb- he would split the skull of we ` cristo-gallus ' translate the word as you like : -- french christian or coxcomb ib p 231-2 let witzell know -lrb- say luther -rrb- that david 's war and battle which he fight be more please to god than the fasting and praying of the best of the honestest and of the holiest monk and friar much more than the work of we new ridiculous and superstitious friar a cordial rich and juicy speech such as shaped itself into and live anew in the gustavus adolphus chap xv p 233-4 god most certainly heareth they that pray in faith and granteth when and how he pleaseth and knoweth most profitable for they we must also know that when we prayer tend to the sanctify of he name and to the increase and honor of he kingdom -lrb- also that we pray accord to he will -rrb- then most certainly he heareth but when we pray contrary to these point then we be not hear for god doth nothing against he name he kingdom and he will then -lrb- saith the understanding -lrb- greek : tò phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- -rrb- what doth prayer effect if a -- prayer = b and a + prayer = b prayer = o the attempt to answer this argument by admit its invalidity relatively to god but assert the efficacy of prayer relatively to the pray-er or precant himself be merely stave off the objection a single step for this effect on the devout soul be produce by a act of god the true answer be prayer be a idea and ` ens spirituale ' out of the cognizance of the understand the spiritual mind receive the answer in the contemplation of the idea life as ` deitas diffusa ' we can set the life in efficient motion but not contrary to the form or type the error and false theory of great man sometimes perhaps most often arise out of true idea falsify by degenerate into conception or the mind excite to action by a inworking idea the understanding work in the same direction accord to its kind and produce a counterfeit in which the mind rest this i believe to be the case with the scheme of emanation in plotinus god be make a first and consequently a comparative intensity and matter the last the whole thence finite and thence its conceivability but we must admit a gradation of intensity in reality chap xvi p 247 when governor and ruler be enemy to god 's word then we duty be to depart to sell and forsake all we have to fly from one place to another as christ commandeth we must make and prepare no uproar nor tumult by reason of the gospel but we must suffer all thing right but then it must be the lawful ruler those in whom the sovereign or supreme power be lodge by the known law and constitution of the country where the law and constitutional liberty of the nation be trample on the subject do not lose and be not in conscience bind to forego they right of resistance because they be christian or because it happen to be a matter of religion in which they rights be violate and this be luther 's opinion whether if a popish czar shall act as we jame ii act the russian greekist would be justify in do with he what the english protestant justifiably do with regard to jame be a knot which i shall not attempt to cut though i guess the russian would by cut they czar 's throat ib ` but no man will do this except he be so sure of he doctrine and religion as that although i myself should play the fool and should recant and deny this my doctrine and religion -lrb- which god forbid -rrb- he notwithstanding therefore would not yield but say if luther or a angel from heaven should teach otherwise _ let he be accurse _ ' well and nobly say thou rare black swan this this be the church where this be find there be the church of christ though but twenty in the whole of the congregation and be twenty such in two hundred different place the church would be entire in each without this no church ib p 248 and he send for one of he chiefest privy councillor name lord john _ von minkwitz _ and say unto he ` you have hear my father say -lrb- run with he at tilt -rrb- that to sit upright on horseback maketh a good tilter if therefore it be good and laudable in temporal tilt to sit upright how much more be it now praiseworthy in god 's cause to sit to stand and to go uprightly and just ' princely so shakspeare would have make a prince elector talk the metaphor be so grandly in character chap xvii p 249 _ signa sunt subinde facta minora re autem et facta subinde creverunt _ a valuable remark as the substance wax that be become more evident the ceremonial sign wane till at length in the eucharist the ` signum ' unite itself with the ` significatum ' and become consubstantial the ceremonial sign namely the eat the bread and drink the wine become a symbol that be a solemn instance and exemplification of the class of mysterious act which we be or as christian should be perform daily and hourly in every social duty and recreation this be indeed to re-create the man in and by christ sublimely do the father call the eucharist the extension of the incarnation : only i should have prefer the perpetuation and application of the incarnation ib a bare writing without a seal be of no force metaphor be sorry logic especially metaphor from human and those too conventional usage to the ordinance of eternal wisdom ib p 250 luther say no a christian be wholly and altogether sanctify \* \* we must take sure hold on baptism by faith as then we shall be yea already be sanctify in this sort david nameth himself holy a deep thought strong meat for man it must not be offer for milk chap xxi p 276 then i will declare he openly to the church and in this manner i will say : loving friend i declare unto you how that n n have be admonish : first by myself in private afterwards also by two chaplain thirdly by two alderman and churchwarden and those of the assembly : yet notwithstanding he will not desist from he sinful kind of life wherefore i earnestly desire you to assist and aid I to kneel down with I and let we pray against he and deliver he over to the devil luther do not mean that this should be do all at once but that a day should be appoint for the congregation to meet for joint consultation and accord to the resolution pass to choose and commission such and such person to wait on the offender and to exhort persuade and threaten he in the name of the congregation : then if after due time allow this prove fruitless to kneel down with the minister & c surely be it only feasible nothing could be more desirable but alas it be not compatible with a church national the congregation of which be therefore not gather nor elect or with a church establish by law for law and discipline be mutually destructive of each other be the same as involuntary and voluntary penance chap xxii p 290 wicliffe and huss oppose and assault the manner of life and conversation in popedom but i chiefly do oppose and resist they doctrine i affirm roundly and plainly that they teach not aright thereto be i call i take the goose by the neck and set the knife to the throat when i can maintain that the pope 's doctrine be false -lrb- which i have prove and maintain -rrb- then i will easily prove and maintain that they manner of life be evil this be a remark of deep insight : ` verum vere lutheranum ' ib p 291 ambition and pride -lrb- say luther -rrb- be the rankest poison in the church when they be possess by preacher zuinglius thereby be mislead who do what pleased himself \* \* \* he write ye honorable and good prince must pardon I in that i give you not you title for the glass window be as well illustrious as ye one might fancy in the vision-of-mirza style that all the angry contemptuous haughty expression of good and zealous man gallant staff-officer in the army of christ form a rick of straw and stubble which at the last day be to be divide into more or fewer haycock accord to the number of kind and unfeignedly humble and charitable thought and speech that have intervene and that these be place in a pile leap-frog fashion in the narrow road to the gate of paradise and burst into flame as the zeal of the individual approach -- so that he must leap over and through they now i can not help think that this dear man of god heroic luther will find more opportunity of show he agility and reach the gate in a greater sweat and with more blister ' a parte post ' than he brother hero zuinglius i guess that the comment of the latter on the prophet will be find almost sterile in these tiger-lily and brimstone flower of polemic rhetoric compare with the controversy of the former with we henry viii he reply to the pope 's bull and the like by the by the joke of the ` glass window ' be lose in the translation the german for illustrious be ` durchlauchtig ' that be transparent or translucent ib when we leave to god he name he kingdom and will then will he also give unto we we daily bread and will remit we sin and deliver we from the devil and all evil only he honor he will have to himself a brief but most excellent comment on the lord 's prayer ib p 297 there be never any that understand the old testament so well as st paul except only john the baptist i can not conjecture what luther have in he mind when he make this exception chap xxvii p 335 i could wish -lrb- say luther -rrb- that the prince and state of the empire would make a assembly and hold a council and a union both in doctrine and ceremony so that every one might not break in and run on with such insolency and presumption accord to he own brain as already be begin whereby many good heart be offend strange heart of man would luther have give up the doctrine of justification by faith alone have the majority of the council decide in favor of the arminian scheme if not by what right could he expect oecolampadius or zuinglius to recant they conviction respect the eucharist or the baptist theirs on infant baptism to the same authority in fact the wish express in this passage must be consider as a mere fly think shoot out by the mood and feeling of the moment a sort of conversational flying-fish that drop as soon as the moisture of the fin have evaporate the paragraph in p 336 of what council ought to order should be consider luther 's genuine opinion ib p 337 the council of nice hold after the apostle ' time -lrb- say luther -rrb- be the very best and purest but soon after in the time of the emperor constantine it be weaken by the arian what arius himself mean i do not know : what the modern arian teach i utterly condemn but that the great council of ariminum be either arian or heretical i could never discover or descry any essential difference between its decision and the nicene though i seem to find a serious difference of the pseudo-athanasian creed from both if there be a difference between the council of nicea and ariminum it perhaps consist in this -- that the nicene be the more anxious to assert the equal divinity in the filial subordination the ariminian to maintain the filial subordination in the equal divinity in both there be three self-subsistent and only one self-originated : -- which be the substance of the idea of the trinity as faithfully word as be compatible with the necessary inadequacy of word to the expression of idea that be spiritual truth that can only be spiritually discern -lrb- 4 -rrb- 18th August 1826 chap xxviii p 347 god 's word a lord of all lord luther every where identify the living word of god with the write word and rage against bullinger who contend that the latter be the word of god only as far as and for whom it be the vehicle of the former to this luther reply : my voice the vehicle of my word do not cease to be my voice because it be ignorantly or maliciously misunderstand yea -lrb- might bullinger have rejoin -rrb- the instance be applicable and the argument valid if we be previously assure that all and every part of the old and new testament be the voice of the divine word but except by the spirit whence be we to ascertain this not from the book themselves for not one of they make the pretension for itself and the two or three text which seem to assert it refer only to the law and the prophet and no where enumerate the book that be give by inspiration : and how obscure the history of the formation of the canon and how great the difference of opinion respect its different part what scholar be ignorant chap xxix p 349 ` patres quamquam sæpe errant taman venerandus propter testimonium fideus ' although i learn from all this chapter that luther be no great patrician -lrb- indeed he be better employ -rrb- yet i be nearly if not wholly of he mind respect the work of the father those which appear to I of any great value be valuable chiefly for those article of christian faith which be as it be ` ante christum ' jesum namely the trinity and the primal incarnation speak of by john i 10 but in the main i should perhaps go even farther than luther for i can not conceive any thing more likely than that a young man of strong and active intellect who have no fear or suffer no fear of worldly prudence to cry halt to he in he career of consequential logic and who have be ` innutritus et juratus ' in the grotio-paleyan scheme of christian evidence and who have be teach by the man and book which he have be breed up to regard as authority to consider all inward experience as fanatical delusion -- i say i can scarcely conceive such a young man to make a serious study of the father of the first four or five century without become either a romanist or a deist let he only read petavius and the different patristic and ecclesiastico - historical tract of semler and have no better philosophy than that of locke no better theology than that of arminius and bishop jeremy taylor and i should tremble for he belief yet why tremble for a belief which be the very antipode of faith better for such a man to precipitate himself on to the utmost goal : for then perhaps he may in the repose of intellectual activity feel the nothingness of he prize or the wretchedness of it and then perhaps the inward yearning after a religion may make he ask -- have i not mistake the road at the outset be i sure that the reformer luther and the rest collectively be fanatic ib p 351 ` take no care what ye shall eat ' as though that commandment do not hinder the carping and caring for the daily bread for ` care ' read ` anxiety ' ` sit tibus curæ non autem solicitudinus pani quotidianus ' ib p 351 even so it be with ambrose : he write indeed well and purely be more serious in write than austin who be amiable and mild \* \* \* fulgentius be the best poet and far above horace both with sentence fair speech and good action he be well worthy to be rank and number with and among the poet ` der teufel ' surely the epithet should be reverse austin 's mildness -- the ` durus pater infantum ' and the ` super ' - horatian effulgence of master foolgentius o swan thy critical cygnet be but gosling nb i have however since i write the above hear mr j hookham frere speak highly of fulgentius ib p 352 for the father be but man and to speak the truth they repute and authority do undervalue and suppress the book and writings of the sacred apostle of christ we doubtless find in the writings of the father of the second century and still more strongly in those of the third passage concern the scripture that seem to say the same as we protestant now do but then we find the very same phrase use of writings not apostolic or with no other difference than what the greater name of the author would naturally produce just as a platonist would speak of speusippus 's book be they extant compare with those of later teacher of platonism -- ` he be plato 's nephew-had see plato -- be he appoint successor & c ' but in inspiration the early christian as far as i can judge make no generic difference let lardner say what he will can he disprove that it be declare heretical by the church in the second century to believe the write word of a dead apostle in opposition to the word of a living bishop see that the same spirit which guide the apostle dwell in and guide the bishop of the church this at least be certain that the later the age of the writer the stronger the expression of comparative superiority of the scripture the earlier on the other hand the more we hear of the ` symbolum ' the ` regulum fideus ' the creed chap xxxii p 362 the history of the prophet jona be so great that it be almost incredible yea it soundeth more strange than any of the poet ' fable and -lrb- say luther -rrb- if it stand not in the bible i should take it for a lie it be quite wonderful that luther who could see so plainly that the book of judith be a allegoric poem should have be blind to the book of jona be a apologue in which jonah mean the israelitish nation ib p 364 for they enter into the garden about the hour at noon day and have appetite to eat she take delight in the apple then about two of the clock accord to we account be the fall milton have adopt this notion in the paradise lose -- not improbably from this book ib p 365 david make a psalm of two and twenty part in each of which be eight verse and yet in all be but one kind of mean namely he will only say thy law or word be good i have conjecture that the 119th psalm might have be a form of ordination in which a series of candidate make they prayer and profession in the open temple before they go to the several synagogue in the country ib but -lrb- say luther -rrb- i say he do well and right thereon : for the office of a magistrate be to punish the guilty and wicked malefactor he make a vow indeed not to punish he but that be to be understand so long as david live o luther luther ask you own heart if this be not jesuit morality chap xxxiii v 367 i believe -lrb- say luther -rrb- the word of we christian belief be in such sort ordain by the apostle who be together and make this sweet ` symbolum ' so briefly and comfortable it be difficult not to regret that luther have so superficial a knowledge of ecclesiastical antiquity : for example he belief in this fable of the creed have be a ` picnic ' contribution of the twelve apostle each give a sentence whereas nothing be more certain than that it be the gradual product of three or four century chap xxxiv p 369 a angel -lrb- say luther -rrb- be a spiritual creature create by god without a body for the service of christendom especially in the office of the church what do luther mean by a body for to I the word seemeth capable of two sens universal and special : -- first a form indicate to a b c & c the existence and finiteness of some one other be ` demonstrative ' as ` hic ' and ` disjunctive ' as ` hic et non ille ' and in this sense god alone can be without body : secondly that which be not merely ` hic distinctive ' but ` divisive ' yea a product divisible from the producent as a snake from its skin a precipitate and death of live power and in this sense the body be proper to mortality and to be deny of spirit make perfect as well as of the spirit that never fall from perfection and perhaps of those who fall below mortality namely the devil but i be incline to hold that the devil have no one body nay no body of he own but ceaselessly usurp or counterfeit body for he be a everlasting liar yea the lie which be the color shadow of the substance that intercept the truth ib p 370 the devil be in wood in water in wilderness and in dark pooly place ready to hurt and prejudice people & c the angel 's like a flea the devil be a bear -- no matter for that quoth stc i love he the better therefore yes heroic swan i love thee even when thou gabbiest like a goose for thy goose help to save the capitol ib p 371 i do verily believe -lrb- say luther -rrb- that the day of judgment draweth near and that the angel prepare themselves for the fight and combat and that within the space of a few hundred year they will strike down both turk and pope into the bottomless pit of hell yea two or three more such angel as thyself martin luther and thy prediction would be or perhaps would now have be accomplish chap xxxv p 388 cogitation of the understanding do produce no melancholy but the cogitation of the will cause sadness as when one be grieve at a thing or when one doth sigh and complain there be melancholy and sad cogitation but the understanding be not melancholy even in luther 's lowest imbecility what gleam of vigorous good sense have he understand the nature and symptom of indigestion together with the detail of subjective see and hear and the existence of mid-state of the brain between sleep and wake luther would have be a greater philosopher but would he have be so great a hero i doubt it praise be god whose mercy be over all he work who bringeth good out of evil and manifesteth he wisdom even in the folly of he servant he strength in they weakness ib p 389 whoso prayeth a psalm shall be make thoroughly warm ` expertus credo ' 19th aug 1826 i have learn to interpret for myself the imprecating verse of the psalm of my inward and spiritual enemy the old adam and all he corrupt menial and thus i be no longer as i use to be stop or scandalize by such passage as vindictive and anti-christian ib the devil -lrb- say luther -rrb- oftentimes object and argue against I the whole cause which through god 's grace i lead he objecteth also against christ but better it be that the temple brake in piece than that christ should therein remain obscure and hide sublime ib in job be two chapter concern ` behemoth ' the whale that by reason of he no man be in safety \* \* these be color word and figure whereby the devil be signify and show a slight mistake of brother martin 's the ` behemoth ' of job be beyond a doubt neither whale nor devil but i think the hippopotamus who be indeed as ugly as the devil and will occasionally play the devil among the rice-grounds but though in this respect a devil of a fellow yet on the whole he be too honest a monster to be a fellow of devil ` vindiciæ behemoticæ ' chap xxxvi p 390 ` of witchcraft ' it often press on my mind as a weighty argument in proof of at least a negative inspiration a especial restrain grace in the composition of the canonical book that though the writer individually do -lrb- the greater number at least -rrb- most probably believe in the objective reality of witchcraft yet no such direct assertion as these of luther 's which would with the vast majority of christian have raise it into a article of faith be to be find in either testament that the ` ob ' and ` oboth ' of mose be no authority for this absurd superstition have be unanswerably shew by webster -lrb- 5 -rrb- chap xxxvii p 398 to conclude -lrb- say luther -rrb- i never yet know a troubled and perplexed man that be right in he own wit a sound observation of great practical utility edward irving should be aware of this in deal with conscience-troubled -lrb- but in fact fancy-vexed -rrb- woman ib it be not a thorn in the flesh touch the unchaste love he bear towards teclum as the papist dream i should like to know how high this strange legend can be trace the other tradition that st paul be subject to epileptic fit have a less legendary character the phrase ` thorn in the flesh ' be scarcely reconcilable with luther 's hypothesis otherwise than as doubt of the objectivity of he vision and of he after revelation may have be consequence of the disease whatever that might be ib p 399 we lord god doth like a printer who setteth the letter backwards we see and feel well he setting but we shall see the print yonder in the life to come a beautiful simile add that even in this world the life especially the autobiography of eminent servant of christ be like the looking-glass or mirror which reverse the type render they legible to we ib p 403 ` indignus sum sed dignus fuus -- creari a deo ' & c although i be unworthy yet nevertheless ' i have be ' worthy ` in that i be ' create of god & c the translation do not give the true sense of the latin it should be ` be ' and ` to be ' the ` dignus fui ' have here the sense of ` dignum I habuit deus ' see herbert 's little poem in the temple : sweetest savior if my soul be but worth the have quickly should i then control any thought of wave but when all my care and pain can not give the name of gain to thy wretch so full of stain what delight or hope remain ib p 404 the chiefest physic for that disease -lrb- but very hard and difficult it be to be do -rrb- be that they firmly hold such cogitation not to be theirs but that most sure and certain they come of the devil more and more i understand the immense difference between the faith-article of ` the devil ' -lrb- -lrb- greek : tou ponaeroù -rrb- -rrb- and the superstitious fancy of devil : ` animus objectivus dominationem in ' -lrb- greek : tòn eimì -rrb- ` affectan ' -lrb- greek : oútos tò méga órganon diabólou hypárchei -rrb- chap xliv p 431 i truly advise all those -lrb- say luther -rrb- who earnestly do affect the honor of christ and the gospel that they would be enemy to erasmus roterodamus for he be a devaster of religion do but read only he dialogue ` de peregrinatione ' where you will see how he derideth and flouteth the whole religion and at last concludeth out of single abomination that he rejecteth religion & c religion here mean the vow and habit of the religious or those bind to a particular life -- the monk friar nun in short the regular in contradistinction from the laity and the secular clergy ib p 432 erasmus can do nothing but cavil and flout he can not confute if -lrb- say luther -rrb- i be a papist so could i easily overcome and beat he for although he flouteth the pope with he ceremony yet he neither have confute nor overcome he no enemy be beat nor overcome with mock jeering and flout most true but it be a excellent pioneer and a excellent ` corps de reserve ' cavalry for pursuit and for clear the field of battle and in the first use luther be greatly oblige to erasmus but such utter unlike can not but end in dislike and so it prove between erasmus and luther erasmus might the protestant say wish no good to the church of rome and still less to we party : it be with he ` rot she and dam we ' chap xlviii p 442 david 's example be full of offence that so holy a man choose of god should fall into such great abominable sin and blasphemy when as before he be very fortunate and happy of whom all the border kingdom be afraid for god be with he if any part of the old testament be typical the whole life and character of david from he birth to he death be eminently so and accordingly the history of david and he psalm which form a most interesting part of he history occupy as large a portion of the old testament as all the other the type be two-fold-now of the messiah now of the church and of the church in all its relation persecute victorious backsliding penitent nb i do not find david charge with any vice though with heavy crime so it be with the church vice destroy its essence ib the same be a strange kind of offence -lrb- say luther -rrb- that the world be offend at he who raise the dead who make the blind to see and the deaf to hear & c we lord allude to the verse that immediately follow and complete he quotation from isaiah -lrb- 6 -rrb- i jehovah will come and do this that he implicitly declare himself the jehovah the word -- this be the offence chap xlix p 443 god will may one say that we should serve he freewillingly but he that serveth god out of fear of punishment of hell or out of a hope and love of recompence the same serveth and honoreth god not freely therefore such a one serveth god not uprightly nor truly _ answer _ this argument -lrb- say luther -rrb- be stoical & c a truly wise paragraph pity it be not expound god will accept we imperfection where they face be turn toward he on the road to the glorious liberty of the gospel chap l p 446 it be the highest grace and gift of god to have a honest a god-fearing housewifely consort & c but god thrusteth many into the state of matrimony before they be aware and rightly bethink themselves the state of matrimony -lrb- say luther -rrb- be the chiefest state in the world after religion & c alas alas this be the misery of it that so many wed and so few be christianly marry but even in this the analogy of matrimony to the religion of christ hold good : for even such be the proportion of nominal to actual christian -- all _ christen _ how few baptize but in true matrimony it be beautiful to consider how peculiarly the marriage state harmonize with the doctrine of justification by free grace through faith alone the little quarrel the imperfection on both side the occasional frailty yield to the one thought -- there be love at the bottom if sickness or other sorer calamity visit I how would the love then blaze forth the fault be there but they be not imprint the prickle the acrid rind the bitterness or sourness be transform into the ripe fruit and the foreknowledge of this give the name and virtue of the ripe fruit to the fruit yet green on the bough ib p 447 the causer and founder of matrimony be chiefly god 's commandment & c it be a state institute by god himself visit by christ in person and present with a glorious present for god say ` it be not good that the man should be alone ' : therefore the wife should be a help to the husband to the end that human generation may be increase and child nurture to god 's honor and to the profit of people and country also to keep we body in sanctification -lrb- add -rrb- and in mutual reverence we spirit in a state of love and tenderness and we imagination pure and tranquil in a word matrimony not only preserveth human generation so that the same remain continually but it preserveth the generation human ib p 450 in the synod at leipzig the lawyer conclude that secret contractor should be punish with banishment and be disinherit whereupon -lrb- say luther -rrb- i send they word that i would not allow thereof it be too gross a proceeding & c but nevertheless i hold it fitting that those which in such sort do secretly contract themselves ought sharply to be reprove yea also in some measure severely punish what a sweet union of prudence and kind nature scold they sharply and perhaps let they smart a while for they indiscretion and disobedience and then kiss and make it up remember that young folk will be young folk and that love have its own law and logic chap lix p 481 the presumption and boldness of the sophist and school-divine be a very ungodly thing which some of the father also approve of and extol namely of spiritual signification in the holy scripture whereby she be pitifully tattered and tear in piece it be a apish work in such sort to juggle with holy scripture : it be no otherwise than if i should discourse of physic in this manner : the fever be a sickness rhubarb be the physic the fever signify the sin -- rhubarb be jesus christ & c who seeth not here -lrb- say luther -rrb- that such signification be mere juggling trick _ even so _ and after the same manner be they deceive that say child ought to be baptize again because they have not faith for the life of I i can not find the ` even so ' in this sentence the watchman cry ` half-past three o'clock ' even so and after the same manner the great cham of tartary have a carbuncle on he nose chap lx p 483 george in the greek tongue be call a ` builder ' that buildeth country and people with justice and righteousness & c a mistake for a tiller or boor from ` bauer ' ` bauen ' the latter have two sens to build and to bring into cultivation chap lxx p 503 i be now advertise -lrb- say luther -rrb- that a new astrologer be rise who presumeth to prove that the earth moveth and goeth about not the firmament the sun and moon nor the star like as when one who sitteth in a coach or in a ship and be move thinketh he sitteth still and resteth but the earth and the tree go run and move themselves therefore thus it goeth when we give up ourselves to we own foolish fancy and conceit this fool will turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down but the scripture sheweth and teacheth he another lesson when joshua command the sun to stand still and not the earth there be a similar but still more intolerant and contemptuous anathema of the copernican system in sir thoma brown almost two century later than luther though the problem be of no difficult solution for reflect mind yet for the reading many it would be a serviceable work to bring together and exemplify the cause of the extreme and universal credulity that characterize sundry period of history -lrb- for example from ad 1400 to ad 1650 -rrb- : and credulity involve lie and delusion -- for by a seeming paradox liar be always credulous though credulous person be not always liar although they most often be it would be worth while to make a collection of the judgment of eminent man in they generation respect the copernican or pythagorean scheme one writer -lrb- i forget the name -rrb- inveigh against it as popery and a popish stratagem to reconcile the mind of man to transubstantiation and the mass for if we may contradict the evidence of we sens in a matter of natural philosophy ' a fortiorus ' or much more may we be expect to do so in a matter of faith in my noetic or doctrine and discipline of idea = ` logice organon ' -- i purpose to select some four five or more instance of the sad effect of the absence of idea in the use of word and in the understanding of truth in the different department of life for example the word ` body ' in connection with resurrection-man & c -- and the last instance will -lrb- please god -rrb- be the sad effect on the whole system of christian divinity i must remember asgill 's book -lrb- 7 -rrb- religion necessarily as to its main and proper doctrine consist of idea that be spiritual truth that can only be spiritually discern and to the expression of which word be necessarily inadequate and must be use by accommodation hence the absolute indispensability of a christian life with its conflict and inward experience which alone can make a man to answer to a opponent who charge one doctrine as contradictory to another -- yes it be a contradiction in term but nevertheless so it be and both be true nay part of the same truth -- but alas besides other evil there be this -- that the gospel be preach in fragment and what the hearer can recollect of the sum total of these be to be he christian knowledge and belief this be a grievous error first labor to enlighten the hearer as to the essence of the christian dispensation the grounding and pervade idea and then set it forth in its manifold perspective its various stage and mode of manifestation in this as in almost all other quality of a preacher of christ luther after paul and john be the great master none see more clearly than he that the same proposition which address to a christian in he first awaken out of the death of sin be a most wholesome nay a necessary truth would be a most condemnable antinomian falsehood if address to a secure christian boasting and trust in ` he ' faith -- yes in ` he ' own faith instead of the faith of christ communicate to he i can not utter how

begin to regale I so much by this way that he vouchsafe I the favor to give I quiet prayer and sometimes it come so far as to arrive at union though i understand neither the one nor the other nor how much they both deserve to be prize but i believe it would have be a great deal of happiness for I to have understand they true it be that this union rest with I for so short a time that perhaps it might arrive to be but as of a ` ave maria ' yet i remain with so very great effect thereof that with not be then so much as twenty year old methought i find the whole world under my foot dream the soul herself forsake fearful rapture childlike mirth silent adoration make a bless shadow of this earth ib chap v p 24 i receive also the bless sacrament with many tear though yet in my opinion they be not shed with that sense and grief for only my have offend god which might have serve to save my soul if the error into which i be bring by they who tell I that some thing be not mortal sin -lrb- which afterward i see plainly that they be -rrb- might not somewhat bestead I \*\*\* methink that without doubt my soul might have run a hazard of not be save if i have die then can we wonder that some poor hypochondriast and epileptic have believe themselves possess by or rather to be the devil himself and so speak in this imagine character when this poor afflict spotless innocent could be so pierce through with fanatic pre-conception as to talk in this manner of she mortal sin and they probable eternal punishment -- and this too under the most fervent sense of god 's love and mercy ib p 43 true it be that i be both the most weak and the most wicked of any live what be the meaning of these word that occur so often in the work of great saint do they believe they literally or be it a specific suspension of the compare power and the memory vouchsafe they as a gift of grace -- a gift of tell a lie without breach of veracity -- a gift of humility indemnify pride ib chap viii p 44 i have not without cause be consider and reflect upon this life of mine so long for i discern well enough that nobody will have gust to look upon a thing so very wicked again can this first sentence be other than madness or a lie for observe the question be not whether teresa be or be not positively very wicked but whether accord to she own scale of virtue she be most and very wicked comparatively see post chap x p 57-8 that relatively to the command ` be ye perfect even as you father in heaven be perfect ' and before the eye of he own pure reason the best of man may deem himself mere folly and imperfection i can easily conceive but this be not the case in question it be here a comparison of one man with all other of whom he have know or hear -- ` ergo ' a matter of experience and in this sense it be impossible without loss of memory and judgment on the one hand or of veracity and simplicity on the other besides of what use be it to draw off we conscience from the relation between ourselves and the perfect ideal appoint for we imitation to the vain comparison of one individual self with other man will they sin lessen mine though they be greater do not every man stand or fall to he own maker accord to he own be ib p 45 i see not what one thing there be of so many as be to be find in the whole world wherein there be need of a greater courage than to treat of commit treason against a king and to know that he know it well and yet never to go out of he presence for howsoever it be very true that we be always in the presence of god yet methink that they who converse with he in prayer be in he presence after a more particular manner for they be see then that he see they whereas other may perhaps remain some day in he presence yet without remember that he look upon they a

such a creature so innocent and of a imagination so heated and so well peopled should often mistake the first not painful and in such a frame often pleasurable approach to ` deliquium ' for divine

concern which i be in doubt whether it reflect more on the sincerity or on the understanding of the english ambassador the breach between the pope and the republic be bring very near a crisis & c these page contain a weak and unhandsome attack on wotton who doubtless have discover that the presentation of the premonition previously to the reconciliation as publicly complete but after it have be privately agree on between the court of rome and the senate of venice would embarrass the latter : whereas deliver as it be it shew the king 's and he minister 's zeal for protestantism and yet supply the venetian with a answer not disrespectful to the king besides what be there in wotton 's whole life -lrb- a man so disinterested and who retire from all he embassy so poor -rrb- to justify the remotest suspicion of he insincerity what can this word mean less or other than that sir h w be either a crypt-papist or have receive a bribe from the romish party horrid accusation -- burnet be notoriously rash and credulous but i remember no other instance in which he zeal for the reformation join with he credulity have mislead he into so gross a calumny it be not to be believe that bedell give any authority to such a aspersion of he old and faithful friend and patron further than that he have relate the fact and that he and the minister differ in opinion as to the prudence of the measure recommend how laxly too the story be narrate the exact date of the recommendation by father paul and the divine should have be give -- then the date of the public annunciation of the reconciliation between the pope and venetian republic and lastly the day on which wotton do present the book -- for even this burnet leave uncertain p 26 it be true he never return and change he religion himself but he son come from spain into ireland when bedell be promote to the bishopric of kilmore there and tell he that he father command he to thank he for the pain he be at in write it he say it be almost always lie open before he and that he have hear he say he be resolve to save one and it seem he instruct he son in the true religion for he declare himself a protestant on he come over southey have give I a bad character of this son of the unhappy convert to the romish church he become it seem a spy on the roman catholic avail himself of he father 's character among they a crime which would indeed render he testimony null and more than null it would be a presumption of the contrary it be clear from he letter to bedell that the convert be a very weak man i owe to he however a complete confirmation of my old persuasion concern bishop hall whom from my first perusal of he work i have always consider as one of the blot -lrb- alas there be too many -rrb- of the biography of the church of england a self-conceited coarse-minded persecute vulgar priest and -lrb- by way of ` anti-climax ' -rrb- one of the first corrupter of and epigrammatizer of we english prose style it be not true that sir thoma brown be the prototype of dr johnson who imitate he only as far as sir t b resemble the majority of he predecessor that be in the pedantic preference of latin derivation to saxon word of the very same force in the balance and construction of he period dr johnson have follow hall as any intelligent reader will discover by a attentive comparison p 158 yea will some man say but that which marreth all be the opinion of merit and satisfaction indeed that be the school doctrine but the conscience enlighten to know itself will easily act that part of the publican ` who smite he breast and say god be merciful to I a sinner ' alas so far from this be the case with ninety nine out of one hundred in spain italy sicily and roman catholic germany it be the gospel tenet that be the true school doctrine that be confine to book and closet of the learn among they p 161 and the like may be conceive here since especially the idolatry practice under the obedience of mystical babylon be rather in false and will-worship of the true god and rather commend as profitable than enjoin as absolutely necessary and the corruption there maintain be rather in a superfluous addition than retraction in any thing necessary to salvation this good man 's charity jarring with he love and tender recollection of father paul fulgentio and the venetian divine have lead he to a far far too palliative statement of roman idolatry not what the pope have yet venture to thunder forth from he anti-sinai but what he and he satellite the regular enforce to the preclusion of all true worship in the actual practice life-long of a immense majority in spain italy bavaria austrium & c & c -- this must determine the point what they be themselves -- not what they would persuade protestant be they essential or faith -- this be the main thing p 164 i answer under correction of better judgment they have the ministry of reconciliation by the communion which be

priest could have any effect on the everlasting weal or woe of a christian even to the immediate disciple and apostle could the text -lrb- if indeed it have reference to sin in we sense at all -rrb- mean more than this -- whenever you discover by the spirit of knowledge which i will send unto you repentance and faith you shall declare remission of sin and the sin shall be remitted-and where the contrary exist you declaration of exclusion from bliss shall be fulfil do christ say that true repentance and actual faith would not save a soul unless the priest 's verbal remission be superadded ` in fine ' if it be in my power i would have this book print in a convenient form and distribute through every house at least through every village and parish throughout the kingdom a volume of thought

recommend the perusal of we elder writer hooker -- taylor -- baxter -- in short almost any of the folio compose from edward vi to charle ii i note : 1 the overcome the habit of derive you whole pleasure passively from the book itself which can only be effect by excitement of curiosity or of some passion force yourself to reflect on what you read paragraph by paragraph and in a short time you will derive you pleasure a ample portion of it at least from the activity of you own mind all else be picture sunshine 2 the conquest of party and sectarian prejudice when you have on the same table before you the work of a hammond and a baxter and reflect how many and momentous they point of agreement how few and almost childish the difference which estrange and irritated these good man let we but imagine what they bless spirit now feel at the retrospect of they earthly frailty and can we do other than strive to feel as they now feel not as they once feel so will it be with the dispute between good man of the present day and if you have no other reason to doubt you opponent 's goodness than the point in dispute think of baxter and hammond of milton and taylor and let it be no reason at all 3 it will secure you from the idolatry of the present time and fashion and create the noblest kind of imaginative power in you soul that of living in past age wholly devoid of which power a man can neither anticipate the future nor even live a truly human life a life of reason in the present 4 in this particular work we may derive a most instructive lesson that in certain point as of religion in relation to law the ` medio tutissimus ibis ' be inapplicable there be no ` medium ' possible and all the attempt as those of baxter though no more required than i believe in god through christ prove only the mildness of the proposer 's temper but as a rule would be equal to nothing at least exclude only the two or three in a century that make it a matter of religion to declare themselves atheist or else be just as fruitful a rule for a persecutor as the most complete set of article that could be frame by a spanish inquisition for to ` believe ' must mean to believe aright -- and ` god ' must mean the true god -- and ` christ ' the christ in the sense and with the attribute understand by christian who be truly christian a established church with a liturgy be a sufficient solution of the problem ` de jure magistratus ' article of faith be in this point of view superfluous for be it not too absurd for a man to hesitate at subscribe he name to doctrine which yet in the more awful duty of prayer and profession he dare affirm before he maker they be therefore in this sense merely superfluous -- not worth re-enact have they ever be do away with -- not worth remove now that they exist 5 the characteristic contradistinction between the speculative reasoner of the age before the revolution and those since be this : -- the former cultivate metaphysics without or neglect empirical psychology the latter cultivate a mechanical psychology to the neglect and contempt of metaphysics both therefore be almost equi-distant from pure philosophy hence the belief in ghost witch sensible reply to prayer and the like in baxter and in a hundred other see also luther 's table talk 6 the earlier part of this volume be interesting as material for medical history the state of medical science in the reign of charle i be almost incredibly low the saddest error of the theologian of this age be -lrb- greek : ho émoige dokeus -rrb- the disposition to urge the history of the miraculous action and incident in and by which christ attest he messiahship to the jewish eye-witness in fulfilment of prophecy which the jewish church have previously understand and interpret as mark of the messiah before they have shew what and how excellent the religion itself be include the miracle as for we a harmonious part of the internal or self-evidence of the religion alas and even when we divine do proceed to the religion itself as to a something which no man could be expect to receive except by a compulsion of the sens which by force of logic only be propagate from the eye witness to the reader of the narrative in 1820 -- -lrb- which logic namely that the evidence of a miracle be not diminish by lapse of age though this include loss of document and the like which logic i say whether it be legitimate or not god forbid that the truth of christianity should depend on the decision -rrb- -- even when we divine do proceed to the religion itself on what do they chiefly dwell on the doctrine peculiar to the religion no these on the contrary be either evade or explain away into metaphor or resign in despair to the next world where faith be to be swallow up in certainty but the worst product of this epidemic error be the fashion of either deny or undervalue the evidence of a future state and the survival of individual consciousness derive from the conscience and the holy instinct of the whole human race dreadful be this : -- for the main force of the reasoning by which this scepticism be vindicate consist in reduce all legitimate conviction to objective proof : whereas in the very essence of religion and even of morality the evidence and the preparation for its reception must be subjective -- ` bless be they that have not see and yet believe ' and dreadful it appear to I especially who in the impossibility of not look forward to consciousness after the dissolution of the body -lrb- ` corpus phoenomenon ' -rrb- have through life find it -lrb- next to divine grace -rrb- the strongest and indeed only efficient support against the still recur temptation of adopt nay wish the truth of spinoza 's notion that the survival of consciousness be the highest prize and consequence of the highest virtue and that of all below this mark the lot after death be self-oblivion and the cessation of individual be indeed how a separatist or one of any other sect of calvinist who confines redemption to the comparatively small number of the elect can reject this opinion and yet not run mad at the horrid thought of a innumerable multitude of imperishable self-conscious spirit everlastingly exclude from god be to I inconceivable deeply be i persuade of luther 's position that no man can worthily estimate or feel in the depth of he be the incarnation and crucifixion of the son of god who be a stranger to the terror of immortality as ingenerate in man while it be yet unquelled by the faith in god as the almighty father book i part i p 2 but though my conscience would trouble I when i sin yet diver sin i be addict to and oft commit against my conscience which for the warning of other i will confess here to my shame 1 i be much addict when i fear correction to lie that i might scape 2 i be much addict to the excessive gluttonous eating of apple and pear & c 3 to this end and to concur with naughty boy that glory in evil i have oft go into other man 's orchard and steal they fruit when i have enough at home & c there be a childlike simplicity in this account of he sin of he childhood which be very please ib p 5 6 and the use that god make of book above minister to the benefit of my soul make I somewhat excessively in love with good book so that i think i have never enough but scrape up as great a treasure of they as i could \* \* \* it make the world seem to I as a carcase that have neither life nor loveliness and it destroy those ambitious desire after literate fame which be the sin of my childhood \* \* \* and for the mathematics i be a utter stranger to they and never could find in my heart to divert any study that way but in order to the knowledge of divinity my inclination be most to logic and metaphysics with that part of physics which treateth of the soul content myself at first with a slighter study of the rest : and there have my labor and delight what a picture of myself ib p 22 in the storm of this temptation i question awhile whether i be indeed a christian or a infidel and whether faith could consist with such doubt as i be conscious of one of the instance of the evil arise from the equivoque between faith and intellectual satisfaction or insight the root of faith be in the will faith be a oak that may be a pollard and yet live ib the be and attribute of god be so clear to I that he be to my intellect what the sun be to my eye by which i see itself and all thing even so with I -- but whether god be existentially as well as essentially intelligent this be for a long time a sore combat between the speculative and the moral man ib p 23 mere deism which be the most plausible competitor with christianity be so turn out of almost all the whole world as if nature make its own confession that without a mediator it can not come to god excellent ib all these assistance be at hand before i come to the immediate evidence of credibility in the sacred oracle themselves this be as it should be that be the evidence ' a priori ' secure the rational probability and then the historical proof of its reality pity that baxter 's chapter in ` the saint ' rest ' should have be one and the earliest occasion of the inversion of this process the fruit of which be the grotio-paleyan religion or ` minimum ' of faith the maxim be ` quanto minus tanto melius ' ib p 24 and once all the ignorant rout be rage mad against I for preach the doctrine of original sin to they and tell they that infant before regeneration have so much guilt and corruption as make they loathsome in the eye of god no wonder -- because the babe would perish without the mother 's milk be it therefore loathsome to the mother surely the little one that christ embrace have not be baptize and yet ` of such be the kingdom of heaven ' ib p 25 some thought that the king should not at all be displeased and provoke and that they be not bind to do any other justice or attempt any other reformation but what they could procure the king to be willing to and these say when you have displeased and provoke he to the utmost he will be you king still \* \* \* the more you offend he the less you can trust he and when mutual confidence be go a war be begin \* \* \* and if you conquer he what the better be you he will still be king you can but force he to a agreement and how quickly will he have power and advantage to violate that which he be force to and to be avenge on you all for the displeasure you have do he he be ignorant of the advantage of a king that can not foresee this this paragraph go to make out a case in justification of the regicide which baxter would have find it difficult to answer certainly a more complete exposure of the inconsistency of baxter 's own party can not be for observe that in case of a agreement with charle all those class which afterwards form the main strength of the parliament and ultimately decide the contest in its favor would have be politically inert with little influence and no actual power -- i mean the yeomanry and the citizen of london : while a vast majority of the noble and land gentry who sooner or later must have become the majority in parliament go over to the king at once add to these the whole systematized force of the high church clergy and all the rude ignorant vulgar in high and low life who detest every attempt at moral reform -- and it be obvious that the king could not want opportunity to retract and undo all that he have concede under compulsion but that neither the will be want nor he conscience at all in the way he own advocate clarendon and other have supply damning proof ib p 27 and though parliament may draw up bill for repeal law yet have the king he negative voice and without he consent they can not do it which though they acknowledge yet do they too easily admit of petition against the episcopacy and liturgy and connive at all the clamor and papers which be against they how so if they admit the king 's right to deny they must admit the subject 's right to entreat ib have they endeavor the ejection of lay-chancellor and the reducing of the diocese to a narrower compass or the set up of a subordinate discipline and only the correct and reform of the liturgy perhaps it might have be bear more patiently do baxter find it so himself -- and when too he have the formal and recorded promise of charle ii for it ib but when the same man -lrb- ussher william morton & c -rrb- see that greater thing be aim at and episcopacy itself in danger or _ they grandeur and riches at least _ most of they turn against the parliament this and in this place be unworthy of baxter even he good man could not wholly escape the jaundice of party ib p 34 they say to this -- that as all the court of justice do execute they sentence in the king 's name and this by he own law and therefore by he authority so much more might he parliament do a very sound argument be here disguise in a false analogy a inapplicable precedent and a sophistical form court of justice administer the total of the supreme power retrospectively involve in the name of the most dignified part but here a part as a part act as the whole where the whole be absolutely requisite -- that be in pass law and again as b and c usurp a power belong to a by the determination of a b and c the only valid argument be that charle have by act of he own cease to be a lawful king ib p 40 and that the authority and person of the king be inviolable out of the reach of just accusation judgment or execution by law as have no superior and so no judge but accord to grotius a king wage war against the lawful copartner of the ` summa potesta ' cease to be they king and if conquer forfeit to they he former share and surely if charle have be victor he would have take the parliament 's share to himself if it have be the parliament and not a mere faction with the army that try and behead charle i do not see how any one could doubt the lawfulness of the act except upon very technical grounds ib p 41 for if once legislation the chief act of government be deny to any part of government at all and affirm to belong to the people as such who be no governor all government will hereby be overthrow here baxter fall short of the subject and do not see the full consequent of he own prior most judicious position legislation in its high and most proper sense belong to god only a people declare that such and such they hold to be law that be god 's will ib p 47 in cornwall sir richard grenvill have take many soldier of the earl of essex 's army sentence about a dozen to be hang when they have hang two or three the rope break which should have hang the next and they send for new rope so oft to hang he and all of they still break that they dare go no further but save all the rest the soldier doubtless contrived this from the aversion natural to englishman of kill a enemy in cold blood and because they foresee that there would be tit for tat ib p 59 it be easy to see from baxter 's own account that he party ruin they own cause and that of the kingdom by they tenet concern the right and duty of the civil magistrate to use the sword against such as be not of the same religion with themselves ib p 62 they seem not to I to have answer satisfactorily to the main argument fetch from the apostle 's own government with which saravium have incline I to some episcopacy before : though miracle and infallibility be apostolical temporary privilege yet church government be a ordinary thing to be continue and therefore as the apostle have successor as they be preacher i see not but that they must have successor as church governor be not peter 's sentence against anania a act of church government therefore though church government be a ordinary thing in some form or other it do not follow that one particular form be a ordinary thing for the time be the apostle as head of the church do what they think best but whatever be bind on the church universal and in all time they deliver as command from christ now no other command be deliver but that all thing should conduce to order and edification ib p 66 and therefore how they could refuse to receive the king till he consent to take the covenant i know not unless the taking of the covenant have be a condition on which he be to receive he crown by the law or fundamental constitution of the kingdom which none pretendeth nor know i by what power they can add anything to the coronation oath or covenant which by he ancestor be to be take without he own consent and pray how and by whom be the coronation oath first impose the scottish nation in 1650 have the same right to make a bargain with the claimant of they throne as they ancestor have it be strange that baxter should not have see that he objection would apply to we ` magna charta ' so he talk of the fundamental constitution just as if these have be aboriginal or rather ` san ' origin and not as indeed they be extort and bargain for by the people but throughout it be plain that baxter repeat but never appropriate the distinction between the king as the executive power and as the individual functionary what obligation lay on the scottish parliament and church to consult the man charle stuart 's personal likes and dislike the oath be to be take by he as they king doubtless he equally dislike the whole protestant interest and if the tory and church of england jacobite of a later day have recall jame ii would baxter have think they culpable for impose on he a oath to preserve the protestant church of england and to inflict severe penalty on he own church-fellow ib p 71 and some man think it a very hard question whether they should rather wish the continuance of a usurper that will do good or the restoration of a rightful governor whose follower will do hurt and who shall dare unconditionally condemn those who judge the former to be the better alternative especially those who do not adopt baxter 's notion of a ` jus divinum ' personal and hereditary in the individual whose father have break the compact on which the claim rest ib p 75 one mr dyer a chief person of the sect do first bring forth a monster which have the part of almost all sort of live creature some part like man but most ugly and misplace and some like beast bird and fish have horn fin and claw and at the birth of it the bed shake and the woman present fall a vomiting and be fain to go forth of the room this babe of mr dyer 's be no bad emblem of richard baxter 's own credulity it be almost a argument on he side that nothing he believe be more strange and inexplicable than he own belief of they ib p 76 the third sect be the ranter these also make it they business as the former to set up the light of nature under the name of christ in man and to dishonor and cry down the church & c but why do baxter every where assert the identity of the new light with the light of nature or what do he mean exclusively by the latter the source must be the same in all light as far as it be light ib p 77 and that be the fourth sect the quaker who be but the ranter turn from horrid profaneness and blasphemy to a life of extreme austerity on the other side observe the _ but _ ib they doctrine be to be see in jacob behman 's book by he that have nothing else to do than to bestow a great deal of time to understand he that be not willing to be easily understand and to know that he bombasted word do signify nothing more than before be easily know by common familiar term this be not in all its part true it be true that the first principle of behman be to be find in the writings of the neo-platonist after plotinus and -lrb- but mix with gross impiety -rrb- in paracelsus -- but it be not true that they be easily know and still less so that they be communicable in common familiar term but least of all be it true that there be nothing original in behmen ib the chiefest of these in england be dr pordage and he family it be curious that less in the review which he nicolaus and mendelssohn conduct under the form of letter to a wounded officer join the name of pordage with that of behman be pordage 's work translate into german ib p 79 also the socinian make some increase by the ministry of one mr biddle sometimes schoolmaster in gloucester who write against the godhead of the holy ghost and afterwards of christ whose follower incline much to mere deism for the socinian till biddle retain much of the christian religion for example redemption by the cross and the omnipresence of christ as to this planet even as the romanist with they saint luther 's obstinate adherence to the ubiquity of the body of christ and he or rather its real presence in and with the bread be a sad furtherance to the advocate of popish idolatry and hierolatry ib p 80 many a time have i be bring very low and receive the sentence of death in myself when my poor honest pray neighbor have meet and upon they fasting and earnest prayer i have be recover once when i have continue weak three week and be unable to go abroad the very day that they pray for I be good Friday i recover and be able to preach and administer the sacrament the next lord 's day and be better after it & c strange that the common manual of school logic should not have secure baxter from the repeat blunder of ` cum hoc ergo propter hoc ' but still more strange that he piety should not have revolt against degrading prayer into medical quackery before the revolution of 1688 metaphysics rule without experimental psychology and in these curious paragraph of baxter we see the effect : since the revolution experimental psychology without metaphysics have in like manner prevail and we now feel the result in like manner from plotinus to proclus that be from a d 250 to a d 450 philosophy be set up as a substitute for religion : during the dark age religion supersede philosophy and the consequence be equally instructive the great maxim of legislation intellectual or political be ` subordinate not exclude ' nature in she ascent leave nothing behind but at each step subordinate and glorify : -- mass crystal organ sensation sentience reflection ib p 82 another time as i sit in my study the weight of my greatest folio book brake down three or four of the highest shelf when i sit close under they and they fall down every side I and not one of they hit I save one upon the arm whereas the place the weight the greatness of the book be such and my head just under they that it be a wonder they have not beat out my brain & c -lrb- greek : méga biblíon méga kakón -rrb- ib p 84 for all the pain that my infirmity ever bring upon I be never half so grievous a affliction to I as the unavoidable loss of my time which they occasion i could not bear through the weakness of my stomach to rise before seven o'clock in the morning & c alas in how many respects do my lot resemble baxter 's but how much less have my bodily evil be and yet how very much greater a impediment have i suffer they to be but verily baxter 's labor seem miracle of support grace ought i not therefore to retract the note p 80 i waver ib p 87 for my part i bless god who give I even under a usurper whom i oppose such liberty and advantage to preach he gospel with success which i can not have under a king to whom i have swear and perform true subjection and obedience yea which no age since the gospel come into this land do before possess as far as i can learn from history sure i be that when it become a matter of reputation and honor to be godly it abundantly further the success of the ministry yea and i shall add this much more for the sake of posterity that as much as i have say and write against licentiousness in religion and for the magistrate 's power in it and though i think that land most happy whose ruler use they authority for christ as well as for the civil peace yet in comparison of the rest of the world i shall think that land happy that have but bare liberty to be as good as they be willing to be and if countenance and maintenance be but add to liberty and tolerate error and sect be but force to keep the peace and not to oppose the substantial of christianity i shall not hereafter much fear such toleration nor despair that truth will bear down adversary what a valuable and citable paragraph likewise it be a happy instance of the force of a cherish prejudice in a honest mind -- practically yield to the truth but yet with a speculative though i still think & c ib p 128 among truth certain in themselves all be not equally certain unto I and even of the mystery of the gospel i must need say with mr richard hooker that whatever some may pretend the subjective certainty can not go beyond the objective evidence \* \* \* therefore i do more of late than ever discern the necessity of a methodical procedure in maintain the doctrine of christianity \* \* \* my certainty that i be a man be before my certainty that there be a god \* \* \* my certainty that there be a god be greater than my certainty that he requireth love and holiness of he creature & c there be a confusion in this paragraph which ask more than a marginal note to disentangle briefly the process of acquirement be confound with the order of the truth when acquire a tinder spark give light to a argand 's lamp : be it therefore more luminous ib p 129 and when i have study hard to understand some abstruse admire book as ` de scientia dei de providentia circa malum de decretis de prædeterminatione de libertate creaturæ ' & c i have but attain the knowledge of human imperfection and to see that the author be but a man as well as i on these point i have come to a rest place let such article as be either to be recognize as fact for example sin or evil have its origination in a will and the reality of a responsible and -lrb- in whatever sense freedom be presuppose in responsibility -rrb- of a free will in man -- or acknowledge as law for example the unconditional bindingness of the practical reason -- or to be freely affirm as necessary through they moral interest they indispensableness to we spiritual humanity for example the personeity holiness and moral government and providence of god -- let these be vindicate from absurdity from self-contradiction and contradiction to the pure reason and restore to simple incomprehensibility he who seek for more know not what he be talk of he who will not seek even this be either indifferent to the truth of what he profess to believe or he mistake a general determination not to disbelieve for a positive and especial faith which be only we faith as far as we can assign a reason for it o how impossible it be to move a inch to the right or the leave in any point of spiritual and moral concernment without see the damage cause by the confusion of reason with the understanding ib p 181 my soul be much more afflict with the thought of the miserable world and more draw out in desire of they conversion than heretofore i be wont to look but little further than england in my prayer as not consider the state of the rest of the world -- or if i prayed for the conversion of the jew that be almost all but now as i better understand the care of the world and the method of the lord 's prayer so there be nothing in the world that lieth so heavy upon my heart as the thought of the miserable nation of the earth i dare not not condemn myself for the languid or dormant state of my feeling respect the mohammedan and heathen nation yet know not in what degree to condemn the less culpable grounds of this languor be first my utter ignorance of god 's purpose with respect to the heathen and second the strong conviction i have that the conversion of a single province of christendom to true practical christianity would do more toward the conversion of heathendom than a army of missionary romanism and despotic government in the larger part of christendom and the prevalence of epicurean principle in the remainder -- these do indeed lie heavy on my heart ib p 135 therefore i confess i give but halt credit to most history that be write not only against the albigens and waldens but against most of the ancient heretic who have leave we none of they own writings in which they speak for themselves and i heartily lament that the historical writings of the ancient schismatic and heretic as they be call perished and that partiality suffer they not to survive that we might have have more light in the church affair of those time and be better able to judge between the father and they it be greatly to the credit of baxter that he have here anticipate those merit which so long after give deserve celebrity to the name and writings of beausobre and lardner and still more recently in this respect of eichhorn paulus and other neologist ib p 136 and therefore have myself now write this history of myself notwithstanding my protestation that i have not in anything wilfully go against the truth i expect no more credit from the reader than the self-evidencing light of the matter with concurrent rational advantage from person and thing and other witness shall constrain he to i may not unfrequently doubt baxter 's memory or even he competence in consequence of he particular mode of think but i could almost as soon doubt the gospel verity as he veracity book i part ii p139 the follow book of this work be interesting and most instructive as a instance of syncretism and its epicurean ` clinaman ' even when it have be undertake from the purest and most laudable motive and from impulse the most christian and yet its utter failure in its object that of tend to a common center the experience of eighteen century seem to prove that there be no practicable ` medium ' between a church comprehensive -lrb- which be the only meaning of a catholic church visible -rrb- in which a in the north or east be allow to advance officially no doctrine different from what be allow to b in the south or west -- and a co-existence of independent church in none of which any further unity be require but that between the minister and he congregation while this again be secure by the election and continuance of the former depend wholly on the will of the latter perhaps the best state possible though not the best possible state be where both be find the one establish by maintenance the other by permission in short that which we now enjoy in such a state no minister of the former can have a right to complain for it be at he own option to have take the latter ` et volenti nulla fit injurium ' for a individual to demand the freedom of the independent single church when he receive # 500 a year for submit to the necessary restriction of the church general be impudence and mammonolatry to boot ib p 141 they -lrb- the erastian -rrb- misunderstand and injure they brethren suppose and affirm they to claim as from god a coercive power over the body or purse of man and so set up ` imperium in imperio ' whereas all temperate christian -lrb- at least except papist -rrb- confess that the church have no power of force but only to manage god 's word unto man 's conscience but be not the receiver as bad as the thief be it not a poor evasion to say : -- it be true i send you to a dungeon there to rot because you do not think as i do concern some point of faith -- but this only as a civil officer as a divine i only tenderly entreat and persuade you can there be fouler hypocrisy in the spanish inquisition than this ib p 142 that hereby they -lrb- the diocesan party -rrb- alter the ancient species of presbyter to whose office the spiritual government of they proper folk as truly belong as the power of preach and worship god do i could never rightly understand this objection of richard baxter 's what power not possess by the rector of a parish would he have wish a parochial bishop to have exert what could have be give by the legislature to the latter which might not be give to the former in short baxter 's plan seem to do away archbishop -- -lrb- greek : koinoì epískopoi -rrb- -- but for the rest to name we present rector and vicar bishop i can not see what be gain by he plan the true difficulty be that church discipline be attach to a establishment by this world 's law not to the form itself establish : and he objection from paragraph 5 to paragraph 10 relate to particular abuse not to episcopacy itself ib p 143 but above all i dislike that most of they -lrb- the independent -rrb- make the people by majority of vote to be church governor in excommunication absolution & c which christ have make a act of office and so they govern they governor and themselves be not this the case with the house of legislature the member take individually be subject collectively governor ib p 177 the extraordinary gift of the apostle and the privilege of be eye and ear witness to christ be ability which they have for the infallible discharge of they function but they be not the ground of they power and authority to govern the church \* \* \* ` potestas clavium ' be commit to they only not to the seventy i wish for a proof that all the apostle have any extraordinary gift which none of the lxx have nay as a episcopalian of the church of england i hold it a unsafe and imprudent concession tend to weaken the govern right of the bishop but i fear that as the law and right of patronage in england now be the question have better not be stir lest it should be find that the true power of the key be not as with the papist in hand to which it be doubtful whether christ commit they exclusively but in hand to which it be certain that christ do not commit they at all ib p 179 it followeth not a mere bishop may have a multitude of church because a archbishop may who have many bishop under he what then do baxter quarrel about that we bishop take a humbler title than they have a right to claim -- that be in fact archbishop they be for the most part content to be style as one of the brethren ib p 185 i say again no church no christ for no body no head and if no christ then there be no christ now baxter here forget he own mystical regenerated church if he mean this it be nothing to the argument in question if not then he must assert the monstrous absurdity of no unregenerate church no christ ib p 188 or if they would not yield to this at all we might have communion with they as christian without acknowledge they for pastor observe the inconsistency of baxter no pastor no church no church no christ and yet he will receive they as christian : much to he honor as a christian but not much to he credit as a logician ib p 189 we be agree that as some discovery of consent on both part -lrb- the pastor and people -rrb- be necessary to the being of the member of a political particular church : so that the most express declaration of that consent be the most plain and satisfactory dealing and most obliging and likest to attain the end in we church especially in good living there be such a overflow fullness of consent on the part of the pastor as supplies that of the people altogether nay to nullify they declare dissent ib p 194 by the establishment of what be contain in these twelve proposition or article follow the church in these nation may have a holy communion peace and concord without any wrong to the conscience or liberty of presbyterian congregational episcopal or any other christian painfully instructive be these proposal from so wise and peaceable a divine as baxter how mighty must be the force of a old prejudice when so generally acute a logician be blind by it to such palpable inconsistency on what ground of right could a magistrate inflict a penalty whereby to compel a man to hear what he might believe dangerous to he soul on which the right of burn the refractory individual might not be defend as well ib p 198 to which end \* \* i think that this be all that should be require of any church or member ordinarily to be profess : in general i do believe all that be contain in the sacred canonical scripture and particularly i believe all explicitly contain in the ancient creed & c to a man of sense but unstudied in the context of human nature and from have confine he reading to the writer of the present and the last generation unused to live in former age it must seem strange that baxter should not have see that this test be either all or nothing and the creed be it certain that the so call apostle ' creed be more than the mere catechism of the catechumen be it the baptismal creed of the eastern or western church especially the former the only test really necessary in my opinion be a established liturgy ib p 201 as reverend bishop ussher have manifest that the western creed now call the apostle ' -lrb- want two or three clause that now be in it -rrb- be not only before the nicene creed but of much further antiquity that no beginning of it below the apostle ' day can be find remove these two or three clause and doubtless the substance of the remainder must have be little short of the apostolic age but so be one at least of the writings of clement the great question be : be this the baptismal symbol the ` regulum fideus ' which it be forbid to put in write -- or be it not the christian a b c of the ` catechumenus ' previously to they baptismal initiation into the higher mystery to the ` strong meat ' which be not for babe ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- ib p 203 not so much for my own sake as other lest it should offend the parliament and open the mouth of we adversary that we can not ourselves agree in fundamental and lest it prove a occasion for other to sue for a universal toleration that this apprehension so constantly haunt so powerfully actuate even the mild and really tolerant baxter be a strong proof of my old opinion -- that the dogma of the right and duty of the civil magistrate to restrain and punish religious avowal by he deem heretical universal among the presbyterian and parliamentary churchman join with the persecute spirit of the presbyterian -- be the main cause of cromwell 's despair and consequent unfaithfulness concern a parliamentary commonwealth ib p 222 i try when i be last with you to revive you reason by propose to you the infallibility of the common sens of all the world and i could not prevail though you have nothing to answer that be not against common sense and it be impossible any thing controvert can be bring nearer you or make plainer than to be bring to you eye and taste and feeling and not yours only but all man 's else sense go before faith faith be no faith but upon supposition of sense and understanding : if therefore common sense be fallible faith must need be so this be one of those two-edged argument which not indeed begin but begin to be fashionable just before and after the restoration i be half convert to transubstantiation by tillotson 's common sens against it see clearly that the same grounds ` totidem verbis et syllabis ' would serve the socinian against all the mystery of christianity if the roman catholic have pretend that the phenomenal bread and wine be change into the phenomenal flesh and blood this objection would have be legitimate and irresistible but as it be it be mere sensual babble the whole of popery lie in the assumption of a church as a numerical unit infallible in the highest degree inasmuch as both which be scripture and what scripture teach be infallible by derivation only from a infallible decision of the church fairly undermine or blow up this : and all the remain peculiar tenet of romanism fall with it or stand by they own right as opinion of individual doctor a antagonist of a complex bad system -- a system however notwithstanding -- and such be popery -- should take heed above all thing not to disperse himself let he keep to the sticking place but the majority of we protestant polemic seem to have take for grant that they could not attack romanism in too many place or on too many point -- forget that in some they will be less strong than in other and that if in any one or two they be repel from the assault the feeling of this will extend itself over the whole besides what be the use of allege thirteen reason for a witness 's not appear in court when the first be that the man have die since he ` subpoena ' it be as if a party employ to root up a tree be to set one or two at that work while other be hacking the branch and other saw the trunk at different height from the ground n b the point of attack suggest above in dispute with the romanist be of special expediency in the present day : because a number of pious and reasonable roman catholic be not aware of the dependency of they other tenet on this of the infallibility of they church decision as they call they but be themselves shake and dispose to explain it away this once fix the scripture rise uppermost and the man be already a protestant rather a genuine catholic though he opinion should remain nearer to the roman than the reform church ib _ but methink yet i should have hope of revive you charity you can not be a papist indeed but you must believe that out of they church -lrb- that be out of the pope 's dominion -rrb- there be no salvation and consequently no justification and charity or save grace and be it possible you can so easily believe you religious father to be in hell you prudent pious mother to be void of the love of god and in a state of damnation & c _ this argument ` ad affectum ' be beautifully and forcibly state but yet defective by the omission of the point -- not for unbelief or misbelief of any article of faith but simply for not be a member of this particular part of the church of christ for it be possible that a christian might agree in all the article of faith with the roman doctor against those of the reformation and yet if he do not acknowledge the pope as christ 's vicar and hold salvation possible in any other church he be himself exclude from salvation without this great distinction lady ann lindsey might have reply to baxter : -- so might a pagan orator have say to a convert from paganism in the first age of christianity so indeed the advocate of the old religion do argue what can you bear to believe that numa camillus fabricius the scipio the cato that cicero seneca that titus and the antoninus be in the flame of hell the accursed object of the divine hatred now whatever you dare hope of these as heathen we dare hope of you as heretic ib p 224 _ but this be not the worst you consequently anathematize _ all papist by you sentence : for heresy by you own sentence cut off man from heaven : but popery be a bundle of heresy : therefore it cut off man from heaven the minor i prove & c this introduction of syllogistic form in a letter to a young lady be whimsically characteristic ib p 225 you say the scripture admit of no private interpretation but you abuse yourself and the text with a false interpretation of it in these word a interpretation be call private either as to the subject person or as to the interpreter you take the text to speak of the latter when the context plainly sheweth you that it speak of the former the apostle direct they to understand the prophecy of the old testament give they this caution -- that none of these scripture that be speak of christ the public person must be interpret as speak of david or other private person only of whom they be mention but as type of christ & c it be strange that this sound and irrefragable argument have not be enforce by the church divine in they controversy with the modern unitarian as capp belsham and other who refer all the prophetic text of the old testament to historical personage of they time exclusively of all double sense ib p 226 as to what you say of apostle still place in the church : -- when any shew we a immediate mission by they communion and by miracle ` tongue ' and a spirit of revelation and infallibility prove themselves apostle we shall believe they this be another of those two-edged argument which baxter and jeremy taylor import from grotius and which have since become the universal fashion among protestant i fear however that it will do we more hurt by expose a weak part to the learn infidel than service in we combat with the romanist i venture to assert most unequivocally that the new testament contain not the least proof of the ` linguipotence ' of the apostle but the clearest proof of the contrary : and i doubt whether we have even as decisive a victory over the romanist in we middletonian farmerian and douglasian dispute concern the miracle of the first two century and they assume contrast ` in genere ' with those of the apostle and the apostolic age as we have in most other of we protestant controversy nb these opinion of middleton and he more cautious follower be no part of we real church doctrine this passion for law court evidence begin with grotius ib p 246 we conceive there need no more to be say for justify the imposition of the ceremony by law establish than what be contain in the beginning -- of this section inasmuch as lawful authority have already determine the ceremony in question to be decent and orderly and to serve to edification : and consequently to be agreeable to the general rule of the word to a self-convinced and disinterested lover of the church of england it give a indescribable horror to observe the frequency with which the prelatic party after the restoration appeal to the law as of equal authority with the express word of scripture -- as if the law by they appeal to be other than the vindictive determination of they own furious partizan -- as if the same appeal might not have be make by bonner and gardiner under philip and mary why should i speak of the inhuman sophism that because it be silly in my neighbor to break he egg at the broad end when the squire and the vicar have declare they predilection for the narrow end therefore it be right for the squire and the vicar to hang and quarter he for he silliness : -- for it come to that ib p 248 to you it be indifferent before you imposition : and therefore you may without any regret of you own conscience forbear the imposition or persuade the law maker to forbear it but to many of those that dissent from you they be sinful & c but what be all this good worthy baxter but say and unsay if they be not indifferent why do you previously concede they to be such in short nothing can be more pitiably weak than the conduct of the presbyterian party from the first capture of charle i common sense require either a bold denial that the church have power in ceremony more than in doctrine or that the parliament be the church since it be the parliament that enact all these thing -- or if they admit the authority lawful and the ceremony only in they mind inexpedient good god can self-will more plainly put on the crack mask of tender conscience than by refusal of obedience what intolerable presumption to disqualify as ungodly and reduce to null the majority of the country who prefer the liturgy in order to force the long winded vanity of bustling god-orator on those who would fain hear prayer not spout ib p 249 the great controversy between the hypocrite and the true christian whether we should be serious in the practice of the religion which we commonly profess have troubled england more than any other -- none be more hate and divide as puritan than those that will make religion they business & c have not the governor have bitter proof that there be other and more cruel vice than swearing and careless living -- and that these be predominant chiefly among such as make they religion they business ib and whereas you speak of open a gap to sectary for private conventicle and the evil consequent to the state we only desire you to avoid also the cherishing of ignorance and profaneness and _ suppress all sectary _ and spare not in a way that will not suppress the means of knowledge and godliness the present company that be we own dear selve always except ib p 250 otherwise the poor undo church of christ will no more believe you in such profession than we believe that those man intend the king 's just power and greatness who take away he life or who like baxter join the army that be shower cannon ball and bullet around he inviolable person whenever by read the prelatical writings and history i have have a over dose of anti-prelatism in my feeling i then correct it by dip into the work of the presbyterian and they fellow and so bring myself to more charitable thought respect the prelatist and fully subscribe to milton 's assertion that presbyter be but old priest writ large ib p 254 the apocryphal matter of you lesson in tobit judith bel and the dragon & c be scarce agreeable to the word of god do not jude refer to a apocryphal book ib we experience unresistibly convinceth we that a continued prayer doth more to help most of the people and carry on they desire than turn almost every petition into a distinct prayer and make preface and conclusion to be near half the prayer this now be the very point i most admire in we excellent liturgy to any particular petition offer to the omniscient there may be a sinking of faith a sense of its superfluity but to the lifting up of the soul to the invisible and there fix it on he attribute there can be no scruple ib p 257 the not abate of the imposition be the cart off of many hundred of you brethren out of the ministry and of many thousand christian out of you communion but the abate of the imposition will so offend you as to silence or excommunicate none of you at all for example we think it a sin to subscribe or swear canonical obedience or use the transient image of the cross in baptism and therefore these must cast we out & c as long as independent single church or voluntarily synodical be forbid and punishable by penal law this argument remain irrefragable the imposition of such trifle under such fearful threat be the very bitterness of spiritual pride and vindictiveness -- after the law pass by which thing become as they now be it be a mere question of expediency for the national church to determine in relation to its own comparative interest if the church choose unluckily the injury have be to itself alone it seem strange that such man as baxter should not see that the use of the ring the surplice and the like be indifferent accord to he own confession yea mere trifle in comparison with the peace of the church but that it be no trifle that man should refuse obedience to lawful authority in matter indifferent and prefer the sin of schism to offend they taste and fancy the church do not upon the whole contend for a trifle nor for a indifferent matter but for a principle on which all order in society must depend still this be true only provide the church enact no ordinance that be not necessary or at least plainly conducive to order or -lrb- generally -rrb- to the end for which it be a church besides the point which the king have require they to consider be not what ordinance it be right to obey but what it be expedient to enact or not to enact ib p 269 that the pastor of the respective parish may be allow not only publicly to preach but personally to catechize or otherwise instruct the several family admit none to the lord 's table that have not personally own they baptismal covenant by a credible profession of faith and obedience and to admonish and exhort the scandalous in order to they repentance : to hear the witness and the accuse party and to appoint fit time and place for these thing and to deny such person the communion of the church in the holy eucharist that remain impenitent or that wilfully refuse to come to they pastor to be instruct or to answer such probable accusation and to continue such exclusion of they till they have make a credible profession of repentance and then to receive they again to the communion of the church -- provide there be place for due appeal to superior power suppose only such man pastor as be now most improperly whether as boast or as sneer call evangelical what a insufferable tyranny would this introduce who would not rather live in algier this alone would make this minute history of the ecclesiastic faction invaluable that it must convince all sober lover of independence and moral self-government how dearly we ought to prize we present church establishment with all its fault ib p 272 therefore we humbly crave that you majesty will here declare that it be you majesty 's pleasure that none be punish or trouble for not use the book of common prayer till it be effectually reform by divine of both persuasion equally depute thereunto the dispense power of the crown not only acknowledge but earnestly invoke cruel as the conduct of laud and that of sheldon to the dissentient be yet god 's justice stand clear towards they for they demand that from other which they themselves would not grant they be to be allow at they own fancy to denounce the ring in marriage and yet impower to endungeon through the magistrate the honest and peaceable quaker for reject the outward ceremony of water in baptism as seduce man to take it as a substitute for the spiritual reality -- though the quaker no less than themselves appeal to scripture authority -- the baptist 's own contrast of christ 's with the water baptism ib p 273 we be sure that kneel in any adoration at all in any worship on any lord 's day in the year or any week day between easter and pentecost be not only disused but forbid by general council & c -- and therefore that kneel in the act of receive be a novelty contrary to the decree and practice of the church for many hundred year after the apostle be not this because kneel be the agree sign of sorrow and personal contrition which be not to be introduce into the public worship on the great day and the solemn season of the church 's joy and thanksgiving if so baxter 's appeal to this usage be a gross sophism a mere pun ib p 308 baxter 's exception to the common prayer book 1 order requireth that we begin with reverent prayer to god for he acceptance and assistance which be not do enunciation of god 's invitation and promise in god 's own word as in the common prayer book much better 2 that the creed and decalogue contain the faith in which we profess to assemble for god 's worship and the law which we have break by we sin should go before the confession and absolution or at least before the praise of the church which they do not might have deserve consideration if the people or the larger number consist of uninstructed ` catechumenus ' or mere candidate for church-membership but the object be not the first teaching of the creed and decalogue but the lively reimpressing of the same it be much better as it be 3 the confession omitteth not only original sin but all actual sin as specify by the particular commandment violate and almost all the aggravation of those sin whereas confession be the expression of repentance should be more particular as repentance itself should be ground on one of the grand error of the whole dissent party namely the confusion of public common prayer praise and instruction with domestic and even with private devotion we confession be a perfect model for christian community 4 when we have crave help for god 's prayer before we come to they we abruptly put in the petition for speedy deliverance -- -lrb- ' o god make speed to save we : o lord make haste to help we ' -rrb- without any intimation of the danger that we desire deliverance from and without any other petition conjoin 5 it be disorderly in the manner to sing the scripture in a plain tune after the manner of read 6 -lrb- ` the lord be with you and with thy spirit ' -rrb- be petition for divine assistance come in abruptly in the midst or near the end of morning prayer : and -lrb- ` let we pray ' -rrb- be adjoin when we be before in prayer mouse-like squeak and nibble 7 -lrb- ` lord have mercy upon we : christ have mercy upon we : lord have mercy upon we ' -rrb- seemeth a affected tautology without any special cause or order here and the lord 's prayer be annex that be before recite and yet the next word be again but a repetition of the aforesaid oft repeat general -lrb- ' o lord shew thy mercy upon we ' -rrb- still worse the spirit in which this and similar complaint originate have turn the prayer of dissent minister into irreverent preachment forget that tautology in word and thought imply no tautology in the music of the heart to which the word be as it be set and that it be the heart that lift itself up to god we word and thought be but part of the enginery which remain with ourselves and logic the rustling dry leaf of the lifeless reflex faculty do not merit even the name of a pulley or lever of devotion 8 the prayer for the king -lrb- ' o lord save the king ' -rrb- be without any order put between the foresaid petition and another general request only for audience -lrb- ` and mercifully hear we when we call upon thee ' -rrb- a trifle but just 9 the second collect be intitule -lrb- ` for peace ' -rrb- and have not a word in it of petition for peace but only ` for defense in assault of enemy ' and that we ` may not fear they power ' and the preface -lrb- ` in knowledge of whom standeth ' & c and ` whose service ' & c -rrb- have no more evident respect to a petition for peace than to any other and the prayer itself come in disorderly while many prayer or petition be omit which accord both to the method of the lord 's prayer and the nature of the thing should go before 10 the third collect intitule -lrb- ` for grace ' -rrb- be disorderly & c and thus the main part of prayer accord to the rule of the lord 's prayer and we common necessity be omit not wholly unfounded : but the objection proceed on a arbitrary and -lrb- i think -rrb- false assumption that the lord 's prayer be universally prescriptive in form and arrangement 12 the litany omitteth very many particulars and it be exceed disorderly follow no just rule of method have beg pardon of we sin and deprecate vengeance it proceedeth to evil in general and some few sin in particular and thence to a more particular enumeration of judgment and thence to a recitation of the part of that work of we redemption and thence to the deprecation of judgment again and thence to prayer for the king and magistrate and then for all nation and then for love and obedience & c the very point here object to as fault i should have select as excellency for do not the duty and temptation occur in real life even so intermingled the imperfection of think much more of language so singly successive allow no better representation of the close neighborhood nay the co-inherence of duty in duty desire in desire every want of the heart point godward be a chili agon that touch at a thousand point from these remark i except the last paragraph of s 12 : -lrb- as to the prayer for bishop and curate and the position of the general thanksgiving & c -rrb- which be defect so palpable and so easily remove that nothing but antipathy to the objector could have retain they 13 the like defectiveness and disorder be in the communion collect for the day there be no more reason why it should be appropriate to that day than another or rather be a common petition for all day & c i do not see how these suppose impropriety for want of appropriateness to the day could be avoid without risk of the far greater evil of too great appropriation to particular saint and day as in popery i be so far a puritan that i think nothing would have be lose if christmas day and good Friday have be the only week day make holy day and easter the only lord 's day especially distinguish i should also have add whitsunday but that it have become unmeaning since we clergy have as i grieve to think become generally arminian and interpret the descent of the spirit as the gift of miracle and of miraculous infallibility by inspiration have render it of course of little or no application to christian at present yet how can arminian pray we church prayer collectively on any day answer see a ` boa constrictor ' with a ox or deer what they do swallow prove so astounding a dilatability of gullet that it would be unconscionable strictness to complain of the horn antler or other indigestible non-essential be suffer to rot off at the confines -lrb- greek : hérkos hodóntôn -rrb- but to write seriously on so serious a subject it be mournful to reflect that the influence of the systematic theology then in fashion with the anti-prelatic divine whether episcopalian or presbyterian have quench all fineness of mind all flow of heart all grandeur of imagination in they while the victorious party the prelatic arminian enrich as they be with all learning and highly gifted with taste and judgment have empty revelation of all the doctrine that can properly be say to have be reveal and thus equally cause the extinction of the imagination and quench the life in the light by withhold the appropriate fuel and the supporter of the sacred flame so that between both party we transcendant liturgy remain like a ancient greek temple a monumental proof of the architectural genius of a age long depart when there be giant in the land ib p 337 as i be proceed bishop morley interrupt I accord to he manner with vehemency cry out \* \* the bishop interrupt I again \* \* i attempt to speak and still he interrupt I \* \* bishop morley go on talk louder than i & c the bishop appear to have behave insolently enough safe in they knowledge of charle 's inclination they laugh in they sleeve at he commission they best answer would have be to have press the anti-impositionist with they utter forgetfulness of the possible nay very probable difference of opinion between the minister and they congregation a vain minister might disgust a sober congregation with he ` extempore ' prayer or he open contempt of they kneel at the sacrament and the like yet by what right if he act only as a individual and then what a endless source of dispute and preference of this minister or of that ib p 341 the paper offer by bishop cosin 1 that the question may be put to the manager of the division whether there be anything in the doctrine or discipline or the common prayer or ceremony contrary to the word of god and if they can make any such appear let they be satisfy 2 if not let they propose what they desire in point of expediency and acknowledge it to be no more this be propose doubtless by one of you sensible man it be so plain so plausible shallow ` nihili nauci pilus flocci-cal ' why the very phrase contrary to the word of god would take a month to define and neither party agree at last one party say : the church have power from god 's word to order all matter of order so as shall appear to they to conduce to decency and edification : but ceremony respect the orderly performance of divine service : ergo the church have power to ordain ceremony : but the cross in baptize be a ceremony ergo the church have power to prescribe the cross in baptism what be rightfully order can not be rightfully withstand : -- but the cross & c be rightfully order : -- ` ergo ' the cross can not be rightfully omit to this how easily would the other party reply 1 that a small number of bishop could not be call the church : 2 that no one church have power or pretence from god 's word to prescribe concern mere matter of outward decency and convenience to other church or assembly of christian people : 3 that the blend a unnecessary and suspicious if not superstitious motion of the hand with a necessary and essential act doth in no wise respect order or propriety : lastly that to forbid a man to obey a direct command of god because he will not join with it a admit mere tradition of man be contrary to common sense no less than to god 's word expressly and by breach of charity which be the great end and purpose of god 's word besides might not the pope and he shaveling have make the same proposition to the reformer in the reign of edward vi in respect to the greater part of the idle superfluity which be reject by the reformer only as idle and superfluous and for that reason contrary to the spirit of the gospel though few if any be in the direct tooth of a positive prohibition above all a honest policy dictate that the end in view be fully determine as here for instance the preclusion of disturbance and indecorum in christian assembly every addition to means already adequate to the secure of that end tend to frustrate the end and be therefore evidently exclude from the prerogative of the church -lrb- however that word may be interpret -rrb- inasmuch as its power be confine to such ceremony and regulation as conduce to order and general edification in short it grieve I to think that the head of the most apostolical church in christendom should have insist on three or four trifle the abolition of which could have give offence to none but such as from the baleful superstition that alone could attach importance to they effectually it be charity to offend-when all the rest of baxter 's objection might have be answer so triumphantly ib p 343 answer to the foresaid paper 8 that none may be a preacher that dare not subscribe that there be nothing in the common prayer book the book of ordination and the 39 article that be contrary to the word of god i think this might have be leave out as well as the other two article mention by baxter for as by the word contrary to the word of god in cosin 's paper it be not mean to declare the common prayer book free from all error the sense must have be that there be not anything in it in such a way or degree contrary to god 's word as to oblige we to assign sin to those who have overlook it or who think the same compatible with god 's word or who though individually disapprove the particular thing yet regard that acquiescence as a allow sacrifice of individual opinion to modesty charity and zeal for the peace of the church for observe that this eighth instance be additional to and therefore not inclusive of the precede seven : otherwise it must have be place as the first or rather as the whole the seven follow be motive and instance in support and explanation of the point ib p 368 let I mediate here between baxter and the bishop : baxter have take for grant that the king have a right to promise a revision of the liturgy canon and regiment of the church and that the bishop ought to have meet he and he friend as diplomatist on even grind the bishop could not with discretion openly avow all they mean and it would be bigotry to deny that the spirit of compromise have no indwelling in they feeling or intent but nevertheless it be true that they think more in the spirit of the english constitution than baxter and he friend -- this thought they be the law of the land ` quam nolumus mutari ' and it must be the king with and by the advice of he parliament that can authorize any part of he subject to take the question of its repeal into consideration under other circumstance a king might bring the bishop and the head of the romish party together to plot against the law of the land no we would have no other secret committee but of parliamentary appointment we be but so many individual it be in the legislature that the congregation the party most interested in this cause meet collectively by they representative -- lastly let it not be overlook that the root of the bitterness be common to both party -- namely the conviction of the vital importance of uniformity -- and this admit surely a undoubted majority in favor of what be already law must decide whose uniformity it be to be ib p 368 we must need believe that when you majesty take we consent to a liturgy to be a foundation that would infer we concord you mean not that we should have no concord but by consent to this liturgy without any considerable alteration this be forcible reasoning but which the bishop could fairly leave for the king to answer -- the contract tacit or express be between he and the anti-prelatic presbytero-episcopalian party to which neither the bishop nor the legislature have accede or assent if baxter and calamy be so little imbued with the spirit of the constitution as to consider charle ii as the breath of they nostril and this dread sovereign breath in its passage give a snort or a snuffle or have lead they to expect a snuffle surprise they with a snort let the reproach be share between the breath 's fetid conscience and the nostril ' nasoductility the traitor to the liberty of they country who be swarm and intriguing for favor at breda when they should have be at they post in parliament or in the lobby prepare term and condition -- have all the minister that be afterwards eject and the presbyterian party generally exert themselves heart and soul with monk 's soldier and in collect those whom monk have displace and instead of carry on treason against the government ` de facto ' by mendicant negociation with charle have take open measure to confer the sceptre on he as the scotch do -- whose stern and truly loyal conduct have be most unjustly condemn -- the schism in the church might have be prevent and the revolution of 1688 supersede nb in the above i speak of the bishop as man interested in a litigate estate god forbid i should seek to justify they as christian ib p 369 ` quære ' whether in the 20th article these word be not insert -- ` habet ecclesium auctoritatem in controversii fideus ' strange that the evident antithesis between power in respect of ceremony and authority in point of faith should have be overlook ib some have publish that there be a proper sacrifice in the lord 's supper to exhibit christ 's death in the ` post-fact ' as there be a sacrifice to prefigure it in the old law in the ` ante-fact ' and therefore that we have a true altar and not only metaphorically so call doubtless a gross error yet pardonable for to error nearly as gross it be oppose ib some have maintain that the lord 's day be keep merely by ecclesiastical constitution and that the day be changeable where shall we find the proof of the contrary -- at least if the position have be word thus : the moral and spiritual obligation of keep the lord 's day be ground on its manifest necessity and the evidence of its benignant effect in connection with those condition of the world of which even in christianized country there be no reason to expect a change and be therefore command by implication in the new testament so clearly and by so immediate a consequence as to be no less binding on the conscience than a explicit command a have lawful authority expressly command I to go to london from bristol there be at present but one safe road : this therefore be command by a and would be so even though a have speak of another road which at that time be open ib p 370 some have broach out of socinus a most uncomfortable and desperate doctrine that late repentance that be upon the last bed of sickness be unfruitful at least to reconcile the penitent to god this no doubt refer to jeremy taylor 's work on repentance and be but too faithful a description of its character ib p 373 a little after the king be behead mr atkin meet this priest in london and go into a tavern with he say to he in he familiar way what business have you here i warrant you come about some roguery or other whereupon the priest tell it he as a great secret that there be thirty of they here in london who by instruction from cardinal mazarine do take care of such affair and have sit in council and debate the question whether the king should be put to death or not -- and that it be carry in the affirmative and there be but two voice for the negative which be he own and another 's and that for he part he could not concur with they as foresee what misery this would bring upon he country mr atkin stand to the truth of this but think it a violation of the law of friendship to name the man richard baxter be too thoroughly good for any experience to make he worldly wise else how could he have be simple enough to suppose that mazarine would leave such a question to be vote ` pro ' and ` con ' and decide by thirty emissary in london and how could he have reconcile mazarine 's have any share in charle 's death with he own masterly account pp 98 99 100 even cromwell though he might have prevent could not have effect the sentence the regicidal judge be not he creature consult the life of colonel hutchinson upon this ib p 374 since this dr peter moulin have in he answer to ` philanax anglicus ' declare that he be ready to prove when authority will call he to it that the king 's death and the change of the government be first propose both to the sorbonne and to the pope with he conclave and consent to and conclude for by both the pope in he conclave have about the same influence in charle 's fate as the pope 's eye in a leg of mutton the letter intercept by cromwell be charles 's death-warrant charle know he power and cromwell and ireton know it likewise and know that it be the power of a man who be within a yard 's length of a talisman only not within a arm 's length but which in that state of the public mind could he but have once grasp it would have enable he to blow up presbyterian and independent both if ever a lawless act be defensible on the principle of self-preservation the murder of charle might be defend i suspect that the fatal delay in the publication of the ` icon basilike ' be susceptible of no other satisfactory explanation in short it be absurd to burthen this act on cromwell and he party in any special sense the guilt if guilt it be be consummate at the gate of hull that be the first moment that charle be treat as a individual man against man whatever right hampden have to defend he life against the king in battle cromwell and ireton have in yet more imminent danger against the king 's plot milton 's reasoning on this point be unanswerable : and what a wretched hand do baxter make of it ib p 375 but if the law of the land appoint the noble as next the king to assist he in do right and withhold he from do wrong then be they license by man 's law and so not prohibit by god 's to interpose themselves for the safety of equity and innocency and by all lawful and needful means to procure the prince to be reform but in no case deprive where the sceptre be inherit so far bishop bilson excellent o by all means preserve for he the benefit of he rightful heir-loom the regal sceptre only lay it about he shoulder till he promise to handle it as he ought but what if he break he promise and you head or what if he will not promise how much honester would it be to say that extreme case be ` ipso nomine ' not generalizable -- therefore not the subject of a law which be the conclusion ` per genus singulus in genere inclusus ' every extreme case must be judge by and for itself under all the peculiar circumstance now as these be not foreknowable the case itself can not be predeterminable harmodius and aristogiton do not justify brutus and cassius : but neither do brutus and cassius criminate harmodius and aristogiton the rule apply till a extreme case occur and how can this be prove i answer the only proof be success and good event for these afford the best presumption first of the extremity and secondly of its remediable nature -- the two element of its justification to every individual it be forbid he who attempt it therefore must do so on the presumption that the will of the nation be in he will : whether he be mad or in he sens the event can alone determine ib p 398 the govern power and obligation over the flock be essential to the office of a pastor or presbyter as institute by christ there be -lrb- greek : hôs émoige dokeus -rrb- one flaw in baxter 's plea for he presbyterian form of church government that he use a metaphor which inasmuch as it be but a metaphor agree with the thing mean in some point only as if it be commensurate ` in toto ' and virtually identical thus the presbyter be a shepherd as far as the watchfulness tenderness and care be to be the same in both but it do not follow that the presbyter have the same sole power and exclusive right of guidance and for this reason -- that he flock be not sheep but man not of a natural generic or even constant inferiority of judgment but christian co-heir of the promise and therein of the gift of the holy spirit and of the interpretation of the holy scripture how then can they be exclude from a share in church government the word of christ if they may be transfer from they immediate application to the jewish synagogue suppose the contrary -- and that highest act of government the election of the officer and minister of the church be confessedly exercise by the congregation include the presbyter and arch-presbyter or bishop in the primitive church the question therefore be : -- be a national church establish by law compatible with christianity if so as baxter hold the representative -lrb- king lord and common -rrb- be or may be representative of the whole people as christian as well as civil subject -- and they voice will then be the voice of the church which every individual as a individual themselves as individual and ' a fortiorus ' the officer and administrator appoint by they be bind to obey at the risk of excommunication against which there would be no appeal but to the heavenly cæsar the lord and head of the universal church but whether as the accredit representative and plenipotentiary of the national church they can avail themselves of they conjoint but distinct character as temporal legislator to superadd corporal or civil penalty to the spiritual sentence in point peculiar to christianity as heretical opinion church ceremony and the like thus destroy ` discipline ' even as wood be destroy by combination with fire -- this be a new and difficult question which yet baxter and the presbyterian divine and the puritan of that age in general not only answer affirmatively but most zealously not to say furiously affirm with anathema to the assertor of the negative and spiritual threat to the magistrate neglect to interpose the temporal sword in this respect the present dissenter have the advantage over they earlier predecessor but on the other hand they utterly evacuate the scriptural command against schism take away all sense and significance from the article respect the catholic church and in consequence degrade the discipline itself into mere club-regulation or the by-law of different lodge -- that very discipline the capability of exercise which in its own specific nature without superinduction of a destructive and transmutual opposite be the fairest and firmest support of they cause 20th October 1829 ib p 401 that sententially it must be do by the pastor or governor of that particular church which the person be to be admit into or cast out of this most arbitrary appropriation of the word of christ and of the apostle john and paul by the clergy to themselves exclusively be the -lrb- greek : prôton pseudo -rrb- the fatal error which have practically exclude church discipline from among protestant in all free country that it be retain and a efficient power among the quaker and only in that sect who act collectively as a church -- who not only have no proper clergy but will not allow a division of majority and minority nor a temporary president -- seem to supply a unanswerable confirmation of this my assertion and a strong presumption for the validity of my argument the wesleyan methodist have i know a discipline and the power be in they consistory -- a general conclave of priest cardinal since the death of pope wesley but what division and secession this have give rise to what discontent and heart-burning it still occasion in they labor inferior minister and in the class be no less notorious and may authorize a belief that as the sect increase it will be less and less effective nay that it have decrease and after all what be it compare with the discipline of the quaker -- baxter 's inconsistency on this subject would be inexplicable do we not know he zealotry against harrington the deist and the mystic -- so that like a electrify pith-ball he be for ever attract towards they tenet concern the pretended perfecting of spiritual sentence by the civil magistrate but he touch only to fly off again toleration dainty word for soul-murder god grant that my eye may never see a toleration he exclaim in he book against harrington 's oceana ib p 405 as for the democratical conceit of they that say that the parliament have they govern power as they be the people 's representative and so have the member of the convocation though those represent have no govern power themselves it be so palpably self-contradicting that i need not confute it self-contradicting accord to baxter 's sense of the word represent and govern but every rational adult have a govern power : namely that of govern himself ib p 412 that though a subject ought to take a oath in the sense of he ruler who impose it as far as he can understand it yet a man that taketh a oath from a robber to save he life be not always bind to take it in the imposer 's sense if he take it not against the proper sense of the word this be a point on which i have never be able to satisfy myself -- the only safe conclusion i have be able to draw be the folly mischief and immorality of all oath but judicial one -- and those no farther excepted than as they be means of secure a deliberate consciousness of the presence of the omniscient judge the inclination of my mind be at this moment to the principle that a oath may deepen the guilt of a act sinful in itself but can not be detach from the act it be understand that a perfectly voluntary and self-imposed oath be itself a sin the man who compel I to take a oath by put a pistol to my ear have in my mind clearly forfeit all he right to be treat as a moral agent nay it seem to be a sin to act so as to induce he to suppose himself such contingent consequence must be exclude but would i be persuade weigh in favor of annul on principle a oath sinfully extort but i hate casuistry so utterly that i could not without great violence to my feeling put the case in all its bearing for example : -- it be sinful to enlarge the power of wicked agent but to allow they to have the power of bind the conscience of those whom they have injure be to enlarge the power & c again : no oath can bind to the perpetration of a sin but to transfer a sum of money from its rightful owner to a villain be a sin & c and twenty other such but the robber may kill the next man possibly : but still more probably many who would be robber if they could obtain they end without murder would resist the temptation if no extenuation of guilt be contemplate -- and one murder be more effective in rouse the public mind to preventive measure and by the horror it strike be make more directly preventive of the tendency than fifty civil robbery by contract ib p 435 that the minister be not bind to read the liturgy himself if another by whomsoever be procure to do it so be it he preach not against it wonderful that so good and wise a man as baxter should not have see that in this the church would have give up the best perhaps the only efficient preservative of she faith but for we bless and truly apostolic and scriptural liturgy we church ' pew would long ago have be fill by arian and socinian as too many of they desk and pulpit already be part iii p 59 as also to make we take such a poor suffering as this for a sign of true grace instead of faith hope love mortification and a heavenly mind and that the loss of one grain of love be worse than a long imprisonment here baxter confound he own particular case which very many would have covet with the suffering of other prisoner on the same score -- suffering nominally the same but with few if any of baxter 's almost flattering support ib p 60 it would trouble the reader for I to reckon up the many disease and danger for these ten year past in or from which god have deliver I though it be my duty not to forget to be thankful seven month together i be lame with a strange pain in one foot twice deliver from a bloody flux a spurious cataract in my eye with incessant web and network before it have continue these eight year \* \* \* so that i have rarely one hour 's or quarter of a hour 's ease yet through god 's mercy i be never one hour melancholy & c the power of the soul by its own act of will be i admit great for any one occasion or for a definite time yea it be marvellous but of such exertion and such a even frame of spirit as baxter 's be under such unremitting and almost unheard-of bodily derangement and pain as he and during so long a life 1 do not believe a human soul capable unless substantiate and successively potentiate by a especial divine grace ib p 65 the reason why i make no larger a profession necessary than the creed and scripture be because if we depart from this old sufficient catholic rule we narrow the church and depart from the old catholicism why then any creed this be the difficulty if you put the creed as in fact and not by courtesy apostolic and on a parity with scripture have namely its authority in itself and a direct inspiration of the framer inspire ` ad id tempus et ad eam rem ' on what ground be this to be do without admit the binding power of tradition in the very sense of the term in which the church of rome use it and the protestant church reject it that it be the sum total make by apostolic contribution each apostle casting as into a helmet a several article as he -lrb- greek : symbolon -rrb- be the tradition and this be holden as a mere legendary tale by the great majority of learn divine that it be simply the creed of the western church be affirm by many protestant divine and some of these divine of we church its comparative simplicity these divine explain by the freedom from heresy enjoy by the western church when the eastern church have be long trouble therewith other again and not unplausibly contend that it be the creed of the catechumen preparatory to the baptismal profession of faith which other be a fuller comment on the union of the father the son and the holy ghost into whose name -lrb- or power -rrb- they be baptise that the apostle ' creed receive addition after the apostolic age seem almost certain not to mention the perplexing circumstance that so many of the latin father who give almost the word of the apostolic creed declare it forbid absolutely to write or by any material form to transmit the ` canon fideus ' or ` symbolum ' or ` regula fidei ' the creed -lrb- greek : kat ' hexocháen -rrb- by analogy of which the question whether such a book be scripture or not be to be try with such doubt how can the apostle ' creed be prefer to the nicene by a consistent member of the reform catholic church ib p 67 they think while you -lrb- the independent -rrb- seem to be for a stricter discipline than other that you way or usual practice tendeth to extirpate godliness out of the land by take a very few that can talk more than the rest and make they the church & c have baxter have as judicious adviser among he theological as he have among he legal friend and have he allow they equal influence with he he would not i suspect have write this irritating and too egometical paragraph but baxter would have disbelieve a prophet who have foretell that almost the whole orthodoxy of the non-conformist would he retain and preserve by the independent congregation in england after the presbyterian have almost without exception become first arian then socinian and finally unitarian : that be the ` demi-semi-quaver ' of christianity arminianism be take for the ` semi-breve ' ib p 69 after this i wait on he -lrb- dr john owen -rrb- at london again and he come once to I to my lodgings when i be in town near he and he tell I that he receive my chide letter and perceive that i suspect he reality in the business but he be so hearty in it that i should see that he really mean as he speak conclude in these word you shall see it and my practice shall reproach you diffidence \* \* \* about a month after i go to he again and he have do nothing but be still hearty for the work and to be short i thus wait on he time after time till my papers have be near a year and a quarter in he hand and then i advise he to return they to I which he do with these word i be still a well-wisher to those mathematics -- without any other word about they or ever give I any more exception against they and this be the issue of my third attempt for union with the independent dr owen be a man of no ordinary intellect it would be interesting to have he conduct in this point seemingly so strange in some measure explain : the word those mathematics look like a innuendo that baxter 's scheme of union by which all the party oppose to the prelatic church be to form a rival church be like the mathematics true indeed but true only in the idea that be abstract from the subject matter still there appear a very chilling want of open-heartedness on the part of owen produce perhaps by the somewhat overly and certainly most ungracious resentment of baxter it be odd at least to propose concord in the tone and on the alleged ground of a old grudge ib i have be twenty-six year convince that dichotomize will not do it but that the divine trinity in unity have express itself in the whole frame of nature and morality \* \* \* but he mr george lawson have not hit on the true method of the ` vestigium trinitati ' & c among baxter 's philosophical merit we ought not to overlook that the substitution of trichotomy for the old and still general plan of dichotomy in the method and disposition of logic which form so prominent and substantial a excellence in kant 's critique of the pure reason of the judgment and the rest of he work belong originally to richard baxter a century before kant -- and this not as a hint but as a fully evolve and systematically apply principle nay more than this : -- baxter ground it on a absolute idea presuppose in all intelligential act : whereas kant take it only as a fact in which he seem to anticipate or suspect some yet deeper truth latent and hereafter to be discover on recollection however i be dispose to consider ` this ' alone as baxter 's peculiar claim i have not indeed any distinct memory of giordano bruno 's ` logice venatrix veritati ' but doubtless the principle of trichotomy be necessarily involve in the polar logic which again be the same with the pythagorean ` tetracty ' that be the eternal fountain or source of nature and this be sacred to contemplation of identity and prior in order of think to all division be so far from interfere with trichotomy as the universal form of division -lrb- more correctly of distinctive distribution in logic -rrb- that it imply it ` prothesis ' be by the very term anterior to ` thesis ' can be no part of it thus in ` prothesis ' ` thesis ' ` antithesis ' ` synthesis ' we have the tetrad indeed in the intellectual and intuitive contemplation but a triad in discursive arrangement and a tri-unity in result -lrb- 3 -rrb- ib p 144 see the great difficulty that lie in the way of increase charity so as to meet the increase of population or even so as to follow it and the manifold desirableness of parish church with the material dignity that in a right state of christian order would attach to they as compare with meeting-houses chapel and the like -- all more or less ` privati juris ' i have often feel disposed to wish that the large majestic church central to each give parish might have be appropriate to public prayer to the mystery of baptism and the lord 's supper and to the ` quasi sacramenta ' marriage penance confirmation ordination and to the continued reading aloud or occasional chanting of the scripture during the interval of the different service which ought to be so often perform as to suffice successively for the whole population and that on the other hand the chapel and the like should be entirely devote to teaching and expound ib p 153 and i prove to he that christianity be prove true many year before any of the new testament be write and that so it may be still prove by one that doubt of some word of the scripture and therefore the true order be to try the truth of the christian religion first and the perfect verity of the scripture afterwards with more than dominican virulence do goeze head pastor of the lutheran church at hamburg assail the celebrated lessing for make and support the same position as the pious baxter here advance this controversy with goeze be in 1778 nearly a hundred year after baxter 's write this ib p 155 and within a few day mr barnett ride the circuit be cast by he horse and die in the very fall and sir john medlicote and he brother a few week after lay both dead in he house together this interpret of accident and coincidence into judgment be a breach of charity and humility only not universal among all sect and party of this period and common to the best and gentlest man in all we should not therefore bring it in charge against any one in particular but what excuse shall be make for the revival of this presumptuous encroachment on the divine prerogative in we day ib p 180 near this time my book call a key for catholic be to be reprint in the preface to the first impression i have mention with praise the earl of lauderdale \* \* \* i think best to prefix a epistle to the duke in which i say not a word of he but truth \* \* \* but the indignation that man have against the duke make some blame I as keep up the reputation of one whom multitude think very ill of whereas i own none of he fault and do nothing that i could well avoid for the aforesaid reason long after this he profess he kindness to I and tell I i should never want while he be able and humbly entreat I to accept twenty guinea from he which i do this would be a curious proof of the slow and imperfect intercourse of communication between scotland and london if baxter have not be particularly inform of lauderdale 's horrible cruelty to the scotch covenanter : -- and if baxter do know they he surely run into a greater inconsistency to avoid the appearance of a less and the twenty guinea they must have smell i should think of more than the earthly brimstone that might naturally enough have be expect in gold or silver from he palm i would as soon have pluck a ingot from the cleft of the devil 's hoof -lrb- greek : taut ' élegon períthumos egô gàr mísei en ísô laudérdalon échô kaì kerkokerônucha satan -rrb- ib p 181 about that time i have finish a book call catholic thought in which i undertake to prove that besides thing unrevealed know to none and ambiguous word there be no considerable difference between the arminian and calvinist except some very tolerable difference in the point of perseverance what arminian what calvinist -- it be possible that the guard language and position of arminius himself may be interpret into a very tolerable compatibility with the principle of the milder calvinist such as archbishop leighton that true father of the church of christ but i more than doubt the possibility of even approximate the principle of bishop jeremy taylor to the fundamental doctrine of leighton much more to those of cartwright twiss or owen ib p 186 bishop barlow tell my friend that get my papers for he that he could hear of nothing that we judge to be sin but mere inconvenience when as above seventeen year ago we publicly endeavor to prove the sinfulness even of many of the old imposition clearly a undeterminable controversy inasmuch as there be no centra-definition possible of sin and inconvenience in religion : while the exact point at which a inconvenience become intolerable pass into sin must depend on the state and the degree of light of the individual conscience to which it appear or become intolerable besides a thing may not be only indifferent in itself but may be declare such by scripture and on this indifference the scripture may have rest a prohibition to christian to judge each other on the point if yet a pope or archbishop should force this on the conscience of other for example to eat or not to eat animal food would he not sin in so do and do scripture permit I to subscribe to a ordinance make in direct contempt of a command of scripture if it be say -- in all matter indifferent and so not sinful you must comply with lawful authority : -- must i not reply but you have yourself remove the indifferency by you injunction look in popish country for the hideous consequence of the unnatural doctrine -- that the priest may go to hell for sinfully command and he parishioner go with he for not obey that command ib p 191 about this time die my dear friend mr thoma gouge of whose life you may see a little in mr clark 's last book of life : -- a wonder of sincere industry in work of charity it would make a volume to recite at large the charity he use to he poor parishioner at sepulchre 's before he be eject and silence for non-conformity & c i can not express how much it grieve I that we clergy should still think it fit and expedient to defend the measure of the high churchman from laud to sheldon and to speak of the eject minister calamy baxter gouge howe and other as schismatic factionist fanatic or pharisee : -- thus to flatter some half-dozen dead bishop wantonly deprive we present church of the authority of perhaps the largest collective number of learn and zealous discreet and holy minister that one age and one church be ever bless with and whose authority in every considerable point be in favor of we church and against the present dissenter from it and this seem the more impolitic when it must be clear to every student of the history of these time that the unmanly cruelty inflict on baxter and other be as bishop ward stillingfleet and other see at the time part of the popish scheme of the cabal to trick the bishop and dignified clergy into render themselves and the established church odious to the public by law the execution of which the king the duke arlington and the popish priest direct towards the very last man that the bishop themselves -lrb- the great majority at least -rrb- would have molest appendix ii p 37 if i can prove that it have be the universal practice of the church ` in nudum apertum caput manus imponere ' doth it follow that this be essential and the contrary null how likewise can it be prove that the imposition of hand in ordination do not stand on the same ground as the imposition of hand in sickness that be the miraculous gift of the first preacher of the gospel all protestant admit that the church retain several form so originate after the cessation of the originate power which be the substance of these form ib if you think not only imposition to be essential but also that nothing else be essential or that all be true minister that be ordain by a lawful bishop per ` manuum impositionem ' then do you egregiously ` tibi ipsi imponere ' baxter like most scholastic logician have a sneak affection for pun the cause be -- the necessity of attend to the primary sense of word that be the visual image or general relation express and which remain common to all the after sens however widely or even incongruously differ from each other in other respects for the same reason schoolmaster be commonly punster i have indorse you bill sir say a pedagogue to a merchant meaning he have flog he son william -- my old master the rev jame bowyer the ` hercule furen ' of the phlogistic sect but else a incomparable teacher -- use to translate ` nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu ' -- first recite the latin word and observe that they be the fundamental article of the peripatetic school -- you must flog a boy before you can make he understand -- or you must lay it in at the tail before you can get it into the head ib p 45 then that the will must follow the practical intellect whether right or wrong -- that be no precept but the nature of the soul in its act because that the will be ` potentia cæca non nata ad intelligendum sed ad volendum vel nolendum intellectum ' this be the main fault in baxter 's metaphysics that he so often substantiate distinction into dividuous self-subsistent as here -- for a will not intelligent be no will appendix iii p 55 and for many age no other ordinarily baptise but infant if christ have no church then where be he wisdom he love and he power what be become of the glory of he redemption and he catholic church that be to continue to the end but the antipoedo-baptist would deny any such consequence as applicable to they who be to act accord to the circumstance in which god who ordain he successive manifestation in due correspondence with other light and state of thing have place they he do not exclude from the church of christ -lrb- say they -rrb- those whom we do not accept into the communion of we particular society any more than the house of lord exclude commoner from be member of parliament and we do this because -- we think that such promiscuous admission would prolong a error which would be deadly to we though not to you who interpret the scripture otherwise ` in fine ' there be two sens in which the word ` church of england ' may be use -- first with reference to the idea of the church as a estate of this christian realm protest against the papal usurpation comprise first the interest of a permanent learn class that be the clergy -- secondly those of the proper that be the infirm poor from age or sickness -- and thirdly the adequate proportional instruction of all in all class by public prayer recitation of the scripture by expound preach catechizing and schooling and last not least by the example and influence of a pastor and a schoolmaster place as a germ of civilization and cultivation in every parish throughout the land to this idea the reform church of england with its marriable and married clergy would have approximate if the revenue of the church as they exist at the death of henry vii have be rightly transfer by he successor -- transfer i mean from reservoir which have by degeneracy on the one hand and progressive improvement on the other fall into ruin and in which those revenue have stagnate into contagion or uselessness -- transfer from what have become public evil to they original and inherent purpose of public benefit instead of be sacrilegiously alienate by a transfer to private proprietor that this be impracticable be historically true but no less true be it philosophically that this impracticability arise wholly from moral cause -lrb- namely the loose manners and corrupt principle of a great majority in all class during the dynasty of the tudor -rrb- do not prevent this wholesale sacrilege from deserving the character of the first and deadliest wound inflict on the constitution of the kingdom which term in the body politic as in body natural express not only what be and have be evolve but likewise whatever be potentially contain in the seminal principle of the particular body and which would in its due time have appear but for emasculation in its infancy this however be the first sense of the word church of england -lrb- 4 -rrb- the second be the church of england as now by law establish and by practice of the law actually exist that in the first sense it be the object of my admiration and the earthly ` ne plus ultra ' of my religious aspiration it be superfluous to say : but i may be allow to express my conviction that on we recur to the same end and object -lrb- the restoration of a national and circulate property in counterpoise of individual possession disposable and heritable -rrb- though in other form and by other means perhaps the decline or progress of this country depend in the second sense of the word i can sincerely profess that i love and honor the church of england comparatively beyond any other church establish or unestablished now exist in christendom and it be wholly in consequence of this deliberate and most affectionate filial preference that i have read this work and calamy 's historical writings with so deep and so melancholy a interest and i dare avow that i can not but regard as a ignorant bigot every man who -lrb- especially since the publicity and authentication of the contents of the stuart papers memoirs and life of jame ii & c -rrb- can place the far later furious high church compilation and story of walker and other in competition with the veracity and general verity of baxter and calamy or can forget that the great body of non-conformist to whom these great and good man belong be not dissenter from the established church willingly but a orthodox and numerous portion of the church omit then the wound receive by religion generally under henry viii and the shameless secularization clandestinely effect during the reign of elizabeth and the first jame i be dispose to consider the three follow as the grand evil epoch of we present church first the introduction and after-predominance of latitudinarianism under the name of arminianism and the spirit of a conjoint romanism and socinianism at the latter half or towards the close of the reign of jame i in the person of montague laud and they confederate second the ejection of the two thousand minister after the restoration with the other violence in which the churchman make themselves the dupe of charle jame the jesuit and the french court -lrb- see the stuart papers ` passim ' -rrb- it be this that give consistence and enduring strength to schism in this country prevent the pacation of ireland and prepare for the separation of america at a far too early period for the true interest of either country third the surrender by the clergy of the right of tax themselves and the jacobitical folly that combine with the former to put it in the power of the whig party to deprive the church of she convocation -- a bitter disgrace and wrong to which most unhappily the people be render indifferent by the increase contrast of the sermon of the clergy with the article and homily of the church itself -- but a wrong nevertheless which already have avenge and will sooner or later be see to avenge itself on the state and the govern class that continue this boast of a short-sighted policy the same policy which in we own day would have fund the property of the church and by convert the clergy into salaried dependent on the government ` pro tempore ' have deprive the establishment of its fairest honor that of be neither enslave to the court nor to the congregation the same policy alas which even now pay and patronize a board of agriculture to undermine all land property by a succession of false shallow and inflammatory libel against tithe these be my weigh sentiment : and fervently desire as i do the perpetuity and prosperity of the established church zealous for its rights and dignity prefer its form believe its article of faith and hold its book of common prayer and its translation of the scripture among my highest privilege as a christian and a englishman i trust that i may both entertain and avow these sentiment without forfeit any part of my claim to the name of a faithful member of the church of england June 1820 n b as to warburton 's alliance of the church and state i object to the title -lrb- alliance -rrb- and to the matter and mode of the reasoning but the inter-dependence of the church and the state appear to I a truth of the highest practical importance let but the temporal power protect the subject in they just rights as subject merely : and i do not know of any one point in which the church have the right or the necessity to call in the temporal power as its ally for any purpose exclusively ecclesiastic the right of a firm to dissolve its partnership with any one partner breach of contract have be prove and publicly to announce the same be common to all man as social being i speak above of romanism but call it if you like laudism or lambethism in temporality and ceremonial and of socinianism in doctrine that be a retain of the word but a reject or interpret away of the sense and substance of the scriptural mystery this spirit have not indeed manifest itself in the article of the trinity since waterland give the deathblow to arianism and so leave no alternative to the clergy but the actual divinity or mere humanity of we lord and the latter would be too impudent a avowal for a public reader of we church liturgy : but in the article of original sin the necessity of regeneration the necessity of redemption in order to the possibility of regeneration of justification by faith and of prevenient and auxiliary grace -- all i can say with sincerity be that we orthodoxy seem so far in a improve state that i can hope for the time when churchman will use the term arminianism to express a habit of belief oppose not to calvinism or the work of calvin but to the article of we own church and to the doctrine in which all the first reformer agree note -- that by latitudinarianism i do not mean the particular tenet of the divine so call such as dr h more cudworth and they compeer relative to toleration comprehension and the general belief that in the greater number of point then most controvert the pious of all party be far more nearly of the same mind than they own imperfection and the imperfection of language allow they to see : i mean the disposition to explain away the article of the church on the pretext of they inconsistency with right reason -- when in fact it be only a incongruity with a wrong understand the faculty which st paul call -lrb- greek : phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- the rule of which have be all abstracted from object of sense -lrb- finite in time and space -rrb- be logically applicable to object of the sense alone this i have elsewhere call the spirit of socinianism which may work in many whose tenet be anti-socinian law be -- ` conclusio per regulam generi singulorum in genere isto inclusorum ' now the extreme ` et inclusa ' be contradictory term therefore extreme case be not capable subject of law ' a priori ' but must proceed on knowledge of the past and anticipation of the future and the fulfilment of the anticipation be the proof because the only possible determination of the accuracy of the knowledge in other word the agent may be condemn or honor accord to they intention and the apparent source of they motive so we honor brutus but the

human -- this it be when mr elwyn make this assertion i take it as the hyperbole of affection : but now i subscribe to it seriously and bless the hour that introduce I to the knowledge of the evangelical apostolical archbishop leighton April 1814 next to the inspired scripture -- yea and as the vibration of that once strike hour remain on the air stand leighton 's commentary on the 1st epistle of st peter comment vol i p 2 -- they redemption and salvation by christ jesus that inheritance of immortality buy by he blood for they and the evidence and stability of they right and title to it by the blood of christ i mean this i contemplate the christ 1 -- as ` christus agens ' the jehovah christ the word : 2 -- as ` christus patiens ' the god incarnate in the former he be ` relative ad intellectum humanum lux lucifica sol intelligibili : relative ad existentiam humanam anima animan calor foven ' in the latter he be ` vita vivificans principium spiritualis id est veræ reproductioni in vitam veram ' now this principle or ` vis vitæ vitam vivifican ' consider in ` forma passiva assimilationem patien ' at the same time that it excite the soul to the vital act of assimilate -- this be the blood of christ really present through faith to and actually partake by the faithful of this the body be the continual product that be a good life-the merit of christ act on the soul redemptive ib pp 13-15 of they sanctification : ` elect unto obedience ' & c that the doctrine assert in this and the two or three follow page can not be deny or explain away without remove -lrb- as the modern unitarian -rrb- or -lrb- as the arminian -rrb- unsettling and undermine the foundation of the faith i be fully convinced and equally so that nothing be gain by the change the very same logical consequence be deducible from the tenet of the church arminian -- scarcely more so indeed from those which they still hold in common with luther zuinglius calvin knox and cranmer and the other father of the reformation in england and which be therefore most unfairly entitle calvinism -- than from those which they have attempt to substitute in they place nay the shock give to the moral sense by these consequence be to my feeling aggravate in the arminian doctrine by the thin yet dishonest disguise meantime the consequence appear to I in point of logic legitimately conclude from the term of the premiss what shall we say then where lie the fault in the original doctrine express in the premiss god forbid in the particular deduction logically consider but these we have find legitimate where then i answer in deduce any consequence by such a process and accord to such rule the rule be alien and inapplicable the process presumptuous yea preposterous the error -lrb- greek : to prôton pseudo -rrb- lie in the false assumption of a logical deducibility at all in this instance first : -- because the term from which the conclusion must be draw - -lrb- ` terminus in majore præmissi a quibus scientialiter et scientifice demonstrandum erat ' -rrb- be accommodation and not scientific -- that be proper and adequate not ` per idem ' but ` per quam maxime simile ' or rather ` quam maxime dissimile ' : secondly -- because the truth in question be transcendant and have they evidence if any in the idea themselves and for the reason and do not and can not derive it from the conception of the understanding which can not comprehend the truth but be to be comprehend in and by they -lrb- ` john ' i 5 -rrb- : lastly and chiefly -- because these truth as they do not originate in the intellective faculty of man so neither be they address primarily to we intellect but be substantiate for we by they correspondence to the want craving and interest of the moral be for which they be give and without which they would be devoid of all meaning -- ` vox et præterea nihil ' the only conclusion therefore that can be draw from they must be such as be imply in the origin and purpose of they revelation and the legitimacy of all conclusion must be try by they consistency with those moral interest those spiritual necessity which be the proper final cause of the truth and of we faith therein for some of the faithful these truth have i doubt not a evidence of reason but for the whole household of faith they certainty be in they work now it be this by which in all case we know and determine existence in the first instance that which work in we or on we exist for we the shape and form that follow the work as its result or product whether the shape cognizable by sense or the form distinguish by the intellect be after all but the particularization of this work its proper name as it be as john jame peter in respect of human nature they be all derive from the relation in which finite being stand to each other and be therefore heterogeneous and except by accommodation devoid of meaning and purpose when apply to the work in and by which god make he existence know to we and -lrb- we may presume to say -rrb- especially exist for the soul in whom he thus work on these grounds therefore i hold the doctrine of original sin the redemption therefrom by the cross of christ and change of heart as the consequent without adopt the addition to the doctrine infer by one set of divine the modern calvinist or acknowledge the consequence burden on the doctrine by they antagonist nor be this my faith fairly liable to any inconvenience if only it be remember that it be a spiritual working of which i speak and a spiritual knowledge -- not through the ` medium ' of image the seek after which be superstition nor yet by any sensation the watch for which be enthusiasm and the conceit of its presence fanatical distemperature do the will of the father and ye shall ` know ' it we must distinguish the life and the soul though there be a certain sense in which the life may be call the soul that be the life be the soul of the body but the soul be the life of the man and christ be the life of the soul now the spirit of man the spirit subsistent be deeper than both not only deeper than the body and its life but deeper than the soul and the spirit descendent and supersistent be higher than both in the regenerated man the height and the depth become one -- the spirit communeth with the spirit -- and the soul be the ` inter-en ' or ` ens inter-medium ' between the life and the spirit -- the ` participium ' not as a compound however but as a ` medium indifferen ' -- in the same sense in which heat may be designate as the indifference between light and gravity and what be the reason -- the spirit in its presence to the understanding abstractedly from its presence in the will -- nay in many during the negation of the latter the spirit present to man but not appropriate by he be the reason of man : -- the reason in the process of its identification with the will be the spirit ib pp 63-4 can we deny that it be unbelief of those thing that causeth this neglect and forget of they the discourse the tongue of man and angel can not beget divine belief of the happiness to come only he that give it give faith likewise to apprehend it and lay hold upon it and upon we believe to be fill with joy in the hope of it most true most true ib p 68 in spiritual trial that be the sharpest and most fiery of all when the furnace be within a man when god doth not only shut up he loving-kindness from its feeling but seem to shut it up in hot displeasure when he write bitter thing against it yet then to depend upon he and wait for he salvation this be not only a true but a strong and very refined faith indeed and the more he smite the more to cleave to he \* \* \* though i see as it be he hand lift up to destroy I yet from that same hand would i expect salvation bless god o my soul for this sweet and strong comforter it be the honey in the lion ib p 75 this natural man may discourse of and that very knowingly and give a kind of natural credit to it as to a history that may be true but firmly to believe that there be divine truth in all these thing and to have a persuasion of it stronger than of the very thing we see with we eye such a assent as this be the peculiar work of the spirit of god and be certainly save faith ` lord i believe : help thou my unbelief ' my reason acquiesce and i believe enough to fear o grant I the belief that bring sweet hope ib p 76 faith \* \* cause the soul to find all that be speak of he in the word and he beauty there represent to be abundantly true make it really taste of he sweetness and by that possess the heart more strongly with he love persuade it of the truth of those thing not by reason and argument but by a inexpressible kind of evidence that they only know that have it either this be true or religion be not religion that be it add nothing to we human reason ` non religat ' grant it grant it I o lord ib pp 104-5 this sweet stream of they doctrine do as the river make its own bank fertile and pleasant as it run by and flow still forward to after age and by the confluence of more such prophecy grow greater as it go till it fall in with the main current of the gospel in the new testament both act and preach by the great prophet himself whom they foretell to come and record by he apostle and evangelist and thus unite into one river clear as crystal this doctrine of salvation in the scripture have still refresh the city of god he church under the gospel and still shall do so till it empty itself into the ocean of eternity in the whole course of my study i do not remember to have read so beautiful a allegory as this so various and detailed and yet so just and natural ib p 121 there be a truth in it that all sin arise from some kind of ignorance \* \* \* for be the true visage of sin see at a full light undressed and unpainted it be impossible while it so appear that any one soul could be in love with it but would rather flee from it as hideous and abominable this be the only -lrb- defect shall i say no but the only -rrb- omission i have feel in this divine writer -- for he we understand by feel experimentally -- that he doth not notice the horrible tyranny of habit what the archbishop say be most true of beginner in sin but this be the foretaste of hell to see and loathe the deformity of the wed vice and yet still to embrace and nourish it ib p 122 he call those time wherein christ be unknown to they ` the time of they ignorance ' though the star shine never so bright and the moon with they in its full yet they do not altogether make it day : still it be night till the sun appear how beautiful and yet how simple and as it be unconscious of its own beauty ib p 124 you be run to destruction in the way of sin and there be a voice together with the gospel preach to you ear that spake into you heart and call you back from that path of death to the way of holiness which be the only way of life he have sever you from the mass of the profane world and pick you out to be jewel for himself o how divine surely nothing less than the spirit of christ could have inspire such thought in such language other divine -- donne and jeremy taylor for instance -- have convert they worldly gift and apply they to holy end but here the gift themselves seem unearthly ib p 138 as in religion so in the course and practice of man 's life the stream of sin run from one age to another and every age make it greater add somewhat to what it receive as river grow in they course by the accession of brook that fall into they and every man when he be bear fall like a drop into this main current of corruption and so be carry down it and this by reason of its strength and he own nature which willingly dissolve into it and run along with it in this single period we have religion the spirit -- philosophy the soul -- and poetry the body and drapery unite -- plato glorified by st paul and yet come as unostentatiously as any speech from a innocent girl of fifteen ib p 158 the chief point of obedience be believe the proper obedience to truth be to give credit to it this be not quite so perspicuous and single-sensed as archbishop leighton 's sentence in general be this effect be occasion by the omission of the word this or divine or the truth in christ for truth in the ordinary and scientific sense be receive by a spontaneous rather than choose by a voluntary act and the apprehension of the same -lrb- belief -rrb- suppose a position of congruity rather than a act of obedience far otherwise be it with the truth that be the object of christian faith : and it be this truth of which leighton be speak belief indeed be a living part of this faith but only as long as it be a living part in other word belief be imply in faith but faith be not necessarily imply in belief ` the devil believe ' ib p 166 hence learn that true conversion be not so slight a work as we commonly account it it be not the outward change of some bad custom which gain the name of a reform man in the ordinary dialect it be new birth and be and elsewhere call ' a new creation though it be but a change in quality ' yet it be such a one and the quality so far distant from what they before be & c i dare not affirm that this be erroneously say but it be one of the comparatively few passage that be of service as remind I that it be not the scripture that i be read not the quality merely but the root of the quality be trans-created how else could it be a birth -- a creation ib p 170 this natural life be compare even by natural man to the vainest thing and scarce find they thing light enough to express it vain and as it be here call grass so they compare the generation of man to the leaf of tree \* \* \* ` man that be bear of a woman be of few day and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and be cut down job ' xiv 1 2 psalm xc 12 xxxix 4 it be the fashion to decry scholastic distinction as useless subtlety or mere phantom -- ` entia logica vel etiam verbalia solum ' and yet in order to secure a safe and christian interpretation to these and numerous other passage of like phrase and import in the old testament it be of highest concernment that we should distinguish the personeity or spirit as the source and principle of personality from the person itself as the particular product at any one period and as that which can not be evolve or sustain but by the co-agency of the system and circumstance in which the individual be place in this latter sense it be that ` man ' be use in the psalm in job and elsewhere -- and the term make synonymous with flesh that which constitute the spirit in man both for other and itself be the real man and to this the element and elementary power contribute its bulk -lrb- -lrb- greek : tò -rrb- ` videri et tangi ' -rrb- wholly and its phenomenal form in part both as co-efficient and as condition now as these be under a law of vanity and incessant change -- -lrb- greek : tà màe ónta all ' aèi ginómena -rrb- -- so must all be to the production and continuance of which they be indispensable on this hang the doctrine of the resurrection of the body as a essential part of the doctrine of immortality -- on this the scriptural -lrb- and only true and philosophical -rrb- sense of the soul ` psyche ' or life as result from the continual assurgency of the spirit through the body -- and on this the begetting of a new life a regenerate soul by the descent of the divine spirit on the spirit of man when the spirit by sanctification be fit for a incorruptible body then shall it be raise into a world of incorruption and a celestial body shall burgeon forth thereto the germ of which have be implant by the redeeming and creative word in this world truly have it be say of the elect : -- they fall asleep in earth but awake in heaven so st paul expressly teach : and as the passage -lrb- 1 ` cor ' xv 35 -- 54 -rrb- be write for the express purpose of rectify the notion of the convert concern the resurrection all other passage in the new testament must be interpret in harmony with it but john likewise -- describe the same great event as subsequent to and contra-distinguished from the partial or millennary resurrection -- which -lrb- whether we be to understand the apostle symbolically or literally -rrb- be to take place in the present world -- behold ' a new earth ' and ' a new heaven ' as antecedent to or coincident with the appearance of the new jerusalem -- that be the state of glory and the resurrection to life everlasting the old earth and its heaven have pass away from the face of he on the throne at the moment that it give up the dead ` rev ' xx-xxi ib pp 174-5 ` but the word of the lord endureth for ever ' and with respect to those learn man that apply the text to god i remember not that this ` abide for ever ' be use to express god 's eternity in himself no nor be it here use for that purpose but yet i can not doubt but that either the word -lrb- greek : ho lógos en archa -rrb- or the divine promise in and through the incarnate word with the gracious influence proceed from he be here mean -- and not the write -lrb- greek : rháemata -rrb- or scripture ib p 194 if any one 's head or tongue should grow apace and all the rest stand at a stay it would certainly make he a monster and they be no other that be know and discover christian and grow daily in that but not at all in holiness of heart and life which be the proper growth of the child of god father in heaven have mercy on I christ lamb of god have mercy on I save I lord or i perish alas i be perish ib p 200 a well-furnished table may please a man while he have health and appetite but offer it to he in the height of a fever how unpleasant it would be then though never so richly deck it be then not only useless but hateful to he but the kindness and love of god be then as seasonable and refreshing to he as in health and possibly more to the regenerate -- but to the conscious sinner a source of terror insupportable ib p 211 these thing hold likewise in the other stone of this building choose before time : all that should be of this building be fore-ordain in god 's purpose all write in that book beforehand and then in due time they be choose by actual call accord to that purpose hew out and sever by god 's own hand from the quarry of corrupt nature -- dead stone in themselves as the rest but make living by he bring they to christ and so make truly precious ' and account precious by he that have make they so though this be not only true but a most important truth it would yet have be well to have obviate the apparent carnal consequence ib p 216 all sacrifice be not take away but it be change from the offering of those thing formerly in use to spiritual sacrifice now these be every way preferable they be easier and cheaper to we and yet more precious and acceptable to god still understand -- to the regenerate to other they be not only not easy and cheap but unpurchaseable and impossible too o god have mercy upon I ib p 229 though i be beset on all hand be accuse by the law and mine own conscience and by satan and have nothing to answer for myself yet here i will stay for i be sure in he there be salvation and no where else here i _ will _ stay but alas the poor sinner have forfeit the power of willing miserable wish be all he can command o the dreadful injury of a irreligious education to be teach we prayer and the awful truth of religion in the same tone in which we be teach the latin grammar -- and too often inspiring the same sensation of weariness and disgust vol ii p 242 and thus be reproach mention amongst the suffering of christ in the gospel and not as the least the railing and mocking that be dart at he and fix to the cross be mention more than the very nail that fix he and -lrb- ` heb ' xii 2 -rrb- the ` shame ' of the cross though he be above it and despise it yet that shame add much to the burden of it i understand leighton thus : that though we lord feel it not as ` shame ' nor be wound by the reviling of the people in the way of any correspondent resentment or sting which yet we may be without blame yet he suffer from the same as sin and as a addition to the guilt of he persecutor which could not but aggravate the burden which he have take on himself as be sin in its most devilish form ib p 293 this therefore be mainly to be study that the seat of humility be the heart although it will be see in the carriage yet as little as it can \* \* \* and this i would recommend as a safe way : ever let thy thought concern thyself be below what thou utterest and what thou seest needful or fitting to say to thy own abasement be not only content -lrb- which most be not -rrb- to be take at thy word and believe to be such by they that hear thee but be desirous of it and let that be the end of thy speech to persuade they and gain it of they that they really take thee for as worthless a man as thou dost express thyself alas this be a most delicate and difficult subject : and the safest way and the only safe general rule be the silence that accompany the inward act of look at the contrast in all that be of we own do and impulse so may praise be make they own antidote vol iii p 20 serm i ` they shall see god ' what this be we can not tell you nor can you conceive it : but walk heavenwards in purity and long to be there where you shall know what it mean : ` for you shall know he as he be ' we say now i see the full meaning force and beauty of a passage -- we see they through the word be not christ the word -- the substantial consubstantial word -lrb- greek : ho ôn ei tòn kólpon tou patrós -rrb- -- not as we word arbitrary nor even as the word of nature phenomenal merely if even through the word a powerful and perspicuous author -- -lrb- as in the next to inspired commentary of archbishop leighton -- for whom god be praise -rrb- -- i identify myself with the excellent writer and he thought become my thought : what must not the blessing be to be thus identify first with the filial word and then with the father in and through he ib p 63 serm v in this elementary world light be -lrb- as we hear -rrb- the first visible all thing be see by it and it by itself thus be christ among spiritual thing in the elect world of he church all thing be ` make manifest by the light ' say the apostle ` eph ' v 13 speaking of christ as the follow verse doth evidently testify it be in he word that he shine and make it a directing and convincing light to discover all thing that concern he church and himself to be know by its own brightness how impertinent then be that question so much toss by the romish church how know you the scripture -lrb- say they -rrb- to be the word of god without the testimony of the church i would ask one of they again how they can know that it be daylight except some light a candle to let they see it they be little verse in scripture that know not that it be frequently call light and they be senseless that know not that light be see and know by itself ` if we gospel be hide ' say the apostle ` it be hide to they that perish ' : the god of this world have blind they mind against the light of the glorious gospel no wonder if such stand in need of a testimony a blind man know not that it be light at noon-day but by report : but to those that have eye light be see by itself on the true test of the scripture oh be it not for my manifold infirmity whereby i be so all unlike the white-robed leighton i could almost conceit that my soul have be a emanation from he so many and so remarkable be the coincidence and these in part of he work that i could not have see -- and so uniform the congruity of the whole as i read i seem to myself to be only think my own thought over again now in the same and now in a different order ib p 68 the author of the epistle to the hebrew call he -lrb- christ -rrb- -lrb- greek : apaúgasma -rrb- ` the brightness of he father 's glory and the character of he person ' -lrb- i 3 -rrb- and under these expression lie that remarkable mystery of the son 's eternal relation to the father which be rather humbly to be adore than boldly to be explain either by god 's perfect understanding of he own essence or by any other notion certainly not by a transfer of a notion and this too a notion of a faculty itself but notional and limitary to the supreme reality but there be idea which be of higher origin than the notion of the understanding and by the irradiation of which the understanding itself become a human understanding of such ` veritate verificæ ' leighton himself in other word speak often surely there must have be a intelligible propriety in the term ` logo ' word ` beget before all creation ' -- a adequate idea or ` icon ' or the evangelist and apostolic penman would not have adopt they they do not invent the term but take they and use they as they be take and apply by philo and both the greek and oriental sage nay the precise and orthodox yet frequent use of these term by philo and by the jewish author of that traditionalæ wisdom -- degrade in after time but which in its purest part exist long before the christian æra -- be the strongest extrinsic argument against the arian socinian and unitarian in proof that st john must have mean to deceive he reader if he do not use they in the know and receive sense to a materialist indeed or to those who deny all knowledge not resolvable into notice from the five sens these term as apply to spiritual being must appear inexplicable or senseless but so must spirit to I -lrb- why do i say to I -rrb- to bull to waterland to gregory nazianzen basil athanasius augustine the term word and generation have appear admirably yea most awfully pregnant and appropriate -- but still as the language of those who know that they be place with they back to substance -- and which therefore they can name only from the correspondent shadow -- yet not -lrb- god forbid -rrb- as if the substance be the same as the shadow -- which yet leighton suppose in this he censure -- for if he do not he then censure himself and a number of he most beautiful passage these and two or three other sentence -- slip of human infirmity -- be useful in remind I that leighton 's work be not inspire scripture ` postscript ' on a second consideration of this passage and a revisal of my marginal animadversion -- yet how dare i apply such a word to a passage write by a minister of christ so clearly under the especial light of the divine grace as be archbishop leighton -- i be incline to think that leighton confine he censure to the attempt to explain the trinity -- and this by notion -- and not to the assertion of the adorable act imply in the term both of the evangelist and apostle and of the church before as well as after christ 's ascension nor to the assent of the pure reason to the truth and more than assent to the affirmation of the idea ib p 73 this fifth sermon excellent in part be yet on the whole the least excellent of leighton 's work -- and breathe less of either he own character as a man or the character of he religious philosophy the style too be in many place below leighton 's ordinary style -- in some place even turbid operose and catechrestic -- for example -- to trample on smiling with one foot and on frowning with the other ib p 77 serm vi leighton i presume be acquaint with the hebrew language but he do not appear to have study it much he observation on the ` heart ' as use in the old testament shew that he do not know that the ancient hebrew suppose the heart to be the seat of intellect and therefore use it exactly as we use the head ib p 104 serm vii this seventh sermon be admirable throughout leighton throughout o what a contrast might be present by publish some discourse of some court divine -lrb- south for instance -rrb- preach under the same state of affair and print the two in column ib p 107 serm viii in all love three thing be necessary some goodness in the object either true and real or apparent and seeming to be so for the soul be it ever so evil can affect nothing but which it take in some way to be good this assertion in these word have be so often make from plato 's time to ours that even wise man repeat it without perhaps much examination whether it be not equivocal -- or rather -lrb- i suspect -rrb- true only in that sense in which it would amount to nothing -- nothing to the purpose at least this be to be regret -- for it be a mischievous equivoque to make ` good ' a synonyme of ` pleasant ' or even the ` genus ' of which pleasure be a ` species ' it be a grievous mistake to say that bad man seek pleasure because it be good no like child they call it good because it be pleasant even the useful must derive its meaning from the good not ` vice versa ' postscript the line in p 107 note by I be one of a myriad instance to prove how rash it be to quote single sentence or assertion from the correctest writer without collate they with the known system or express conviction of the author it would be easy to cite fifty passage from archbishop leighton 's work in direct contradiction to the sentence in question -- which he have learn in the school when a lad and afterwards have hear and meet with so often that he be not aware that he have never sift its real purport this eighth sermon be another most admirable discourse ib serm ix p 12 the reasonable creature it be true have more liberty in its action freely choose one thing and reject another yet it can not be deny that in act of that liberty they choice and refusal -lrb- a -rrb- follow the sway of they nature and condition -lrb- a -rrb- i would fain substitute for ` follow ' the word ` be most often determine and always affect by ' i do not deny that the will follow the nature but then the nature itself be a will ib as the angel and glorified soul -lrb- they nature be perfectly holy and unalterably such -rrb- they can not sin they can delight in nothing but obey and praise that god in the enjoyment of whom they happiness consisteth if angel be other than spirit make perfect or as leighton write glorified soul -- the unalterable by nature seem to I rashly assert ib the mind -lrb- greek : phrónaema -rrb- some render it the prudence or wisdom of the flesh here you have it the carnal mind but the word signify indeed a act of the mind rather than either the faculty itself or the habit of prudence in it so as it discover what be the frame of both those i doubt -lrb- greek : phrónaema -rrb- signify a act : and so far i agree with leighton but -lrb- greek : phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- be ` the flesh ' -lrb- that be the natural man -rrb- in the act or habitude of mind -- but those act take collectively be the faculty -- the understanding how often have i find reason to regret that leighton have not clearly make out to himself the diversity of reason and the understanding ib serm xv p 196 a narrow enthralled heart fetter with the love of lower thing and cleave to some particular sin or but some one and that secret may keep foot a while in the way of god 's commandment in some step of they but it must give up quickly be not able to run on to the end of the goal one of the bless privilege of the spiritual man -lrb- and such leighton be -rrb- be a pierce insight into the disease of which he himself be clear -lrb- greek : eléaeson kyrie -rrb- ib serm xvi p 204 know you not that the redeem of christ and he be one they live one life christ live in they and if ` any man have not the spirit of christ he be none of he ' as the apostle declare in this chapter so then this we be plainly to tell you and consider it you that will not let go you sin to lay hold on christ have as yet no share in he but on the other side : the truth be that when soul be once set upon this search they commonly wind the notion too high and subtilize too much in the dispute and so entangle and perplex themselves and drive themselves further off from that comfort that they be seek after such measure and mark they set to themselves for they rule and standard and unless they find those without all controversy in themselves they will not believe that they have a interest in christ and this bless and safe estate in he to such i would only say be you in a willing league with any known sin & c a admirable antidote for such as too sober and sincere to pass off feverous sensation for spirituality have be perplex by wesley 's assertion -- that a certainty of have be elect be a indispensable mark of election whitfield 's ultra-calvinism be gospel gentleness and pauline sobriety compare with wesley 's arminianism in the outset of he career but the main and most noticeable difference between leighton and the modern methodist be to be find in the uniform selfishness of the latter not do you wish to love god do you love you neighbor do you think ' o how dear and lovely must christ be ' -- but -- be you certain that christ have save ` you ' that he die for ` you -- you -- you -- yourself ' on to the end of the chapter this be wesley 's doctrine lecture ix vol iv p 96 for that this be he fixed purpose lucretius not only vow but also boast of it and load he -lrb- epicurus -rrb- with ill-advised praise for endeavor through the whole course of he philosophy to free the mind of man from all the bond and tie of religion but surely in this passage ` religio ' must be render superstition the most effectual means for the removal of which epicurus suppose himself to have find in the exclusion of the ` god many and lord many ' from they imagine agency in all the ` phænomena ' of nature and the event of history substitute for these the belief in fix law have in themselves they evidence and necessity on this account in this passage at least lucretius praise he master ib p 105 they always seem to I to act a very ridiculous part who contend that the effect of the divine decree be absolutely irreconcilable with human liberty because the natural and necessary liberty of a rational creature be to act or choose from a rational motive or spontaneously and of purpose : but who see not that on the supposition of the most absolute decree this liberty be not take away but rather establish and confirm for the decree be ` that such a one shall make choice of or do some particular thing freely and whoever pretend to deny that whatever be do or choose whether good or indifferent be so do or choose or at least may be so espouse a absurdity ' i fear i fear that this be a sophism not worthy of archbishop leighton it seem to I tantamount to say -- i force that man to do so or so without my force he but however that may be the following sentence be more precious than diamond they be divine ib lect xi p 113 for that this world compound of so many and such heterogeneous part should proceed by way of natural and necessary emanation from that one first present and most simple nature nobody i imagine could believe or in the least suspect \* \* \* but if he produce all these thing freely \* \* how much more consistent be it to believe that this be do in time than to imagine it be from eternity it be inconceivable how any thing can be create in time and production be incompatible with interspace ib lect xv p 152 the platonist divide the world into two the sensible and intellectual world \* \* \* accord to this hypothesis those parable and metaphor which be often take from natural thing to illustrate such as be divine will not be similitude take entirely at pleasure but be often in a great measure found in nature and the thing themselves i have assert the same thing and more fully show wherein the difference consist of symbolic and metaphorical in my first lay sermon and the substantial correspondence of the genuine platonic doctrine and logic with those of lord bacon in my essay on method in the friend -lrb- 2 -rrb- ib lect xix p 201 even the philosopher give they testimony to this truth and they sentiment on the subject be not altogether to be reject for they almost unanimously be agree that felicity so far as it can be enjoy in this life consist solely or at least principally in virtue : but as to they assertion that this virtue be perfect in a perfect life it be rather express what be to be wish than describe thing as they be and why be the philosopher to be judge accord to a different rule on what ground can it be assert that the stoic believe in the actual existence of they god-like perfection in any individual or that they mean more than this -- to no man can the name of the wise be give in its absolute sense who be not perfect even as he father in heaven be perfect ib lect xxi p 225 in like manner if we suppose god to be the first of all being we must unavoidably therefrom conclude he unity as to the ineffable trinity subsist in this unity a mystery discover only by the sacred scripture especially in the new testament where it be more clearly reveal than in the old let other boldly pry into it if they please while we receive it with we humble faith and think it sufficient for we to admire and adore but surely it have be reveal to we we may venture to say -- that a positive unity so far from exclude imply plurality and that the godhead be a fulness -lrb- greek : plaeroma -rrb- ib lect xxiv p 245 ask yourselve therefore ` what you would be at ' and with what disposition you come to this most sacred table in a age of colloquial idiom when to write in a loose slang have become a mark of loyalty this be the only l'estrange vulgarism i have meet with in leighton ib exhortation to the student p 252 study to acquire such a philosophy as be not barren and babble but solid and true not such a one as float upon the surface of endless verbal controversy but one that enter into the nature of thing for he speak good sense that say the philosophy of the greek be a mere jargon and noise of word if so then so be all philosophy : for what system be there the element and outline of which be not to be find in the greek school here leighton follow too incautiously the father -lrb- footnote 1 : work of leighton 4 vol 8vo london 1819 ed -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ` statesman 's manual ' p 230 2nd edit friend iii 3d edit ed -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* note on sherlock 's vindication of the doctrine of the trinity -lrb- 1 -rrb- sect i p 3 some new philosopher will tell you that the notion of a spirit or a immaterial substance be a contradiction for by substance they understand nothing but matter and then a immaterial substance be immaterial matter that be matter and no matter which be a contradiction but yet this do not prove a immaterial substance to be a contradiction unless they could first prove that there be no substance but matter and that they can not conceive any other substance but matter do not prove that there be no other certainly not : but if not only they but dr sherlock himself and all mankind be incapable of attach any sense to the term substance but that of matter -- then for we it would be a contradiction or a groundless assertion thus : by ` substance ' i do not mean the only notion we can attach to the word but a somewhat i know not what may for aught i know not be contradictory to spirit why should we use the equivocal word ` substance ' -lrb- after all but a ` ens logicum ' -rrb- instead of the definite term ` self-subsistent ' we be equally conscious of mind and of that which we call ` body ' and the only possible philosophical question be these three : 1 be they co-ordinate as agent and re-agent 2 or be the one subordinate to the other as effect to cause and which be the cause or ground which the effect or product 3 or be they co-ordinate but not inter-dependent that be ` per harmonium præstabilitam ' ib p 4 now so far as we understand the nature of any be we can certainly tell what be contrary and contradictious to its nature as that accident should subsist without ` they subject ' & c that accident should subsist -lrb- rather exist -rrb- without a subject may be a contradiction but not that they exist without this or that subject the word ` they subject ' be ' a petitio principius ' ib these and such like be the manifest absurdity and contradiction of transubstantiation and we know that they be so because we know the nature of a body & c indeed be i either romanist or unitarian i should desire no better than the admission of body have a ` esse ' not in the ` percipus ' and really subsist -lrb- -lrb- greek : autò tò chraema -rrb- -rrb- as the supporter of its accident at all event the romanist declare the accident to be those ordinarily impressed on the sens -lrb- -lrb- greek : tà phaínomena kaì aísthaeta -rrb- -rrb- by bread and wine do at the same time declare the flesh and blood not to be the -lrb- greek : phaínomena kaì aísthaeta -rrb- so call but the -lrb- greek : noúmena kaì autà tà chráemata -rrb- there be therefore no contradiction in the term however reasonless the doctrine may be and however unnecessary the interpretation on which it be pretended i confess have i be in luther 's place i would not have rest so much of my quarrel with the papist on this point nor can i agree with we arminian divine in they ridicule of transubstantiation the most rational doctrine be perhaps for some purpose at least the ` rem credimus modum nescimus ' next to that the doctrine of the sacramentary that it be ` signum sub rei nomine ' as when we call a portrait of caius caius but of all the remainder impanation consubstantiation and the like i confess that i should prefer the transubstantiation of the pontifical doctor ib p 6 the proof of this come to this one point that we may have sufficient evidence of the being of a thing whose nature we can not conceive and comprehend : he who will not own this contradict the sense and experience of mankind and he who confess this and yet reject the belief of that which he have good evidence for merely because he can not conceive it be a very absurd and senseless infidel here again though a zealous believer of the truth assert i must object to the bishop 's logic none but the weakest man have object to the tri-unity merely because the ` modus ' be above they comprehension : for so be the influence of think on muscular motion so be life itself so in short be every first truth of necessity for to comprehend a thing be to know its antecedent and consequent but they affirm that it be against they reason besides there seem a equivocation in the use of ` comprehend ' and ` conceive ' in the same meaning when a man tell I that he will can lift he arm i conceive he meaning though i do not comprehend the fact i understand ` he ' but the socinian say -- we do not understand ` you ' we can not attach to the word ` god ' more than three possible meaning either 1 a person or self-conscious be 2 or a thing 3 or a quality property or attribute if you take the first then you admit the contradiction if either of the latter two you have not three person and one god but three person have equal share in one thing or three with the same attribute that be three god sherlock do not meet this let I repeat the difficulty if possible more clearly the argument of the philosophic unitarian as wissowatius who mistake as they be be not to be confound with they degenerate successor the priestleyan and belshamite may be thus express by the term god we can only conceive you to suppose one or other of three meaning 1 either you understand by it a person in the common sense of a intelligent or self-conscious being -- or 2 a thing with its quality and property -- or 3 certain power and attribute comprise under the word nature if we suppose the first the contradiction be manifest and you yourselve admit it and therefore forbid we so to interpret you word for if by god you mean person then three person and one god would be the same as three person and one person if we take the second as you meaning as a infinite thing be a absurdity we have three finite god like jupiter neptune and pluto who share the universe between they if the latter we have three person with the same attribute -- and if a person with infinite attribute be what we mean by god then we have either three god or involve the contradiction above mention it be unphilosophic by admission of all philosopher they add to multiply cause beyond the necessity now if there be three person of infinite and the same attribute dismiss two and you lose nothing but a numerical phantom the answer to this must commence by a denial of the premiss ` in toto ' : and this both bull and waterland have do most successfully but i very much doubt whether sherlock on he principle could have evade the unitarian logic in fact it be scarcely possible to acquit he altogether of a ` quasi-tritheism ' sect ii p 13 ` for like as we be compel by the christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be god and lord ' -- -lrb- that be by especial revelation -rrb- ` so be we forbid by the catholic religion to say there be three god or three lord ' that be by the religion contain in and give in accompaniment with the universal reason ` the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world ' ib p 14 this creed -lrb- athanasian -rrb- do not pretend to explain how there be three person each of which be god and yet but one god -lrb- of which more hereafter -rrb- but only assert the thing that thus it be and thus it must be if we believe a trinity in unity which should make all man who would be think neither arian nor socinian more cautious how they express the least dislike of the athanasian creed which must either argue that they condemn it before they understand it or that they have some secret dislike to the doctrine of the trinity the dislike commonly feel be not of the doctrine of the trinity but of the positive anathematic assertion of the everlasting perdition of all and of each who doubt the same -- a assertion deduce from scripture only by a train of captious consequence and equivocation thus a : i honor and admire caius for he great learning b : the knowledge of the sanscrit be a important article in caius 's learn a : i have be often in he company and have find no reason for believe this b : o then you deny he learning be envious and caius 's enemy a : god forbid i love and admire he i know he for a transcendant linguist in the hebrew greek latin and modern european language -- and with or without the sanscrit i look up to he and rely on he erudition in all case in which i be concerned and it be this perfect trust this unfeigned respect that be the appoint criterion of caius 's friend and disciple and not they full acquaintance with each and all particulars of he superiority thus without christ or in any other power but that of christ and -lrb- subjectively -rrb- of faith in christ no man can be save but do it follow that no man can have christian faith who be ignorant or erroneous as to any one point of christian theology will a soul be condemn to everlasting perdition for want of logical ` acumen ' in the perception of consequence -- if he verily embrace christ as he redeemer and unfeignedly feel in himself the necessity of redemption he implicitly hold the divinity of christ whatever from want or defect of logic may be he notion ` explicite ' ib p 18 ` but the whole three person be co-eternal and co-equal ' and yet this we must acknowledge to be true if we acknowledge all three person to be eternal for in eternity there can be no ` afore or after other ' it must however be consider as a serious defect in a creed if exclude subordination without mention any particular form it give no hint of any other form in which it admit it the only ` minus ' admit by the athanasian creed be the inferiority of christ 's humanity to the divinity generally but both scripture and the nicene creed teach a subordination of the son to the father independent of the incarnation of the son now this be not insert and therefore the denial in the assertion ` none be greater or less than another ' be universal and a plain contradiction of christ speaking of himself as the co-eternal son ` my father be greater than i ' speaking of himself as the co-eternal son i say -- for how superfluous would it have be a truism how unworthy of we lord to have say in effect that a creature be less than god and after all creed assuredly be not to be impose ` ad libitum ' -- a new creed or at least a new form and choice of article and expression at the pleasure of individual now where be the authority of the athanasian creed in what consist its necessity if it be the same as the nicene why not be content with the nicene if it differ how dare we retain both -lrb- 2 -rrb- if the athanasian do not say more or different but only differ by omission of a necessary article then to impose it be as absurd as to force a mutilate copy on one who have already the perfect original lastly it be not enough that a abstract contain nothing which may not by a chain of consequence be deduce from the book of the evangelist and apostle in order for it to be a creed for the whole christian church for a creed be or ought to be a ` syllepsis ' of those primary fundamental truth that be as it be the starting-post from which the christian must commence he progression the full-grown christian need no other creed than the scripture themselves highly valuable be the nicene creed but it have its chief value as a historical document prove that the same text in scripture receive the same interpretation while the greek be a living language as now sect iii p 23 if what he say be true : ` he that err in a question of faith after have use reasonable diligence to be rightly inform be in no fault at all ' how come a atheist or a infidel a turk or a jew to be in any fault do we author think that no atheist or infidel no unbelieving jew or heathen ever use reasonable diligence to be rightly inform \* \* \* if you say he confines this to such point as have always be controvert in the church of god i desire to know a reason why he thus confines it for do not he reason equally extend to the christian faith itself as to those point which have be controvert in christian church and the notary might ask in he turn : do you believe that the christian either of the greek or of the western church will be damned accord as the truth may be respect the procession of the holy ghost or that either the sacramentary or the lutheran or again the consubstantiationist or the transubstantiationist if not why do you stop here whence this sudden palsy in the limb of you charity again do this eternal damnation of the individual depend on the suppose importance of the article deny or on the moral state of the individual on the inward source of this denial and lastly who authorize either you or the pseudo-athanasius to interpret catholic faith by belief arise out of the apparent predominance of the grounds for over those against the truth of the position assert much more by belief as a mere passive acquiescence of the understanding be all damned who die during the period when ` totus fere mundus factus est arianus ' as one of the father admit alas alas how long will it be ere christian take the plain middle road between intolerance and indifference by adopt the literal sense and scriptural import of heresy that be wilful error or belief originate in some perversion of the will and of heretic -lrb- for such there be nay even orthodox heretic -rrb- that be man wilfully unconscious of they own wilfulness in they limpet-like adhesion to a favorite tenet ib p 26 all christian must confess that there be no other name give under heaven whereby man can be save but only the name of christ now this be a most awful question on which depend whether christ be more than socrate for to bring god from heaven to reproclaim the ten commandment be ` too too ' ridiculous need i say i incline to sherlock but yet i can not give to faith the meaning he do though i give it all and more than all the power but if that name as power save the jewish church before they know the name as name how much more now if only the will be not guiltily averse any miracle do in kind as truly bring god from heaven as the incarnation which the socinian wholly forget as in other point they receive without scruple what they have learn without examination and then transfer to the first article which they do look into all the difficulty that belong equally to the former : as the simonidean doubt concern god to the trinity and the like ib p 27 the eclectic neo-platonist -lrb- sallustius and other -rrb- justify they polytheism on much the same pretext as be in fact involve in the language of this page -lrb- greek : polloì mèn en dè mium theótaeti -rrb- this indeed seem to I decisive in favor of waterland 's scheme against this of sherlock 's -- namely that in the latter we find no sufficient reason why in the nature of thing this intermutual consciousness might not be possess by thirty instead of three it seem a strange confounding -lrb- greek : hetéron genéôn -rrb- to answer true but the latter only happen to be the fact -- just as if we be speak of the number of person in the privy council ib p 28 ` note ' by keep this faith ` whole and undefiled ' must be mean that a man should believe and profess it without add to it or take from it \* \* \* first for add what if a honest plain man because he be a christian and a protestant should think it necessary to add this article to the athanasian creed -- ' i believe the holy scripture of the old and new testament to be a divine infallible and complete rule both for faith and manners ' i hope no protestant would think a man damned for such addition and if so then this creed of athanasius be at least a unnecessary rule of faith ` answer ' that be to say it be a addition to the catholic faith to own the scripture to be the rule of faith as if it be a addition to the law of england to own the original record of they in the tower this notary manage he cause most weakly and sherlock ` fib ' he like a scientific pugilist but he himself expose weak part as in p 27 the objection to the athanasian creed urge by better man than the notary yea by divine not less orthodox than sherlock himself be this : not that this creed add to the scripture but that it add to the original ` symbolum fideus ' the ` regulum ' the ` canon ' by which accord to the greater number of the ` ante ' - nicene father the book of the new testament be themselves try and determine to be scripture now this ` symbolum ' be to bring together all that must be believe even by the babe in faith or to what purpose be it make now say they the nicene creed be really nothing more than a verbal explication of the common creed but the clause in the athanasian -lrb- ` which faith ' & c -rrb- however fairly deduce from scripture be not contain in the creed or selection of certain article of faith from the scripture or not at least from those preaching and narration of which the new testament scripture be the repository might not a papist plead equally in support of the creed of pope pius : the new article be deduce from scripture that be in we opinion and that most expressly in we lord 's several and solemn address to st peter so again sherlock 's answer to this paragraph from the note be evasive -- for it be very possible nay it be and have be the case that a man may believe in the fact and doctrine contain in the new testament and yet not believe the holy scripture to be either divine infallible or complete sect iv p 50 we know not what the substance of a infinite mind be nor how such substance as have no part or extension can touch each other or be thus externally unite but we know the unity of a mind or spirit reach as far as its self-consciousness do for that be one spirit which know and feel itself and its own thought and motion and if we mean this by ` circum-incession ' three person thus intimate to each other be numerically one the question still return have these three infinite mind at once self-conscious and conscious of each other 's consciousness always the very same thought if so this mutual consciousness be unmeaning or derivative and the three do not cease to be three because they be three same if not then there be tritheism evidently ib p 64 st paul tell we 1 cor ii 10 ` that the spirit searcheth all thing yea the deep thing of god ' so that the holy spirit know all that be in god even he most deep and secret counsel which be a argument that he be very intimate with he but this be not all : it be the manner of know which must prove this consciousness of which i speak : and that the apostle add in the next verse that the spirit of god know all that be in god just as the spirit of a man know all that be in man : that be not by external revelation or communication of this knowledge but by self-consciousness by a internal sensation which be owe to a essential unity ` for what man knoweth the thing of a man save the spirit of a man which be in he even so the thing of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god ' it would be interesting if it be feasible to point out the epoch at which the text mode of argue in polemic controversy become predominant i mean by single text without any modification by the context i suspect that it commence or rather that it first become the fashion under the dort or systematic theologian and during the so call quinquarticular controversy this quotation from st paul be a striking instance : -- for st paul be speak of the holy spirit of which true spiritual christian be partaker and by which or in which those christian be enable to search all thing even the deep thing of god no person be here speak of but reference be make to the philosophic principle that can only act immediately that be interpenetratively as two globule of quicksilver and co-adunatively now perceive and know be consider as immediate act relatively to the object perceive and know : -- ` ergo ' the ` principium sciendus ' must be one -lrb- that be homogeneous or consubstantial -rrb- with the ` principium essendus quoad objectum cognitum ' in order therefore for a man to understand or even to know of god he must have a god-like spirit communicate to he wherewith as with a inward eye which be both eye and light he see the spiritual truth now i have no objection to he call this spirit a ` person ' if only the term ` person ' be so understand as to permit of its be partaken of by all spiritual creature as light and the power of vision be partaken of by all see one but it be too evident that sherlock suppose the father as father to possess a spirit that be a intellective faculty by which he know the spirit that be the third co-equal person and that this spirit the person have a spirit that be a intellective faculty by which he know the father and the ` logo ' in like manner relatively to both so too the father have a ` logo ' with which he distinguish the ` logo ' -- and the ` logo ' have a ` logo ' and so on : that be to say there be three several though not sever triune god each be the same position three time ` realiter positum ' as three guinea from the same mint suppose they to differ no more than they appear to we to differ -- but whether a difference wholly and exclusively numerical be a conceivable notion except under the predicament of space and time whether it be not absurd to affirm it where interspace and interval can not be affirm without absurdity -- this be the question or rather it be no question ib p 68 nor do we divide the substance but unite these three person in one numerical essence : for we know nothing of the unity of the mind but self-consciousness as i show before and therefore as the self-consciousness of every person to itself make they distinct person so the mutual consciousness of all three divine person to each other make they all but one infinite god : as far as consciousness reach so far the unity of a spirit extend for we know no other unity of a mind or spirit but consciousness but this contradict the precede paragraph in which the father be self-conscious that he be the father and not the son and the son that he be not the father and that the father be not he now how can the son 's be conscious that the father be conscious that he be not the son constitute a numerical unity and wherein can such a consciousness as that attribute to the son differ from absolute certainty be not god conscious of every thought of man -- and would sherlock allow I to deduce the unity of the divine consciousness with the human sherlock 's be doubtless a very plain and intelligible account of three god in the most absolute intimacy with each other so that they be all as one but by no means of three person that be one god i do not wonder that waterland and the other follower of bull be alarmed ib p 72 even among man it be only knowledge that be power human power and human knowledge as that signify a knowledge how to do anything be commensurate whatever human skill extend to human power can effect : nay every man can do what he know how to do if he have proper instrument and material to do it with this prove that perfect knowledge suppose perfect power : and that they be one and the same if he have proper instrument : -- do not this show that the means be suppose co-present with the knowledge not the same with it ib for it be nothing but think which move we body and all the member of they which be the immediate instrument of all human force and power : except mechanical motion which do not depend upon we will such as the motion of the heart the circulation of the blood the concoction of we meat and the like all voluntary motion be not only direct but cause by thought : and so indeed it must be or there could be no motion in the world for matter can not move itself and therefore some mind must be the first mover which make it very plain that infinite truth and wisdom be infinite and almighty power even this though not ill-conceived be inaccurately express ib p 81 there be no contradiction that three infinite mind should be absolutely perfect in wisdom goodness justice and power for these be perfection which may be in more than one as three man may all know the same thing and be equally just and good : but three such mind can not be absolutely perfect without be mutually conscious to each other as they be to themselves will any man in he sens affirm that my knowledge be increase by say all three time follow be it not mere repetition in time if the son have thought which the father as the father could not have but for he interpenetration of the son 's consciousness then i can understand it but then these be not three absolute but three mode of perfection constitute one absolute and by what right sherlock could call the one father more than the other i can not see ib p 88 and yet if we consider these three divine person as contain each other in themselves and essentially one by a mutual consciousness this pretend contradiction vanish : for then the father be the one true god because the father have the son and the holy spirit in himself : and the son may he call the one true god because the son have the father and the holy ghost in himself & c nay this be to my understand three god and sherlock seem to have bring in the material phantom of a thing or substance ib p 97 but if these three distinct person be not separate but essentially unite unto one each of they may be god and all three but one god : for if these three person -- each of whom -lrb- greek : monadikôs -rrb- as it be in the creed singly by himself not separately from the other divine person be god and lord be essentially unite into one there can be but one god and one lord and how each of these person be god and all of they but one god by they mutual consciousness i have already explain -- that be -- if the three person be not three -- so might the arian answer unless sherlock have show the difference of separate and distinct relatively to mind for what other separation can be conceive in mind but distinction distinction may be join with imperfection as ignorance or forgetfulness and so it be in man : -- and if this be call separation by a metaphor from body then the conclusion would be that in the supreme mind there be distinction without imperfection and then the question be whence come plurality of person can it be conceive other than as the result of imperfection that be finiteness ib p 98 thus each divine person be god and all of they but the same one god as i explain it before o no assert it ib p 98-9 this one supreme god be father son and holy ghost a trinity in unity three person and one god now father son and holy ghost with all they divine attribute and perfection -lrb- except they personal property which the school call the ` modi subsistendi ' that one be the father the other the son and the other the holy ghost which can not be communicate to each other -rrb- be whole and entire in each person by a mutual consciousness each feel the other person in himself all they essential wisdom power goodness justice as he feel himself and this make they essentially one as i have prove at large will not the arian object you admit the ` modus subsistendus ' to be a divine perfection and you affirm that it be incommunicable do it not follow therefore that there be perfection which the all-perfect do not possess this would not apply to bishop bull or waterland sect v p 102 st austin in he sixth book of the trinity take notice of a common argument use by the orthodox father against the arian to prove the co-eternity of the son with the father that if the son be the wisdom and power of god as st paul teach -lrb- 1 ` cor ' i -rrb- and god be never without he wisdom and power the son must he co-eternal with the father \* \* \* but this acute father discover a great inconvenience in this argument for it force we to say that the father be not wise but by that wisdom which he beget not be himself wisdom as the father : and then we must consider whether the son himself as he be god of god and light of light may be say to be wisdom of wisdom if god the father be not wisdom but only beget wisdom the proper answer to augustine be that the son and holy ghost be necessary and essential not contingent : and that ` he ' argument have a still greater inconvenience as shewn in note p 98 ib pp 110-113 but what make st gregory dispute thus nicely and oppose the common and ordinary form of speech do he in good earnest believe that there be but one man in the world no no he acknowledge as many man as we do a great multitude who have the same human nature and that every one who have a human nature be a individual man distinguish and divide from all other individual of the same nature what make he so zealous then against say that peter jame and john be three man only this that he say man be the name of nature and therefore to say there be three man be the same as to say there be three human nature of a different kind for if there be three human nature they must differ from each other or they can not be three and so you deny peter jame and john to be -lrb- greek : homooúsioi -rrb- or of the same nature and for the same reason we must say that though the father be god the son god and the holy ghost god yet there be not three god but -lrb- greek : mía theótaes -rrb- one godhead and divinity sherlock struggle in vain in my opinion at least to clear these father of egregious logomachy whatever may have be the soundness of they faith spite of the quibble by which they endeavor to evince its rationality the very change of the term be suspicious yes we might say three god -lrb- it would be answer -rrb- as we say and ought to say three man : for man and humanity -lrb- greek : ánthropôs -rrb- and -lrb- greek : ánthrôpótaes -rrb- be not the same term -- so if the father be god the son god and the holy ghost god there would be three god though not -lrb- greek : trei theótaetes -rrb- -- that be three godhead ib p 115-16 gregory nyssen tell we that -lrb- greek : theòs -rrb- be -lrb- greek : theatàes -rrb- and -lrb- greek : éphoros -rrb- the inspector and governor of the world that be it be a name of energy operation and power and if this virtue energy and operation be the very same in all the person of the trinity father son and holy ghost then they be but one god but one power and energy \* \* \* the father do nothing by himself nor the son by himself nor the holy ghost by himself but the whole energy and operation of the deity relate to creature begin with the father pass to the son and from father and son to the holy spirit the holy spirit do not act anything separately there be not three distinct operation as there be three person -lrb- greek : allà mìa tìs gínetai agathou bouláematos kínaesis kaì diakósmaesis -rrb- -- but one motion and disposition of the good will which pass through the whole trinity from father to son and to the holy ghost and this be do -lrb- greek : achrónos kaì adiarétôs -rrb- without any distance of time or propagate the motion from one to the other but by one thought as it be in one numerical mind and spirit and therefore though they be three person they be but one numerical power and energy but this be either tritheism or sabellianism it be hard to say which either the -lrb- greek : boúlaema -rrb- subsist in the son and in the holy ghost and not merely pass through they and then there would be three numerical -lrb- greek : bouláemata -rrb- as well as three numerical person : ` ergo ' -lrb- greek : trei theoì àe theataí -rrb- -lrb- accord to gregory nyssen 's shallow and disprovable etymology -rrb- which would be tritheism : or -lrb- greek : hén ti gínetai boúlaema -rrb- and then the son and holy ghost be but term of relation which be sabellianism but in fact this gregory and the other be tritheist in the mode of they conception though they do not wish to be so and refuse even to believe themselves such gregory nyssen cyril of alexandrium maximus and damascen be charge with a kind of tritheism by petavius and dr cudworth who accord to sherlock have mistake they meaning see pp 106-9 of this vindication ib p 117 for i leave any man to judge whether this -lrb- greek : mía kínaesis bouláematos -rrb- this one single motion of will which be in the same instant in father son and holy ghost can signify anything else but a mutual consciousness which make they numerically one and as intimate to each other as every man be to himself as i have already explain it be not god conscious to all my thought though i be not conscious of god 's would sherlock endure that i should infer : ` ergo ' god be numerically one with I though i be not numerically one with god i have never see but greatly wish to see waterland 's controversial tract against sherlock again : accord to sherlock 's conception it would seem to follow that we ought to make a triad of triad or a ennead 1 father -- son -- holy ghost 2 son -- father -- holy ghost 3 holy ghost -- son -- father else there be a ` x ' in the father which be not in the son a ` y ' in the son which be not in the father and a ` z ' in the holy ghost which be in neither : that be each by himself be not total god ib p 120 but however he might be mistake in he philosophy he be not in he divinity for he assert a numerical unity of the divine nature not a mere specific unity which be nothing but a logical notion nor a collective unity which be nothing but a company who be naturally many : but a true subsist numerical unity of nature and if the difficulty of explain this and he zeal to defend it force he upon some unintelligible nicety to prove that the same numerical human nature too be but one in all man it be hard to charge he with teaching that there be three independent and co-ordinate god because we think he have not prove that peter jame and john be but one man this will make very foul work with the father if we charge they with all those erroneous conceit about the trinity which we can fancy in they inconvenient way of explain that venerable mystery especially when they compare that mysterious unity with any natural union so that after all this obscuration of the obscure sherlock end by fairly throw up he briefs and yet call out not guilty ` victorium ' and what be this but to say : these father do indeed involve tritheism in they mode of defend the tri-personality but they be not tritheist : -- though it would be far more accurate to say that they be tritheist but not so as to make any practical breach of the unity -- as if for instance peter jame and john have three silver ticket by shew one of which either or all three would have the same thing as if they have shew all three ticket and ` vice versa ' all three ticket could produce no more than each one each correspond to the whole ib i be sure st gregory be so far from suspect that he should be charge with tritheism upon this account that he fence against another charge of mix and confound the ` hypostase ' or person by deny any difference or diversity of nature -lrb- greek : hôs ek tou màe déchesthai tàen katà physin diaphoràn míxin tina tôn hypostáseôn kaì anakúklaesin kataskeúzonta -rrb- which argue that he think he have so fully assert the unity of the divine essence that some might suspect he have leave but one person as well as one nature in god this be just what i have say p 116 whether sabellianism or tritheism i observe be hard to determine extreme meet ib p 121 secondly to this ` homo-ousiote ' the father add a numerical unity of the divine essence this petavius have prove at large by numerous testimony even from those very father whom he before accuse for make god only collectively one as three man be one man such as gregory nyssen st cyril maximus damascen which be a demonstration that however ` he might mistake ' they explication of it from the unity of human nature they be far enough from tritheism or one collective god this be most uncandid sherlock even to be consistent with he own confession § 1 p 120 ought to have say however he might mistake they ` intention ' in consequence of they inconvenient and unphilosophical explication which mistake in fact consist in take they at they word ib petavius greatly commend boethius 's explication of this mystery which be the very same he have before condemn in gregory nyssen and those other father -- that father son and holy ghost be one god not three god : ` hujus conjunctionis ratio est indifferentium ' : that be such a sameness of nature as admit of no difference or variety or a exact ` homo-ousiote ' as he explain it \* \* those make a difference who augment and diminish as the arian do who distinguish the trinity into different nature as well as person of different worth and excellency and thus divide and multiply the trinity into a plurality of god ` principium enim pluralitatis alteritas est præter alteritatem enim nec pluralitas quid sit intelligus potest ' then if so what become of the person have the person attribute distinct from they nature -- or do not they common nature constitute they common attribute ` principium enim & c ' ib p 124 that the father universally acknowledge that the operation of the whole trinity ` ad extra ' be but one petavius have prove beyond all contradiction and hence they conclude the unity of the divine nature and essence for every nature have a virtue and energy of its own for nature be a principle of action and if the energy and operation be but one there can be but one nature and if there be two distinct and divided operation if either of they can act alone without the other there must be two divide nature then it be not the son but the whole trinity that be crucify : for surely this be a operation ` ad extra ' ib p 126 but to do st austin right though he do not name this consciousness yet he explain this trinity in unity by example of mutual consciousness i name one of he similitude before of the unity of we understanding memory and will ` which ' be all conscious to each other that we remember what we understand and will we understand what we remember and will and what we will we remember and understand and therefore all these three faculty do penetrate and comprehend each other ` which ' the ` man ' be self-conscious alike when he remember will and understand but in what sense be the generic term memory conscious to the generic word will this be mere nonsense be memory understanding and volition person -- self-subsistent if not what be they to the purpose who doubt that jehovah be consciously powerful consciously wise consciously good and that it be the same jehovah who in be omnipotent be good and wise in be wise omnipotent and good in be good be wise and omnipotent but what have all this to do with a distinction of person instead of one tri-unity we might have a mille-unity the fact be that sherlock and -lrb- for aught i know -rrb- gregory nyssen have not the clear idea of the trinity positively but only a negative arianism ib p 127 he proceed to shew that this unity be without all manner of confusion and mixture \* \* for the mind that love be in the love \* \* \* and the knowledge of the mind which know and love itself be in the mind and in its love because it love itself know and know itself loving : and thus also two be in each for the mind which know and love itself with its knowledge be in love and with its love be in knowledge then why do we make tri-personality in unity peculiar to god the doctrine of the trinity -lrb- the foundation of all rational theology no less than the precondition and ground of the rational possibility of the christian faith that be the incarnation and redemption -rrb- rest securely on the position -- that in man ` omni actioni præit sua proprium passio deus autem est actus purissimus sine ullum potentialitate ' as the tune produce between the breeze and eolian harp be not a self-subsistent so neither memory nor understanding nor even love in man : for he be a passive as well as active being : he be a patible agent but in god this be not so whatever be necessarily of he -lrb- god of god light of light -rrb- be necessarily all act therefore necessarily self-subsistent though not necessarily self-originated this then be the true mystery because the true unique that the son of god have origination without passion that be without cease to be a pure act : while a create entity be as far as it be merely creaturely and distinguishable from the creator a mere ` passio ' or recipient this unicity we strive not to ` express ' for that be impossible but to designate by the nearest though inadequate analogy -- ` beget ' ib p 133 as for the holy ghost whose nature be represent to be love i do not indeed find in scripture that it be any where say that the holy ghost be that mutual love wherewith father and son love each other : but this we know that there be a mutual love between father and son : ` the father loveth the son and have give all thing into he hand ' -- john iii 35 ` and the father loveth the son and sheweth he all thing that himself doeth ' - john v 20 and we savior himself tell we ' i love the father ' -- john xiv 31 and i shewed before that love be a distinct act ` and therefore in god must be a person : for there be no accident nor faculty in god ' this most important nay fundamental truth so familiar to the elder philosophy and so strongly and distinctly enunciate by philo judæus the senior and contemporary of the evangelist be to we modern divine darkness and a sound sect vi pp 147-8 yes you 'll say that there should be three person each of which be god and yet but one god be a contradiction : but what principle of natural reason do it contradict surely never do argument vertiginate more i have just accede to sherlock 's exposition of the trinity as the supreme be he reflex act of self-consciousness and he love all form one supreme mind and now he tell I that each be the whole supreme mind and deny that three each ` per se ' the whole god be not the same as three god i grant that division and separation be term inapplicable yet surely three distinct though undivided god be three god that the father son and holy ghost be the one true god i fully believe but not sherlock 's exposition of the doctrine nay i think it would have be far better to have word the mystery thus : -- the father together with he son and spirit be the one true god each ` per se ' god this be the -lrb- greek : prôton méga pseudo -rrb- of sherlock 's scheme each of the three be whole god because neither be or can be ` per se ' the father himself be ' a se ' but not ` per se ' ib p 149 for it be demonstrable that if there be three person and one god each person must be god and yet there can not be three distinct god but one for if each person be not god all three can not be god unless the godhead have person in it which be not god three person have the same nature be three person -- and if to possess without limitation the divine nature as oppose to the human be what we mean by god why then three such person be three god and will bethink so till gregory nyssen can persuade we that john jame and peter each possess the human nature be not three man john be a man jame be a man and peter be a man : but they be not three man but one man ib p 150 i affirm that natural reason be not the rule and measure of expound scripture no more than it be of expound any other write the true and only way to interpret any write even the scripture themselves be to examine the use and propriety of word and phrase the connexion scope and design of the text its allusion to ancient custom and usage or dispute for there be no other good reason to be give for any exposition but that the word signify so and the circumstance of the place and the apparent scope of the writer require it this and the follow paragraph be excellent ' o si sic omnium ' ib p 153 reconcile man to the doctrine -lrb- of the trinity -rrb- and the scripture be plain without any farther comment this i have now endeavor and i believe we adversary will talk more sparingly of absurdity and contradiction for the future and they will lose the best argument they have against the orthodox exposition of scripture good doctor you sadly over-rated both you own power and the docility of you adversary if so clear a head and so zealous a trinitarian as dr waterland could not digest you exposition or acquit it of tritheism little hope be there of find the unitarian more persuadable ib p 154 though christ be god himself yet if there be three person in the godhead the equality and sameness of nature do not destroy the subordination of person : a son be equal to he father by nature but inferior to he as he son : if the father as i have explain it be original mind and wisdom the son a personal subsisting but reflex image of he father 's wisdom though they eternal wisdom be equal and the same yet the original be superior to the image the father to the son but why we man deem it so because the image be but a shadow and not equal to the original but if it be the same in all perfection how could that which be exactly the same be less again god be all be : -- consequently there can nothing be add to the idea except what imply a negation or diminution of it if one and the same being be equal to the father as touch he godhead but inferior as man then it be + be - x ' which be not = + be ' but of two man i may say that they be equal to each other a = + courage-wisdom b = + wisdom-courage both wise and courageous but a inferior in wisdom b in courage but god be all-perfect ib p 156 so bear before all creature as -lrb- greek : prôtótokos -rrb- also signify ` that by he be all thing create ' ` all thing be create by he and for he and he be before all thing ' -lrb- which be the explication of -lrb- greek : pôrtótokos pásaes ktíseos -rrb- beget before the whole creation ' and therefore no part of the creation himself -rrb- this be quite right we version should here be correct -lrb- greek : prôto -rrb- or -lrb- greek : prótaton -rrb- be here a intense comparative -- ` infinitely before ' ib p 159 that he ` be in the form of god think it not robbery to be equal with god ' & c -- phil ii 8 9 i should be incline to adopt a interpretation of the unusual phrase -lrb- greek : hárpagmon -rrb- somewhat different both from the socinian and the church version : -- who be in the form of god do not ` think equality with god a thing to be seize with violence ' but make & c ib p 160 be a mere creature a fit lieutenant or representative of god in personal or prerogative act of government and power must not every be be represent by one of he own kind a man by a man a angel by a angel in such act as be proper to they nature and must not god then be represent by one who be god be any creature capable of the government of the world do not this require infinite wisdom and infinite power and can god communicate infinite wisdom and infinite power to a creature or a finite nature that be can a creature be make a true and essential god this be sound reasoning it be to be regret that sherlock have not confine himself to logical comment on the scripture instead of attempt metaphysical solution ib pp 161-3 i find little or nothing to ` object to ' in this exposition from pp 161-163 inclusively of ` phil ' ii 8 9 and yet i seem to feel as if a something that should have be prefix and to which all these consideration would have be excellent seconds be miss to explain the cross by the necessity of sacrificial blood and the sacrificial blood as a type and ` ante ' - delegate or pre-substitute of the cross be too like a ` argumentum in circulo ' ib p 164 and though christ be the eternal son of god and the natural lord and heir of all thing yet ` god have ' in this ` highly exalted he ' and give ` he a name which be above every name that at ' -lrb- or in -lrb- greek : en -rrb- -rrb- ` the name of jesus every knee should bow of thing in heaven ' & c -- phil ii 9 10 11 never be a sublime passage more debased than by this rendering of -lrb- greek : en -rrb- by ` at ' instead of ` in ' -- ` at ' the ` phenomenon ' instead of ` in ' the ` noumenon ' for such be the force of ` noman ' name in this and similar passage namely ` in vera et substantiali potestate jesu ' : that be -lrb- greek : en lógô kaì dià lógou -rrb- the true ` noumenon ' or ` ens intelligibile ' of christ to bow at hear the ` cognomen ' may become a universal but it be still only a non-essential consequence of the former but the debasement of the idea be not the worst evil of this false rendering -- it have afford the pretext and authority for un-christian intolerance ib p 168 ` the father judgeth no man but have commit all judgment to the son ' -- john v 22 should the father judge the world he ` must ' judge as the maker and sovereign of the world by the strict rule of righteousness and justice and then how could any sinner be save -lrb- why be mercy incompatible with righteousness how then can the son be righteous -rrb- but he have commit judgment to the son as a mediatory king who judge by the equity and chancery of the gospel this article require exposition incomparably more than the simple doctrine of the trinity plain and evident ` simplici intuitu ' and render obscure only by divert the mental vision by term draw from matter and multitude in the trinity all the ` how ' may and should be answer by ` look ' just as a wise tutor would do in state the fact of a double or treble motion as of a ball roll north ward on the deck of a ship sailing south while the earth be turn from west to east and in like manner that be ` per intuitum intellectualem ' must all the mystery of faith be contemplate -- they be intelligible ` per se ' not discursively and ` per analogiam ' for the truth be unique and may have shadow and type but no analogy at this moment i have no intuition no intellectual diagram of this article of the commission of all judgment to the son and therefore a multitude of plausible objection present themselves which i can not solve -- nor do i expect to solve they till by faith i see the thing itself -- be not mercy a attribute of the deity as deity and not exclusively of the person of the son and be not the authorize another to judge by equity and mercy the same as judge so ourselves if the father can do the former why not the latter ib p 171 and therefore now it be give he to have life in himself as the father have life in himself as the original fountain of all life by whom the son himself live : all life be derive from god either by eternal generation or procession or creation and thus christ have life in himself also to the new creation he be the fountain of life : ` he quickeneth whom he will ' the truth which hitherto have be metaphysical then begin to be historical the eternal be to be manifest in time hence christ come with sign and wonder that be the absolute or the anterior to cause and effect manifest itself as a ` phenomenon ' in time but with the predicate of eternity -- and this be the only possible definition of a miracle ` in re ipsa ' and not merely ` ad hominem ' or ` ad ignorantiam ' ib p 177 he next argument consist in apply such thing to the divinity of we savior as belong to he humanity ` that he increase in wisdom & c : -- that he know not the day of judgment ' -- which he evidently speak of himself as man : as all the ancient father confess in st mark it be say ` but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angel that be in heaven neither the son but the father ' st matthew do not mention the son : ` of that day and hour knoweth no man not the angel of heaven but my father only ' how much more politic as well as ingenuous it have be to have acknowledge the difficulty of this text so far from its be evident the evidence would be on the arian side be it not that so many express text determine we to the contrary ib which show that the son in st matthew be include in the -lrb- greek : oudeìs -rrb- none or no man and therefore concern he only as a man : for the father ` include the whole trinity ' and therefore include the son who seeth whatever he father doth this be a ` argumentum in circulo ' and ` petitio rei sub lite ' why be he call the son in ` antithesis ' to the father if it mean no not the christ except in he character of the co-eternal son include in the father if it concern he only as a man why be he place after the angel why call the ` son ' simply instead of the son of man or the messiah ib -lrb- greek : oudeìs -rrb- be not -lrb- greek : oudeìs anthrôpôn -rrb- but ` no one ' : as in john i 18 ` no one have see god at any time ' that be he be by essence invisible this most difficult text i have not see explain satisfactorily i have think that the -lrb- greek : ággeloi -rrb- must here be take in the primary sense of the word namely as messenger or missionary prophet : of this day knoweth no one not the messenger or revealer of god 's purpose now in heaven no not the son the greatest of prophet -- that be he in that character promise to declare all that in that character it be give to he to know ib p 186 when st paul call the father the one god he expressly oppose it to the many god of the heathen ` for though there be that be call god & c but to we there be but one god the father of whom be all thing and one lord jesus christ by whom be all thing and we by he ' : where the ` one god ' and ` one lord and mediator ' be oppose to the many god and many lord or mediator which be worship by the heathen but surely the ` one lord ' be as much distinguish from the ` one god ' as both be contradistinguish from the ` god many and lord many ' of the heathen besides ` the father ' be not the term use in that age in distinction from the god that be no god but -lrb- greek : ho epì pántôn theós -rrb- ib p 222 ` the word be with god ' that be it be not yet in the world or not yet make flesh but with god -- ` john ' i 1 so that to be ` with god ' signify nothing but not to be in the world _ ` the word be with god ' _ grotius do say that this be oppose to the word 's be make flesh and appear in the world : but he be far enough from think that these word have only a negative sense : \* \* \* for he tell we what the positive sense be that with god be -lrb- greek : parà tô patrí -rrb- with the father \* \* and explain it by what wisdom say ` prov ' vii 30 ` then i be by he & c ' which he do not think a ` prosopopoeium ' but speak of a subsist person but even this be scarcely tenable even as greek have this be st john 's meaning surely he would have say -lrb- greek : en theô -rrb- not -lrb- greek : pròs tòn theón -rrb- in the nearest proximity that be not confusion but it be strange that sherlock should not have see that grotius have a hankering toward socinianism but like a ` shy cock ' and a man of the world be always ready to unsay what he have say -lrb- footnote 1 : a vindication of the doctrine of the holy and ever bless trinity and the incarnation of the son of god occasion by the brief note on the creed of st athanasius and the brief history of the unitarian or socinian and contain a answer to both by wm sherlock london 8vo 1690 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the third general council that at ephesus in 431 decree that it should not be lawful for any man to publish or compose another faith or creed than that which be define by the nicene council ed -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* note on waterland 's vindication of christ 's divinity -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` in initio ' it would be no easy matter to find a tolerably competent individual who more venerate the writings of waterland than i do and long have do but still in how many page do i not see reason to regret that the total idea of the 4 = 3 = 1 -- of the adorable tetracty eternally self-manifested in the triad father son and spirit -- be never in its cloudless unity present to he hence both he and bishop bull too often treat it as a peculiarity of positive religion which be to be clear of all contradiction to reason and then thus negatively qualify to be actually receive by a act of the mere will ` sit pro ratione voluntas ' now on the other hand i affirm that the article of the trinity be religion be reason and its universal ` formulum ' and that there neither be nor can be any religion any reason but what be or be a expansion of the truth of the trinity in short that all other pretended religion pagan or ` pseudo ' - christian -lrb- for example sabellian arian socinian -rrb- be in themselves atheism though god forbid that i should call or even think the man so denominate atheist i affirm a heresy often but never dare denounce the holder a heretic on this ground only can it be make comprehensible how any honest and commonly intelligent man can withstand the proof and sound logic of bull and waterland that they fail in the first place to present the idea itself of the great doctrine which they so ably advocate take my self stc as a humble instance i be never so befooled as to think that the author of the fourth gospel or that st paul ever teach the priestleyan psilanthropism or that unitarianisn -lrb- presumptuously nay absurdly so call -rrb- be the doctrine of the new testament generally but during the sixteen month of my aberration from the catholic faith i presume that the tenet of the divinity of christ the redemption and the like be irrational and that what be contradictory to reason could not have be reveal by the supreme reason as soon as i discover that these doctrine be not only consistent with reason but themselves very reason i return at once to the literal interpretation of the scripture and to the faith as to dr samuel clarke the fact be every generation have its one or more over-rated man clarke be such in the reign of george i dr johnson eminently so in that of george iii lord byron be the star now in the ascendant in every religious and moral use of the word god take absolutely that be not as a god or the god but as god a relativity a distinction in kind ` ab omnus quod non est deus ' be so essentially imply that it be a matter of perfect indifference whether we assert a world without god or make god the world the one be as truly atheism as the other in fact for all moral and practical purpose they be the same position differently express for whether i say god be the world or the world be god the inevitable conclusion the sense and import be that there be no other god than the world that be there be no other mean to the term god whatever you may mean by or choose to believe of the world that and that alone you mean by and believe of god now i very much question whether in any other sense atheism that be speculative atheism be possible for even in the lucretian the coarsest and crudest scheme of the epicurean doctrine a hylozism a potential life be clearly imply as also in the celebrated ` lene clinamen ' become actual desperado articulate breath into a blasphemy of nonsense to which they themselves attach no connected meaning and the wickedness of which be alone intelligible there may be but a la place or a la grand would and with justice resent and repel the imputation of a belief in chance or of a denial of law order and self-balancing life and power in the world they error be that they make they the proper and underived attribute of the world it follow then that pantheism be equivalent to atheism and that there be no other atheism actually exist or speculatively conceivable but pantheism now i hold it demonstrable that a consistent socinianism follow its own consequence must come to pantheism and in ungodd the savior must deify cat and dog flea and frog there be there can be no ` medium ' between the catholic faith of trinal unity and atheism disguise in the self-contradicting term pantheism -- for every thing god and no god be identical position query i p 1 ` the word be god ' -- john i 1 ' i be the lord and there be none else there be no god besides I ' -- be xiv 5 & c in all these text the ` be ' or ` be ' ought to be render positively or objectively and not as a mere connective : ` the word be god ' and saith ' i be the lord there be no god besides I ' the supreme be ` deitas objectiva ' the father saith ' i be in that i be -- deitas subjectiva ' ib p 2 whether all other being besides the one supreme god be not exclude by the text of isaiah -lrb- to which many more might be add -rrb- and consequently whether christ can be god at all unless he be the same with the supreme god the sum of you answer to this query be that the text cite from isaiah be speak of one person only the person of the father & c o most unhappy mistranslation of ` hypostasis ' by person the word be properly the only person ib p 3 now upon you hypothesis we must add that even the son of god himself however divine he may be think be really no god at all in any just and proper sense he be no more than a nominal god and stand exclude with the rest all worship of he and reliance upon he will be idolatry as much as the worship of angel or man or of the god of the heathen would be god the father he be god and he only and ` he only shall thou serve ' this i take to be a clear consequence from you principle and unavoidable waterland 's argument be absolutely unanswerable by a worshipper of christ the modern ` ultra ' - socinian cut the knot query ii p 43 and therefore he might as justly bear the style and title of ` lord god god of abraham ' & c while he act in that capacity as he do that of ` mediator messiah son of the father ' & c after that he condescend to act in another and to discover he personal relation and why then do not dr waterland -- why do not he great predecessor in this glorious controversy bishop bull -- contend for a revisal of we establish version of the bible but especially of the new testament either the unanimous belief and testimony of the first five or six century ground on the reiterate declaration of john and paul and the writer of the epistle to the hebrew be erroneous or at best doubtful -- and then why not wipe they off why these reference to they -- or else they be as i believe and both bull and waterland believe the very truth and then why continue the translation of the hebrew into english at second-hand through the ` medium ' of the septuagint have we not adopt the hebrew word jehovah be not the -lrb- greek : kyrio -rrb- or lord of the lxx a greek substitute in countless instance for the hebrew jehovah why not then restore the original word and in the old testament religiously render jehovah by jehovah and every text of the new testament refer to the old by the hebrew word in the text refer to have this be do socinianism would have be scarcely possible in england why be not this do -- i will tell you why because that great truth in which be contain all treasure of all possible knowledge be still opaque even to bull and waterland -- because the idea itself -- that ` idea idearum ' the one substrative truth which be the form manner and involvent of all truth -- be never present to either of they in its entireness unity and transparency they most ably vindicate the doctrine of the trinity negatively against the charge of positive irrationality with equal ability they shew the contradiction nay the absurdity involve in the rejection of the same by a profess christian they demonstrate the utterly un-scriptural and contra-scriptural nature of arianism and sabellianism and socinianism but the self-evidence of the great truth as a universal of the reason -- as the reason itself -- as a light which reveal itself by its own essence as light -- this they have not have vouchsafe to they query xv p 225-6 the pretence be that we equivocate in talking of eternal generation all generation be necessarily -lrb- greek : ánarchón ti -rrb- without dividuous beginning and herein contradistinguish from creation ib p 226 true it be not the same with human generation not the same ` eodem modo ' certainly but it be so essentially the same that the generation of the son of god be the transcendent which give to human generation its right to be so call it be in the most proper that be the fontal sense of the term generation ib you have not prove that all generation imply beginning and what be more can not it would be difficult to disprove the contrary generation with a beginning be not generation but creation hence we may see how necessary it be that in all important controversy we should predefine the term negatively that be exclude and preclude all that be not mean by they and then the positive meaning that be what be mean by they will be the easy result -- the post-definition which be at once the real definition and impletion the circumference and the area ib p 227-8 it be a usual thing with many -lrb- moralist may account for it -rrb- when they meet with a difficulty which they can not readily answer immediately to conclude that the doctrine be false and to run directly into the opposite persuasion -- not consider that they may meet with much more weighty objection there than before or that they may have reason sufficient to maintain and believe many thing in philosophy and divinity though they can not answer every question which may be start or every difficulty which may be raise against they o if bull and waterland have be first philosopher and then divine instead of be first manacled or say articled clerk of a guild -- if the clear free intuition of the truth have lead they to the article and not the

irrational animal dog elephant beaver and the like endowed with the same sens therefore i regard this paragraph p 223-4 as a specimen of admirable special plead ` ad hominem ' in the court of eristic logic but i condemn it as a wilful resignation or temporary self-deposition of the reason i will not suppose what my reason declare to be no position at all and therefore a impossible sub-position ib

for it i suppose must have run thus : gentleman though i have sacrifice to other god yet i hope you 'll observe that i do it not absolutely : i mean not any absolute or supreme sacrifice -lrb- which be all that the law forbid -rrb- but relative and inferior only i regulate my intention with all imaginable care and my esteem with the most critical exactness i consider the other god whom i sacrifice to as inferior only and infinitely so reserve all sovereign sacrifice to the supreme god of israel this or the like apology must i presume have bring off the criminal with some applause for he acuteness if you principle be true either you must allow this or you must be content to say that not only absolute supreme sacrifice -lrb- if there be any sense in that phrase -rrb- but all sacrifice be by the law appropriate to god only & c & c how be it possible for a arian to answer this but it be impossible and arianism be extinguish by waterland but in order to the increase of socinianism and this i doubt not waterland foresee he be too wise a man to suppose that the exposure of the folly and falsehood of one form of infidelism would cure or prevent infidelity enough that he make it more bare-faced -- i might say bare-breeched for modern unitarianism be verily the ` sans-culotterie ' of religion ib p 239 you imagine that act of religious worship be to derive they signification and quality from the intention and meaning of the worshipper : whereas the very reverse of it be the truth truly excellent let the church of england praise god for she saint -- a more glorious kalendar than rome can show ib p 251 the sum then of the case be this : if the son could be include as be uncreated and very god as creator sustainer preserver of all thing and one with the father then he might be worship upon they -lrb- the ante-nicene father ' -rrb- principle but otherwise could not every where in this invaluable writer i have to regret the absence of all distinct idea of the i be as the proper attribute of the father and hence the ignorance of the proper jehovaism of the son and hence that while we worship the son together with the father we nevertheless pray to the father only through the son query xvii and we may never be able perfectly to comprehend the relation of the three person ` ad intra ' amongst themselves the ineffable order and economy of the

that be he person or he own life but we can distinctly apprehend they in strictness the idea god like all other idea rightly so call and as contradistinguish from conception be not so properly above as alien from comprehension it be like smell a sound query xviii p 269 from what have be observe it may appear sufficiently that the divine -lrb- greek : lógos -rrb- be we king and we god long before that he have the same claim and title to religious worship that the father himself have -- ` only not so distinctly reveal ' here i differ ` toto orbe ' from waterland and say with luther and zinzendorf that before the baptism of john the ` logo ' alone have be distinctly reveal and that first in christ he declare himself a son namely the co-eternal only-begotten son and thus reveal the father indeed the want of the idea of the 1 = 3 could alone have prevent waterland from infer this from he own query ii and the text cite by he pp 28-38 the father can not be reveal except in and through the son he eternal ` exegesis ' the contrary position be a absurdity the supreme will indeed the absolute good knoweth himself as the father : but the act of self-affirmation the i be in that i be be not a manifestation ` ad extra ' not a ` exegesis ' ib p 274 this point be settle i might allow you that in some sense distinct worship commence with the distinct title of son or redeemer : that be we bless lord be then first worship or command to be worship by we under that distinct title or character have before have no other title or character peculiar and proper to himself but only what be common to the father and he too rather shall i say that the son and the spirit the word and the wisdom be alone worship because alone reveal under the law see proverb i ii the passage quote from bishop bull be very plausible and very eloquent but only ` cum multis granis salis sumend ' query xix p 279 that the father whose honor have be sufficiently secure under the jewish dispensation and could not but be so under the christian also & c here again this contradiction of waterland to he own principle be continually recur -- yea and in one place he involve the very tritheism of which he be so victorious a antagonist namely that the father be jehovah the son jehovah and the spirit jehovah -- thus make jehovah either a mere synonyme of god -- whereas he himself rightly render it

conception for idea query xxiii p 351 but take advantage of the ambiguity of the word ` hypostasis ' sometimes use to signify substance and sometimes person you contrive a fallacy and why do not

the very name of father apply in the creed to the first person intimate the relation he bear to a son & c no doubt : but the most probable solution of the apparent want of distinctness of explication on this article in my humble judgment be -- that the so-called apostle ' creed be at first the preparatory confession of the catechumen the admission-ticket as it be -lrb- ` symbolum ad baptismum ' -rrb- at the gate of the church and gradually augment as heresy start up the latest of these seem to have consist in the doubt respect the entire death of jesus on the cross as distinguish from suspend animation hence in the fifth or sixth century the clause -- and he descend into hade be insert -- that be the indissoluble principle of the man jesus be separate from and leave the dissoluble and subsist apart in ` scheol ' or the abode of separated soul -- but really mean no more than ` vere mortuus est ' jesus be take from the cross dead in the very same sense in which the baptist be dead after he beheading nevertheless well adapt as this creed be to its purpose i can not but regret the high place and precedence which by means of its title and the fable to which that title give rise it have usurp it have as it appear to I indirectly favor arianism and socinianism ib p 250 that st john write he gospel with a view to confute cerinthus among other false teacher be attest first by irenæus who be a disciple of polycarp and who flourish within less than a century of st john 's time i have little trust and no faith in the gossip and hearsay-anecdote of the early father irenæus not except within less than a century of st john 's time alas a century in the paucity of writer and of man of education in the age succeed the apostolic must be reckon more than equal to five century since the use of printing suppose however the truth of the irenæan tradition -- that the creed of cerinthus be what irenæus state it to have be and that john at the instance of the asiatic bishop write he gospel as a antidote to the cerinthian heresy -- do there not thence arise in he utter silence a almost overwhelming argument against the apostolicity of the ` christopædia ' both that prefix to luke and that concorporate with matthew ib p 257 ` in he be life and the life be the light of man ' the same word be life the -lrb- greek : logo and zôáe -rrb- both one there be no occasion therefore for subtilly distinguish the word and life into two son as some do i will not deny the possibility of this interpretation it may be -- nay it be -- fairly deducible from the word of the great evangelist : but i can not help think that take as the primary intention it degrade this most divine chapter which unite in itself the three character of sublime profound and pregnant and alloy its universality by a mixture of time and accident ib ` and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness cometh not upon it ' so i render the verse conformable to the rendering of the same greek verb -lrb- greek : katalambánô -rrb- by we translator in another place of this same gospel the apostle as i conceive in this 5th verse of he 1st chapter allude to the prevail error of the gentile & c o sad sad how must the philosopher have be eclipse by the shadow of antiquarian erudition in order that a mind like waterland 's could have sacrifice the profound universal import of ` comprehend ' to a allusion to a worthless dream of heretical nonsense the mushroom of the day have waterland ever think of the relation of he own understanding to he reason but alas the identification of these two diversity -- of how many error have it be ground and occasion ib p 259 ` and the word be make flesh ' -- become personally unite with the man jesus ` and dwelt among we ' -- reside constantly in the human nature so assumed waterland himself do but dimly see the awful import of -lrb- greek : egéneto sàrx -rrb- -- the mystery of the alien ground -- and the truth that as the ground such must be the life he cause himself to ` become flesh ' and therein assume a mortal life into he own person and unity in order himself to transubstantiate the corruptible into the incorruptible waterland 's anxiety to show the anti-heretical force of st john 's gospel and epistle have cause he to overlook they catholicity -- they applicability to all country and all time -- they truth independently of all temporary accident and error -- which catholicity alone it be that constitute they claim to canonicity that be to be canonical inspired writings ib p 266 hereupon therefore the apostle in defense of christ 's real humanity say ` this be he that come by water and blood ' ` water and blood ' that be ` serum ' and ` crassamentum ' mean simply ` blood ' the blood of the animal or carnal life which saith mose ` be the life ' hence ` flesh ' be often take as and indeed be a form of the blood -- blood form or organize thus ` blood ' often include ` flesh ' and ` flesh ' include ` blood ' ` flesh and blood ' be equivalent to blood in its twofold form or rather as form and formless ` water and blood ' have therefore two meaning in st john but which ` in idem coincidunt ' : 1 true animal human blood and no celestial ichor or phantom : 2 the whole sentiently vital body fix or flow the pipe and the stream for the ancient and especially the jew have no distinct apprehension of the use or action of the nerve : in the old testament ` heart ' be use as we use ` head ' ` the fool have say in he heart ' -- be in english : the worthless fellow -lrb- ` vaurien ' -rrb- have take it into he head & c ib p 268 the apostle have say that the spirit be truth or essential truth -lrb- which be give he a title common to god the father and to christ -rrb- & c be it clear that the distinct ` hypostasis ' of the holy spirit in the same sense as the only-begotten son be hypostatically distinguish from the father be a truth that form a immediate object or intention of st john that it be a truth imply in and fairly deducible from many text both in he gospel and epistle i do not indeed i can not doubt -- but only whether this article of we faith he be commission to declare explicitly it grieve I to think that such giant ` archaspistæ ' of the catholic faith as bull and waterland should have cling to the intruded gloss -lrb- 1 ` john ' v 7 -rrb- which in the opulence and continuity of the evidence as display by they own master-mind would have be superfluous have it not be worse than superfluous that be senseless in itself and interruptive of the profound sense of the apostle ib p 272 he be come come in the flesh and not merely to reside for a time or occasionally and to fly off again but to abide and dwell with man clothe with humanity incautiously word at best compare we lord 's own declaration to he disciple that he have dwell a brief while ` with ' or ` among ' they in order to dwell ` in ' they permanently ib p 286 it be very observable that the ebionite reject three of the gospel receive only st matthew 's -lrb- or what they call so -rrb- and that curtail they reject likewise all st paul 's writings reproach he as a apostate how unlikely be it that justin should own such reprobate as those be for fellow-christian i dare avow my belief -- or rather i dare not withhold my avowal -- that both bull and waterland be here hunting on the trail of a old blunder or figment concoct by the gross ignorance of the gentile christian and they father in all that respect hebrew literature and the palestine christian i persist in the belief that though a refuse of the persecute and from neglect degenerate jew-christian may have sink into the mean and carnal notion of they unconverted brethren respect the messiah no proper sect of ebionite ever exist but those to whom st paul travel with the contribution of the church nor any such man as ebion unless indeed it be st barnaba who in he humility may have so name himself while solicit relief for the distressed palestine christian -- i be barnaba the beggar but i will go further and confess my belief that the -lrb- so-called -rrb- ebionite of the first and second century who reject the ` christopædia ' and whose gospel commence with the baptism by john be orthodox apostolic christian who receive christ as the lord that be as jehovah ` manifest in the flesh ' as to they rejection of the other gospel and of paul 's writings i might ask : -- could they read they but the whole notion seem to rest on a anachronical misconception of the ` evangelium ' every great mother church at first have its own gospel ib p 288 to say nothing here of the truer reading -lrb- man of you nation -rrb- there be no consequence in the argument the ebionite be christian in a large sense man of christian profession nominal christian as justin allow the worst of heretic to be and this be all he could mean by allow the ebionite to be christian i agree with bull in holding -lrb- greek : apò tou hymetérou génous -rrb- the most probable reading in the passage cite from justin and be by no means convince that the celebrated passage in josephus be a interpolation but i do not believe that such man as be here describe ever profess themselves christian or be or could have be baptize ib p 292 le clerc would appear to doubt whether the person point to in justin really deny christ 's divine nature or no it be as plain as possible that they do le clerc be no favorite of mine and waterland be a prime favorite nevertheless in this instance i too doubt with le clerc and more than doubt ib p 338 -lrb- greek : phúsei dè

fragment he would never have compliment the follow extract from irenæus as say the same thing in fuller and stronger word compare with the fragment from justin it be but the flat common-place logic of analogy so common in the early father ib p 340 ` qui nude tantum hominem eum dicunt ex joseph generatum \* \* moriuntur ' ` non nude hominem ' -- not a mere man do i hold jesus to have be and to be but a perfect man and by personal union with the logo perfect god that he have a earthly father might be requisite to he be a perfect man i can readily suppose but why the have a earthly father should be more incompatible with he perfect divinity than he have a earthly mother i can not comprehend all that john and paul believe god forbid that i should not chap vii p 389 it be a sufficient reason for not receive either they -lrb- ` arian doctrine ' -rrb- or the interpretation bring to support they that the ancient in the best and purest time either know nothing of they or if they do condemn they as excellent means of raise a presumption in the mind of the falsehood of arianism and socinianism and thus of prepare the mind for a docile reception of the great idea itself -- i admit and value the testimony from the writings of the early father but alas the increase dimness end in the final want of the idea of this all-truths - include truth of the tetracty eternally manifest in the triad -- this this be the ground and cause of all the main heresy from semi-arianism recall by dr samuel clarke to the last setting ray of depart faith in the necessitarian psilanthropism of dr priestley ib p 41-2 & c i can not but think that waterland 's defense of the father in these page against barbeyrac be below he great power and characteristic vigor of judgment it be enough that they the father of the first three century be the light of they age and worthy of all reverence for they good gift but it appear to I impossible to deny they credulity they ignorance with one or two exception in the interpretation of the old testament or they hardihood in assert the truth of whatever they think it for the interest of the church and for the good of soul to have believe as true a

religious duty in anecdote of this kind and in the instance of eminently good man it be that my head and heart have they most obstinate fall out the question be : -- to what extent the undoubted subjective truth may legitimately influence we judgment as to the possibility of the objective ib p 67 the bishop then give he the living of pettigo in a wild part of the county of donegal have make

yet extinct among we prelate yet it be impossible to compare the present condition of the church and the disposal of its dignity and emolument with the fact record in this life without a honest exultation ib p 106 he once declare to I that he would resign he live if the athanasian creed be remove from the prayer book and i be sure he would have do so surely there be more zeal than wisdom in this declaration do the athanasian or rather the ` pseudo ' - athanasian creed differ from the nicene or not if not it must be dispensable at least if not superfluous if it do differ which of the two be i to follow -- the profession of a anonymous individual or the solemn decision of upward of three hundred bishop convene from all part of the christian world vol i p 177-180 no problem more difficult or of more delicate treatment than the ` criterion ' of miracle yet none on which young divine be fonder of display they gift nor be this the worst they charity too often go to wreck from the error of identify the faith in christ with the argument by which they think it be to be support but surely if two believer meet at the same goal of faith it be a very secondary question whether they travel thither by the same road of argument in this and other passage of skelton i recognize and reverence a vigorous and robust intellect but i complain of a turbidness in he reasoning a huddle in he sequence and here and there a semblance of argue in a circle -- from the miracle to the doctrine and from the doctrine to the miracle add to this a too little advertency to the distinction between the evidence of a miracle for a a eye-witness and for b for whom it be the relation of a miracle by a assert eye-witness and again between b and x y z for whom it be a fact of history the result of my own meditation be that the evidence of the gospel take as a total be as great for the christian of the nineteenth century as for those of the apostolic age i should not be startle if i be tell it be greater but it do not follow that this equally hold good of each component part a evidence of the most cogent clearness unknown to the primitive christian may compensate for the evanescence of some evidence which they enjoy evidence comparatively dim have wax into noon-day splendor and the comparative wane of other once effulgent be more than indemnify by the ` synopsis ' -lrb- greek : tou pántos -rrb- which we enjoy and by the standing miracle of a christendom commensurate and almost synonymous with the civilized world i make this remark for the purpose of warn the divinity student against the disposition to overstrain particular proof or rest the credibility of the gospel too exclusively on some one favorite point i confess that i can not peruse page 179 without fancy that i be read some romish doctor 's work date from a community where miracle be the ordinary news of the day p s by the by the rev philip skelton be of the true irish breed that be a brave fellow but a bit of a bully arrah by st pathrick but i shall make cold mutton of you misther arian ib p 182 if in this he appear to deal fairly by we prove such thing as admit of it by reason and such as do not by the authority of he miracle & c be ` we ' likely to have miracle perform or pretend before we eye if not what may all this mean if skelton take for grant the veracity of the evangelist and the precise verity of the gospel the truth and genuineness of the miracle be include : -- and if not what do he prove the exact accordance of the miracle relate with the ideal of a true miracle in the reason do indeed furnish a argument for the probable truth of the relation but this do not seem to be skelton 's intention ib p 185 but to remedy this evil as far as the nature of the thing will permit a genuine record of the true religion must be keep up that its article may not be in danger of total corruption in such a sink of opinion anything rather than seek a remedy in that which scripture itself declare the only one alas these bewilderment -lrb- the romanist urge -rrb- have take place especially through and by the misuse of the scripture whatever god have give we ought to think necessary -- the scripture the church the spirit why disjoin they ib p 186 now a perpetual miracle consider as the evidence of any thing be nonsense because be it at first ever so apparently contrary to the known course of nature it must in time be take for the natural effect of some unknown cause as all physical ` phænomena ' if far enough trace always be and consequently must fall into a level as to a capacity of prove any thing with the most ordinary appearance of nature which though all of they miracle as to the primary cause of they production can never be apply to the proof of a inspiration because ordinary and common i doubt this though i have no doubt that it would be pernicious the yearly blossoming of aaron 's rod be against skelton who confound single fact with class of ` phænomena ' and he draw he conclusion from a arbitrary and as seem to I senseless definition of a miracle ib p 214 end of discourse ii skelton appear to have confound two error very different in kind and in magnitude -- that of the infidel against whom he argument be with few exception irrefragable and that of the christian who sincerely believe the law the prophecy the miracle and the doctrine all in short which in the scripture themselves be declare to have be reveal do not attribute the same immediate divinity to all and every part of the remainder it would doubtless be more christian-like to substitute the view express in the next discourse -lrb- iii -rrb- but still the latter error be not as the former ib p 234 but why should not the conclusion be give up since it be possible christ may have have two nature in he so as to have be less than the father in respect to the one and equal to he in respect to the other i understand these word -lrb- ` my father be greater than i ' -rrb- of the divinity -- and of the filial subordination which do not in the least encroach on the equality necessary to the unity of father son and spirit bishop bull do the same see too skelton 's own remark in discourse v p 265 ib p 251 this be necessary because they law be ordain by angel now this be a instance of what i can not help regard as a superstitious excess of reverence for single text we know that long before the epistle to the hebrew be write the alexandrian church which by its intercourse with greek philosopher chiefly platonist have become ashamed of the humanities of the hebrew scripture in defiance of those scripture have pretend that it be not the supreme be who give the law in person to mose but some of he angel the author of the epistle to the hebrew argue ` ad homine ' avail himself of this in order to prove that on they own grounds the mosaic be of dignity inferior to the christian dispensation to get rid of this no-difficulty in a single verse or two in the epistle skelton throw a insurmountable difficulty on the whole mosaic history ib p 265 therefore he saith ` i ' -lrb- as a man -rrb- ` can of myself do nothing ' even of this text i do not see the necessity of skelton 's parenthesis -lrb- as a man -rrb- nay it appear to I -lrb- i confess -rrb- to turn a sublime and most instructive truth into a truism but if not as the son of god therefore ' a fortiorus ' not as the son of man and more especially as such in all that refer to the redemption of mankind ib p 267 to this glory christ as god be entitle from all eternity but do not acquire a right to it as man till he have pay the purchase by he blood i too hold this for a most important truth but yet could wish it to have be somewhat differently express as thus : -- but do not acquire it as man till the means have be provide and perfect by he blood ib p 268 if christ in one place -lrb- ` john ' xiv 28 -rrb- say ` my father be greater than i ' he must be understand of he relation to the father as he son bear of a woman i do not see the necessity of this : do not christ say ` my father and i will come and we will dwell in you ' nay i dare confidently affirm that in no one passage of st john 's gospel be we lord declare in any special sense the son of the first person of the trinity in reference to he birth from a woman and remember it be from st john 's gospel that the word be cite so too the answer to philip ought to be interpret by ch i 18 of the same gospel ib p 276 i confess i do not agree with skelton 's interpretation of any of these text entirely because i hold the nicene faith and revere the doctrine of the trinity as the fundamental article of christianity i apply to christ as the second person almost all the text which skelton explain of he humanity at all event 1 consider ` the first-born of every creature ' as a false version of the word which -lrb- as the argument and follow verse prove -rrb- should be render ` beget before ' -lrb- or rather ` superlatively before ' -rrb- ` all that be create or make for by he ' they be make ib ` of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angel which be in heaven neither the son but the father ' i can not explain myself here but i have long think that we savior mean in these word -lrb- greek : ainíttein tàen théotaeta ahutou -rrb- -- and that like the problem propose by he to the scribe they be intend to prepare the mind of the disciple for this awful mystery -- -lrb- greek : ei màe ho patáer -rrb- -- unless or if not as the father know it while in st matthew the equivalent sense be give by the omission of the -lrb- greek : oud ' ho uhíos -rrb- and its inclusion in the father ` as the father knoweth I so know i the father ' it would have be against the general rule of scripture prophecy and the intention of the revelation in christ that the first christian should have be so influence in they measure and particular action as they could not but have be by a particular foreknowledge of the express and precise time at which jerusalem be to be destroy to reconcile they to this uncertainty we lord first teach they to consider this destruction the close of one great epoch or -lrb- greek : aiôn -rrb- as the type of the final close of the whole world of time that be of all temporal thing and then reason with they thus : -- wonder not that i should leave you ignorant of the former when even the highest order of heavenly intelligence know not the latter -lrb- greek : oud ' ho uhíos eus màe ho patáer -rrb- nor should i myself but that the father know it all whose will be essentially know to I as the eternal son but even to I it be not revealably communicate such seem to I the true sense of this controverted passage in mark and that it be bear out by many parallel text in st john and that the correspondent text in matthew which omit the -lrb- greek : oud ' ho huíos -rrb- convey the same sense in equivalent term the word -lrb- greek : emou -rrb- include the son in the -lrb- greek : patàer mónos -rrb- for to he only-begotten son before all time the father showeth all thing ib p 279 but whether we can reconcile these word to we belief of christ 's prescience and divinity or not matter little to the debate about he divinity itself since we can so fully prove it by innumerable passage of scripture too direct express and positive to be balance by one obscure passage from ` whence the arian be to draw the consequence himself which may possibly be wrong ' very good ib p 280 ` we know that the son of god be come and have give we a understanding that we may know he that be true and we be in he that be true even in he son jesus christ this be the true god and eternal life ' -- l john v 20 the whole connection evidently show the word to be speak of christ that the word comprehend christ be most evident all that can be fairly conclude from 1 cor viii 6 be this : -- that the apostle paul and john speak of the father as include and comprehend the son and the holy ghost as he word and he spirit but of these as infer or suppose the father not comprehend he whenever therefore respect the godhead itself contain both deity and dominion the term god be distinctively use it be apply to the father and lord to the son ib p 281 but farther it be object that christ can not be god since god call he ` he servant ' more than once particularly ` isaiah ' xlii 1 the prophet often speak of the anti-type or person typify in language appropriate to and suggest by the type itself so perhaps in this passage if as i suppose hezekiah be the type immediately present to isaiah 's imagination however skelton 's answer be quite sufficient ib p 287 hence it appear that in the passage object -lrb- 1 ` cor ' xv 24 & c -rrb- christ be speak of purely as that man whom ` god have highly exalted and to whom he have give a name which be above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow ' -lrb- phil ii 9 10 -rrb- i must confess that this exposition do not quite satisfy I i can not help think that something more and deeper be mean by the apostle and this must be seek for in the mystery of the trinity itself ` in which ' -lrb- mystery -rrb- ` all treasure of knowledge be hide ' ib p 318 hence perhaps may be best explain what st peter say in the second epistle after plead a miracle ` we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed ' i believe that st peter neither say it nor mean this but that -lrb- greek : bebaióteron -rrb- follow ` the prophetic word ' we have also the word of prophecy more firm -- that be we have in addition to the evidence of the miracle themselves this further confirmation that they be the fulfilment of known prophecy ib p 327 agreeable to these passage of the prophet st peter tell we -lrb- ` act ' x 38 -rrb- ` god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and power ' i have often to complain that too little attention be pay by commentator to the history and particular period in which certain speech be deliver or word write could st peter with propriety have introduce the truth to a prejudiced audience with its deepest mystery must he not have begin with the most evident fact ib disc viii the doctrine of the holy trinity vindicate be i a clergyman the paragraph from p 366 to p 370 both inclusive of this discourse should form the conclusion of my sermon on trinity Sunday -- whether i preached at st jame 's or in a country village ib pp 374-378 as a reason why we should doubt we own judgment it be quite fair to remind the objector that the same difficulty occur in the scheme of god 's ordinary providence but that a difficulty in a suppose article of reveal truth be solve by the occurrence of the same or of a equivalent difficulty in the common course of human affair -- this i find it hard to conceive how be the religious as distinguish from the moral sense first awaken what make the human soul feel the necessity of a faith in god but the apparent incongruity of certain dispensation in this world with the idea of god with the law write in the heart be not the reconciling of these fact or ` phænomena ' with the divine attribute one of the purpose of a reveal religion but even this be not a full statement of the defect complain of in this solution a difficulty which may be only apparent -lrb- like that other of the prosperity of the wicked -rrb- be solve by the declaration of its reality a difficulty ground on the fact of temporal and outward privation and suffering be solve by be infinitely increase that be by the assertion of the same principle on the determination of we inward and everlasting weal and woe that there be nothing in the christian faith or in the canonical scripture when rightly interpret that require such a argument or sanction the recourse to it i believe myself to have prove in the aid to reflection for observe that to solve have a scientific and again a religious sense and that in the latter a difficulty be satisfactorily solve as soon as its insolvibility for the human mind be prove and account for ib -lrb- disc xiv pp 500-502 -rrb- christianity prove by miracle i can not see and never could the purpose or ` cui bono ' of this reasoning to whom be it address to a man who deny a god or that god can reveal he will to mankind if such a man be not below talk to he must first be convince of he miserable blindness respect these truth for these be clearly presuppose in every proof of miracle generally again do he admit the authenticity of the gospel and the veracity of the evangelist do he credit the fact there related and as related if not these point must be prove for these be clearly presuppose in all reasoning on the particular miracle of the christian dispensation if he do can he deny that many act of christ be wonderful -- that reanimate a dead body in which putrefaction have already commence -- and feed four thousand man with a few loaf and fish so that the fragment leave greatly exceed the original total quantity -- be wonderful event should such a man ` compo menti ' exist -lrb- which i more than doubt -rrb- what could a wise man do but stare -- and leave he christ work many wonderful work imply admirable power and direct to the most merciful and beneficent end and these act be such sign of he divine mission as render inattention or obstinate averseness to the truth and doctrine which he promulgate inexcusable and indeed on any hypothesis but that of immoral disposition and prejudice utterly inconceivable in what respect i pray can this statement be strengthen by any reasoning about the nature and distinctive essence of miracle ` in abstracto ' what purpose can be answer by any pretended definition of a miracle if i meet with a disputatious word-catcher or logomachist who seek to justify he unbelief on this ground i should not hesitate to say -- never mind whether it be a miracle or no call it what you will -- but do you believe the fact do you believe that christ do by force of he will and word multiply instantaneously twelve loaf and a few small fish into sufficient food for a hungering multitude of four thousand man and woman when i meet with or from credible authority hear of a man who believe this fact and yet think it no sign of christ 's mission when i can even conceive of a man in he right sens who believe all the fact and event relate in the new testament and as there related do yet remain a deist i may think it time to enter into a disquisition respect the right definition of a miracle and meantime i humbly trust that believe with my whole heart and soul in the wonderful work of we lord and savior jesus christ i shall not forfeit my title of christian though i should not subscribe to this or that divine 's right definition of he ` idea ' of a miracle which word be with I no ` idea ' at all but a general term the common surname as it be of the wonderful work work by the messenger of god to man in the patriarchal mosaic and christian dispensation it be to these notion and general definition far more than to the fact themselves that the argument of infidel apply and from which they derive they plausibility nor be this all the infidel imitate the divine and adopt the same mode of argue namely by this substantiation of mere general or collective term for instance hume 's argument -lrb- state by the by before he be bear and far more forcibly by dr south who place it in the mouth of thoma -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- -- reduce it to the particular fact in question and its whole speciousness vanish i be speaking of the particular fact and action of the gospel of those and those only now that i should be deceive or the eye-witness have be deceive under all the circumstance of those miracle with all antecedent accompaniment and consequent be quite as contrary to that be unparalleled in my experience as the return to life of a dead man so again in the second paragraph of page 502 -lrb- 3 -rrb- the position be true or false accord to the definition of a miracle in the narrower sense of the term miracle -- that be a consequent present to the outward sens without a adequate antecedent ejusdem generi -- it be not only false but detractory from the christian religion it be a main nay a indispensable evidence but it be not the only no nor if comparison be at all allowable the highest and most efficient unless indeed the term evidence be itself confine to grounds of conviction offer to the sens but then the position be a mere truism there be yet another way of reasoning which i utterly dislike namely by put imaginary case of imaginary miracle as paley have do if a dozen different individual all man of known sense and integrity should each independently of the other pledge they everlasting weal on the truth that they see a man behead and quarter and that on a certain person 's prayer or bidding the quarter reunite and then a new head grow on and from out of the stump of the neck : and should the man himself assure you of the same shew you the juncture and identify himself to you by some indelible mark with which you have be previously acquaint -- could you withstand this evidence what could a judicious man reply but -- when such a event take place i will tell you but what have this to do with the reason for we belief in the truth of the write record of the old and new testament why do you fly off from the fact to a gigantic fiction -- when the possibility of the ` if ' with respect to a much less startling narration be the point in dispute between we such and so peculiar and to a honest mind so unmistakeable be the character of veracity and simplicity on the very countenance as it be of the gospel that every remove of the inquirer 's attention from the fact themselves be a remove of he conversion it be you business to keep he from wander not to set he the example never surely be there a more unequal writer than skelton -- in the discourse on the trinity the compeer of bull and waterland and yet the writer of these page 500-501 natural magic a stroke of art for example convert the nile into blood and then he definition of a miracle suspension of the law of nature suspension -- law -- nature bless I a chapter would be require for the explanation of each several word of this definition and little less than omniscience for its application in any one instance a effect present to the sens without any adequate antecedent ` ejusdem generis ' be a miracle in the philosophic sense thus : the corporeal ponderable hand and arm raise with no other known causative antecedent but a think a pure act of a immaterial essentially invisible imponderable will be a miracle for a reflect mind add the word ` præter experientiam ' : and we have the definition of a miracle in the popular practical and appropriate sense vol iii that all we thought and view respect we faith should be consistent with each other and with the attribute of god be most highly desirable : but when the great diversity of man 's understanding and the unavoidable influence of circumstance on the mind be consider we may hope from the divine mercy that the agreement in the result will suffice and that he who sincerely and efficiently believe that christ leave the glory which he have with the father before all world to become man and die for we salvation -- that by he we may and by he alone we can be save -- will be hold a true believer -- whether he interpret the word ` sacrifice ' ` purchase ' ` bargain ' ` satisfaction ' of the creditor by full payment of the ` debt ' and the like as proper and literal expression of the redeeming act and the cause of we salvation as skelton seem to have do -- or -lrb- as i do -rrb- as figurative language truly designate the effect and consequence of this adorable act and process ib p 393 but be the prospect of a better parish in case of greater diligence set before he by he bishop on the music of such a promise like one bit by a ` tarantula ' we should probably soon see he in motion and serve god -lrb- o shameful -rrb- for the sake of mammon as if he torpid body have be animated anew by a return soul without any high-flying in christian morality i can not keep shrink from the wish here express at all event i can not sympathize with or participate in the expectation of a infinite advancement from man so motived ib p 394 yet excommunication the inherent discipline of the church which it exercise under persecution which it be still permit to exercise under the present establishment rarely i suspect without expose the clergyman to the risk of a action for damages or some abuse there be few subject that more need investigation yet require more vigor and soundness of judgment to be rightly handle than this of christian discipline in a church establish by law it be indeed a most difficult and delicate problem and supply baxter with a most plausible and to I the only perplexing of he numerous objection to we ecclesiastical constitution on the other hand i see clearly that he be require a impossibility and that he argument carry on to its proper consequence conclude against all church establishment not more against the national church of which he complain than the one of he own clipping and shaping which he would have substitute consequently every proof -lrb- and i see many and satisfactory proof -rrb- of the moral and political necessity of a established church be at the same time a pledge that a deeper insight would detect some flaw in the reasoning of the disciplinarian for if a be right and requisite b which be incompatible with a can not be rightly require and this it be that first lead I to the distinction between the ` ecclesium ' and a ` enclesium ' concern which see my essay on establishment and dissent in which i have meet the objection to my position that christian discipline be incompatible with a church establish by law from the fact of the discipline of the church of scotland -lrb- 4 -rrb- who deny that it be in the power of a legislature to punish certain offence by ignominy and to make the clergy magistrate in reference to these the question be whether it be wise or expedient which it may be or rather may have be in scotland and the contrary in england wise or unwise this be not discipline not christian discipline enforce only by spiritual motive enact by spiritual authority and submit to for conscience ' sake ib p 446 be this as it may the foreknowledge and the decree be both eternal here now it be a clear point that the moral action of all accountable agent be with certainty fore-known and they doom unalterably fix long before any one of they exist strange that so great a man as skelton should first affirm eternity of both yet in the next sentence talk of long before these reflection -lrb- 5 -rrb- be excellent but here skelton offend against he own canon i should feel no reluctance moral or speculative in accept the apparent necessity of both proposition as a sufficient reason for believe both and the transcendancy of the subject as a sufficient solution of they apparent incompatibility but yet i think that another view of the subject not less congruous with universal reason and more agreeable to the light of reason in the human understanding might be defend without detract from any perfection of the divine be nay i think that skelton need but one step more to have see it ib p 478 ` in fine ' to what purpose be these reflection take as a whole written i can not answer to dissuade man from reasoning on a subject beyond we faculty then why all this reasoning vol iv p 28 deism reveal ` shepherd ' be you ever at constantinople sir ` dechaine ' never `

be such a man as cæsar ` dech ' by no means ` shep ' and you have all you know concern the being of either the city or the man merely from the report of other who have it from other and so on through many link of tradition ` dech ' i have ` shep ' you see then that there be certain case in which the evidence of thing not see nor either sensibly or demonstrably perceive can justly challenge so entire a assent that he who should pretend to refuse it in the fullest measure of acquiescence would be deservedly esteem the most stupid or perverse of mankind that there be a sophism here every one must feel in the very fact of be ` non-plus would ' without be convince the sophism consist in the instance be ` haud ejusdem generi ' -lrb- -lrb- greek : élegchos metabáseôs eis állo génos -rrb- -rrb- and what the allogeneity be between the assurance of the being of madrid or constantinople and the belief of the fact of the resurrection of christ i have show elsewhere the universal belief of the ` tyrannicidium ' of julius cæsar be doubtless a fairer instance but the whole mode of argument be unsound and unsatisfying why run off from the fact in question or the class at least to which it belong the victory can be but accidental -- a victory obtain by the unguarded logic or want of logical foresight of the antagonist who need only narrow he position to narration of fact and event in we judgment of which we be not aid by the analogy of previous and succeed experience to deprive you of the opportunity of skirmishing thus on no man 's land but this be skelton 's ruling passion sometimes he strength -- too often he weakness he must force the reader to believe : or rather he have a antagonist a wilful infidel or heretic always and exclusively before he imagination or if he think of the reader at all it be as of a partizan enjoy every hard thump and smash ` fister ' he give the adversary whom skelton hate too cordially to endure to obtain any thing from he with he own liking no it must be against he will and in spite of it no thanks to he -- the dog could not help himself how much more effectual would he have find it to have commence by place himself in a state of sympathy with the suppose sceptic or unbeliever -- to have state to he he own feeling and the real grounds on which they rest -- to have show himself the difference between the historical fact which the sceptic take for grant and believe spontaneously as it be -- and those which be to be the subject of discussion and this bring the question at once to the proof and here after all lie the strength of skelton 's reasoning which would have work far more powerfully have it come first and single and with the whole attention direct towards it ib p 35 ` templeton ' surely the resurrection of christ or any other man can not be a thing impossible with god it be neither above he power nor when employ for a sufficient purpose inconsistent with he majesty wisdom and goodness this be the ever open and vulnerable part of deism the deist as a deist believe ` implicite ' at least so many and stupendous miracle as to render he disbelief of lesser miracle simply because they be miraculous gross inconsistency to have the battle fairly fight out spinoza or a bhuddist or a burmese gymnosoph should be challenge then i be deeply persuade would the truth appear in full evidence that no christ no god -- and conversely if the father then the son i can never too often repeat that reveal religion be a pleonasm -- religion be revelation and revelation the only religion ib p 37 ` shep ' those believer whose faith be to rely on the truth of the christian history rest they assent on a write report make by eye-witness which report the various church and sect jealous of one another take care to preserve genuine and uncorrupted at least in all material point and all the religious writer in every age since have amply attest a divine of the present day who shall undertake the demonstration of the truth of christianity by external evidence or historically must not content himself with assume or assert this he must either prove it or prove that such proof be not necessary i myself should be quite satisfied if i prove the former position in respect to the fourth gospel and show that the evidence of the other three be equivalent to a record by a eye-witness : which would not be at all inconsistent with my contend at the same time for the authenticity of the first gospel or rather for the catholic interpretation of the title-word -lrb- greek : katà matthaion -rrb- as the more probable opinion which a sound divine will neither abandon nor overload neither place it in the foundation nor on the other hand suffer it to be extrude from the wall believe I there be great very great danger in these broad unqualified assertion that skelton deal in even though the balance of evidence should be on he side yet the inquirer will be unfavourably affect by the numerous doubt and difficulty which a acquaintance with the more modern work of biblical criticism will pour upon he and for which he mind be wholly unprepared to meet with a far weaker evidence than we have take it for grant we be to find give the same shake to the mind that miss a stair give to the body ib p 243 ` temp ' you mr dechaine seem to forget that god be just and you mr shepherd that he be merciful ` dech ' i insist that as god be merciful he will forgive ` shep ' and i insist that as he be just he will punish ` temp ' pray mr dechaine be you able upon the deistical scheme to rid yourself of this difficulty ` dech ' i see no difficulty in it at all god give we law only for we good and will never suffer those law to become a snare to we and the occasion of we eternal misery here be the ` cardo ' the man of sense assert that it be necessary for the good of all that a code of law should exist while yet it be impossible that all should at all time be obey by each person : but what be impossible can not be require nevertheless it may be require that no ` iota ' of any one of these law should be wilfully and deliberately transgress nor be there any one for the transgression of which the transgressor must not hold himself punishable and yet -lrb- say we man of sense -rrb- what may not be say of any one point or any one moment can not be deny of the collective agency of a whole life or any considerable section of it here we find ourselves constrain by we best feeling to praise or condemn to reward or punish accord as a great predominance of act of obedience or disobedience and a continued love of the better or the lust after the worst manifest the maxim -lrb- ` regulum maximum ' -rrb- the radical will and proper character of the individual so parent judge of they child so schoolmaster of they scholar so friend of friend and even so will god judge he creature if we be to trust in we common sense or believe the repeat declaration in the old testament and now i should be glad to hear any satisfactory ` sensible ' reply to this or any answer that do not fly higher than ` sense ' can follow and pierce into the thick cloud of decry metaphysics for no fair reply can be imagine but one which would find the root of the moral evil the true -lrb- greek : ponaerón -rrb- in this very impossibility ib p 249 ` cunningham ' but how do all this discourse about sacrifice and the natural light show that you faith do not ascribe injustice to god in put a innocent person to death for the transgression of the guilty ` shep ' be christ innocent ` cunn ' ` he be without sin ' `

be to answer as well as i for say that god predetermine the death of this only innocent person i be less pleased with this volume than with any of the precede ask you own heart and conscience whether -lrb- for instance -rrb- they be satisfy with this defense ` duri per durius ' : or whether frightening a modest query into silence by pervert it into a accusation of the almighty by virtue of a conclusion borrow from the calvinistic theory of predestination be not more in the spirit of job 's comforter than become a minister of the apostolic church of england and ireland such argument be but edge-tool at the safest but more often they may rather be liken to the two-edged blade of parysati 's knife the one of which be poison leave they to calvin or those who dare appropriate calvin 's word that god 's absolute will be the only rule of he justice -- thus divide the divine attribute yet calvin himself distinguish the hide from the reveal god even as the greek father distinguish the -lrb- greek : thélaema theou -rrb- the absolute ground of all be from the -lrb- greek : boulàe tou theou -rrb- as the cause and dispose providence of all existence but i disapprove of the plan and spirit of this work -lrb- deism reveal -rrb- the cold-hearted worldly-minded cunning deist or the coarse sensual infidel be of all man the least likely to be convert and the conscientious inquire though mislead and perplexed sceptic will throw aside a book at once as not applicable to he case which treat every doubt as a crime and suppose that there be no doubt at all possible but in a bad heart and from wicked wish compare this with st paul 's language concern the jew so again pp 225 & c of this volume do not the plainest intuition of we moral and rational be confirm the position here attribute to the deist dechaine be they not the same by which melancthon de-calvinize at least de-augustinized the heroic luther -- those which constitute one of the only two essential difference between the augsburg confession and the calvinistic article of faith and can anything be more flittery and special-pleading than skelton 's objection and again p 507 and that prayer which he -lrb- tindal -rrb- be report to have use a little before he death ` if there be a god i desire he may have mercy on I ' -- be it christian-like to publish and circulate a blind report -- so improbable and disgusting as to demand the strongest and most unsuspicious testimony for its reception ib p 268 ` shep ' pray mr dechaine if a person whom you know to be a honest and clear-sighted man should solemnly assure you he see a dead man restore to life what would you think of he testimony ` dech ' as i could not possibly have as strong a assurance of he honesty clear-sightedness and penetration as of the great improbability of the fact i should not believe he ` shep ' well it be true he might be deceive himself or intend to impose on you but in case ten such person should all at different time confirm the

advantage gain by assert more i must lose all power of distinction before i can affirm that the genuineness of the first gospel -- that in its present form it be write by matthew or be a literal

that such a equality would destroy the divine unity : a thought of this kind never seem to have occur to they mind in so truly excellent a book as this be i regret that this position should rest on a assertion the equality of christ would not indeed destroy the unity of god the father consider as one person : but unless we presume the jew in question acquaint with the great truth of the tri-unity we must admit that it would be consider as imply ditheism now that some among the jew have make very near approach though blended with error to the doctrine teach in john c i we can prove from the writings of philo -- and the socinian can never prove that these jew do not know at least of the doctrine of they school concern the only-begotten word -- -lrb- greek : lógos monogenáes -rrb- -- not as a attribute much less as a abstraction or personification -- but as a distinct ` hypostasis ' -lrb- greek : symphysikáe -rrb- : - and hence it might be show that they offence be that the carpenter 's son the galilean should call himself the -lrb- greek : theòs phanerós -rrb- this might have be render more than probable by the conclude sentence of christ 's answer to the disciple of john -- ` and bless be he whosoever shall not be offend in I ' -lrb- luke vii 23 -rrb- which appear to have no adequate or even tolerable meaning unless in reference to the passage in isaiah -lrb- lxi 1 2 -rrb- prophesy that jehovah himself would come among they and do the thing which we savior state himself to have do thus too i regret that the answer of we lord -lrb- john x 34-36 -rrb- be one of the imagine strong-hold of the socinian should not have be more fully clear up i doubt not that fuller 's be a true interpretation and that no other be consistent with we lord 's various other declaration but the word in and by themselves admit a more plausible misinterpretation than be elsewhere the case of socinian displanation in short i think both passage would have be better defer to a further part of the work let I add that a mighty and comparatively new argument against the socinian may be most unanswerably deduce from this reply of we lord 's even be it consider as a mere ` argumentum ad homine ' : -- namely that it be not he messiahship that so offend the jew but he sonship otherwise we savior 's language would have neither force motive or object even be i no more than the messiah in you meanest conception of that character yet after what i have do before you eye nothing but malignant heart could have prevent you from adopt a milder interpretation of my word when in you own scripture there exist a precedent that so much more than merely justify I and this i believe to be the meaning of the word as intend to be understand by the jew in question though doubtless fuller 's sense exist ` implicite ' no candid person would ever call it a evasion to prove the injustice and malignity of a accuser even from he own grounds : -- you charge I falsely but even be you charge true namely that i be a mere man and yet call myself the son of god still it would not follow that i have be guilty of blasphemy but as understand by the modern unicist it would verily verily be a evasive ambiguity most unworthy of christian belief concern he savior common charity would have demand of he to have say : -- i be a mere man : i do not pretend to be more but i use the word in analogy to the word ` ye be as god ' and i have a right to do so : for though a mere man i be the great prophet and messenger which mose promise you letter v p 72 if dr priestley have form he estimate of human virtue by that great standard which require love to god with all the heart soul mind and strength and we neighbor as ourselves -- instead of represent man by nature as have more virtue than vice -- he must have acknowledge with the scripture that ` the whole world lieth in wickedness -- that every thought and imagination of they heart be only evil continually ' -- and that ` there be none of they that doeth good no not one ' to this the unicist would answer that by ` the whole world ' be mean all the worldly-minded -- no matter in how direct opposition to half a score other text one text at a time sufficient for the day be the evil thereof -- and in this way they go on pull out hair by hair from the horse 's tail -lrb- say rather dream that they do so -rrb- and then conclude with a shout that the horse never have a tail for why this hair be not a tail nor that nor the third and so on to the very last and how can all do what none of all do -- ridiculous as this be it be a fair image of socinian logic thank god they pluck out be a mere fancy -- and the sole miserable reality be the bare rump which they call they religion -- but that be the ape 's own growth ib p 77 first that all punishment be design for the good of the whole and less or corrective punishment for the good of the offender be admit \* \* god never inflict punishment for the sake of punish this be not -lrb- greek : hôs émoige dokeus -rrb- sufficiently guard that all punishment work for the good of the whole and that the good of the whole be include in god 's design i admit : but that this be the sole cause and the sole justification of divine punishment i can not i dare not concede -- because i should thus deny the essential evil of guilt and its inherent incompatibility with the presence of a being of infinite holiness now exclusion from god imply the sum and utmost of punishment and this would follow from the very essence of guilt and holiness independently of example consequence or circumstance letter vi p 90 -lrb- the system compare as to they tendency to promote morality in general -rrb- i have hitherto make no objection to no remark on any one part of this letter for i object to the whole -- not as calvinism but -- as what calvin would have recoil from how be it that so good and shrewd a man as andrew fuller should not have see that the difference between a calvinist and a priestleyan materialist-necessitarian consist in this : -- the former not only believe a will but that it be equivalent to the ` ego ipse ' to the actual self in every moral agent though he believe that in human nature it be a enslave because a corrupt will in deny free will to the unregenerated he no more deny will than in assert the poor negro in the west indy to be slave i deny they to be man now the latter the priestleyan use the word will -- not for any real distinct correspondent power but -- for the mere result and aggregate of fiber motion and sensation in short it be a mere generic term with he just as when we say the main current in a river now by not advert to this and alas mislead by jonathan edward 's book fuller have hide from himself and he reader the damnable nature of the doctrine -- not of necessity -lrb- for that in its highest sense be identical with perfect freedom they be definition each of the other -rrb- but -- of extraneous compulsion o even this be not adequate to the monstrosity of the think a denial of all agency -- or a assertion of a world of agent that never act but be always act upon and yet without any one be that act -- this be the hybrid of death and sin which throughout this letter be treat so amicably another fearful mistake and which be the ground of the former lie in concede to the materialist ` explicite et implicite ' that the -lrb- greek : noúmenon -rrb- the ` intelligibile ' the ` ipseitas super sensibili ' of guilt be in time and of time and consequently a mechanism of cause and effect -- in other word in confound the -lrb- greek : phainómena tà rhéonta tà màe óntôs ónta -rrb- -- all which belong to time and can not be even think of except as effect necessarily predetermine by the precedent cause -lrb- themselves in they turn effect of other cause -rrb- -- with the transsensual ground or actual power after such admission no other possible defense can be make for calvinism or any other ` ism ' than the wretched recrimination : why yours dr priestley be just as bad -- yea and no wonder : -- for in essential both be the same but there be no reason for fuller 's meddle with the subject at all -- metaphysically i mean ib p 95 if the unconditionality of election render it unfriendly to virtue it must be upon the supposition of that view of thing which attribute more to god and less to man have such ascendancy which be the very reverse of what dr priestley elsewhere teach and that in the same performance but in both system as fuller have erroneously state he own man be annihilate there be neither more nor less it be all god all all be but ` deus infinite modificatus ' : -- in brief both system be not spinosism for no other reason than that the logic and logical consequency of 10 fuller + 10 x 10 dr priestley pile on each other would not reach the calf of spinoza 's leg both system of necessity lead to spinosism nay to all the horrible consequence attribute to it by spinoza 's enemy o why do andrew fuller quit the high vantage ground of notorious fact plain durable common sense and express scripture to delve in the dark in order to countermine mine under a spot on which he have no

a great poet i know from he poem but that he be the greatest of the augustan age i must learn from quinctilian and other ib p 35 philo and the author of the wisdom of solomon -- -lrb- or rather perhaps author for the first ten chapter form a complete work of themselves -rrb- -- be both cabalistico-platonizing jew of alexandrium as far as be such they must agree so far they do agree and as widely as such man could differ do they differ not only the style of the wisdom of solomon be generically different from philo 's -- so much so that i should deem it a free translation from a hebrew original -- but also in all the ` minutiæ ' of traditional history and dogma it contradict philo philo attribute the creation of man to angel and they infuse the evil principle through they own imperfection in the book of wisdom god create man spotless and the devil tempting he occasion the fall so the whole account of the plague of egypt differ as widely as possible even to absolute contradiction the origin of idolatry be explain altogether differently by philo and by the book of wisdom in short so unsupported be the tradition that many have suppose a elder philo as the author that the second and third chapter allude to christ be a groundless hypothesis the ` just man ' be call ` the son of god ' jehovah -lrb- greek : pais kyrión -rrb- -- but christ 's specific title which be deem blasphemous by the jew be ` ben elohim ' -lrb- greek : uhiòs tou theou -rrb- -- and the fancy that philo be a christian in heart but dare not openly profess himself such be too absurd why no trace in he latest work or those of he middle age why not the least variation in he religious or philosophical creed in he latter work write long after the resurrection from those compose by he before or a few year after christ 's birth some of philo 's earlier work must have be write when we lord be in he infancy or at least boyhood in short just take all those passage of philo which most closely resemble other in the wisdom of solomon and contain the same or nearly the same thought and write they in opposite column and no doubt will remain that philo be not the composer of the book of wisdom philo subtle and with long involved period knit together by logical connective : the book of wisdom sententious full of parallelism assertory and hebraistic throughout it be either compose by a man who try to hebraize the greek or if a translator by one who try to greecise the hebraism of he original -- not to disguise or hide they -- but only so as to prevent they from repel or mislead the greek reader the different use of the greek particle in the wisdom of solomon and in the work of philo be sufficient to confute the hypothesis of philo be the author as little could it have be write by a christian for it could not have be a christian of palestine from the overflow alexandrine platonism -- nor a christian at all for it contradict the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and in no wise connect any redemptory or sacrificial virtue with the death of he ` just man ' -- deny original sin in the christian sense and explain the vice and virtue of mankind by the action of the soul of man in a state of pre-existence no sign or miracle be refer to in the account of ` the just man ' and that it be intend as a generalization be evident from the change of the singular into the plural number in the third chapter the result be in my judgment that this book be compose by a unknown jew of alexandrium either sometime before or at the same time with christ i do not think st paul 's parallel passage amount to any proof of quotation or allusion -- they contain the common doctrine of the spiritualize judaism in the cabalum -- and yet the work could scarcely have be write long before christ or it would certainly have be quote or mention by philo and most probably by josephus and this too be a answer to the splendid and well-supported hypothesis of its be a translation from a chaldaic original compose by jerubbabel the variation of the syriac translation -- which be so easily explain by translate the passage into the chaldaic when the cause of the mistake in the greek or of the variation in the syriac be see at once -- be certainly startling but they be too free and how could the father jerome for example remain ignorant of the existence of this chaldaic original my own opinion be as i say before that the book be write in greek by a alexandrian jew who have form he style on that of the lxx and be lead still further to a imitation of the old testament manner by the nature of he fiction and as a dramatic propriety and yet deviate from it partly on account of the very remoteness of he platonic conception from the simplicity and poverty of the hebrew and partly because of the wordy rhetoric epidemic in alexandrium : and that it be write before the death if not the birth of christ i be induce to believe because i do not think it probable that a book compose by a jew who have confess christ after the resurrection would so soon have be receive by the christian and so early place in the very next rank to work of full inspiration take therefore as a work ` ante ' or at least ` extra christum ' it be most valuable as ascertain the opinion of the learn jew on many subject and the general belief concern immortality and a day of judgment on this ground whitaker might have erect a most formidable battery that would have play on the very camp and battle-array of the socinian that be of those who consider christ only as a teacher of important truth in refer to the cabalum i be not ignorant of the date of the oldest rabbinical writings which contain or refer to this philosophy but i coincide with eichorn and very many before eichorn that the foundation of the cabalum be lay and well known long before christ though not all the fanciful superstructure i be persuade that new light might be throw on the apocalypse by a careful study of the book sohar and of whatever else there may be of that kind the introduction -lrb- i 4 -rrb- be clearly cabalum : -- the -lrb- greek : ho ôn kaì ho aen kaì ho erchómenos -rrb- = 3 and the ` seven spirit ' = 10 ` sephiroth ' constitute together the ` adam kadmon ' the second adam of st paul the incarnate one in the messiah be it not for the silence of philo and josephus which i be unable to explain if the wisdom of solomon be write so long before christ i might perhaps incline to believe it compose shortly after if not during the persecution of the jew in egypt under ptolemy philopator this hypothesis would give a particular point to the bitter exposure of idolatry to the comparison between the suffering of the jew and those of idolatrous nation to the long rehearsal and rhetorical declaration of the plague of egypt and to the reward of ` the just man ' after a death of martyrdom and would besides help to explain the put together of the first ten chapter and the fragment contain in the remain chapter they be work write at the same time and by the same author : nay i do not think it absurd to suppose that the chapter after the tenth be annex by the writer himself as a long explanatory appendix or possibly if they be once a separate work these nine conclude chapter be part of a book compose during the persecution in egypt the introduction and termination of which be personal and of local application be afterwards omit or expunge in order not to give offence to the other egyptian -- perhaps to spare the shame of such jew as have apostatize through fear and in general not to revive heart-burning in modern language i should call these chapter in they present state a note on c x 15-19 on a reperusal of this book i rather believe that these latter chapter never form part of any other work but be compose as a sort of long explanatory postscript with particular bearing on certain exist circumstance to which this part of the jewish history be especially applicable nay i begin to find the silence of philo and josephus less inexplicable and to imagine that i discover the solution of this problem in the very title of the book no one expect to find any but work of authenticity enumerate in these writer but to this a work call itself the wisdom of solomon both be a fiction and never mean to pass for anything else could make no pretension to have approximate it to the holy book of the nation would have injure the dignity of the jewish canon and bring suspicion on the genuine work of solomon while it would have expose to a charge of forgery a composition which be in itself only a innocent dramatic monologue n b this hypothesis possess all the advantage and involve none of the absurdity of that which would attribute the ` ecclesiasticus ' to the infamous jason the high priest more than one commentator i find have suspect that the wisdom of solomon and the second book of maccabee be by the same author i think this nothing ib p 36 philo throw out a number of declaration that shew he own and the jewish belief in a secondary sort of god a god subordinate in origin to the father of all yet most intimately unite with he and share he most unquestionable honor the belief of the alexandrian jew who have acquire greek philosophy no doubt -- but of the palestine jew ib 2 p 48 st john also be witness by a heathen -lrb- amelius -rrb- and by one who put he down for a barbarian to have represent the logo as the maker of all thing as with ` god ' and as god and st john be attest to have declare this not even as shaded over but on the contrary as place in full view stranger still whitaker could scarcely have read the greek amelius say that these truth if strip of they allegorical dress -lrb- -lrb- greek : metapephrasména ek tae tou

human nature -- that be with all man that this be he meaning consult plotinus ib 9 p 107 seest thou not add philo in the same spirit of subtilize be into power and divide the logo into two who that have even rest but in the porch of the alexandrian philosophy would not rather say ` of substantiate power and attribute into be ' what be the whole system from philo to plotinus and thence to proclus inclusively but one fanciful process of hypostasize logical conception and generic term in proclus it be logolatry run mad chap iii 1 p 131-2 such would be the evidence for that divinity to accompany the book of wisdom if we consider it to be as old as solomon or only as the son of sirach but i consider it to be much later than either and actually a work of philo 's \* \* the language be very similar to philo 's flow lively and happy how be it possible to have read the short hebraistic sentence of the book of wisdom and the long involved period that characterize the style of all philo 's known writings and yet attribute both to one writer but indeed i know no instance of assertion make so audaciously or of passage misrepresent and even mistranslate so grossly as in this work of whitaker he system be absolute naked tritheism ib the righteous man be shadow out by the author with a plain reference to we savior himself ` let we lie in wait for the righteous ' & c how then could philo have remain a jew ib 2 p 195 in all effect that be voluntary the cause must be prior to the effect as the father be to the son in human generation but in all that be necessary the effect must be coeval with the cause as the stream be with the fountain and light with the sun have the sun be eternal in its duration light would have be co-eternal with it a just remark but it cut two way for these necessary effect be not really but only logically different or distinct from the cause : -- the ray of the sun be only the sun diffuse and the whole rest on the sensitive form of material space take away the notion of material space and the whole distinction perish chap iv 1 p 266 justin accordingly set himself to shew that in the beginning before all creature god generate a certain rational power out of himself be it not monstrous that the jew have accord to whitaker fully believe a trinity one and all but half a century or less before trypho justin should never refer to this general faith never reproach trypho with the present opposition to it as a heresy from they own forefather even those who reject christ or rather jesus as christ -- but no -- not a single objection ever strike mr whitaker or appear worthy of a answer the stupidest become authentic -- the most fantastic abstraction of the alexandrine dreamer substantial reality i confess this book have satisfy I how little erudition will gain a man now-a-days the reputation of vast learning if it be only accompany with dash and insolence it seem to I impossible that whitaker can have write well on the subject of mary queen of scot he power of judgment be apparently so abject for instance he say that the grossest moral improbability be sweep away by positive evidence : -- as if positive evidence -lrb- that be the belief i be to yield to a or b -rrb- be not itself ground on moral probability upon my word whitaker would have be a choice judge for charle ii and titus oate ib p 267 justin therefore proceed to demonstrate it -lrb- the pre-existence of christ -rrb- assert joshua to have give only a temporary inheritance to the jews & c a precious beginning of a precious demonstration it be well for I that my faith in the trinity be already well ground by the scripture by bishop bull and the best part of plotinus or this man would certainly have make I either a socinian or a deist ib 2 p 270 the general mode of commence and conclude the epistle of st paul be a prayer of supplication for the party to whom they be address in which he say ` grace to you and peace from god we father and ' -- from whom besides -- ` the lord jesus christ ' in which we savior be at time invoke alone as ` the grace of we lord jesus christ be with you all ' and be even ` invoke ' the first at time as ` the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all ' shew we plainly & c invoke surely a pious wish be not a invocation may good angel attend you be no

of christian faith nay stranger still : -- to imagine with scotus and mr oxlee that in a scheme which more directly than even the grosser species of atheism preclude all moral responsibility and subvert all essential difference of right and wrong they have find the means of prove and explain the christian doctrine of the trinity and incarnation that be the great and only sufficient antidote of the right faith against this insidious poison for pantheism -- trick it up as you will -- be but a paint atheism a mask of perverted scripture may hide its ugly face but can not change a single feature introduction p 4 in the infancy of the christian church and immediately after the general dispersion which necessarily follow the sack of jerusalem and bither the greek and latin father have the fairest opportunity of dispute with the jew and of evince the truth of the gospel dispensation but unfortunately for the success of so noble a design they be totally ignorant of the hebrew scripture and so want in every argument that stamp of authority which be equally necessary to sanction the principle of christianity and to command the respect of they jewish antagonist for the confirmation of this remark i may appeal to the father themselves but especially to barnaba justin and irenæus who in they several attempt at hebrew learning betray such portentous sign of ignorance and stupidity that we be cover with shame at the sight of they criticism mr oxlee would be delighted in read jacob rhenferd 's disquisition on the ebionite and other suppose heretic among the jewish christian and i can not help think that rhenferd who have so ably anticipate mr oxlee on this point and in jortin 's best manner display the gross ignorance of the gentile father in all matter relate to hebrew learning and the ludicrous yet mischievous result thereof have form a juster though very much lower opinion of these father with a few exception than mr oxlee i confess that till the light of the twofoldness of the christian church dawn on my mind the study of the history and literature of the church during the first three or four century infected I with a spirit of doubt and disgust which require a frequent recurrence to the writings of john and paul to preserve I whole in the faith prop i ch i p 16 the truth of the doctrine be vehemently insist on in a variety of place by the great r mose ben maimon who found upon it the unity of the godhead and rank it among the fundamental article of the jewish religion thus in he celebrated letter to the jew of marseille he observe & c but what be obtain by quotation from maimonide more than from alexander hale or any other schoolman of the same age the metaphysics of the learn jew be derive from the same source namely aristotle and he object be the same as that of the christian schoolman namely to systematize the religion he profess on the form and in the principle of the aristotelian philosophy by the by it be a serious defect in mr oxlee 's work that he do not give the age of the writer whom he cite he can not have expect all he reader to be as learn as himself ib ch iii p 26 mr oxlee seem too much inclined to identify the rabbinical interpretation of scripture text with they true sense when in reality the rabbis themselves not seldom use those interpretation as a convenient and popular mode of convey they own philosophic opinion neither have i be able to admire the logic so general among the divine of both church accord to which if one two or perhaps three sentence in any one of the canonical book appear to declare a give doctrine all assertion of a different character must have be mean to be take metaphorically ib p 26-7 the prophet isaiah too clearly inculcate the spirituality of the godhead in the follow declaration : ` but egypt be man and not god : and they horse flesh and not spirit ' -lrb- c xxxi 3 -rrb- \* \* \* in the former member the prophet declare that egypt be man and not god and then in term of strict opposition enforce the sentiment by add that they cavalry be flesh and not spirit which be just as if he have say : ` but egypt which have horse in war be only a man that be flesh and not god who be spirit ' assuredly this be a false interpretation and utterly unpoetical it be even doubtful whether -lrb- hebrew : unable to transliterate txt ed -rrb- -lrb- ` ruach ' -rrb- in this place mean ` spirit ' in contradistinction to ` matter ' at all and not rather air or wind at all event the poetic decorum the proportion and the antithetic parallelism demand a somewhat as much below god as the horse be below man the opposition of ` flesh ' and ` spirit ' in the gospel of st john who think in hebrew though he write in greek favor we common version -- ` flesh and not spirit ' : but the place in which this passage stand namely in one of the first forty chapter of isaiah and therefore write long before the captivity together with the majestic simplicity characteristic of isaiah 's name give perhaps a greater probability to the other : ` egypt be man and not god and she horse flesh and not wind ' if mr oxlee render the fourth verse of psalm civ -- ` he maketh spirit he messenger ' -lrb- for we version -- ` he maketh he angel spirit ' -- be without a violent inversion senseless -rrb- this be a case in point for the use of the word ` spirit ' in the sense of incorporeal being -lrb- mr oxlee will hardly i apprehend attribute the opinion of some later rabbi that god alone and exclusively be a spirit to the sacred writer easy as it would be to quote a score of text in proof of the contrary -rrb- i however can not doubt that the true rendering of the above-mentioned verse in the psalm be -- ` he maketh the wind he angel or messenger and the lightning he ministrant servant ' as to mr oxlee 's ` abstract intelligence ' i can not but think ` abstract ' for ` pure ' and even pure intelligence for incorporeal a lax use of term with regard to the point in question the truth seem to be this the ancient hebrew certainly distinguish the principle or ground of life understanding and will from ponderable visible matter the former they consider and call ` spirit ' and believe it to be a emission from the almighty father of spirit : the latter they call ` body ' and in this sense they doubtless believe in the existence of incorporeal being but that they have any notion of immaterial being in the sense of des cartes be contrary to all we know of they and of every other people in the same degree of cultivation air fire light express the degree of ascend refinement in the infancy of think the life soul mind be suppose to be air -- ` anima animus ' that be -lrb- greek : ánemos -rrb- spiritus -lrb- greek : pneuma -rrb- in the childhood they be fire ` men ignea igniculum ' and god himself -lrb- greek : pur noeròn pur aeízôon -rrb- lastly in the youth of thought they be refine into light and that light be capable of subsist in a latent state the experience of the stricken flint of lightning from the cloud and the like serve to prove or at least it supply a popular answer to the objection -- if the soul be light why be it not visible that the purest light be invisible to we gross sense and that visible light be a compound of light and shadow be answer of a later and more refined period observe however that the hebrew legislator preclude all unfit application of the materialize fancy by forbid the people to ` imagine ' at all concern god for the ear alone to the exclusion of all other bodily sense be he to be designate that be by the name all else be for the mind -- by power truth wisdom holiness mercy prop ii ch ii p 36 i fear i must surrender my hope that mr oxlee be a exception to the rule that the study of rabbinical literature either find a man ` whimmy ' or make he so if neither the demand of poetic taste nor the peculiar character of oracle be of avail yet morality and piety might seem enough to convince any one that this vision of micaiah -lrb- 2 ` chron ' c xviii 18 & c -rrb- be the poetic form the veil of the prophet 's meaning and a most sublime meaning it be mr oxlee should recollect that the form and personage of vision be all and always symbolical ib pp 39-40 it will not avail we much however to have establish they incorporeity or spirituality if what r mose affirm be true \* \* \* this impious paradox \* \* sway however by the authority of so great a man even r david kimchus have dilapse into the same error & c to what purpose then be the crude metaphysics of these later rabbi bring forward differ as they do in no other respect from the theological ` dictum ' of the schoolman but that they be write in a sort of hebrew i be far from deny that a interpreter of the scripture may derive important aid from the jewish commentator : aben ezra -lrb- about 1150 -rrb- especially be a truly great man but of this i be certain that he only will be benefit who can look down upon they work whilst study they -- that be he must thoroughly understand they weakness superstition and rabid appetite for the marvellous and the monstrous and then read they as a enlighten chemist of the present day would read the writings of the old alchemist or as a linnæus might peruse the work of pliny and aldrovandus if he can do this well -- if not he will line he skull with cobweb ib pp 40 41 but how i would ask be this position to be defend surely not by contradict almost every part of the inspired volume in which such frequent mention occur of different and distinct angel appear to the patriarch and prophet sometimes in group and sometimes in limited number \* \* it be indeed so wholly repugnant to the general tenor of the sacred writings and so abhorrent from the piety of both jew and christian that the learn author himself either forget what he have before advanced or else postpone he philosophy to he religion have absolutely maintain the contrary in he explication of the cherubim & c i be so far from agree with mr oxlee on these point that i not only doubt whether before the captivity any fair proof of the existence of angel in the present sense can be produce from the inspired scripture -- but think also that a strong argument for the divinity of christ and for he presence to the patriarch and under the law rest on the contrary namely that the seraph be image no less symbolical than the cherubim surely it be not presume too much of a clergyman of the church of england to expect that he would measure the importance of a theological tenet by its bearing on we moral and spiritual duty by its practical tendency what be it to we whether angel be the spirit of just man make perfect or a distinct class of moral and rational creature augustine have well and wisely observe that reason recognize only three essential kind -- god man beast try as long as you will you can never make a angel anything but a man with wing on he shoulder ib ch iii p 58 but this deficiency in the mosaic account of the creation be amply supply by early tradition which inculcate not only that the angel be create but that they be create either on the second day accord to r jochanan or on the fifth accord to r chananium inspire scripture amply supply by the talmudic and rabbinical tradition -- this from a clergyman of the church of england i be i confess greatly disappointed i have expect i scarce know why to have have some light throw on the existence of the cabalum in its present form from ezekiel to paul and john but mr oxlee take it as he find it and gravely ascribe this patch-work of corrupt platonism or plotinism with chaldean persian and judaic fable and fancy to the jewish doctor as a original profound and pious philosophy in its fountain-head the indispensable requisite not only to a profitable but even to a safe study of the cabalum be a familiar knowledge of the docimastic philosophy that be a philosophy which have for its object the trial and testing of the weight and measure themselves the first principle definition postulate axiom of logic and metaphysics but this be in no other way possible but by we enumeration of the mental faculty and a investigation of the constitution function limit and applicability ` ad qua re ' of each the application to this subject of the rule and form of the understanding or discursive logic or even of the intuition of the reason itself if reason be assume as the first and highest have pantheism for its necessary result but this the cabalist do : and consequently the cabalistic theosophy be pantheistic and pantheism in whatever drapery of pious phrase disguise be -lrb- where it form the whole of a system -rrb- atheism and preclude moral responsibility and the essential difference of right and wrong one of the two contra-distinction of the hebrew revelation be the doctrine of positive creation this if not the only be the easiest and surest criterion between the idea of god and the notion of a ` men agitan molem ' but this the cabalist evade by they double meaning of the term ` nothing ' namely as nought = 0 and as no ` thing ' and by they use of the term as designate god thus in word and to the ear they teach that the world be make out of nothing but in fact they mean and inculcate that the world be god himself expand it be not therefore half a dozen passage respect the first three ` proprietate ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the sephiroth that will lead a wise man to expect the true doctrine of the trinity in the cabalistic scheme : for he know that the scholastic value the theological necessity of this doctrine consist in its exhibit a idea of god which rescue we faith from both extreme cabalo-pantheism and anthropomorphism it be i say to prevent the necessity of the cabalistic inference that the full and distinct developement of the doctrine of the trinity become necessary in every scheme of dogmatic theology if the first three ` proprietate ' be god so be the next seven and so be all ten god accord to the cabalist be all in each and one in all i do not say that there be not a great deal of truth in this but i say that it be not as the cabalist represent it the whole truth spinoza himself describe he own philosophy as in substance the same with that of the ancient hebrew doctor the cabalist -- only unswathed from the biblical dress ib p 61 similar to this be the declaration of r mose ben maimon for that influence which flow from the deity to the actual production of abstract intelligence flow also from the intelligence to they production from each other in succession & c how much trouble would mr oxlee have save himself have he in sober earnest ask he own mind what he mean by emanation and whether he could attach any intelligible meaning to the term at all as apply to spirit ib p 65 thus have by variety of proof demonstrate the fecundity of the godhead in that all spirituality of whatever gradation have originate essentially and substantially from it like stream from they fountain i avail myself of this as another sound argument that in the sameness of the divine essence subsist a plurality of person a plurality with a vengeance why this be the very scoff of a late unitarian writer -- only that he invert the order mr oxlee prove ten trillion of trillion in the deity in order to deduce ' a fortiorus ' the rationality of three : the unitarian from the three pretend to deduce the equal rationality of as many thousand ib p 66 so if without detriment to piety great thing may be compare with small i would contend that every intelligency descend by way of emanation or impartition from the godhead must need be a personality of that godhead from which it have descend only so vastly unequal to it in personal perfection that it can form no part of its proper existency be not this to all intent and purpose ascribe partibility to god indeed it be the necessary consequence of the emanation scheme -- unequal -- aye various ` wicked ' personality of the godhead -- how do this rhyme -- even as a metaphor emanation be a ill-chosen term for it apply only to fluid ` ramenta ' unravellings thread would

conscience or allay the fanaticism of the methodist themselves this be the uniform and gross mis-statement of the one great point in dispute by which the methodist be represent as hold the compatibility of a impure life with a saving faith : whereas they only assert that the work of righteousness be the consequence not the price of redemption a gift include in the great gift of salvation -- and therefore not of merit but of imputation through the free love of the savior part i p 49 it be enough it seem that all the disorderly class of mankind prompt as they be by they worst

the observance of any law human or divine -- they must not even be entreat to do they best just as ` absurd ' would it be we be tell in a physician to send away he patient when labor under some desperate disease with a recommendation to do he utmost towards he own cure and then to come to he to finish it as it be in the minister of the ` gospel ' to propose to the sinner ` to do he best ' by way of healing the disease of the soul -- and then to come to the lord jesus to perfect he recovery the ` only ' previous qualification be to ` know ' we misery and the remedy be prepared see dr hawker 's work vol vi p 117 for know let the barrister substitute feel that be we know it as we know we life and then ask himself whether the production of such a state of mind in a sinner would or would not be of greater promise as to he reformation than the repetition of the ten commandment with paraphrase on the same -- but why not both the barrister be at least as wrong in the undervaluing of the one as the pseudo-evangelist in the exclusion of the other ib p 51 whatever these new evangelist may teach to the contrary the present state of public moral and of public happiness would assume a very different appearance if the thief swindler and highway robber would ` do they best ' towards maintain themselves by honest labor instead of perpetually plan new system of fraud and new scheme of depredation that be if these thief have a different will -- not a mere wish however anxious : -- for this wish the libertine doubtless have as describe in p 50 -- but a effective will well and who doubt this the point in dispute be as to the means of produce this reformation in the will which whatever the barrister may think christ at least think so difficult as to speak of it not once or twice but uniformly as little less than miraculous as tantamount to a re-creation this barrister may be liken to a ignorant but well-meaning galenist who write against some infamous quack who live by puff and vend pill of mercurial sublimate for all case of a certain description should have no stronger argument than to extol ` sarsaparilla ' and ` lignum vitæ ' or ` senna ' in contempt of all mercurial preparation ib p 56 not for the revenue of a archbishop would he exhort they to a duty ` unknown in scripture ' of add they five talent to the five they have receive & c all this be mere calumny and wilful misstatement of the tenet of wesley who never doubt that we be bind to improve we ` talent ' or on the other hand that we be equally bind have do so to be equally thankful to the giver of all thing for the power and the will by which we improve the talent as for the original capital which be the object of the improvement the question be not whether christ will say ` well do thou good and faithful servant ' & c -- but whether the servant be to say it of himself now christ have deliver as positive a precept against we do this as the promise can be that he will impute it to we if we do not impute it to we own merit ib p 60 the complaint of the profligacy of servant of every class and of the depravity of the time be in every body 's hearing : -- and these evangelical tutor -- the

without sanctification this barrister for ever forget that the whole point in dispute be not concern the possibility of a immoral christian be save which the methodist would deny as strenuously as himself and perhaps give a austerer sense to the word immoral but whether morality or as the methodist would call it sanctification be the price which we pay for the purchase of we salvation with we own money or a part of the same free gift god know i be no advocate for methodism but for fair statement i be and most zealously -- even for the love of logic put honesty out of sight ib p 72 in every age say the moral divine -lrb- blair -rrb- the practice have prevail of substitute certain appearance of piety in the place of the great ` duty ' of humanity and mercy & c will the barrister rest the

` no-doing ' when he come to explain it be not only a act a work but even a very severe and perseverant energy of the will he be therefore to be arraign of nonsense and abuse of word rather than of immoral doctrine ib p 84 the sacred volume of holy writ declare that ` true ' -lrb- pure -rrb- ` religion and undefile before god and the father be this to visit the fatherless and widow in they

a fine burst of rhetoric and not a mere truism just as when we say -- a cheerful heart be a perpetual thanksgiving and a state of love and resignation the truest utterance of the lord 's prayer st jame oppose christianity to the outward sign and ceremonial observance of the jewish and pagan religion but these be the only sure sign these be the most significant ceremonial observance by which you christianity be to be make know -- ` to visit the fatherless ' & c true religion do not consist ` quoad essentiam ' in these act but in that habitual state of the whole moral be which manifest itself by these act -- and which act be to the religion of christ that which ablutions sacrifice and temple-going be to the mosaic religion namely its genuine -lrb- greek : thraeskeía -rrb- that which be the religion of mose be the ceremonial or cult of the religion of christ mose command all good work even those state by st jame as the means of temporal felicity and this be the mosaic religion and to these he add a multitude of symbolical observance and these form the mosaic cult -lrb- ` cultus religioni ' -lrb- greek : thraeskeía -rrb- -rrb- christ command holiness out of perfect love that be christian religion and add to this no other ceremony or symbol than a pure life and active beneficence which -lrb- say st jame -rrb- be the ` true cult ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- ib p 86 there be no one whose writings be better calculate to do good -lrb- than those of paley -rrb- by inculcate the essential duty of common life and the sound truth of practical christianity indeed paley 's whole system be reducible to this one precept : -- obey god and benefit you neighbor because you love yourself above all christ have himself comprise he system in -- love you neighbor as yourself and god above all these sound truth of practical christianity consist in a total subversion not only of christianity but of all morality -- the very word virtue and vice being but lazy synonyme of prudence and miscalculation -- and which ought to be expunge from we vocabulary together with abraxa and abracadabra as charm abuse by superstitious or mystic enthusiast ib p 94 eventually the whole direction of the popular mind in the affair of religion will be gain into the hand of a set of ignorant fanatic of such low origin and vulgar habit as can only serve to degrade religion in the eye of those to whom its influence be most want will such person venerate or respect it in the hand of a sect compose in the far greater part of bigotted coarse illiterate and low-bred enthusiast man who have abandon they

joke-smith of rome -- do both feel and apply all this to the galilean sect and yet -- ` vicisti o galilæe ' ib p 95 they never fail to refer to the proud pharisee whom they term self - ` righteous ' and thus have greatly misrepresent he character they proceed to declaim on the arrogance of found any expectation of reward from the performance of we ` moral duty ' : -- whereas the plain truth be that the pharisee be ` not righteous ' but merely arrogate to himself that character he have neglect all the ` moral duty ' of life who tell the barrister this not the gospel i be sure the evangelical have only to translate these sentence into the true statement of he opinion in order to baffle this angry and impotent attack the self-righteousness of all who expect to claim salvation on the plea of they own personal merit pay to a b at sight -- value receive by I -- to messr stone and co banker heaven-gate it be a short step from this to the popish pay to a b ` or order ' once assume merit and i defy you to keep out supererogation and the old ` monte di pietà ' ib p 97 -- and from thence occasion be take to defame all those who strive to prepare themselves during this they state of trial for that judgment which they must undergo at that day when they will receive either reward or punishment accord as they shall be find to have ` merit ' the one or ` deserve ' the other can the barrister have read the new testament or do he know it only by quotation ib -- a swarm of new evangelist who be every where teach the people that no reliance be to be place on holiness of life as a ground of future acceptance i be weary of repeat that this be false it be only deny that mere act not proceed from faith be or can be holiness as surely -lrb- would the methodist say -rrb- as the holy ghost proceeds from the son so surely do sanctification from redemption and not vice versa -- much less from self-sanctifiedness that ostrich with its head in the sand and the pluck rump of its merit stare on the divine -lrb- greek : ta -rrb- ` venatrix ' ib p 102 ` he that doeth righteousness be righteous ' since then it be plain that each must ` himself ' be righteous if he be so at all what do they mean who thus inveigh against ` self ' - righteousness since christ himself declare there be no other here again the whole dispute lie in the word himself in the outward and visible sense both party agree but the methodist call it the will in we give by grace the barrister call it we own will or we ourselves but why do not the barrister reserve a part of he wrath for dr priestley accord to whom a villain have superior claim on the divine justice as a innocent martyr to the grand machinery of providence -- for dr priestley who turn the whole dictionary of human nature into verb impersonal with a perpetual ` subauditur ' of ` deus ' for they common nominative case -- which say ` deus ' however be but another ` automaton ' self-worked indeed but yet work not properly work for he admit no more freedom or will to god than to man the lutheran leave the free will whine with a break back in the ditch and dr priestley put the poor animal out of he misery -- but seriously be it fair or even decent to appeal to the legislature against the methodist for hold the doctrine of the atonement do we not pray by act of parliament twenty time every Sunday ` through the only merit of jesus christ ' be it not the very nose which -lrb- of flesh or wax -rrb- this very legislature insist on as a indispensable qualification for every christian face be not the lack thereof a felonious deformity yea the grimmest feature of the ` lue confirma ' of statute heresy what say the reverend critic to this will he not rise in wrath against the barrister -- he the pamphagus of homilitic liturgic and articular orthodoxy -- the garagantua whose ravenous maw leave not a single word syllable letter no not one ` iota ' unswallowed if we be to believe he own recent and voluntary manifesto -lrb- 3 -rrb- what say he to this barrister and he hint to the legislature ib p 105 if the new faith be the only true one let we embrace it but let not those who vend these ` new article ' expect that we should choose they with we eye shut let any man read the homily of the church of england and if he do not call this either blunt impudence or blank ignorance i will plead guilty to both new article would to heaven some of they at least be why wesley himself be scandalize at luther 's commentary on the epistle to the galatian and cry off from the moravian -lrb- the strictest lutheran -rrb- on that account ib p 114 the catalogue of author which this rev gentleman have please to specify and recommend begin with homer hesiod the argonautic æschylus sophocle euripide pindar theogni herodotus thucydide xenophon polybius diodorus siculus \* \* \* ` this catalogue ' say he ` might be considerably extend but i study brevity it be only necessary for I to add that the recommendation of these book be not to be consider as expressive of my approbation of every particular sentiment they contain ' it would indeed be grievous injustice if this writer 's reputation should be injure by the occasional unsoundness of opinion in writer whom it be more than probable he may never have read and for whose sentiment he ought no more to be make answerable than the compiler of lackington 's catalogue from which it be not unlikely that he own be abridged very good ib p 115-16 these high-strained pretender to godliness who deny the power of the sinner to help himself take good care always to attribute he ` save change ' to the bless effect of some sermon preach by some one or other of ` they ' evangelical fraternity they always hold ` themselves ' up to the multitude as the instrument produce all those marvellous conversion which they relate no instance be record in they saint ' calendar of any sinner resolve in consequence of a reflective and serious perusal of the scripture to lead a new life no instance of a daily perusal of the bible produce a daily progress in virtuous habit no the ` gospel ' have no such effect -- it be always the ` gospel preacher ' who work the miracle & c excellent and just in this way be the methodist to be attack : -- even as the papist be by baxter not from they doctrine but from they practice and the spirit of they sect there be a fine passage in lord bacon concern a heresy of manner be not less pernicious than heresy of matter ib p 118 but they saint who would stop they ear if you should mention with admiration the name of a garrick or a siddon -- who think it a sin to support such a ` infamous profession ' as that through the medium of which a milton a johnson a addison and a young have labor to mend the heart & c whoo see milton 's preface to the samson agoniste ib p 133 in the evangelical magazine be the following article : at -- in yorkshire after a handsome collection -lrb- for the missionary society -rrb- a poor man whose wages be about 28 per week bring a donation of 20 guinea we friend hesitate to receive it \* \* when he answer \* \* -- ` before i know the grace of we lord i be a poor drunkard : i never could save a shilling my family be in beggary and rag but since it have please god to renew I by he grace we have be industrious and frugal : we have not spend many idle shilling and we have be enable to put something into the bank and this i freely offer to the bless cause of we lord and savior ' this be the second donation of this same poor man to the same amount whatever these evangelist may think of such conduct they ought to be ashamed of thus basely take advantage of this poor ignorant enthusiast & c be it possible to read this affect story without finding in it a complete answer to the charge of demoralize the lower class do the barrister really think that this generous and grateful enthusiast be as likely to be unprovided and poverty-stricken in he old age as he be prior to he conversion except indeed that at that time he old age be as improbable as he distress be certain if he do live so long this be singing ` io pæan ' for the enemy with a vengeance part ii p 14 it behove he -lrb- dr hawker in he letter to the barrister -rrb- to show in what manner a covenant can exist without term or condition accord to the methodist there be a condition -- that of faith in the power and promise of christ and the virtue of the cross and be it otherwise the objection be scarcely appropriate except at the old bailey or in the court of king 's bench the barrister might have frame a second law-syllogism as acute as he former the law of england allow no binding covenant in a transfer of goods or chattel without value receive but there can be no value receive by god : -- ` ergo ' there can be no covenant between god and man and if jehovah should be as courteous as the house of common and acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court at westminster the plead might hold perhaps and the pentateuch be quash after a argument before the judge besides how childish to puff up the empty bladder of a old metaphysical foot-ball on the ` modus operandus interior ' of justification into a shew of practical substance as if it be no less solid than a cannon ball why drive it with all the vehemence that five toe can exert it would not kill a louse on the head of methodism repentance godly sorrow abhorrence of sin as sin and not merely dread from forecast of the consequence these the arminian would call means of obtain salvation while the methodist -lrb- more philosophically perhaps -rrb- name they sign of the work of free grace commence and the dawn of the sun of redemption and pray where be the practical difference ib p 26 jesus answer he thus -- ` verily i say unto you unless a man be bear of water and of the spirit he can not enter into the kingdom of god ' -- the true sense of which be obviously this : -- except a man be initiate into my religion by baptism -lrb- which ` at that time ' be always ` precede by a confession of faith ' -rrb- and unless he manifest he sincere reception of it by lead that upright and ` spiritual ' life which it enjoin ` he can not enter the kingdom of heaven ' or be a partaker of that happiness which it belong to I to confer on those who believe in my name and keep my saying upon my faith as a christian if no more be mean by be bear again than this the speaker must have have the strongest taste in metaphor of any teacher in verse or prose on record jacob behman himself not except the very alchemist lag behind pity however that we barrister have not show we how this plain and obvious business of baptism agree with ver 8 of the same chapter : ` the wind bloweth where it listeth ' & c now if this do not express a visitation of the mind by a somewhat not in the own power or fore-thought of the mind itself what be word mean for ib p 29 the true meaning of be ` bear again ' in the sense in which we savior use the phrase imply nothing more or less in plain term than this : -- to repent to lead for the future a religious life instead of a life of disobedience to believe the holy scripture and to pray for grace and assistance to persevere in we obedience to the end all this any man of common sense might explain in a few word pray then -lrb- for i will take the barrister 's own commentary -rrb- what do the man of common sense mean by grace if he will explain grace in any other way than as the circumstance ` ab extra ' -lrb- which would be mere mockery and in direct contradiction to a score of text -rrb- and yet without mystery i will undertake for dr hawker and co to make the new birth itself as plain as a pikestaff or a whale 's foal or sarah robart 's rabbit ib p 30 so that they go on in they sin wait for a new birth & c so that they go on in they sin -- who would not suppose it notorious that every methodist meeting-house be a cage of newgate lark make up they mind to die game ib the follow account be extract from the methodist magazine for 1798 : the lord astonish ` sarah robert ' with he mercy by ` set she at liberty while employ ' in the necessary business of ` wash ' for she family & c n b not the famous rabbit-woman -- she be robart ib p 31 a washerwoman have ` all she sin blot out ' in the twinkling of a eye and while reek with suds be receive in the family of the redeemer 's kingdom surely this be a most abominable profanation of all that be serious & c and where pray be the absurdity of this have christ declare any antipathy to washerwoman or the holy ghost to warm suds why do not the barrister try he hand at the abominable profanation in a story of a certain woman with a issue of blood who be make free by touch the hem of a garment without the previous knowledge of the wearer ` ride caper vitem : taman hinc cum stabis ad ara in tua quod fundus cornua possit erit ' ib p 32 the lead design of john the baptist \* \* be \* this : -- to prepare the mind of man for the reception of that pure system of moral truth which the savior by divine authority be speedily to inculcate and of those sublime doctrine of a resurrection and a future judgment which as powerful motive to the practice of holiness he be soon to reveal what then do not john the baptist himself teach a pure system of moral truth be john so much more ignorant than paul before he conversion and the whole jewish nation except a few rich freethinker as to be ignorant of the sublime doctrine of a resurrection and a future judgment this i well know be the strong-hold of socinianism but surely one single unprejudiced perusal of the new testament -- not to suppose a acquaintance with kidder or lightfoot -- would blow it down like a house of card ib p 33 -- they faith in the efficacy of they own rite and creed and ceremony and they whole train of ` substitution ' for ` moral duty ' be so entire and in they opinion be such a ` saving faith ' that they could not at all interpret any language that seem to dispute they value or deny they importance poor strange jew they have doubtless what darwin would call a specific ` paralysis ' of the auditory nerve to the writings of they own prophet which yet be read sabbath after sabbath in they public synagogue for neither john nor christ himself ever do or indeed could speak in language more contemptuous of the folly of consider rite as substitution for moral duty or in severer word denounce the blasphemy of such a opinion why need i refer to isaiah or micah ib p 34 thus it be that this moral preacher explain and enforce the duty of repentance and thus it be that he prepare the way for the greatest and best of teacher & c well then if all this be but a preparation for the doctrine of christ those doctrine themselves must surely have be something different and more difficult oh no john 's preparation consist in a complete rehearsal of the ` drama didacticum ' which christ and the apostle be to exhibit to a full audience -- nay prithee good barrister do not be too rash in charge the methodist with a monstrous burlesque of the gospel ib p 37 -- the logic of the new evangelist will convince he that it be a contradiction in term even to ` suppose ' himself ` capable of do any thing ' to help ` or bring any thing to recommend himself to the divine favor ' now suppose the wisdom of these endless attack on a old abstruse metaphysical notion to be allow yet why in the name of common candor do not the barrister ring the same ` tocsin ' against he friend dr priestley 's scheme of necessity -- or against he idolize paley who explain the will as a sensation produce by the action of the intellect on the muscle and the intellect itself as a catenation of idea and idea as configuration of the organize brain would not every syllable apply yea and more strongly more indisputably and would he fellow-sectary thank he or admit the consequence or have any late socinian divine discover that do as ye would be do unto be a interpolated precept ib p 39 even repentance and faith -lrb- say dr hawker -rrb- those most essential qualification of the mind for the participation and enjoyment of the blessing of the gospel -lrb- and which all real disciple of the lord jesus can not but possess -rrb- be ` never suppose as a condition which the sinner perform to entitle he to mercy ' but merely as evidence that he be bring and have obtain mercy ` they can not be the condition ' of obtain salvation ought not this single quotation to have satisfy the barrister that no practical difference be deducible from these doctrine essential qualification say the methodist : -- term and condition say the spiritual higgler but if a man begin to reflect on he past life be he to withstand the inclination god forbid exclaim both if he feel a commence shame and sorrow be he to check the feeling god forbid cry both in one breath but should not remembrancer be throw in the way of sinner and the voice of warn sound through every street and every wilderness doubtless quoth the rationalist we do it we do it shout the methodist in every corner of every lane in the high road and in the waste we send forth the voice -- come to christ and repent and be cleansed aye quoth the rationalist but i say repent and become clean and go to christ -- now be not mr rationalist as great a bigot as the methodist as he be ` I judice ' a worse psychologist part ii p 40 the former authority on this subject i have quote from the gospel accord to st luke : that gospel most positively and most solemnly declare the ` repentance ' of sinner to be the ` condition ' on which ` alone ' salvation can be obtain but the doctor of the new divinity ` deny ' this : they tell we distinctly ` it can not ' be for the future the gospel accord to calvin must be receive as the truth sinner will certainly prefer it as the more comfortable of the two beyond all comparison mercy but only to read calvin 's account of that repentance without which there be no sign of election and to call it the more comfortable of the two the very term by which the german new-birthite express it be enough to give one goose-flesh -- ` das herzknirschen ' -- the very heart crash between the tooth of a lock-jaw 'd agony ib what be ` faith ' be it not a conviction produce in the mind by adequate testimony no that be not the meaning of faith in the gospel nor indeed anywhere else be it so the stronger the testimony the more adequate the faith yet who say i have faith in the existence of george ii as he present majesty 's antecessor and grandfather -- if testimony then evidence too -- and who have faith that the two side of all triangle be greater than the third in truth faith even in common language always imply some effort something of evidence which be not universally adequate or communicable at will to other well to be sure he have behave badly hitherto but i have faith in he if it be otherwise how could it be imputed as righteousness can morality exist without choice -- nay strengthen in proportion as it become more independent of the will a very meritorious man he have faith in every proposition of euclid which he understand ib p 41 i could as easily create a world -lrb- say dr hawker -rrb- as create either faith or repentance in my own heart surely this be a most monstrous confession what be not the christian religion a ` reveal ' religion and have we not the most miraculous attestation of its truth just look at the answer of christ himself to nicodemus ` john ' iii 2 3 nicodemus profess a full belief in christ 's divine mission why it be attest by he miracle what answer christ well say o believer no not a word of this but the proof of the folly of such a supposition ` verily verily i say unto thee except a man be bear again he can not see the kingdom of god ' -- that be he can not have faith in I ib p 42 how can this evangelical preacher declaim on the necessity of seriously search into the truth of revelation for the purpose either of produce or confirm we belief of it when he have already pronounced it to be just as possible to arrive at conviction as to create a world do dr hawker say that it be impossible to produce a assent to the historic credibility of the fact relate in the gospel do he say that it be impossible to become a socinian by the weigh of outward evidence no but dr hawker say -- and i say -- that this be not can not be what christ mean by faith which to the misfortune of the socinian he always demand as the condition of a miracle instead of look forward to it as the natural effect of a miracle how come it that peter see miracle countless and yet be without faith till the holy ghost descend on he besides miracle may or may not be adequate evidence for socinianism but how could miracle prove the doctrine of redemption or the divinity of christ but this be the creed of the church of england it be wearisome to be under the necessity or at least the constant temptation of attack socinianism in review a work professedly write against methodism surely such a work ought to treat of those point of doctrine and practice which be peculiar to methodism but to publish a ` diatribe ' against the substance of the article and catechism of the english church nay of the whole christian world except the socinian and to call it hint concern the dangerous and abominable absurdity of methodism be too bad ib p 43 but this calvinistic evangelist tell we by way of accounting for the utter impossibility of produce in himself either faith or repentance that both be of divine origin and like the light and the rain and the dew of heaven which tarrieth not for man neither waiteth for the son of man be from above and come down from the father of light from whom alone cometh every good and perfect gift be the barrister -- be the socinian divine -- inspired or infallibly sure that it be a crime for a christian to understand the word of christ in they plain and literal sense when a socinian choose to give he paraphrase -- often too as strongly remote from the word as the old spiritual paraphrase on the song of solomon ib p 46 accord to that gospel which have hitherto be the pillar of the christian world we be teach that whosoever endeavor to the best of he ability to reform he manners and amend he life will have pardon and acceptance as interpret by whom by the socinus or the barrister -- or by origen chrysostom jerome the gregory eusebius athanasius -- by thoma aquina bernard thomas-a-kempi -- by luther melancthon zuinglius calvin -- by the reformer and martyr of the english church -- by cartwright and the learn puritan -- by knox -- by george fox -- with regard to this point that mere external evidence be inadequate to the production of a saving faith and in the majority of other opinion all these agree with wesley so they all understand the gospel but it be not so ` ergo ' the barrister be infallible ib p 47 ` when the wicked man turneth away from the wickedness which he have commit and doeth that which be lawful and right he shall save he soul alive ' this gracious declaration the old moral divine of we church have place in the front of its liturgy in the name of patience over and over again who have ever deny this the question be by what power he own or by the free grace of god through christ the wicked man be enable to turn from he wickedness and again and again i ask : -- be not these old moral divine the author and compiler of the homily if the barrister do not know this he be a ignorant man if know it he have yet never examine the homily he be a unjust man but if he have he be a slanderer and a sycophant be it not intolerable to take up three bulky pamphlet against a recent sect denounce as most dangerous and which we all know to be most powerful and of rapid increase and to find little more than a weak declamatory abuse of certain metaphysical dogma concern free will or free will forfeit ` de libero vel servo arbitrio ' -- of grace predestination and the like -- dogma on which accord to milton god and the logo converse as soon as man be in existence they in heaven and adam in paradise and the devil in hell -- dogma common to all religion and to all age and sect of the christian religion -- concern which brahmin dispute with brahmin mahometan with mahometan and priestley with price -- and all this to be lay on the shoulder of the methodist collectively : though it be a notorious fact that a radical difference on this abstruse subject be the ground of the schism between the whitfieldite and wesleyan methodist and that the latter coincide in opinion with erasmus and arminius by which latter name they distinguish themselves and the former with luther calvin and they great guide st augustine this i say be intolerable -- yea a crime against sense candor and white paper ib p 50 for so very peculiarly direct to the sinner and to he only -lrb- say the evangelical preacher -rrb- be the bless gospel of the lord jesus that unless you be a sinner you be not interested in its saving truth do not christ himself say the same in the plainest and most unmistakable word ' i come not to call the righteous but sinner to repentance they that be whole need not a physician but they that be sick ' can he who have no share in the danger be interest in the save pleased from benevolence he may be but interested he can not be ` estne aliquid inter salvum et salutem inter liberum et libertatem salus est pereuntis vel saltem periditantis : redemptio quasus pon divinus inter servum et libertatem -- amissam ideoque optatam ' ib p 52 it be reserve for these day of ` new discovery ' to announce to mankind that unless they be sinner they be exclude from the promise blessing of the gospel merely read ` that unless they be sick they be preclude from the offer remedy of the gospel ' and be not this the dictate of common sense as well as of methodism but do not methodism cry aloud that all man be sick -- sick to the very heart ` if we say we be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth be not in we ' this shallow-pated barrister make I downright piggish and without the stratagem of that famed philosopher in pig-nature almost drive I into the charon 's hoy of methodism by he rude and stupid tail-hauling I back from it ib p 53 i can assure these gentleman that i regard with a reverence as pure and awful as can enter into the human mind that blood which be shed upon the cross that be in the barrister 's creed that mysterious flint which with the subordinate aid of mutton barley salt turnip and potherb make most wonderful fine flint broth suppose christ have never shed he blood yet if he have work he miracle raise lazarus and teach the same doctrine would not the result have be the same -- or if christ have never appear on earth yet do not daniel work miracle as stupendous which surely must give all the authority to he doctrine that miracle can give and do he not announce by the holy spirit the resurrection to judgment of glory or of punishment ib p 54 let they not attempt to escape it by quote a few disconnect phrase in the epistle but let they adhere solely and steadfastly to that gospel of which they affect to be the exclusive preacher and whence have the barrister learn that the epistle be not equally bind on christian as the four gospel surely of st paul 's at least the authenticity be incomparably clearer than that of the first three gospel and if he give up as doubtless he do the plenary inspiration of the gospel the personal authority of the writer of all the epistle be greater than two at least of the four evangelist secondly the gospel of john and all the epistle be purposely write to teach the christian faith whereas the first three gospel be as evidently intend only as ` memorabilia ' of the history of the christian revelation as far as the process of redemption be carry on in the life death and resurrection of the divine founder this be the blank brazen blushless or only brass-blushing impudence of a old bailey barrister attempt to browbeat out of court the better and more authentic half of the witness against he if i wish to understand the law of england shall i consult hume or blackstone -- he who have write he volume expressly as comment on those law or the historian who mention they only as far as the law be connect with the event and character which he relate or describe nay it be far worse than this far christ himself repeatedly defer the publication of he doctrine till after he death and give the reason too that till he have send the holy ghost he disciple be not capable of comprehend they do he not attribute to a immediate influence of especial inspiration even peter 's acknowledgment of he filiation to god or messiahship -- be it from the gospel that paul learn to know christ -- be the church sixty year without the awful truth teach exclusively in john 's gospel part iii p 5 the ` nostrum ' of the mountebank will he prefer to the prescription of the regular practitioner why be this because there be something in the authoritative arrogance of the pretender by which ignorance be overawe this be something and true as far as it go that be however but a very little way the great power of both spiritual and physical mountebank rest on that irremovable property of human nature in force of which indefinite instinct and suffering find no echo no resting-place in the definite and comprehensible ignorance unnecessarily enlarge the sphere of these : but a sphere there be -- fact of mind and craving of the soul there be -- in which the wisest man seek help from the indefinite because it be nearer and more like the infinite of which he be make the image : -- for even we be infinite even in we finiteness infinite as the father in he infinity in many caterpillar there be a large empty space in the head the destine room for the push forth of the ` antennæ ' of its next state of be ib p 12 but the anti-moralists aver \* \* that they be quote unfairly -- that although they disavow it be true the necessity and deny the value of practical morality and personal holiness and declare they to be totally irrelevant to we future salvation yet that \* \* i might have find occasional recommendation of moral duty which i have neglect to notice the same ` crambe bi decy cocta ' of one self-same charge ground on one gross and stupid misconception and mis-statement : and to which there need no other answer than this simple fact let the barrister name any one gross offence against the moral law for which he would shun a man 's acquaintance and for that same vice the methodist would inevitably be exclude publicly from they society and i be incline to think that a fair list of the barrister 's friend and acquaintance would prove that the calvinistic methodist be the austerer and more watchful censor of the two if this be the truth as it notoriously be what but the cataract of stupidity uncouched or the thickest film of bigot-slime can prevent a man from see that this tenet of justification by faith alone be exclusively a matter between the calvinist 's own heart and he maker who alone know the true source of he word and action but that to he neighbor and fellow-creedsmen he spotless life and good work be demand not indeed as the prime efficient cause of he salvation but as the necessary and only possible sign of that faith which be the means of that salvation of which christ 's free grace be the cause and the sanctify spirit the perfecter but i fall into the same fault i be arraign by so often expose and confute the same blunder which have no claim even at its first enunciation to the compliment of a philosophical answer but why in the name of common sense all this endless whoop and hubbub against the calvinistic methodist i have understand that the arminian methodist or wesleyan be the more numerous body by far have there be any union lately have the follower of wesley abjure the doctrine of they founder on this head ib p 16 we be tell by we new spiritual teacher that reason be not to be apply to the inquiry into the truth or falsehood of they doctrine they be spiritually discern and carnal reason have no concern with they even under this aversion to reason as apply to religious grounds a very important truth lurk : and the mistake -lrb- a very dangerous one i admit -rrb- lie in the confound two very different faculty of the mind under one and the same name -- the pure reason or ` vis scientifica ' and the discourse or prudential power the proper object of which be the ` phænomena ' of sensuous experience the greatest loss which modern philosophy have through wilful scorn sustained be the grand distinction of the ancient philosopher between the -lrb- greek : noúmena -rrb- and -lrb- greek : phainómena -rrb- this give the true sense of pliny -- ` venerare deos ' -lrb- that be they statue and the like -rrb- ` et numina deorum ' that be those spiritual influence which be represent by the image and person of apollo minerva and the rest ib p 17 religion have for its object the moral care and the moral cultivation of man its beauty be not to be seek in the region of mystery or in the flight of abstraction what ignorance be there a single moral precept of the gospel not to be find in the old testament not one a new edition of white 's ` diatessaron ' with a run comment the hebrew greek and roman writer before christ and those after he who it be morally certain draw no aid from the new testament be a grand ` desideratum ' and if anything could open the eye of socinian this would do it ib p 24 the masculine strength and moral firmness which once distinguish the great mass of the british people be daily fading away methodism with all its cant & c well but in god 's name can methodism be at once the effect and the cause of this loss of masculine strength and moral firmness -- do whitfield and wesley blow they out at the first puff -- these grand virtue of masculine strength and moral firmness admire i pray you the happy antithesis yet feminine would be a improvement as then the sense too would be antithetic however the sound be sufficient and modern rhetoric possess the virtue of economy ib p 27 so with the tinker i would give he the care of kettle but i would not give he ` the cure of soul ' so long as he attend to the management and mending of he pot and pan i would wish success to he ministry : but when he come to declare ` himself ' a choose vessel and demand permission to take the soul of the people into he holy keep i should think that instead of a ` licence ' it would be more humane and more prudent to give he a passport to st luke 's depend upon it such man be never send by providence

-rrb- the more he look for peace ` this way he guilt ' like a heavy burden become more intolerable when he become ` dead ' to the ` law ' -- as to ` any dependence upon it for salvation ' -- by the body of christ and marry to he who be raise from the dead then and not till then he heart be set at liberty to run the way of god 's commandment here we be teach that the ` conscience ' can never find relief from obedience to the law of the gospel false we be tell by bunyan and he editor that the conscience can never find relief for its disobedience to the law in the law itself -- and this be as true of the moral as of the mosaic law i be not defend calvinism or bunyan 's theology but if victory not truth be my object i could desire no easier task than to defend it against we doughty barrister well but i repent -- that be regret it -- yes and so you doubtless regret the loss of a eye or arm : -- will that make it grow again -- think you this nonsense as apply to morality be it so but yet nonsense most tremendously suit to human nature it be as the barrister may find in the argument of the pagan philosopher against christianity who attribute a large portion of its success to its hold out a expiation which no other religion do read but that most affect and instructive anecdote select from the hindostan missionary account by the quarterly review -lrb- 4 -rrb- again let I say i be not give my own opinion on this very difficult point but of one thing i be convince that the ' i be sorry for it that be enough ' -- man mean nothing but regret when they talk of repentance and have conscience either so pure or so callous as not to know what a direful and strange thing remorse be and how absolutely a fact ` sui generis ' i have often remark and it can not be too often remark -lrb- vain as this may sound -rrb- that this essential heterogeneity of regret and remorse be of itself a sufficient and the best proof of free will and reason the co-existence of which in man we call conscience and on this rest the whole superstructure of human religion -- god immortality guilt judgment redemption whether another and different superstructure may be raise on the same foundation or whether the same edifice be susceptible of important alteration be another question but such be the edifice at present and this its foundation : and the barrister might as rationally expect to blow up windsor castle by discharge a popgun in one of its cellar as hope to demolish calvinism by such argument as he ib p 35 36 and behold a certain lawyer stand up and tempt he say master what shall i do ` to inherit eternal life ' he say unto he ` what be write in the law how readest thou ' and he answer say thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with ` all thy strength ' and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he say unto he thou ` hast answer right this do and thou shall live ' luke x 25-28 so would bunyan and so would calvin have preach -- would both of they in the name of christ have make this assurance to the barrister -- ` this do and thou shalt live ' but what if he have not do it but the very contrary and what if the querist should be a staunch disciple of dr paley : and hold himself morally oblige not to hate or injure he fellow-man not because he be compel by conscience to see the exceed sinfulness of sin and to abhor sin as sin even as he eschew pain as pain -- no not even because god have forbid it -- but ultimately because the great legislator be able and have threaten to put he to unspeakable torture if he disobey and to give he all kind of pleasure if he do not -lrb- 5 -rrb- why verily in this case i do foresee that both the tinker and the divine would wax warm and rebuke the say querist for vile hypocrisy and a most nefarious abuse of god 's good gift intelligible language what do you call this ` loving the lord you god with all you heart with all you soul with all you strength and all you mind -- and you neighbor as yourself ' whereas in truth you love nothing not even you own soul but only set a superlative value on whatever will gratify you selfish lust of enjoyment and insure you from hell-fire at a thousand time the true value of the dirty property if you have the impudence to persevere in mis-naming this love supply any one instance in which you use the word in this sense if you son do not spit in you face because he believe that you would disinherit he if he do and this be he main moral obligation would you allow that you son love you -- and with all he heart and mind and strength and soul -- shame shame now the power of loving god of willing good as good -lrb- not of desire the agreeable and of prefer a larger though distant delight to a infinitely smaller immediate qualification which be mere selfish prudence -rrb- bunyan consider supernatural and seek its source in the free grace of the creator through christ the redeemer : -- this the kantean also aver to be supersensual indeed but not supernatural but in the original and essence of human nature and form its grand and awful characteristic hence he call it ` die menschheit ' -- the principle of humanity -- but yet no less than calvin or the tinker declare it a principle most mysterious the undoubted object of religious awe a perpetual witness of that god whose image -lrb- -lrb- greek : eikôn -rrb- -rrb- it be a principle utterly incomprehensible by the discursive intellect -- and moreover teach we that the surest plan for stifle and paralyze this divine birth in the soul -lrb- a phrase of plato 's as well as of the tinker 's -rrb- be by attempt to evoke it by or to substitute for it the hope and fear the motive and calculation of prudence which be a excellent and in truth indispensable servant but consider as master and primate of the moral diocese preclude the possibility of virtue -lrb- in bunyan 's phrase holiness of spirit -rrb- by introduce legality which be no cant phrase of methodism but of authenticate standing in the ethic of the profoundest philosopher -- even those who reject christianity as a miraculous event and revelation itself as far as anything supernatural be imply in it i must not mention plato i suppose -- he be a mystic nor zeno -- he and he be visionary : -- but aristotle the cold and dry aristotle have in a very remarkable passage in he lesser tract of ethic assert the same thing and call it a divine principle lie deeper than those thing which can be explain or enunciate discursively ib p 45 46 sure i be that no father of a family that can at all estimate the importance of keep from the infant mind whatever might raise impure idea or excite improper inquiry will ever commend the pilgrim 's progress to they perusal and in the same spirit and for the same cogent reason that the holy monk lewi prohibit the bible in all decent family -- or if they must have something of that kind would propose in preference tirante the white o how i abhor this abominable heart-haunting impurity in the envelope of modesty merciful heaven be it not a direct consequence from this system that we all purchase we existence at the price of we mother 's purity of mind see what milton have write on this subject in the passage quote in the friend in the essay on the communication of truth -lrb- 6 -rrb- ib p 47 let we ask whether the female mind be likely to be train to purity by study this manual of piety and by express its devotional desire after the follow example mercy be a _ young _ and _ breeding _ woman _ long _ for something & c out upon the fellow i could find it in my heart to suspect he of any vice that the worst of man could commit ib pp 55 56 ` as by one man 's disobedience many be make sinner so by the obedience of one shall many be make righteous ' the interpretation of this text be simply this : -- as by follow the fatal example of one man 's disobedience many be make sinner so by that pattern of perfect obedience which christ have set before we shall many be make righteous what may not be explain thus and into what may not any thing be thus explain it come out little better than nonsense in any other than the literal sense for let any man of sincere mind and without any system to support look round on all he christian neighbor and will he say or will they say that the origin of they well-doing be a attempt to imitate what they all believe to be inimitable christ 's perfection in virtue he absolute sinlessness no -- but yet perhaps some particular virtue for instance he patriotism in weep over jerusalem he active benevolence in cure the sick and preach to the poor he divine forgiveness in pray for he enemy -- i grant all this but then how be this peculiar to christ be it not the effect of all illustrious example of those probably most which we last read of or which make the deepest impression on we feeling be there no good man before christ as there be no bad man before adam be it not a notorious fact that those who most frequently refer to christ 's conduct for they own action be those who believe he the incarnate deity -- consequently the best possible guide but in no strict sense a example -- while those who regard he as a mere man the chief of the jewish prophet both in the pulpit and from the press ground they moral persuasion chiefly on argument draw from the propriety and seemliness -- or the contrary -- of the action itself or from the will of god know by the light of reason to make st paul prophesy that all christian will owe they holiness to they exclusive and conscious imitation of christ 's action be to make st paul a false prophet -- and what in such case become of the boast influence of miracle even as false would it be to ascribe the vice of the chinese or even we own to the influence of adam 's bad example as well might we say of a poor scrofulous innocent : see the effect of the bad example of he father on he i blame no man for disbelieve or for oppose with might and main the dogma of original sin but i confess that i neither respect the understanding nor have confidence in the sincerity of he who declare that he have carefully read the writings of st paul and find in they no consequence attribute to the fall of adam but that of he bad example and none to the cross of christ but the good example of die a martyr to a good cause i would undertake from the writings of the later english socinian to collect paraphrase on the new testament text that could only be parallel by the spiritual paraphrase on solomon 's song to be find in the recent volume of a dictionary of the holy bible by john brown minister of the gospel at haddington : third edition in the article song ib p 63 64 call forth the robber from he cavern and the midnight murderer from he

distress mankind and when they be thus throng round in a circle assure they -- not that there be a god that judgeth the earth -- not that punishment in the great day of retribution will await they crime & c & c -- let every sinner in the throng be tell that they will stand ` justified ' before god that the ` righteousness ' of ` christ ' will be imputed to ` they ' & c well do so -- nay nay it have be do the effect have be try and slander itself can not deny that the effect have be the conversion of thousand of those very sinners whom the barrister 's fancy thus convoke o shallow man not to see that here lie the main strength of the cause he be attack that to repeat my former illustration he draw the attention to patient in that worst state of disease which perhaps alone require and justify the use of the white pill as a mode of expose the frantic quack who vend it promiscuously he fix on the empiric 's cure to prove he murder -- not to forget what ought to conclude every paragraph in answer to the barrister 's hint and be the case as allege what do this prove against the present methodist as methodist be not the tenet of imputed righteousness the faith of all the scotch clergy who be not false to they declaration at they public assumption of the ministry till within the last sixty or seventy year be not the tenet preach Sunday after Sunday in every nook of scotland and have the barrister hear that the moral of the scotch peasant and artizan have be improve within the last thirty or forty year since the exception have become more and more common -- be it by want of strict moral that the puritan be distinguish to they disadvantage from the rest of englishman during the reign of elizabeth jame i charles i and ii and that very period which the barrister affirm to have be distinguish by the moral vigor of the great mass of briton -- be it not likewise the period when this very doctrine be preach by the clergy fifty time for once that it be hear from the same pulpit in the present and precede generation never never can the methodist be successfully assail if not honestly and never honestly or with any chance of success except as methodist -- for they practice they alarming theocracy they stupid mad and mad-driving superstition these be they property ` in peculio ' they doctrine be those of the church of england with no other difference than that in the church liturgy and article and homily calvinism and lutheranism be join like the two hand of the union fire office : - the methodist have unclasped they and one be whitfield and the other

real christian be as mischievous as it be false yet christ 's assertion on this head be positive and universal and i believe it from my inmost soul and be convince that it be just as true ad 1810 as ad 33 ib p 82 the spirit with which all they merciless treatment be to be bear be next point out \* \* ` patient bearing of injury ' be true christian fortitude and will always be more effectual to ` disarm we enemy ' and to bring other to the knowledge of the truth than all ` argument ' whatever be this barrister a christian of any sort or sect and be he not ashamed if not afraid to ridicule such passage as these if they be not true the four gospel be false ib p 86 it be impossible to give they credit for integrity when we behold the obstinacy and the artifice with which they defend they system against the strongest argument and against the clearest evidence modest gentleman i wonder he find time to write bulky pamphlet : for surely modesty like he must secure success and clientage at the bar doubtless he mean he own argument the evidence he himself have adduce : -- i say doubtless for what be these pamphlet but a long series of attack on the doctrine of the strict lutheran and calvinist -lrb- for the doctrine he attack be common to both -rrb- and if he know stronger argument clearer evidence he would certainly have give they -- and then what obstinate rogue must we bishop be to have suffer these hint to pass into a third edition and yet not have bring a bill into parliament for a new set of article i have not hear that they have even the grace to intend it ib p 88 on this subject i will quote the just and striking observation of a excellent modern writer in whatever village say he the fanatic get a footing drunkenness and swearing -- sin which be more expose to the eye of the world would be ruinous to they great pretension to superior sanctity -- will perhaps be find to decline but i be convince from personal observation that every species of fraud and falsehood -- sin which be not so readily detect but which seem more closely connect with worldly advantage -- will be find invariably to increase -lrb- religion without cant by r fellowe be of st mary 's hall oxford -rrb- in answer to this let I make a very just observation by some other man of my opinion to be hereafter quote from a excellent modern writer -- and it be this that from the birth of christ to the present hour no sect or body of man be zealous in the reformation of manners in society without have be charge with the same vice in the same word when i hate a man and see nothing bad in he what remain possible but to accuse he of crime which i can not see and which can not be disprove because they can not be prove surely if christian charity do not preclude these charge the shame of convict parrotry ought to prevent a man from repeat and republish they the very same thought almost the word be to be find of the early christian of the poor quaker of the republican of the first reformer -- why need i say this do not every one know that a jovial pot-companion can never believe a water-drinker not to be a sneak cheating knave who be afraid of he thought that every libertine swear that those who pretend to be chaste either have they mistress in secret or far worse and so on ib p 89 the same religious abstinence from all appearance of recreation on the lord 's day and the same neglect of the weightier matter of the moral law in the course of the week & c this sentence thus smuggle in at the bottom of the chest ought not to pass unnoticed for the whole force of the former depend on it it be a true trick and deserve reprobation ib p 97 note it be procure mr collyer inform we by the merit of he lecture on scripture fact it should have be lecture on ` scriptural ' fact what should we think of the grammarian who instead of ` historical ' should present we with lecture on ` history ' fact but law tract and be not ` scripture ' as often use semi-adjectively ib p 98 do you really believe say dr hawker that because man by he apostacy have lose he power and ability to obey god have lose he right to command put the case that you be call upon as a barrister to recover a debt due from one man to another and you know the debtor have not the ability to pay the ` creditor ' would you tell you client that he debtor be under no legal or moral obligation to pay what he have no power to do and would you tell he that the very expectation of he just right ` be as foolish as it be tyrannical ' \* \* \* i will give my reply to these question distinctly and without hesitation \* \* \* suppose a to have lend b a thousand pound as a capital to commence trade and that when he purchase he stock to this amount and lodge it in he warehouse a fire be to break out in the next dwelling and extend itself to ` he ' warehouse be to consume the whole of he property and reduce he to a state of utter ruin if a my client be to ask my opinion as to he right to recover from b i should tell he that this he right would exist should b ever be in a condition to repay the sum borrow \* \* \* but that to attempt to recover a thousand pound from a man thus reduce by accident to utter ruin and who have not a shilling leave in the world would be ` as foolish as it be tyrannical ' but this be rank sophistry the question be : -- do a thief -lrb- and a fraudulent debtor be no better -rrb- acquire a claim to impunity by not possess the power of restore the goods every moral act derive its character -lrb- say a schoolman with a unusual combination of profundity with quaintness -rrb- ` aut voluntate originis aut origine voluntatis ' now the very essence of guilt its dire and incommunicable character consist in its tendency to destroy the free will -- but when thus destroy be the habit of vice thenceforward innocent do the law excuse the murder because the perpetrator be drunk dr hawker put he objection laxly and weakly enough but a manly opponent would have be ashamed to seize a hour 's victory from what a move of the pen would render impregnable ib p 102 3 when at this solemn tribunal the sinner shall be call upon to answer for the transgression of those ` moral ' law on obedience to which salvation be make to depend will it be sufficient that he declare himself to have be teach to believe that the gospel ` have neither term nor condition ' and that he salvation be secure by a covenant which procure he pardon and peace ` from all eternity ' : a covenant the effect of which no folly or ` after-act whatever ' could possibly destroy -- who could anticipate the sentence of condemnation and not weep in agony over the deluded victim of ignorance and misfortune who be thus teach a doctrine so fatally false what then god be represent as a tyrant when he claim the penalty of disobedience from the servant who have wilfully incapacitate himself for obey -- and yet just and merciful in condemn to indefinite misery a poor deluded victim of ignorance and imposture even though the barrister spite of he antipathy to methodist would weep in agony over he but before the barrister draw bill of imagination on he tender feeling would it not have be as well to adduce some last die speech and confession in which the culprit attribute he crime -- not to sabbath-breaking and loose company -- but to sermon-hearing on the ` modus operandus ' of the divine goodness in the work of redemption how the ebenezerite would stare to find the socinian and themselves in one flock on the sheep-side of the judgment-seat -- and they cousin and fellow methodist the tabernacler all caprifle -- goat every man : -- and why they hold that repentance be in the power of every man with the aid of grace while the goat hold that without grace no man be able even to repent a make grace the cause and b make it only a necessary auxiliary and do the socinian extricate himself a whit more clearly without a due concurrence of circumstance no mind can improve itself into a state susceptible of spiritual happiness : and be not the disposition and pre-arrangement of circumstance as dependent on the divine will as those spiritual influence which the methodist hold to be mean by the word grace will not the socinian find it as difficult to reconcile with mercy and justice the condemnation to hell-fire of poor wretch bear and breed in the thief ' nest of st gile as the methodist the condemnation of those who have be less favor by grace i have one other question to ask though it should have be ask before suppose christ teach nothing more than a future state of retribution and the necessity and sufficiency of good moral how be we to explain he forbid these truth to be teach to any but jew till after he resurrection do the jew reject those doctrine except perhaps a handful of rich man call sadducee they all believe they and would have die a thousand death rather than have renounce they faith besides what be there in doctrine common to the creed of all religion and enforce by all the school of philosophy except the epicurean which should have prevent they be teach to all at the same time i perceive that this difficulty do not press on socinian exclusively : but yet it press on they with far greater force than on other for they make christianity a mere philosophy the same in substance with the stoical only purer from error and accompany with clearer evidence : -- while other think of it as part of a covenant make up with abraham the fulfilment of which be in good faith to be first offer to he posterity i ask this only because the barrister profess to find every thing in the four gospel so plain and easy ib p 106 the reformer by whom those article be frame be educate in the church of rome and oppose themselves rather to the perversion of its power than the error of its doctrine a outrageous blunder ib p 107 lord bacon be the first who dedicate he profound and penetrate genius to the cultivation of sound philosophy & c this very same lord bacon have give we he ` confessio fidei ' at great length with full particularity now i will answer for the methodist ' unhesitating assent and consent to it but would the barrister subscribe it ib p 108 we look back to that era of we history when superstition throw she victim on the pile and bigotry tie the martyr to he stake : -- but we take we eye from the retrospect and turn they in thankful admiration to that be who have open the mind of many and be daily open the mind of more amongst we to the reception of these most important of all truth that there be no true faith but in practical goodness and that the worst of error be the error of the ` life ' such be the conviction of the most enlighten of we clergy : the conviction i trust of the far greater part \* \* \* they deem it better to inculcate the moral duty of christianity in the pure simplicity and clearness with which they be reveal than to go aside in search of ` doctrinal mystery ' for as mystery can not be make manifest they of course can not be understand and that which can not be understand can not be believe and can consequently make no part of any system of faith : since no one till he understand a doctrine can tell whether it be true or false till then therefore he can have no faith in it for no one can rationally affirm that he believe that doctrine to be true which he do not know to be so and he can not know it to be true if he do not understand it in the religion of a true christian therefore there can be nothing unintelligible and if the preacher of that religion do not make mystery they will never find any who the bishop or the dignified clergy have they at length explode all doctrinal mystery be horsley the one red leaf the last of its clan that hold the doctrine of the trinity the corruption of the human will and the redemption by the cross of christ verily this be the most impudent attempt to impose a naked socinianism on the public as the general religion of the nation admit by all but a dunghill of mushroom fanatic that ever insult common sense or common modesty and will the far greater part of the english clergy remain silent under so atrocious a libel as be contain in this page do they indeed solemnly pray to they maker weekly before god and man in the word of a liturgy which they know can not be believe for heaven 's sake my dear southey do quote this page and compare it with the introduction to and petition of the liturgy and with the collect on the advent & c ib p 110 we shall discover upon a attentive examination of the subject that all those law which lay the basis of we constitutional liberty be no other than the rule of religion transcribe into the judicial system and enforce by the sanction of civil authority what compare these law first with tacitus 's account of the constitutional law of we german ancestor pagan and then with the pandect and ` novellæ ' of the most christian justinian aid by all he bishop observe the barrister be assert a fact of the historical origination of we law -- and not what no man would deny that as far as they be humane and just they coincide with the precept of the gospel no they be transcribe ib p 113 where a man hold a certain system of doctrine the state be bind to tolerate though it may not approve they but when he demand a ` license to teach ' this system to the rest of the community he demand that which ought not to be grant incautiously and without grave consideration this discretionary power be delegate in trust for the common good & c all this dear southey i leave to the lash of you indignation it would be oppression to do -- what the legislature could not do if it would -- prevent a man 's thought but if he speak they aloud and ask either for instruction and confutation if he be in error or assent and honor if he be in the right then it be no oppression to throw he into a dungeon but the barrister would only withhold a license nonsense what if he preach and publish without it will the legislature dungeon he or not if not what use be either the grant or the withholding and this too from a socinian who by this very book have i believe make himself obnoxious to imprisonment and the pillory -- and against man whose opinion be authorize by the most solemn act of parliament and record in a book of which there must be one by law in every parish and of which there be in fact one in almost every house and hovel part iv p 1 the religion of genuine christianity be a revelation so distinct and specific in its design and so clear and intelligible in its rule that a man of philosophic and retired thought be apt to wonder by what mean the endless system of error and hostility which divide the world be ever introduce into it what means this hollow cant -- this fifty time warmed-up bubble and squeak that such part be intelligible as the barrister understand that such part as it possess in common with all system of religion and morality be plain and obvious in other word that abc be so legible that they be legible to every one that have learn to read if the barrister mean other or more than this if he really mean the whole religion and revelation of christ even as it be find in the original record the gospel and epistle he escape from the silliness of a truism by throw himself into the arm of a broad brazenfaced untruth what be the sixth chapter of st john 's gospel so distinct and specific in its design that any modest man can wonder that the best and most learn man of every age since christ have deem it mysterious be the many passage concern the devil and demoniac so very easy have this writer himself throw the least light on or himself receive one ray of light from the meaning of the word faith -- or the reason of christ 's paramount declaration respect its omnific power its absolutely indispensable necessity if the word mean only what the barrister suppose a persuasion that in the present state of we knowledge the evidence for the historical truth of the miracle of the gospel outweigh the argument of the sceptic will he condescend to give we such a comment on the assertion that have we but a grain of mustard seed of it we might control all material nature without make christ himself the most extravagant hyperbolist that ever mis-used language but it be impossible to make that man blush who can seriously call the word of christ as record by st john plain easy common sense out of which prejudice artifice and selfish interest alone can compose any difficulty the barrister have just as much right to call he religion christianity as to call flour and water plum pudding : -- yet we all admit that in plum pudding both flour and water do exist ib p 7 socinus can have no claim upon my veneration : i have never concern myself with what he believe nor with what he teach & c the scripture be my authority and on no other authority will i ever knowingly lay the foundation of my faith utterly untrue it be not the scripture but such passage of scripture as appear to he to accord with he procrustean bed of so call reason and a force of the blankest contradiction into the same meaning by explanation to which i defy he to furnish one single analogy as allow by mankind with regard to any other writings but the old and new testament it be a gross and impudent delusion to call a book he authority which he receive only so far as it be a echo of he own conviction i defy he to adduce one single article of he whole faith -lrb- creed rather -rrb- which he really derive from the scripture even the argument for the resurrection be and must be extraneous : for the very proof of the fact be -lrb- as every ` tyro ' in theology must know -rrb- the proof of the authenticity of the book in which they be contain this question i would press upon he : -- suppose we possess the father only with the ecclesiastical and pagan historian and that not a page remain of the new testament -- what article of he creed would it alter ib p 10 if the creed of calvinistic methodism be really more productive of conversion than the religion of christianity let they openly and at once say so but calvinistic methodism why calvinistic methodism not one in a hundred of the methodist be calvinist not to mention the impudence of this crow in he abuse of black feather be it worse in a methodist to oppose socinianism to christianity that be to the doctrine of wesley or even whitfield which be the same as those of all the reform church of christendom and differ only wherein the most celebrated divine of the same church have differ with each other -- than for the barrister to oppose methodism to christianity -lrb- he christianity -rrb- -- that be to socinianism which in every peculiar doctrine of christianity differ from all divine of all church of all age for the one tenet in which the calvinist differ from the majority of christian be there not ten in which the socinian differ from all to what purpose then this windy declamation about john calvin how many methodist do the barrister think ever see much less read a work of calvin 's if he scorn the name of socinus as he authority and appeal to scripture do not the methodist the same when do they refer to calvin in what work do they quote he this page be therefore mere dust in the eye of the public and he abuse of calvin display only he own vulgar ignorance both of the man and of he writings for he seem not to know that the humane melancthon and not only he but almost every church lutheran or reform throughout europe send letter to geneva extol the execution of servetus and return they thanks yet it be a murder not the less : yes a damned murder : but the guilt of it be not peculiar to calvin but common to all the theologian of that age and ` nota bene ' mr barrister the socinus not except who be prepare to inflict the very same punishment on f davidi for deny the adorability of christ if to wish will resolve and attempt to realize be morally to commit a action then must socinus and calvin hunt in the same collar but o mercy if every human being be to be hold up to detestation who in that age would have think it he duty to have pass sentence ` de comburendo heretico ' on a man who have publicly style the trinity a cerberus and a three-headed monster of hell what would the history of the reformation be but a list of criminal with what face indeed can we congratulate ourselves on be bear in a more enlighten age if we so bitterly abuse not the practice but the agent do we not admit by this very phrase enlighten that we owe we exemption to we intellectual advantage not primarily to we moral superiority it will be time enough to boast when to we own tolerance we have add they zeal learning and indefatigable industry -lrb- 7 -rrb- ib p 13 14 if religion consist in listen to long prayer and attend long sermon in keep up a outside appearance of devotion and interlard the most common discourse with phrase of gospel usage : -- if this be religion then be the disciple of methodism pious beyond compare but in real humility of heart in mildness of temper in liberality of mind in purity of think in openness and uprightness of conduct in private life in those practical virtue which be the vital substance of christianity -- in these be they superior no public observation be against the fact and the conclusion to which such observation lead be rarely incorrect \* \* the very name of the sect carry with it a impression of meanness and hypocrisy scarce a individual that have have any dealings with those belong to it but have good cause to remember it from some circumstance of low deception or of shuffling fraud its very member trust each other with caution and reluctance the more wealthy among they be drain and dry by the leech that perpetually fasten upon they the leader ignorant and bigoted -- i speak of they collectively -- present we with no counter-quality that can conciliate respect they have all the craft of monk without they courtesy and all the subtlety of jesuit without they learning in the whole ` bibliotlieca theologica ' i remember no instance of calumny so gross so impudent so unchristian even as a single robber i mean he who rob one man get hang while the robber of a million be a great man so it seem to be with calumny this worthy barrister will be extol for this audacious slander of thousand for which if apply to any one individual he would be in danger of the pillory this paragraph should be quote : for be the charge true it be nevertheless impossible that the barrister should know it to be true he positively assert as a truth know to he what it be impossible he should know : -- he be therefore doubly a slanderer for first the charge be a gross calumny and be it otherwise he would still be a slanderer for he could have no proof no ground for such a charge ib p 15 amidst all this spirit of research we find nothing -- comparatively nothing -- of improvement in that science of all other the most important in its influence \* \* \* religion except from the emancipate energy of a few superior mind which have dare to snap asunder the cord which bind they to the rock of error \* \* \* have be suffer to remain in its principle and in its doctrine just what it be when the craft of catholic

self-conceit of the blunderer ib p 29 -- if of ` different denomination ' how be they thus conciliate to a society of this ominous nature from which they must themselves of necessity be exclude by that indispensable condition of admittance ' a union ' of religious sentiment in the ` great doctrine ' : which very want of union it be that create these ` different denomination ' no barrister they mean that man of different denomination may yet all believe in the corruption of the human will the redemption by christ the divinity of christ as consubstantial with the father the necessity of the holy spirit or grace -lrb- mean more than the disposition of circumstance -rrb- and the necessity of faith in christ superad to a belief of he action and doctrine -- and yet differ in many other point the point enumerate be call the great point because all christian agree in they except the arian and socinian who for that reason be not deem christian by the rest the roman catholic the lutheran the calvinist the arminian the greek with all they sub-division do yet all accord in these article : -- the bookseller might have say all who repeat the nicene creed n b i do not approve or defend nay i dislike these unite theological bookseller : but this utter barrister be they best friend by attack they so as to secure to they victory and all the advantage of be know to have be wickedly slander -- the best shield a faulty cause can protend against the javelin of fair opposition ib p 56 we savior never in any single instance reprobate the exercise of reason : on the contrary he reprehend severely those who do not exercise it carnal reason be not a phrase to be find in he gospel he appeal to the understanding in all he say and in all he teach he never require ` faith ' in he disciple without first furnish sufficient ` evidence ' to justify it he reason thus : if i have do what no ` human power ' could do you must admit that my power be ` from above ' & c good heaven do he not uniformly require faith as the condition of obtain the evidence as this barrister call it -- that be the miracle what a shameless perversion of the fact he never do reason thus in one instance only and then upbraid the base sensuality of the jew he say : if ye be so base as not to believe what i say from the moral evidence in you own conscience yet pay some attention to it even for my work ' sake and this a ` argumentum ad hominem ' a bitter reproach -lrb- just as if a great chemist should say -- though you do not care for my science or the important truth it present yet even as a amusement superior to that of you juggler to whom you willingly crowd pay some attention to I -rrb- -- this be to be set up against twenty plain text and the whole spirit of the whole gospel besides christ could not reason so for he know that the jew admit both natural and demoniacal miracle and they faith in the latter he never attack though by a ` argumentum ad hominem ' -lrb- for it be no argument in itself -rrb- he deny its applicability to he own work if christ have reason so why do not the barrister quote he word instead of put imaginary word in he mouth ib 60 61 religion be a system of ` reveal ' truth and to affirm of any reveal truth that we ` can not understand ' it be in effect either to deny that it have be reveal or -- which be the same thing -- to admit that it have be reveal in vain it be too worthless i can not go on merciful god hast thou not reveal to we the being of a conscience and of reason and of will -- and do this barrister tell we that he understand they let he know that he do not even understand the very word understanding he do not seem to be aware of the school-boy distinction between the -lrb- greek : hóti estus -rrb- and the -lrb- greek :

note on davison 's discourse on prophecy 1825 -lrb- 1 -rrb- disc iv pt i p 140 as to system of religion alien from christianity if any of they have teach the doctrine of eternal life the reward of obedience as a dogma of belief that doctrine be not they boast but they burden and difficulty inasmuch as they could never defend it they could never justify it on independent grounds of deduction nor produce they warrant and authority to teach it in such precarious and unauthenticated principle it may pass for a conjecture or pious fraud or a splendid phantom : it can not wear the dignity of truth ah why do not mr davison adhere to the manly the glorious strain of think from p 134 -lrb- ` since prophecy ' & c -rrb- to p 139 -lrb- ` that mercy ' -rrb- of this discourse a fact be no subject of scientific demonstration speculatively : we can only bring analogy and these heraclitus socrate plato and other do bring but they main argument remain to this day the main argument -- namely that none but a wicked man dare doubt it when it be not in the light of promise it be in the law of fear at all time a part of the conscience and presuppose in all spiritual conviction ib p 160 some indeed have seek the ` star ' and the ` sceptre ' of balaam 's prophecy where they can not well be find in the reign of david for though a sceptre might be there the star properly be not surely this be a very weak reason a far better be i think suggest by the word ' i shall see he -- i shall behold he ' -- which in no intelligible sense could be true of balaam relatively to david ib p 162 the israelite could not endure the voice and fire of mount sinaus they ask a intermediate messenger between god and they who should temper the awfulness of he voice and impart to they he will in a milder way ` deut ' xviii 15 be the follow argument worthy we consideration if as the learn eichhorn paulus of jena and other of they school have assert mose wait forty day for a tempest and then by the assistance of the natural magic he have learn in the temple of isis ` initiate ' the law all we experience and knowledge of the way in which large body of man be affect would lead we to suppose that the hebrew people would have be keenly excite interested and elevated by a spectacle so grand and so flattering to they national pride but if the voice and appearance be indeed divine and supernatural well must we assume that there be a distinctive though verbally inexpressible terror and disproportion to the mind the sens the whole ` organismus ' of the human beholder and hearer which might both account for and even in the sight of god justify the tremble prayer which deprecate a repetition ib p 164 to justify its application to christ the resemblance between he and mose have often be deduce at large and draw into a variety of particulars among which several point have be take minute and precarious or have so little of dignity or clearness of representation in they that it would be wise to discard they from the prophetic evidence with we present knowledge we be both enable and dispose thus to evolve the full contents of the word ` like ' but i can not help think that the contemporary of mose -lrb- if not otherwise orally instruct -rrb- must have understand it in the first and historical sense at least of joshua ib p 168 a distinguished commentator on the law of mose michaeli vindicate they temporal sanction on the ground of the mosaic code being of the nature of a civil system to the statute of which the reward of a future state would be incongruous and unsuitable i never read either of michaeli 's work but the same view come before I whenever i reflect on the mosaic code who expect in reality of any kind the sharp outline and exclusive character of scientific classification it be the predominance of the characterize constituent that give the name and class do not even we own statute law though co-exist with a separate religious code contain many ` formulæ ' of word which have no sense but for the conscience davison 's stress on the word ` covet ' in the tenth commandment be i think beyond what so ancient a code warrant -- and for the other instance michaeli would remind he that the mosaic constitution be a strict theocracy and that jehovah the god of all be they ` king ' i do not know the particular mode in which michaeli propound and support this position but the position itself as i have present it to my own mind seem to I among the strongest proof of the divine origin of the law and a essential in the harmony of the total scheme of revelation disc iv pt ii p 180 but the first law meet he on he own term it stand upon a present retribution the execution of its sentence be matter of history and the argument result from it be to be answer before the question be carry to another world this be render a very powerful argument by the consideration that though so vast a mind as that of mose though perhaps even a lycurgus might have distinctly foresee the ruin and captivity of the hebrew people as a necessary result of the loss of nationality and the abandonment of the law and religion which be they only point of union they center of gravity -- yet no human intellect could have foresee the perpetuity of such a people as a distinct race under all the aggravate curse of the law weigh on they or that the obstinacy of they adherence to they dividuate institute in persecution dispersion and shame should be in direct proportion to the wantonness of they apostasy from the same in union and prosperity disc v pt ii p 234 except under the dictate of a constrain inspiration it be not easy to conceive how the master of such a work at the time when he have bring it to perfection and behold it in its lustre the labor of so much opulent magnificence and curious art and design to be ` exceed magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all country ' should be occupy with the prospect of its utter ruin and dilapidation and that too under the ` opprobrium ' of god 's vindictive judgment upon it nor to imagine how that strain of sinister prophecy that forebode of malediction should be ascribe to he if he have no such vision reveal here i think mr davison should have crush the objection of the infidel ground on solomon 's subsequent idolatrous impiety the infidel argue that these be not conceivable of a man distinctly conscious of a prior and supernatural inspiration accompany with supernatural manifestation of the divine presence disc vi pt i p 283 in order to evade this conclusion nothing be leave but to deny that isaiah or any person of he age write the book ascribe to he this too be my conclusion but -lrb- if i do not delude myself -rrb- from more evident though not perhaps more certain premiss the age of the cyrus prophecy be the great object of attack by eichhorn and he compiler and i dare not say that in a controversy with these man davison 's argument would appear sufficient but this be not the intended subject of these discourse disc vi pt ii p 289 but how do he express that promise in the image of the resurrection and a immortal state consequently there be imply in the delineation of the lower subject the truth of the greater this remind I of a remark i have elsewhere make respect the expediency of separate the argument address to and valid for a believer from the proof and vindication of scripture intend to form the belief or to convict the infidel disc vi pt iv p 325 when cyrus become master of babylon the prophecy of isaiah be shewn or communicate to he wherein be describe he victory and the use he be appoint to make of it in the restoration of the hebrew people -lrb- ` ezra ' i 1 2 -rrb- this i have be teach to regard as one of josephus 's legend but upon this passage who would not infer that it have ezra for its authority -- who yet do not expressly say that even the prophecy of the far later jeremiah be know or make know to cyrus who -lrb- ezra tell we -rrb- fulfil it if ezra have mean the prediction of isaiah by the word ` he have charge I ' & c why should he not have refer to it together with or even instead of jeremiah be it not more probable that a living prophet have deliver the charge to cyrus see ` ezra ' vi 14 -- again davison make cyrus speak like a christian by omit the affix ` of heaven to the lord god ' in the original cyrus speak as a cyrus might be suppose to do -- namely of a most powerful but yet national deity of a god not of god i have see in so many instance the injurious effect of weak or overstrained argument in defense of religion that i be perhaps more jealous than i need be in the choice of evidence i can never think myself the worse christian for any opinion i may have form respect the price of this or that argument of this or that divine in support of the truth for every one that i reject i could supply two and these -lrb- greek : anékdota -rrb- ib p 336 meanwhile this long repose and obscurity of zerubbabel 's family and of the whole house of david during so many generation prior to the gospel be one of the preparation make whereby to manifest more distinctly the proper glory of it in the birth of the messiah in whichever way i take this whether address to a believer for the purpose of enlighten or to a inquirer for the purpose of establish he faith in prophecy this argument appear to I equally perplexing and obscure it seem ` prima facie ' almost tantamount to a right of infer the fulfilment of a prophecy in b which it do not mention from its entire failure and falsification in a which and which alone it do mention ib p 370 ` behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord ' almost every page of this volume make I feel my own ignorance respect the interpretation of the language of the hebrew prophet and the want of the one idea which would supply the key suppose a infidel to ask I how the jew be to ascertain that john the baptist be elijah the prophet -- be i to assert the pre-existence of john 's personal identity as elijah if not why elijah rather than any other prophet one answer be obvious enough that the contemporary of john hold elijah as the common representative of the prophet but do malachi do so ib p 373 i can not conceive a more beautiful synopsis of a work on the prophecy of the old testament than be give in this recapitulation would that its truth have be equally well substantiate that it can be that it will be i have the liveliest faith -- and that mr davison have contribute as much as we ought to expect and more than any contemporary divine i acknowledge and honor he accordingly but much very much remain to be do before these three page merit the name of a recapitulation disc vii p 375 if i need proof of the immense importance of the doctrine of idea and how little it be understand the follow discourse would supply it the whole discussion on prescience and freewill with exception of the page or two borrow from skelton display a unacquaintance with the deeper philosophy and a helplessness in the management of the particular question which i know not how to reconcile with the steadiness and clearness of insight evince in the earlier discourse i neither do nor ever could see any other difficulty on the subject than what be contain and anticipate in the idea of eternity by idea i mean intuition not sensuous which can be express only by contradictory conception or to speak more accurately be in themselves necessarily both inexpressible and inconceivable but be suggest by two contradictory position this be the essential character of all idea consequently of eternity in which the attribute of omniscience and omnipotence be include now prescience and freewill be in fact nothing more than the two contradictory position by which the human understanding struggle to express successively the idea of eternity not eternity in the negative sense as the mere absence of succession much less eternity in the senseless sense of a infinite time but eternity -- the eternal as deity as god we theologian forget that the objection apply equally to the possibility of the divine will but if they reply that prescience apply to a eternal ` entis absoluti tota et simultanea fruitio ' be but a anthropomorphism or term of accommodation the same answer serve in respect of the human will for the epithet human do not enter into the syllogism as to contingency whence do mr davison learn that it be a necessary accompaniment of freedom or of free action my philosophy teach I the very contrary ib p 392 he contend without reserve that the free action of man be not within the divine prescience rest he doctrine partly on the assumption that there be no strict and absolute prediction in scripture of those action in which man be represent as free and responsible and partly on the abstract reason that such action be in they nature impossible to be certainly foreknown i utterly deny contingency except in relation to the limited and imperfect knowledge of man but the misery be that man write about freewill without a single meditation on will absolutely on the idea -lrb- greek : katt ' exochàen -rrb- without any idea and so bewilder themselves in the jungle of alien conception and to understand the truth they overlay they reason disc viii p 416 it would not be easy to calculate the good which a man like mr davison might effect under god by a work on the messianic prophecy specially intend for and address to the present race of jew -- if only he would make himself acquaint with they objection and way of understand scripture for instance a learn jew would perhaps contend that this prophecy of isaiah -lrb- c ii 2-4 -rrb- can not fairly be interpret of a mere local origination of a religion historically as the drama might be describe as go forth from athen and philosophy from academus and the paint porch but must refer to a established and continuing seat of worship ' a house of the god of jacob ' the answer to this be provide in the precede verse ` in the top of the mountain ' which irrefragably prove the figurative character of the whole prediction ib p 431 one point however be certain and equally important namely that the christian church when it come to recognize more truly the obligation impose upon it by the original command of its founder ` go teach all nation ' & c that the duty here recommend be deducible from this text be quite clear to my mind but whether it be the direct sense and primary intention of the word whether the first meaning be not negative -- -lrb- ` have no respect to what nation a man be of but teach it to all indifferently whom you have a opportunity of address ' -rrb- -- this be not so clear the larger sense be not without its difficulty nor be this narrower sense without its practical advantage disc ix p 453 4 the striking inferiority of several of these latter discourse in point of style as compare with the first 150 page of this volume perplex I it seem more than mere carelessness or the occasional ` infausta tempora scribendus ' can account for i question whether from any modern work of a tenth part of the merit of these discourse either in matter or in force and felicity of diction and composition as many uncouth and awkward sentence could be extract the paragraph in page 453 and 454 be not a specimen of the worst in a volume which ought to be and which probably will be in every young clergyman 's library these ` maculæ ' be subject of just regret the utility of the work no less than its great comparative excellence render its revision a duty on the part of the author speck be no trifle in diamond disc xii p 519 four such ruling kingdom do arise the first the babylonian be in be when the prophecy be represent to have be give it be follow by the persian the persian give way to the grecian the roman close the series this be stoutly deny by eichhorn who contend that the mede or medo-persian be the second -- if i recollect aright but it always strike I that eichhorn like other learn infidel be catch in he own snare for if the prophecy be of the age of the first empire and actually deliver by daniel there be no reason why the roman empire should not have be predict -- for superhuman prediction the last two at least must have be but if the book be a forgery or a political poem like gray 's bard or lycophron 's cassandra and later than antiochus epiphane it be strange and most improbable that the roman should have escape notice in both case the omission of the last and most important empire be inexplicable ib p 521 yet we have it on authority of josephus that daniel 's prophecy be read publicly among the jew in they worship as well as they other receive scripture it be but fair however to remember that the jewish church rank the book of daniel in the third class only among the hagiographic -- passionately almost as the jew before and at the time of we savior be attach to it ib p 522-3 but to a jewish eye or to any eye place in the same position of view in the age of antiochus epiphane it be utterly impossible to admit that this superior strength of the roman power to reduce and destroy this heavier arm of subjugation could have reveal itself so plainly as to warrant the express deliberate description of it ` quære ' see polybius ib we shall yet have to inquire how it could be foresee that this fourth this yet unestablished empire should be the last in the line this be a sound and weighty argument which the precede do not i confess strike I as be on the contrary the admission that by a writer of the maccabaic æra the roman power could scarcely have be overlook greatly strengthen this second argument as naturally suggest expectation of change and wave-like succession of empire rather than the idea of a last in the age of augustus this might possibly have occur to a profound thinker but the age of antiochus be too late to permit the roman power to escape notice and not late enough to suggest its exclusive establishment so as to leave no source of succession -lrb- footnote 1 : discourse on prophecy in which be consider its

respect the restoration of the jew -lrb- ` deuteron ' xxv 1-8 -rrb- it may be long before edward irving see what i seem at least to see so clearly -- and yet i doubt not the time will come when he too will see with the same evidentness -- how much grander a front he system would have present to judicious beholder on how much more defensible a position he would have place it -- and the remark apply equally to ben ezra -lrb- that be emanuel lacunza -rrb- -- have he trust the proof to scripture of undisputed catholicity to the spirit of the whole bible to the consonance of the doctrine with the reason its fitness to the need and capacity of mankind and its harmony with the general plan of the divine dealings with the world -- and have leave the apocalypse in the back ground but alas instead of this he have give it such prominence such prosiliency of relief that he have make the main strength of he hope appear to rest on a vision so obscure that he own author and faith 's - mate claim a meaning for its contents only on the supposition that the meaning be yet to come preliminary discourse p lxxx now of these three the office of christ as we prophet be the means use by the holy spirit for work the redemption of the understanding of man that faculty by which we acquire the knowledge on which proceed both we inward principle of conduct and we outward act of power i can not forbear express my regret that mr irving have not adhere to the clear and distinct exposition of the understanding ` genere et gradu ' give in the aid to reflection -lrb- 3 -rrb- what can be plainer than to say : the understanding be the medial faculty or faculty of means as reason on the other hand be the source of idea or ultimate end by reason we determine the ultimate end : by the understanding we be enable to select and adapt the appropriate means for the attainment of or approximation to this end accord to circumstance but a ultimate end must of necessity be a idea that be that which be not representable by the sense and have no entire correspondent in nature or the world of the sens for in nature there can be neither a first nor a last : -- all that we can see smell taste touch be mean and only in a qualified sense and by the defect of we language entitle end they be only relatively end in a chain of motive b be the end to a but it be itself a mean to c and in like manner c be a mean to d and so on thus word be the means by which we reduce appearance or thing present through the sens to they several kind or ` genus ' that be we generalize and thus think and judge hence the understanding consider specially as a intellective power be the source and faculty of word -- and on this account the understanding be justly define both by archbishop leighton and by immanuel kant the faculty that judge by or accord to sense however practical or intellectual it be one and the same understanding and the definition the medial faculty express its true character in both direction alike i be urgent on this point because on the right conception of the same namely that understanding and sense -lrb- to which the sensibility supply the material of outness ` materiam objectivam ' -rrb- constitute the natural mind of man depend the comprehension of st paul 's whole theological system and this natural mind which be name the mind of the flesh -lrb- greek : phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- as likewise -lrb- greek : psychikàe synesis -rrb- the intellectual power of the living or animal soul st paul everywhere contradistinguish from the spirit that be the power result from the union and

inventor of many corruption that heresiarch be give up to the belly and the palate place therein the happiness of man and so teach he disciple that after the resurrection \* \* \* and what appear most important each would be master of a entire seraglio like a sultan & c i find very great difficulty in credit these black charge on cerinthus and know not how to reconcile they with the fact that the apocalypse itself be by many attribute to cerinthus but mr hunt be not more famous for black than some of the father ib pp 73 4 against whom a very eloquent man dionysius alexandrinus a father of the church write a elegant work to ridicule the millennarian fable the golden and gemmed jerusalem on the earth the renewal of the temple the blood of victim if the book of st dionysius have contain nothing but the derision and confutation of all we have just read it be certain that he doth in no way concern himself with the harmless millennarian but with the jew and judaizer it be to be clearly see that dionysius have nothing in he eye but the ridiculous excess of nepo and he peculiar tenet upon circumcision & c lacunza i suspect be ignorant of greek : and seem not to have know that the object of dionysius be to demonstrate that the apocalypse be neither authentic nor a canonical book ib p 85 the ruin of antichrist with all that be comprehend under that name be entirely consummate and the king of king remain master of the field st john immediately continue in the 20th chapter which thus commenceth : ` and i see a angel come down from heaven & c and i see throne & c and when a thousand year be expire satan shall be loose out of he prison ' it be only necessary to know that the whole book from the first verse to the last be write in symbol to be satisfy that the true meaning of this passage be simply that only the great confessor and martyr will be have in remembrance and honor in the church after the establishment of christianity throughout the roman empire and observe it be the soul that the seer behold : -- there be not a word of the resurrection of the body -- for this would indeed have be the appropriate symbol of a resurrection in a real and personal sense ib c vi p 108 now this very thing st john likewise declareth \* \* to wit ` that they who have be behead for the testimony of jesus and for the word of god and they who have not worship the beast ' these shall live ` or be raise ' at the come of the lord ` which be the first resurrection ' aye but by what authority be this synonimizing or assert the seer not only do not speak of any resurrection but by the word -lrb- greek : psychás -rrb- soul expressly assert the contrary in no sense of the word can soul which descend in christ 's train -lrb- ` chorus sacer animarum et christi comitatus ' -rrb- from heaven be say ` resurgere ' resurrection be always and exclusively resurrection in the body -- not indeed a rise of the ` corpus ' -lrb- greek : phantastikón -rrb- that be the few ounce of carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen and phosphate of lime the ` copula ' of which that give the form no longer exist -- and of which paul exclaim -- ` thou fool not this ' & c -- but the ` corpus ' -lrb- greek : hypostatikòn àe noúmenon -rrb- but there be yet another and worse wresting of the text who that read lacunza p 108 last line but twelve would not understand that the apocalypt have assert this enthronement of the soul of the gentile and judæo-christian martyr which he behold in the train or suite of the descend messiah and that he have first see they in the descent and afterward see throne assign to they whereas the sentence precede and have positively no connection with these soul the literal interpretation of the symbol c xx v 4 be i then behold the christian religion the established religion of the state throughout the roman empire -- emperor king magistrate and the like all christian and administer law in the name of christ that be receive the scripture as the supreme and paramount law then in all the temple the name of jesus be invoke as the king of glory and together with he the old afflict and torment fellow-laborer with christ be revive in high and reverential commemoration & c but that the whole vision from first to last in every sentence yea every word be symbolical and in the boldest largest style of symbolic language and secondly that it be a work of dispute canonicity and at no known period of the church could truly lay claim to catholicity -- but for this i think this verse would be worth a cartload of the text which the romanist divine and catechist ordinarily cite as sanction the invocation of saint ib p 110 you will say nevertheless that even the wicked will be raise incorruptible to inherit incorruption because be once raise they body will no more change or be dissolve but must continue entire for ever unite with they sad and miserable soul well and would you call this corruption or incorruptibility certainly this be not the sense of the apostle when he formally assure we yea even threaten we that corruption can not inherit incorruption ` neither doth corruption inherit incorruption ' what then may this singular expression mean this be what it manifestly mean -- that no person whoever he may be without any exception who possesseth a corrupt heart and corrupt action and therein persevereth unto death shall have reason to expect in the resurrection a pure subtile active and impassible body this be actually dangerous tamper with the written letter without touch on the question whether st paul in this celebrated chapter -lrb- 1 ` cor ' xv -rrb- speak of a partial or of the general resurrection or even concede to lacunza that the former opinion be the more probable i must still vehemently object to this jesuitical interpretation of corruption as use in a moral sense and distinctive of the wicked soul st paul nowhere speak dogmatically or preceptively -lrb- not popularly and incidentally -rrb- of a soul as the proper ` i ' it be always ` we ' or the man how could a regenerate saint put off corruption at the sound of the trump if up to that hour it do not in some sense or other appertain to he but what need of many word it flash on every reader whose imagination supply a unpreoccupied unrefracting ` medium ' to the apostolic assertion that corruption in this passage be a descriptive synonyme of the material sensuous organism common to saint and sinner -- standing in precisely the same relation to the man that the testaceous offensive and defensive armor do to the crab and tortoise these slightly combined and easily decomponible stuff be as incapable of subsist under the altered condition of the earth as a hydatid in the blaze of a tropical sun they would be no longer ` media ' of communion between the man and he circumstance a heavy difficulty press as it appear to I on lacunza 's system as soon as we come to consider the general resurrection we lord -lrb- in book of indubitable and never doubt catholicity -rrb- speak of some who rise to bliss and glory other who at the same time rise to shame and condemnation now if the former class live not during the whole interval from they death to the general resurrection include the millennium or ` die messiæ ' -- how should they whose imperfect or insufficient merit exclude they from the kingdom of the messiah on earth be all at once fit for the kingdom of heaven ib ch vii p 118 it appear to I that this sentence be look to attentively mean in good language this only that the word ` quick ' which the apostle full of the holy spirit set down be a word altogether useless which might without loss have be omit and that it be enough to have set down the word ` dead ' : for by that word alone be the whole express and with much more clearness and brevity the narrow outline within which the jesuit confine the theological reading of they ` alumnus ' be strongly mark in this -lrb- in so many respects -rrb- excellent work : for example the most believe mind with which lacunza take for grant the explode fable of the catechumen ' -lrb- ` vulgo ' apostle ' -rrb- creed have be the quotient of a apostolic ` pic-nic ' to which each of the twelve contribute he several ` symbolum ' ib ch ix p 127 the apostle st peter speaking of the day of the lord say that that day will come suddenly & c -lrb- 2 pet iii 10 -rrb- there be serious difficulty beset the authenticity of the catholic epistle under the name of peter though there exist no grounds for doubt that they be of the apostolic age a large portion too of the difficulty would be remove by the easy and nowise improbable supposition that peter no great scholar or grammarian have dictate the substance the matter and leave the diction and style to he ` amanuensis ' who have be a auditor of st paul the tradition which connect not only mark but luke the evangelist the friend and biographer of paul with peter as a secretary be in favor of this hypothesis but what be of much greater importance especially for the point in discussion be the character of these and other similar description of the ` die messiæ ' the ` die ultima ' and the like be we bind to receive they as article of faith be there sufficient reason to assert they to have be direct revelation immediately vouchsafe to the sacred writer i can not satisfy my judgment that there be -- first because i find no account of any such event have be reveal to the patriarch or to mose or to the prophet and because i do find these event assert and -lrb- for aught i have be able to discover -rrb- for the first time in the jewish church by uninspired rabbi in nearly or altogether the same word as those of the apostle and know that before and in the apostolic age these anticipation have become popular and generally receive notion and lastly because they be borrow by the jew from the greek philosophy and like several other notion take from less respectable quarter adapt to they ancient and national religious belief now i know of no reveal truth that do not originate in revelation and find it hard to reconcile my mind to the belief that any christian truth any essential article of faith should have be first make know by the father of lie or the guess-work of the human understanding blind by paganism or at best without the knowledge of the true god of course i would not apply this to any assertion of any new testament writer which be the final aim and primary intention of the whole passage but only to sentence ` in ordine ad ' some other doctrine or precept ` illustrandi causa ' or ` ad hominem ' or ` more suasorio sive ad ornaturam et rhetorice ' ib part ii p 145 second characteristic ` the kingdom shall be divide ' -- third characteristic ` the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle ' -- fourth characteristic ` they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man : but they shall not cleave one to another ' how exactly do these character apply to the greek empire under the successor of alexander -- when the greek be disperse over the civilized world as artist rhetorician ` grammaticus ' secretary private tutor parasite physician and the like ib p 153 ` for to they he thus speaketh in the gospel : and then shall they see the son of man come in a cloud with power and great glory and when these thing begin to come to pass then look up and lift up you head for you redemption draweth nigh ' i can not deny that there be great force and a impose verisimilitude in this and the precede chapter and much that demand silent thought and respectful attention but still the great question press on I : -- ` come in a cloud ' what be the true import of this phrase have not god himself expound it to the son of man the great apostle assure we all power be give in heaven and on earth he become providence -- that be a divine power behind the cloudy veil of human agency and worldly event and incident control dispose and direct act and event to the gradual unfold and final consummation of the great scheme of redemption the casting forth of the evil and alien nature from man and thus effect the union of the creature with the creator of man with god in and through the son of man even the son of god make manifest now can it be doubt by the attentive and unprejudiced reader of st matthew c xxiv that the son of man in fact come in the utter destruction and devastation of the jewish temple and state during the period from vespasian to hadrian both include and be it a sufficient reason for we reject the teaching of christ himself of christ glorified and in he kingly character that he apostle who disclaim all certain knowledge of the awful event have understand he word otherwise and in a sense more commensurate with they previous notion and the prejudice of they education they communicate they conjecture but as conjecture and these too guard by the avowal that they have no revelation no reveal commentary on they master 's word upon this occasion the great apocalypse of jesus christ while yet in the flesh for by this title be this great prophecy know among the christian of the apostolic age ib p 253 never oh we lady never oh we mother shalt thou fall again into the crime of idolatry be ever blindness like unto this blindness i can imagine but one way of make it seem possible namely that this round square or rectilineal curve -- this honest jesuit i mean -- have confine he conception of idolatry to the worship of false god -- whereas he saint be genuine godling and he ` magna mater ' a goddess in she own right -- and that thus he overlook the meaning of the word ib p 254 the entire text of the apostle be as follow : -- ` now we beseech you brethren by the come of we lord jesus christ and by we gathering together unto he that ye be not soon shake in mind ' & c -lrb- 2 thess ii 1-10 -rrb- o edward irving edward irving by what fascination could you spirit be draw away from passage like this to guess and dream over the rhapsody of the apocalypse for rhapsody accord to you interpretation the poem undeniably be -- though rightly expound it be a well knit and highly poetical evolution of a part of this and we lord 's more comprehensive prediction ` luke ' xvii ib p 297 on the ordinary idea of the come of christ in glory and majesty it will doubtless appear a extravagance to name the jew or to take they into consideration for accord to those idea they should hardly have the least particle of we attention in compare this with the precede chapter i could not help exclaim what a excellent book would this jesuit have write if daniel and the apocalypse have not exist or have be unknown to or reject by he you may divide lacunza 's point of belief into two parallel column -- the first would be find to contain much that be demand by much that be consonant to and nothing that be not compatible with reason the harmony of holy writ and the idea of christian faith the second would consist of puerility and anility some impossible most incredible and all so silly so sensual as to befit a dream talmudist not a scriptural christian and this latter column

beaumont 's note be concern he victory be complete sect iv p 210 the intellectual spirit be move upon the chaos of mind which ignorance and necessity have throw into collision and confusion and the result will be a new creation nature -lrb- to use the nervous language of an-old writer -rrb- will be melt down and recoin and all will be bright and beautiful alas if this be possible now or at any time henceforward whence come the dross if nature be bullion that can be melt and thus purify by the conjoint action of heat and elective attraction i pray mr noble to tell I to what name or ` genus ' he refer the dross will he tell I to the devil whence come the devil and how be the pure bullion so thoughtlessly make as to have a elective affinity for this devil sect v p 286 the next anecdote that i shall adduce be similar in its nature to the last \* \* \* the relater be dr still counsellor at the court of the duke of baden in a work entitle ` die theorie der geister-kunde ' print in 1808 mr noble be a man of too much english good sense to have rely on sing 's -lrb- ` alias ' dr stilling 's -rrb- testimony have he ever read the work in which this passage be find i happen to possess the work and a more anile credulous solemn fop never exist since the day of old audley it be strange that mr noble should not have hear that these three anecdote be first relate by immanuel kant and still exist in he miscellaneous writings ib p 315 can he be a sane man who record the subsequent reverie as matter of fact the baron inform we that on a certain night a man appear to he in the midst of a strong shine light and say ' i be god the lord the creator and redeemer i have choose thee to explain to man the interior and spiritual sense of the sacred writings : i will dictate to thee what thou oughtest to write ' from this period the baron relate he be so illumine as to behold in the clearest manner what pass in the spiritual world and that he could converse with angel and spirit as with man & c i remember no such passage as this in swedenborg 's work indeed it be virtually contradict by they whole tenor swedenborg assert himself to relate ` visa et audita ' -- he own experience as a traveller and visitor of the spiritual world -- not the word of another as a mere ` amanuensis ' but altogether this gulielmus must be a silly billy ib p 321 the apostolic canon in such case be ` believe not every spirit but try the spirit whether they be of god ' -lrb- 1 john iv 1 -rrb- and the touchstone to which they be to be bring be point out by the prophet : ` to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not accord to this word it be because there be no truth in they ' -lrb- be viii 20 -rrb- but instead of this canon you offer another \* \* \* it be simply this : whoever profess to be the bearer of divine communication be insane to bring swedenborg within the operation of this rule you quote as if from he own work a passage which be nowhere to be find in they but which you seem to have take from some biographical dictionary or cyclopædia few or none of which give anything like a fair account of the matter aye my memory do not fail I i find as to insanity in the sense intend by gulielmus namely as ` mania ' -- i should as little think of charge swedenborg with it as of call a friend mad who labor under a ` acyanoblepsium ' ib p 323 do you never read of one who say in word very like you version of the baron 's reverie : ` it come to pass that as i take my journey and be come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shine from heaven a great light round about I : and i fall on the ground and hear a voice say unto I saul saul why persecutest thou I ' in the short space of four year the newspaper contain three several case two of which i cut out and still have among my ocean of papers and which as state be as nearly parallel in external accompaniment to st paul 's as case can well be : -- strike with lightning -- hear the thunder as a articulate voice -- blind for a few day and suddenly recover they sight but then there be no anania no confirm revelation to another this it be that justified st paul as a wise man in regard the incident as supernatural or as more than a providential omen n b not every revelation require a sensible miracle as the credential but every revelation of a new series of ` credenda ' the prophet appeal to record of acknowledged authority and to they obvious sense literally interpret the baptist need no miracle to attest he right of call sinner to repentance see ` exodus ' iv 10 ib pp 346 7 this sentiment that miracle be not the proper evidence of doctrinal truth be assuredly the decision of the truth itself as be obvious from many passage in scripture we have see that the design of the miracle of mose as external performance be not to instruct the israelite in spiritual subject but to make they obedient subject of a peculiar species of political state and though the miracle of jesus christ collaterally serve as testimony to he character he repeatedly intimate that this be not they main design \* \* \* at another time more plainly still he say that it be ' a wicked and adulterous generation ' -lrb- that -rrb- ` seeketh after a sign ' on which occasion accord to mark ` he sigh deeply in he spirit ' how characteristic be that touch of the apostle ` the jew require a sign and the greek seek after wisdom ' -lrb- where by wisdom he mean the elegance and refinement of grecian literature -rrb- agree as in the main i do with the sentiment here express by this eloquent writer i must notice that he have however mistake the sense of the -lrb- greek : saemeion -rrb- which the jew would have tempt we savior to shew -- namely the signal for revolt by openly declare himself they king and lead they against the roman the foreknowledge that this superstition would shortly hurry they into utter ruin cause the deep sigh -- as on another occasion the bitter tear again by the -lrb- greek : sophía -rrb- of the greek they disputatious -lrb- greek : sophistikàe -rrb- be mean the sophist pretend to teach wisdom as a art : and ` sophistæ ' may be literally render wisdom-monger as we say iron-mongers ib p 350 some probably will say what argument can induce we to believe a man in a concern of this nature who give no visible credentials to he authority \* \* \* but let we ask in return be it worthy of a be wear the figure of a man to require such proof as these to determine he judgment \* \* \* the beast act from the impulse of they bodily sens but be utterly incapable of see from reason why they should so act : and it might easily be shewn that while a man think and act under the influence of a miracle he be as much incapable of perceive from any rational ground why he should thus think and act as a beast be what we opponent will perhaps reply \* \* \* be it not by miracle that the prophet -lrb- some of they -rrb- testify they authority do you not believe these fact yes my friend i do most entirely believe they & c there be so much of truth in all this reasoning on miracle that i feel pain in the thought that the result be false -- because it be not the whole truth but this be the grounding and at the same time pervade error of the swedenborgian -- that they overlook the distinction between congruity with reason truth of consistency or internal possibility of this or that be objectively real and the objective reality as fact miracle ` quoad ' miracle can never supply the place of subjective evidence that be of insight but neither can subjective insight supply the place of objective sight the certainty of the truth of a mathematical arch can never prove the fact of its existence i anticipate the answer but know that they likewise proceed from the want of distinguish between idea such as god eternity the responsible will the good and the like -- the actuality of which be absolutely subjective and include both the relatively subjective and the relatively objective as higher or transcendant reality which alone be the proper object of faith the great postulate of reason in order to its own admission of its own being -- the not distinguishing i say between these and those position which must be either matter of fact or fiction for such latter position it be that miracle be require in lieu of experience a 's testimony of experience supply the want of the same experience for b c d & c for example how many thousand believe the existence of red snow on the testimony of captain parry but who can expect more than hint in a marginal note sect vi pp 378 9 380 1 in the general view then which be present in the writings of swedenborg on the subject of heaven and hell as the abode respectively of happiness and of misery while there certainly be not anything which be not in the highest degree agreeable both to reason and scripture there also seem nothing which could be deem inconsistent with the usual conception of the christian world what tend to render think reader a little sceptical be the want of a distinct boundary between the deduction from reason and the article the truth of which be to rest on the baron 's personal testimony he ` visa et audita ' nor be the baron himself -lrb- as it appear to I -rrb- quite consistent on this point ib p 434 witness again the poet milton who introduce active sport among the recreation which he deem worthy of angel and -lrb- strange indeed for a puritan -rrb- include even dancing among the number how could a man of noble 's sense and sensibility bring himself thus to profane the awful name of milton by associate it with the epithet puritan i have often think of write a work to be entitle ` vindiciæ heterodoxæ sive celebrium virorum -lrb- greek : paradogmatizóntôn -rrb- defensio ' that be vindication of great man unjustly brand and at such time the name prominent to my mind 's eye have be giordano bruno jacob behman benedict spinoza and emanuel swedenborg grant that the origin of the swedenborgian theology be a problem yet on which ever of the three possible hypothesis -- -lrb- possible i mean for gentleman scholar and christian -rrb- -- it may be solve -- namely : 1 swedenborg 's own assertion and constant belief in the hypothesis of a supernatural illumination or 2 that the great and excellent man be lead into this belief by become the subject of a very rare but not -lrb- it be say -rrb- altogether unique conjunction of the somniative faculty -lrb- by which the product of the understanding that be to say word conception and the like be render instantaneously into form of sense -rrb- with the voluntary and other power of the wake state or 3 the modest suggestion that the first and second may not be so incompatible as they appear -- still it ought never to be forget that the merit and value of swedenborg 's system do only in a very secondary degree depend on any one of the three for even though the first be adopt the conviction and conversion of such a believer must accord to a fundamental principle of the new church have be work by a insight into the intrinsic truth and goodness of the doctrine severally and collectively and they entire consonance with the light of the write and of the eternal word that be with the scripture and with the sciential and the practical reason or say that the second hypothesis be prefer and that by some hitherto unexplained affection of swedenborg 's brain and nervous system he from the year 1743 thought and reason through the ` medium ' and instrumentality of a series of appropriate and symbolic visual and auditual image spontaneously rise before he and these so clear and so distinct as at length to overpower perhaps he first suspicion of they subjective nature and to become objective for he that be in he own belief of they kind and origin -- still the thought the reasoning the grounds the deduction the fact illustrative or in proof and the conclusion remain the same and the reader might derive the same benefit from they as from the sublime and impressive truth convey in the vision of mirza or the tablet of cebe so much even from a very partial acquaintance with the work of swedenborg i can venture to assert that as a moralist swedenborg be above all praise and that as a naturalist psychologist and theologian he have strong and vary claim on the gratitude and admiration of the professional and philosophical student -- April 1827 p s notwithstanding all that mr noble say in justification of he arrangement it be greatly to be regret that the contents of this work be so confusedly toss together it be however a work of great merit -lrb- footnote 1 : a appeal in behalf of the view of the eternal world and state and the doctrine of faith and life hold by the

entitle the anti-swedenborg address to the reflect of all denomination by samuel noble minister of hanover street chapel london london 1826 ed -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* essay on faith faith may be define as fidelity to we own being -- so far as such be be not and can not become a object of the sens and hence by clear inference or implication to be generally as far as the same be not the object of the sens : and again to whatever be affirm or understand as the condition or concomitant or consequence of the same this will be best explain by a instance or example that i be conscious of something within I peremptorily command I to do unto other as i would they should do unto I -- in other word a categorical -lrb- that be primary and unconditional -rrb- imperative -- that the maxim -lrb- ` regulum maximum ' or supreme rule -rrb- of my action both inward and outward should be such as i could without any contradiction arise therefrom will to be the law of all moral and rational being -- this i say be a fact of which i be no less conscious -lrb- though in a different way -rrb- nor less assure than i be of any appearance present by my outward sens nor be this all but in the very act of be conscious of this in my own nature i know that it be a fact of which all man either be or ought to be conscious -- a fact the ignorance of which constitute either the non-personality of the ignorant or the guilt in which latter case the ignorance be equivalent to knowledge wilfully darken i know that i possess this consciousness as a man and not as samuel taylor coleridge hence know that consciousness of this fact be the root of all other consciousness and the only practical contradistinction of man from the brute we name it the conscience by the natural absence or presume presence of which the law both divine and human determine whether x y z be a thing or a person : -- the conscience be that which never to have have place the object in the same order of thing as the brute for example idiot and to have lose which imply either insanity or apostasy well -- this we have affirm be a fact of which every honest man be as fully assure as of he see hearing or smell but though the former assurance do not differ from the latter in the degree it be altogether diverse in the kind the sens be morally passive while the conscience be essentially connect with the will though not always nor indeed in any case except after frequent attempt and aversion of will dependent on the choice thence we call the presentation of the sens impression those of the conscience command or dictate in the sens we find we receptivity and as far as we personal being be concern we be passive -- but in the fact of the conscience we be not only agent but it be by this alone that we know ourselves to be such nay that we very passiveness in this latter be a act of passiveness and that we be patient -lrb- ` patiente ' -rrb- -- not as in the other case ` simply ' passive the result be the consciousness of responsibility and the proof be afford by the inward experience of the diversity between regret and remorse if i have sound ear and my companion speak to I with a due proportion of voice i may persuade he that i do not hear but can not deceive myself but when my conscience speak to I i can by repeat effort render myself finally insensible to which add this other difference in the case of conscience namely that to make myself deaf be one and the same thing with make my conscience dumb till at length i become unconscious of my conscience frequent be the instance in which it be suspend and as it be drown in the inundation of the appetite passion and imagination to which i have resign myself make use of my will in order to abandon my free-will and there be not i fear example want of the conscience be utterly destroy or of the passage of wickedness into madness -- that species of madness namely in which the reason be lose for so long as the reason continue so long must the conscience exist either as a good conscience or as a bad conscience it appear then that even the very first step that the initiation of the process the become conscious of a conscience partake of the nature of a act it be a act in and by which we take upon ourselves a allegiance and consequently the obligation of fealty and this fealty or fidelity imply the power of be unfaithful it be the first and fundamental sense of faith it be likewise the commencement of experience and the result of all other experience in other word conscience in this its simplest form must be suppose in order to consciousness that be to human consciousness brute may be and be scion but those being only who have a i ` scire possunt hoc vel illud una cum seipsis ' that be ` conscire vel scire aliquid mecum ' or to know a thing in relation to myself and in the act of know myself as act upon by that something now the third person could never have be distinguish from the first but by means of the second there can be no he without a previous thou much less could a i exist for we except as it exist during the suspension of the will as in dream and the nature of brute may be best understand by conceive they as somnambulist this be a deep meditation though the position be capable of the strictest proof -- namely that there can be no i without a thou and that a thou be only possible by a equation in which i be take as equal to thou and yet not the same and this again be only possible by put they in opposition as correspondent opposite or correlative in order to this a something must be affirm in the one which be reject in the other and this something be the will i do not will to consider myself as equal to myself for in the very act of constitute myself ` i ' i take it as the same and therefore as incapable of comparison that be of any application of the will if then i ` minus ' the will be the ` thesis ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- thou ` plus ' will must be the ` antithesis ' but the equation of thou with i by means of a free act negative the sameness in order to establish the equality be the true definition of conscience but as without a thou there can be no you so without a you no they these or those and as all these conjointly form the material and subject of consciousness and the condition of experience it be evident that the con-science be the root of all consciousness -- ' a fortiorus ' the precondition of all experience -- and that the conscience can not have be in its first revelation deduce from experience soon however experience come into play we learn that there be other impulse beside the dictate of conscience that there be power within we and without we ready to usurp the throne of conscience and busy in tempting we to transfer we allegiance we learn that there be many thing contrary to conscience and therefore to be reject and utterly exclude and many that can coexist with its supremacy only by be subjugate as beast of burthen and other again as for instance the social tenderness and affection and the faculty and excitation of the intellect which must be at least subordinate the preservation of we loyalty and fealty under these trial and against these rival constitute the second sense of faith and we shall need but one more point of view to complete its full import this be the consideration of what be presuppose in the human conscience the answer be ready as in the equation of the correlative i and thou one of the twin constituent be to be take as ` plus ' will the other as ` minus ' will so be it here : and it be obvious that the reason or ` super ' - individual of each man whereby he be man be the factor we be to take as ` minus ' will and that the individual will or personalize principle of free agency -lrb- arbitrement be milton 's word -rrb- be the factor marked ` plus ' will -- and again that as the identity or coinherence of the absolute will and the reason be the peculiar character of god so be the ` synthesis ' of the individual will and the common reason by the subordination of the former to the latter the only possible likeness or image of the ` prothesis ' or identity and therefore the require proper character of man conscience then be a witness respect the identity of the will and the reason effect by the self-subordination of the will or self to the reason as equal to or represent the will of god but the personal will be a factor in other moral ` synthesis ' for example appetite ` plus ' personal will = sensuality lust of power ` plus ' personal will = ambition and so on equally as in the ` synthesis ' on which the conscience be ground not this therefore but the other ` synthesis ' must supply the specific character of the conscience and we must enter into a analysis of reason such as the nature and object of the reason be such must be the function and object of the conscience and the former we shall best learn by recapitulate those constituent of the total man which be either contrary to or disparate from the reason i reason and the proper object of reason be wholly alien from sensation reason be supersensual and its antagonist be appetite and the object of appetite the lust of the flesh ii reason and its object do not appertain to the world of the sens inward or outward that be they partake not of sense or fancy reason be super-sensuous and here its antagonist be the lust of the eye iii reason and its object be not thing of reflection association discursion discourse in the old sense of the word as oppose to intuition discursive or intuitive as milton have it reason do not indeed necessarily exclude the finite either in time or in space but it include they 'em inenter ' thus the prime mover of the material universe be affirm to contain all motion as its cause but not to be or to suffer motion in itself reason be not the faculty of the finite but here i must premise the follow the faculty of the finite be that which reduce the confused impression of sense to they essential form -- quantity quality relation and in these action and reaction cause and effect and the like thus raise the material furnish by the sens and sensation into object of reflection and so make experience possible without it man 's representative power would be a delirium a chaos a scud cloudage of shape and it be therefore most appropriately call the understanding or substantiative faculty we elder metaphysician down to hobbe inclusively call this likewise discourse ` discursus discursio ' from its mode of action as not stay at any one object but run as it be to and fro to abstract generalize and classify now when this faculty be employ in the service of the pure reason it bring out the necessary and universal truth contain in the infinite into distinct contemplation by the pure act of the sensuous imagination that be in the production of the form of space and time abstracted from all corporeity and likewise of the inherent form of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of particulars as in the case of geometry numeral mathematics universal logic and pure metaphysics the discursive faculty then become what we shakspeare with happy precision call discourse of reason we will now take up we reasoning again from the word motion in itself it be evident then that the reason as the irradiative power and the representative of the infinite judge the understanding as the faculty of the finite and can not without error be judge by it when this be attempt or when the understanding in its ` synthesis ' with the personal will usurp the supremacy of the reason or affect to supersede the reason it be then what st paul call the mind of the flesh -lrb- -lrb- greek : phrónaema sarkòs -rrb- -rrb- or the wisdom of this world the result be that the reason be super-finite and in this relation its antagonist be the insubordinate understanding or mind of the flesh iv reason as one with the absolute will -lrb- ` in the beginning be the logo and the logo be with god and the logo be god ' -rrb- and therefore for man the certain representative of the will of god be above the will of man as a individual will we have see in iii that it stand in antagonism to all mere particulars but here it stand in antagonism to all mere individual interest as so many self to the personal will as seek its object in the manifestation of itself for itself -- ` sit pro ratione voluntas ' -- whether this be realize with adjunct as in the lust of the flesh and in the lust of the eye or without adjunct as in the thirst and pride of power despotism egoistic ambition the fourth antagonist then of reason be the lust of the will corollary unlike a million of tiger a million of man be very different from a million time one man each man in a numerous society be not only coexistent with but virtually organize into the multitude of which he be a integral part he ` idem ' be modify by the ` alter ' and there arise impulse and object from this ` synthesis ' of the ` alter et idem ' myself and my neighbor this again be strictly analogous to what take place in the vital organization of the individual man the cerebral system of nerve have its correspondent ` antithesis ' in the abdominal system : but hence arise a ` synthesis ' of the two in the pectoral system as the intermediate and like a drawbridge at once conductor and boundary in the latter as objectize by the former arise the emotion affection and in one word the passion as distinguish from the cognition and appetite now the reason have be show to be super-individual generally and therefore not less so when the form of a individualization subsist in the ` alter ' than when it be confine to the ` idem ' not less when the emotion have they conscious or believe object in another than when they subject be the individual personal self for though these emotion affection attachment and the like be the prepared ladder by which the lower nature be take up into and make to partake of the highest room -- as we be teach to give a feeling of reality to the higher ` per medium commune ' with the lower and thus gradually to see the reality of the higher -lrb- namely the object of reason -rrb- and finally to know that the latter be indeed and pre-eminently real as if you love you earthly parent whom you see by these means you will learn to love you heavenly father who be invisible -- yet this hold good only so far as the reason be the president and its object the ultimate aim and case may arise in which the christ as the logo or redemptive reason declare ` he that love father or mother more than I be not worthy of I ' nay he that can permit he emotion to rise to a equality with the universal reason be in enmity with that reason here then reason appear as the love of god and its antagonist be the attachment to individual wherever it exist in diminution of or in competition with the love which be reason in these five paragraph i have enumerate and explain the several power or force belong or incidental to human nature which in all matter of reason the man be bind either to subjugate or subordinate to reason the application to faith follow of its own accord the first or most indefinite sense of faith be fidelity : then fidelity under previous contract or particular moral obligation in this sense faith be fealty to a rightful superior : faith be the duty of a faithful subject to a rightful governor then it be allegiance in active service fidelity to the liege lord under circumstance and amid the temptation of usurpation rebellion and intestine discord next we seek for that rightful superior on we duty to whom all we duty to all other superior on we faithfulness to whom all we bounden relation to all other object of fidelity be found we must inquire after that duty in which all other find they several degree and dignity and from which they derive they obligative force we be to find a superior whose rights include we duty be present to the mind in the very idea of that supreme be whose sovereign prerogative be predicate imply in the subject as the essential property of a circle be co-assume in the first assumption of a circle consequently underive unconditional and as rationally insusceptible so probably prohibitive of all further question in this sense then faith be fidelity fealty allegiance of the moral nature to god in opposition to all usurpation and in resistance to all temptation to the place any other claim above or equal with we fidelity to god the will of god be the last ground and final aim of all we duty and to that the whole man be to be harmonize by subordination subjugation or suppression alike in commission and omission but the will of god which be one with the supreme intelligence be reveal to man through the conscience but the conscience which consist in a inappellable bearing-witness to the truth and reality of we reason may legitimately be construe with the term reason so far as the conscience be prescriptive while as approve or condemn it be the consciousness of the subordination or insubordination the harmony or discord of the personal will of man to and with the representative of the will of god this bring I to the last and fullest sense of faith that be as the obedience of the individual will to the reason in the lust of the flesh as oppose to the supersensual in the lust of the eye as oppose to the supersensuous in the pride of the understanding as oppose to the infinite in the -lrb- greek : phronaema sarko -rrb- in contrariety to the spiritual truth in the lust of the personal will as oppose to the absolute and universal and in the love of the creature as far as it be oppose to the love which be one with the reason namely the love of god thus then to conclude faith subsist in the ` synthesis ' of the reason and the individual will by virtue of the latter therefore it must be a energy and inasmuch as it relate to the whole moral man it must be exert in each and all of he constituent or incident faculty and tendency -- it must be a total not a partial a continuous not a desultory or occasional energy and by virtue of the former that be reason faith must be a light a form of know a beholding of truth in the incomparable word of the evangelist therefore -- ` faith must be a light originate in the logo or the substantial reason which be coeternal and one with the holy will and which light be at the same time the life of man ' now as life be here the sum or collective of all moral and spiritual act in suffer do and be so be faith the source and the sum the energy and the principle of the fidelity of man to god by the subordination of he human will in all province of he nature to he reason as the sum of spiritual truth represent and manifest the will divine end of vol iv -lrb- the final volume in this series -rrb- end of the project gutenberg ebook of coleridge 's literary remains volume 4 by samuel taylor coleridge
