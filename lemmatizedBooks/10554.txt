same experience but the snag i always come up against when i be tell a story be this dash difficult problem of where to begin it it be a thing you do not want to go wrong over because one false step and you be sink i mean if you fool about too long at the start try to establish atmosphere as they call it and all that sort of rot you fail to grip and the customer walk out on you get off the mark on the other hand like a scalded cat and you public be at a loss it simply raise its eyebrow and can not make out what you be talk about and in open my report of the complex case of gussie fink-nottle madeline bassett my cousin angelum my aunt dahlia my uncle thoma young tuppy glossop and the cook anatole with the above spot of dialogue i see that i have make the second of these two floater i shall have to hark back a bit and take it for all in all and weigh this against that i suppose the affair may be say to have have its inception if inception be the word i want with that visit of mine to canne if i have not go to canne i should not have meet the bassett or buy that white mess jacket and angelum would not have meet she shark and aunt dahlia would not have play baccarat yes most decidedly canne be the _ point d'appuus _ right ho then let I marshal my fact i go to canne -- leave jeeve behind he have intimate that he do not wish to miss ascot -- round about the beginning of June with I travel my aunt dahlia and she daughter angelum tuppy glossop angelum 's betrothed be to have be of the party but at the last moment could not get away uncle tom aunt dahlia 's husband remain at home because he can not stick the south of france at any price so there you have the layout -- aunt dahlia cousin angelum and self off to canne round about the beginning of June all pretty clear so far what we stay at canne about two month and except for the fact that aunt dahlia lose she shirt at baccarat and angelum nearly get inhale by a shark while aquaplan a pleasant time be have by all on July the twenty-fifth look bronzed and fit i accompany aunt and child back to london at seven pm on July the twenty-sixth we alight at victorium and at seven-twenty or thereabout we part with mutual expression of esteem -- they to shove off in aunt dahlia 's car to brinkley court she place in worcestershire where they be expect to entertain tuppy in a day or two i to go to the flat drop my luggage clean up a bit and put on the soup and fish preparatory to push round to the drone for a bite of dinner and it be while i be at the flat towel the torso after a much-needed rinse that jeeve as we chat of this and that -- pick up the thread as it be -- suddenly bring the name of gussie fink-nottle into the conversation as i recall it the dialogue run something as follow : self : well jeeve here we be what jeeve : yes sir self : i mean to say home again jeeve : precisely sir self : seem age since i go away jeeve : yes sir self : have a good time at ascot jeeve : most agreeable sir self : win anything jeeve : quite a satisfactory sum thank you sir self : good well jeeve what news on the rialto anybody be phone or call or anything during my ab jeeve : mr fink-nottle sir have be a frequent caller i stare indeed it would not be too much to say that i gape mr fink-nottle yes sir you do not mean mr fink-nottle yes sir but mr fink-nottle 's not in london yes sir well i be blow and i 'll tell you why i be blow i find it scarcely possible to give credence to he statement this fink-nottle you see be one of those freak you come across from time to time during life 's journey who can not stand london he live year in and year out cover with moss in a remote village down in lincolnshire never come up even for the eton and harrow match and when i ask he once if he do not find the time hang a bit heavy on he hand he say no because he have a pond in he garden and study the habit of newt i could not imagine what could have bring the chap up to the great city i would have be prepare to bet that as long as the supply of newt do not give out nothing could have shift he from that village of he be you sure yes sir you get the name correctly fink-nottle yes sir well it be the most extraordinary thing it must be five year since he be in london he make no secret of the fact that the place give he the pip until now he have always stay glue to the country completely surround by newt sir newt jeeve mr fink-nottle have a strong newt complex you must have hear of newt those little sort of lizard thing that charge about in pond oh yes sir the aquatic member of the family salamandrida which constitute the genus molge that be right well gussie have always be a slave to they he use to keep they at school i believe young gentleman frequently do sir he keep they in he study in a kind of glass-tank arrangement and pretty niffy the whole thing be i recall i suppose one ought to have be able to see what the end would be even then but you know what boy be careless heedless busy about we own affair we scarcely give this kink in gussie 's character a thought we may have exchange a occasional remark about it take all sort to make a world but nothing more you can guess the sequel the trouble spread indeed sir absolutely jeeve the craving grow upon he the newt get he arrive at man 's estate he retire to the depths of the country and give he life up to these dumb chum i suppose he use to tell himself that he could take they or leave they alone and then find -- too late -- that he could not it be often the way sir too true jeeve at any rate for the last five year he have be live at this place of he down in lincolnshire as confirm a species-shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refuse to see a soul that be why i be so amaze when you tell I he have suddenly rise to the surface like this i still can not believe it i be incline to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who have be call here be some different variety of fink-nottle the chap i know wear horn-rimmed spectacles and have a face like a fish how do that check up with you datum the gentleman who come to the flat wear horn-rimmed spectacles sir and look like something on a slab possibly there be a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have bring he up to london i be in a position to explain that sir mr fink-nottle confide to I he motive in visit the metropolis he come because the young lady be here young lady yes sir you do not mean he be in love yes sir well i be dash i be really dash i positively be dash jeeve and i be too i mean to say a joke 's a joke but there be limit then i find my mind turn to another aspect of this rummy affair concede the fact that gussie fink-nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fall in love why should he have be haunt my flat like this no doubt the occasion be one of those when a fellow need a friend but i could not see what have make he pick on I it be not as if he and i be in any way bosom we have see a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two year i have not have so much as a post card from he i put all this to jeeve : odd he come to I still if he do he do no argument about that it must have be a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he find i be not here no sir mr fink-nottle do not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeve you have just tell I that this be what he have be do and assiduously at that it be i with whom he be desirous of establish communication sir you but i do not know you have ever meet he i have not have that pleasure until he call here sir but it appear that mr sipperley a fellow student with whom mr fink-nottle have be at the university recommend he to place he affair in my hand the mystery have conk i see all as i dare say you know jeeve 's reputation as a counsellor have long be establish among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discover themselves in any form of soup be always to roll round and put the thing up to he and when he be get a out of a bad spot a put b on to he and then when he have fix up b b send c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth that be how these big consulting practice like jeeve 's grow old sippy i know have be deeply impress by the man 's effort on he behalf at the time when he be try to get engage to elizabeth moon so it be not to be wonder at that he should have advise gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you be act for he be you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what be gussie 's trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i be enable to be of assistance to he no doubt you recall mr sipperley 's predicament sir deeply attach to miss moon he suffer from a rooted diffidence which make it impossible for he to speak i nod i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he could not bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the foot be there not i recollect you say he be let -- what be it -- let something do something cat enter into it if i be not mistaken let ' i dare not ' wait upon ' i would ' sir that be right but how about the cat like the poor cat i ' the adage sir exactly it beat I how you think up these thing and gussie you say be in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavor to formulate a proposal of marriage he courage fail he and yet if he want this female to be he wife he be get to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this be inevitable jeeve i would not have think that this fink-nottle would ever have fall a victim to the divine _ p _ but if he have no wonder he find the go sticky yes sir look at the life he be lead yes sir i do not suppose he have speak to a girl for year what a lesson this be to we jeeve not to shut ourselves up in country house and stare into glass tank you can not be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two course you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tank or you can be a dasher with the sex you can not do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i as i say have rather lose touch but all the same i be exercise about the poor fish as i be about all my pal close or distant who find themselves tread upon life 's banana skin it seem to I that he be up against it i throw my mind back to the last time i have see he about two year ago it have be i have look in at he place while on a motor trip and he have put I right off my feed by bring a couple of green thing with leg to the luncheon table croon over they like a young mother and eventually lose one of they in the salad that picture rise before my eye do not give I much confidence in the unfortunate goof 's ability to woo and win i must say especially if the girl he have earmark be one of these tough modern thug all lipstick and cool hard sardonic eye as she probably be tell I jeeve i say wish to know the worst what sort of a girl be this girl of gussie 's i have not meet the young lady sir mr fink-nottle speak highly of she attraction seem to like she do he yes sir do he mention she name perhaps i know she she be a miss bassett sir miss madeline bassett what yes sir i be deeply intrigued egad jeeve fancy that it be a small world be not it what the young lady be a acquaintance of yours sir i know she well you news have relieve my mind jeeve it make the whole thing begin to seem far more like a practical work proposition indeed sir absolutely i confess that until you supply this information i be feel profoundly dubious about poor old gussie 's chance of induce any spinster of any parish to join he in the saunter down the aisle you will agree with I that he be not everybody be money there may be something in what you say sir cleopatra would not have like he possibly not sir and i doubt if he would go any too well with tallulah bankhead no sir but when you tell I that the object of he affection be miss bassett why then jeeve hope begin to dawn a bit he be just the sort of chap a girl like madeline bassett might scoop in with relish this bassett i must explain have be a fellow visitor of ours at canne and as she and angelum have strike up one of those effervescent friendship which girl do strike up i have see quite a bit of she indeed in my moodier moment it sometimes seem to I that i could not move a step without stub my toe on the woman and what make it all so painful and distressing be that the more we meet the less do i seem able to find to say to she you know how it be with some girl they seem to take the stuff right out of you i mean to say there be something about they personality that paralyse the vocal cord and reduce the contents of the brain to cauliflower it be like that with this bassett and I so much so that i have know occasion when for minute at a stretch bertram wooster might have be observe fumble with the tie shuffling the foot and behave in all other respects in she presence like the complete dumb brick when therefore she take she departure some two week before we do you may readily imagine that in bertram 's opinion it be not a day too soon it be not she beauty mark you that thus numb I she be a pretty enough girl in a droopy blonde saucer-eyed way but not the sort of breath-taker that take the breath no what cause this disintegration in a usually fairly fluent prattler with the sex be she whole mental attitude i do not want to wrong anybody so i will not go so far as to say that she actually write poetry but she conversation to my mind be of a nature calculate to excite the liveliest suspicion well i mean to say when a girl suddenly ask you out of a blue sky if you do not sometimes feel that the star be god 's daisy-chain you begin to think a bit as regard the fusing of she soul and mine therefore there be nothing do but with gussie the posish be entirely different the thing that have stymie I -- viz that this girl be obviously all load down with ideal and sentiment and what not -- be quite in order as far as he be concerned gussie have always be one of those dreamy soulful bird -- you can not shut yourself up in the country and live only for newt if you be not -- and i could see no reason why if he could somehow be induce to get the low burning word off he chest he and the bassett should not hit it off like ham and egg she be just the type for he i say i be most gratified to hear it sir and he be just the type for she in fine a good thing and one to be push along with the utmost energy strain every nerve jeeve very good sir reply the honest fellow i will attend to the matter at once now up to this point as you will doubtless agree what you might call a perfect harmony have prevail friendly gossip between employer and employ and everything as sweet as a nut but at this juncture i regret to say there be a unpleasant switch the atmosphere suddenly change the storm cloud begin to gather and before we know where we be the jarring note have come bound on the scene i have know this to happen before in the wooster home the first intimation i have that thing be about to hot up be a pained and disapproving cough from the neighborhood of the carpet for during the above exchange i should explain while i have dry the frame have be dress in a leisurely manner don here a sock there a shoe and gradually climb into the vest the shirt the tie and the knee-length jeeve have be down on the lower level unpack my effect he now rise hold a white object and at the sight of it i realize that another of we domestic crisis have arrive another of those unfortunate clash of will between two strong man and that bertram unless he remember he fight ancestor and stand up for he rights be about to be put upon i do not know if you be at canne this summer if you be you will recall that anybody with any pretension to be the life and soul of the party be accustom to attend binge at the casino in the ordinary evening-wear trousering top to the north by a white mess-jacket with brass button and ever since i have step aboard the blue train at canne station i have be wonder on and off how mine would go with jeeve in the matter of evening costume you see jeeve be hidebound and reactionary i have have trouble with he before about soft-bosomed shirt and while these mess-jacket have as i say be all the rage -- _ tout ce qu'il y a de chic _ -- on the côte d'azur i have never conceal it from myself even when tread the measure at the palm beach casino in the one i have hasten to buy that there might be something of a upheaval about it on my return i prepare to be firm yes jeeve i say and though my voice be suave a close observer in a position to watch my eye would have notice a steely glint nobody have a greater respect for jeeve 's intellect than i have but this disposition of he to dictate to the hand that feed he have get i feel to be check this mess-jacket be very near to my heart and i jolly well intend to fight for it with all the vim of grand old sieur de wooster at the battle of agincourt yes jeeve i say something on you mind jeeve i fear that you inadvertently leave canne in the possession of a coat belong to some other gentleman sir i switch on the steely a bit more no jeeve i say in a level tone the object under advisement be mine i buy it out there you wear it sir every night but surely you be not propose to wear it in england sir i see that we have arrive at the nub yes jeeve but sir -- you be say jeeve it be quite unsuitable sir i do not agree with you jeeve i anticipate a great popular success for this jacket it be my intention to spring it on the public tomorrow at pongo twistleton 's birthday party where i confidently expect it to be one long scream from start to finish no argument jeeve no discussion whatever fantastic objection you may have take to it i wear this jacket very good sir he go on with he unpacking i say no more on the subject i have win the victory and we wooster do not triumph over a beaten foe presently have complete my toilet i bade the man a cheery farewell and in generous mood suggest that as i be dine out why do not he take the evening off and go to some improve picture or something sort of olive branch if you see what i mean he do not seem to think much of it thank you sir i will remain in i survey he narrowly be this dudgeon jeeve no sir i be oblige to remain on the premise mr fink-nottle inform I he would be call to see I this evening oh gussie 's come be he well give he my love very good sir yes sir and a whisky and soda and so forth very good sir right ho jeeve i then set off for the drone at the drone i run into pongo twistleton and he talk so much about the forthcoming merry-making of he of which good report have already reach I through my correspondent that it be near eleven when i get home again and scarcely have i open the door when i hear voice in the sitting-room and scarcely have i enter the sitting-room when i find that these proceed from jeeve and what appear at first sight to be the devil a closer scrutiny inform I that it be gussie fink-nottle dress as mephistophele -2 - what-ho gussie i say you could not have tell it from my manner but i be feel more than a bit nonplussed the spectacle before I be enough to nonplus anyone i mean to say this fink-nottle as i remember he be the sort of shy shrink goop who might have be expect to shake like a aspen if invite to so much as a social Saturday afternoon at the vicarage and yet here he be if one could credit one 's sens about to take part in a fancy-dress ball a form of entertainment notoriously a testing experience for the toughest and he be attend that fancy-dress ball mark you -- not like every other well-bred englishman as a pierrot but as mephistophele -- this involve as i need scarcely stress not only scarlet tights but a pretty frightful false beard rummy you 'll admit however one mask one 's feeling i betray no vulgar astonishment but as i say what-hoed with civil nonchalance he grin through the fungus -- rather sheepishly i think oh hullo bertie long time since i see you have a spot no thanks i must be off in a minute i just come round to ask jeeve how he think i look how do you think i look bertie well the answer to that of course be perfectly foul but we wooster be man of tact and have a nice sense of the obligation of a host we do not tell old friend beneath we roof-tree that they be a offence to the eyesight i evade the question i hear you be in london i say carelessly oh yes must be year since you come up oh yes and now you be off for a evening 's pleasure he shudder a bit he have i notice a hunt air pleasure be not you look forward to this rout or revel oh i suppose it 'll be all right he say in a toneless voice anyway i ought to be off i suppose the thing start round about eleven i tell my cab to wait will you see if it be there jeeve very good sir there be something of a pause after the door have close a certain constraint i mixed myself a beaker while gussie a glutton for punishment stare at himself in the mirror finally i decide that it would be best to let he know that i be abreast of he affair it might be that it would ease he mind to confide in a sympathetic man of experience i have generally find with those under the influence that what they want more than anything be the listen ear well gussie old leper i say i have be hear all about you eh this little trouble of yours jeeve have tell I everything he do not seem any too brace it be always difficult to be sure of course when a chap have dig himself in behind a mephistophele beard but i fancy he flush a trifle i wish jeeve would not go gas all over the place it be suppose to be confidential i could not permit this tone dish up the dirt to the young master can scarcely be describe as gas all over the place i say with a touch of rebuke anyway there it be i know all and i should like to begin i say sink my personal opinion that the female in question be a sloppy pest in my desire to buck and encourage by say that madeline bassett be a charming girl a winner and just the sort for you you do not know she certainly i know she what beat I be how you ever get in touch where do you meet she be stay at a place near mine in lincolnshire the week before last yes but even so i do not know you call on the neighbor i do not i meet she out for a walk with she dog the dog have get a thorn in its foot and when she try to take it out it snap at she so of course i have to rally round you extract the thorn yes and fall in love at first sight yes well dash it with a thing like that to give you a send-off why do not you cash in immediately i have not the nerve what happen we talk for a bit what about oh bird bird what bird the bird that happen to be hang round and the scenery and all that sort of thing and she say she be go to london and ask I to look she up if i be ever there and even after that you do not so much as press she hand of course not well i mean it look as though there be no more to be say if a chap be such a rabbit that he can not get action when he be hand the thing on a plate he case would appear to be pretty hopeless nevertheless i remind myself that this non-starter and i have be at school together one must make a effort for a old school friend ah well i say we must see what can be do thing may brighten at any rate you will be glad to learn that i be behind you in this enterprise you have bertram wooster in you corner gussie thanks old man and jeeve of course which be the thing that really matter i do not mind admit that i wince he mean no harm i suppose but i be bind to say that this tactless speech nettle I not a little people be always nettle I like that give I to understand i mean to say that in they opinion bertram wooster be a mere cipher and that the only member of the household with brain and resource be jeeve it jar on I and tonight it jar on I more than usual because i be feel pretty dash feed with jeeve over that matter of the mess jacket i mean true i have force he to climb down quell he as describe with the quiet strength of my personality but i be still a trifle shirty at he have bring the thing up at all it seem to I that what jeeve want be the iron hand and what be he do about it i inquire stiffly he be be give the position of affair a lot of thought he have have he it be on he advice that i be go to this dance why she be go to be there in fact it be she who send I the ticket of invitation and jeeve consider -- and why not as a pierrot i say take up the point which have strike I before why this break with a grand old tradition he particularly want I to go as mephistophele i start he do do he he specifically recommend that definite costume yes ha eh nothing just ` ha ' and i 'll tell you why i say ha here be jeeve make heavy weather about I wear a perfectly ordinary white mess jacket a garment not only _ tout ce qu'il y a de chic _ but absolutely _ de rigueur _ and in the same breath as you might say incite gussie fink-nottle to be a blot on the london scene in scarlet tights ironical what one look askance at this sort of in-and-out run what have he get against pierrot i do not think he object to pierrot as pierrot but in my case he think a pierrot would not be adequate i do not follow that he say that the costume of pierrot while please to the eye lack the authority of the mephistophele costume i still do not get it well it be a matter of psychology he say there be a time when a remark like that would have have I snooker but long association with jeeve have develop the wooster vocabulary considerably jeeve have always be a whale for the psychology of the individual and i now follow he like a bloodhound when he snap it out of the bag oh psychology yes jeeve be a great believer in the moral effect of clothes he think i might be embolden in a striking costume like this he say a pirate chief would be just as good in fact a pirate chief be he first suggestion but i object to the boot i see he point there be enough sadness in life without have fellow like gussie fink-nottle go about in sea boot and be you embolden well to be absolutely accurate bertie old man no a gust of compassion shake I after all though we have lose touch a bit of recent year this man and i have once throw inked dart at each other gussie i say take a old friend 's advice and do not go within a mile of this binge but it be my last chance of see she she be off tomorrow to stay with some people in the country besides you do not know do not know what that this idea of jeeve 's will not work i feel a most frightful chump now yes but who can say whether that will not pass off when i get into a mob of other people in fancy dress i have the same experience as a child one year during the christmas festivity they dress I up as a rabbit and the shame be indescribable yet when i get to the party and find myself surround by score of other child many in costume even ghastlier than my own i perk up amazingly join freely in the revel and be able to eat so hearty a supper that i be sick twice in the cab come home what i mean be you can not tell in cold blood i weigh this it be specious of course and you can not get away from it that fundamentally jeeve 's idea be sound in a striking costume like mephistophele i might quite easily pull off something pretty impressive color do make a difference look at newt during the court season the male newt be brilliantly color it help he a lot but you be not a male newt i wish i be do you know how a male newt propose bertie he just stand in front of the female newt vibrate he tail and bend he body in a semi-circle i could do that on my head no you would not find I grouse if i be a male newt but if you be a male newt madeline bassett would not look at you not with the eye of love i mean she would if she be a female newt but she be not a female newt no but suppose she be well if she be you would not be in love with she yes i would if i be a male newt a slight throb about the temple tell I that this discussion have reach saturation point well anyway i say come down to hard fact and cut out all this visionary stuff about vibrate tail and what not the salient point that emerge be that you be book to appear at a fancy-dress ball and i tell you out of my riper knowledge of fancy-dress ball gussie that you will not enjoy yourself it be not a question of enjoy yourself i would not go i must go i keep tell you she be off to the country tomorrow i give it up so be it i say have it you own way yes jeeve mr fink-nottle 's cab sir ah the cab eh you cab gussie oh the cab oh right of course yes rather thanks jeeve well so long bertie and give I the sort of weak smile roman gladiator use to give the emperor before enter the arena gussie trickle off and i turn to jeeve the moment have arrive for put he in he place and i be all for it it be a little difficult to know how to begin of course i mean to say while firmly resolve to tick he off i do not want to gash he feeling too deeply even when display the iron hand we wooster like to keep the thing fairly matey however on consideration i see that there be nothing to be gain by try to lead up to it gently it be never any use beat about the b jeeve i say may i speak frankly certainly sir what i have to say may wind you not at all sir well then i have be have a chat with mr fink-nottle and he have be tell I about this mephistophele scheme of yours yes sir now let I get it straight if i follow you reasoning correctly you think that stimulate by be upholster throughout in scarlet tights mr fink-nottle on encounter the adore object will vibrate he tail and generally let himself go with a whoop i be of opinion that he will lose much of he normal diffidence sir i do not agree with you jeeve no sir no in fact not to put too fine a point upon it i consider that of all the dash silly drivelling idea i ever hear in my puff this be the most blithering and futile it will not work not a chance all you have do be to subject mr fink-nottle to the nameless horror of a fancy-dress ball for nothing and this be not the first time this sort of thing have happen to be quite candid jeeve i have frequently notice before now a tendency or disposition on you part to become -- what be the word i could not say sir eloquent no it be not eloquent elusive no it be not elusive it be on the tip of my tongue begin with a ` e ' and mean be a jolly sight too clever elaborate sir that be the exact word i be after too elaborate jeeve -- that be what you be frequently prone to become you method be not simple not straightforward you cloud the issue with a lot of fancy stuff that be not of the essence all that gussie need be the elder-brotherly advice of a seasoned man of the world so what i suggest be that from now onward you leave this case to I very good sir you lay off and devote yourself to you duty about the home very good sir i shall no doubt think of something quite simple and straightforward yet perfectly effective ere long i will make a point of see gussie tomorrow very good sir right ho jeeve but on the morrow all those telegram start come in and i confess that for twenty-four hour i do not give the poor chap a thought have problem of my own to contend with -3 - the first of the telegram arrive shortly after noon and jeeve bring it in with the before-luncheon snifter it be from my aunt dahlia operating from market snodsbury a small town of sort a mile or two along the main road as you leave she country seat it run as follow : _ come at once traver _ and when i say it puzzle I like the dickens i be understate it if anything as mysterious a communication i consider as be ever flash over the wire i study it in a profound reverie for the best part of two dry martini and a dividend i read it backwards i read it forwards as a matter of fact i have a sort of recollection of even smell it but it still baffle I consider the fact i mean it be only a few hour since this aunt and i have part after be in constant association for nearly two month and yet here she be -- with my farewell kiss still linger on she cheek so to speak -- plead for another reunion bertram wooster be not accustom to this gluttonous appetite for he society ask anyone who know I and they will tell you that after two month of my company what the normal person feel be that that will about do for the present indeed i have know people who could not stick it out for more than a few day before sit down to the well-cooked therefore i send this reply : _ perplexed explain bertie _ to this i receive a answer during the after-luncheon sleep : _ what on earth be there to be perplexed about ass come at once traver _ three cigarette and a couple of turn about the room and i have my response ready : _ how do you mean come at once regard bertie _ i append the comeback : _ i mean come at once you maddening half-wit what do you think i mean come at once or expect a aunt 's curse first post tomorrow love traver _ i then dispatch the follow message wish to get everything quite clear : _ when you say come do you mean come to brinkley court and when you say at once do you mean at once fog at a loss all the best bertie _ i send this one off on my way to the drone where i spend a restful afternoon throw card into a top-hat with some of the better element return in the evening hush i find the answer wait for I : _ yes yes yes yes yes yes yes it do not matter whether you understand or not you just come at once as i tell you and for heaven 's sake stop this back-chat do you think i be make of money that i can afford to send you telegram every ten minute stop be a fathead and come immediately love traver _ it be at this point that i feel the need of get a second opinion i press the bell jeeve i say a v-shaped rumminess have manifest itself from the direction of worcestershire read these i say hand he the papers in the case he scan they what do you make of it jeeve i think mr traver wish you to come at once sir you gather that too do you yes sir i put the same construction on the thing but why jeeve dash it all she be just have nearly two month of I yes

well after four when i get home and by that time i be about ready to turn in i can just remember grope for the bed and crawl into it and it seem to I that the lemon have scarcely touch the pillow before i be arouse by the sound of the door open i be barely tick over but i contrived to raise a eyelid be that my tea jeeve no sir it be mrs traver and a moment later there be a sound like a mighty rush wind and the relative have cross the threshold at fifty mph under she own steam -4 - it have be well say of bertram wooster that while no one view he flesh and blood with a keener and more remorselessly critical eye he be nevertheless a man who delight in give credit where credit be due and if you have follow these memoirs of mine with the proper care you will be aware that i have frequently have occasion to emphasise the fact that aunt dahlia be all right she be the one if you remember who marry old tom traver _ en seconde noce _ as i believe the expression be the year bluebottle win the cambridgeshire and once induce I to write a article on what the well-dressed man be wear for that paper she run -- _ milady 's boudoir _ she be a large genial soul with whom it be a pleasure to hob-nob in she spiritual make-up there be none of that subtle gosh-awfulness which render such a exhibit as say my aunt agatha the curse of the home county and a menace to one and all i have the highest esteem for aunt dahlia and have never waver in my cordial appreciation of she humanity sport quality and general good-eggishness this be so you may conceive of my astonishment at find she at my bedside at such a hour i mean to say i have stay at she place many a time and oft and she know my habit she be well aware that until i have have my cup of tea in the morning i do not receive this crash in at a moment when she know that solitude and repose be of the essence be scarcely i could not but feel the good old form besides what business have she be in london at all that be what i ask myself when a conscientious housewife have return to she home after a absence of seven week one do not expect she to start race off again the day after she arrival one feel that she ought to be stick round minister to she husband confer with the cook feed the cat comb and brushing the pomeranian -- in a word staying put i be more than a little bleary-eyed but i endeavored as far as the fact that my eyelid be more or less glue together would permit to give she a austere and censorious look she do not seem to get it wake up bertie you old ass she cry in a voice that hit I between the eyebrow and go out at the back of my head if aunt dahlia have a fault it be that she be apt to address a _ vis-à-vis _ as if he be somebody half a mile away whom she have observe ride over hound a throwback no doubt to the time when she count the day lose that be not spend in chivy some unfortunate fox over the countryside i give she another of the austere and censorious and this time it register all the effect it have however be to cause she to descend to personality do not blink at I in that obscene way she say i wonder bertie she proceed gaze at I as i should imagine gussie would have gaze at some newt that be not up to sample if you have the faintest conception how perfectly loathsome you look a cross between a orgy scene in the movie and some low form of pond life i suppose

have hear she aright get up and dress yes i turn on the pillow with a little moan and at this juncture jeeve enter with the vital oolong i clutch at it like a drown man at a straw hat a deep sip or two and i feel -- i will not say restore because a birthday party like pongo twistleton 's be not a thing you get restore after with a mere mouthful of tea but sufficiently the old bertram to be able to bend the mind on this awful thing which have come upon I and the more i bent same the less could i grasp the trend of the scenario what be this aunt dahlia i inquire it look to I like tea be she response but you know best you be drink it if i have not be afraid of spilling the healing brew i have little doubt that i should have give a impatient gesture i know i feel like it not the contents

of it but aunt dahlia listen to reason i assure you you have get hold of the wrong man i be hopeless at a game like that ask jeeve about the time i get lug in to address a girl ' school i make the most colossal ass of myself and i confidently anticipate that you will make a equally colossal ass of yourself on the thirty-first of this month that be why i want you the way i look at it be that as

exercise i shall expect you in a day or two and with these heartless word she beetle off leave I a prey to the gloomiest emotion what with the natural reaction after pongo 's party and this stunning blow it be not too much to say that the soul be sear and i be still writhe in the depths when the door open and jeeve appear mr fink-nottle to see you sir he announce -5 - i give he one of my look jeeve i say i have scarcely expect this of you you be aware that i be up to a advanced hour last night you know that i have barely have my tea you can not be ignorant of the effect of that hearty voice of aunt dahlia 's on a man with a headache and yet you come bring I fink-nottle be this a time for fink or any other kind of nottle but do you not give I to understand sir that you wish to see mr fink-nottle to advise he on he affair this i admit open up a new line of think in the stress of my emotion i have clean forget about have take gussie 's interest in hand it alter thing one can not give the raspberry to a client i mean you do not find sherlock holme refuse to see client just because he have be out late the night before at doctor watson 's birthday party i could have wish that the man have select some more suitable hour for approach I but as he appear to be a sort of human lark leave he watery nest at daybreak i suppose i have better give he a audience true i say all right bung he in very good sir but before do so bring I one of those pick-me-up of yours very good sir and presently he return with the vital essence i have have occasion i fancy to speak before now of these pick-me-up of jeeve 's and they effect on a fellow who be hang to life by a thread on the morning after what they consist of i could not tell you he say some kind of sauce the yolk of a raw egg and a dash of red pepper but nothing will convince I that the thing do not go much deeper than that be that as it may however the result of swallow one be amazing for perhaps the split part of a second nothing happen it be as though all nature wait breathless then suddenly it be as if the last trump have sound and judgment day set in with unusual severity bonfire burst out in all in part of the frame the abdomen become heavily charge with molten lava a great wind seem to blow through the world and the subject be aware of something resemble a steam hammer strike the back of the head during this phase the ear ring loudly the eyeball rotate and there be a tingle about the brow and then just as you be feel that you ought to ring up you lawyer and see that you affair be in order before it be too late the whole situation seem to clarify the wind drop the ear cease to ring bird twitter brass band start play the sun come up over the horizon with a jerk and a moment later all you be conscious of be a great peace as i drain the glass now new life seem to burgeon within I i remember jeeve who however much he may go off the rail at time in the matter of dress clothes and in he advice to those in love have always have a neat turn of phrase once speak of someone rise on stepping-stone of he dead self to higher thing it be that way with I now i feel that the bertram wooster who lay prop up against the pillow have become a better stronger finer bertram thank you jeeve i say not at all sir that touch the exact spot i be now able to cope with life 's problem i be gratify to hear it sir what madness not to have have one of those before tackle aunt dahlia however too late to worry about that now tell I of gussie how do he make out at the fancy-dress ball he do not arrive at the fancy-dress ball sir i look at he a bit austerely jeeve i say i admit that after that pick-me-up of yours i feel better but do not try I too high do not stand by my sick bed talk absolute rot we shoot gussie into a cab and he start forth head for wherever this fancy-dress ball be he must have arrive no sir as i gather from mr fink-nottle he enter the cab convince in he mind that the entertainment to which he have be invite be to be hold at no 17 suffolk square whereas the actual rendezvous be no 71 norfolk terrace these aberration of memory be not uncommon with those who like mr fink-nottle belong essentially to what one might call the dreamer-type one might also call it the fatheaded type yes sir well on reach no 17 suffolk square mr fink-nottle endeavor to produce money to pay the fare what stop he the fact that he have no money sir he discover that he have leave it together with he ticket of invitation on the mantelpiece of he bedchamber in the house of he uncle where he be reside bidding the cabman to wait accordingly he ring the door-bell and when the butler appear request he to pay the cab add that it be all right as he be one of the guest invite to the dance the butler then disclaim all knowledge of a dance on the premise and decline to unbelt yes sir upon which -- mr fink-nottle direct the cabman to drive he back to he uncle 's residence well why be not that the happy end all he have to do be go in collect cash and ticket and there he would have be on velvet i should have mention sir that mr fink-nottle have also leave he latchkey on the mantelpiece of he bedchamber he could have ring the bell he do ring the bell sir for some fifteen minute at the expiration of that period he recall that he have give permission to the caretaker -- the house be officially close and all the staff on holiday -- to visit he sailor son at portsmouth golly jeeve yes sir these dreamer type do live do not they yes sir what happen then mr fink-nottle appear to have realize at this point that he position as regard the cabman have become equivocal the figure on the clock have already reach a substantial sum and he be not in a position to meet he obligation he could have explain you can not explain to cabmen sir on endeavor to do so he find the fellow sceptical of he bona fides i should have leg it that be the policy which appear to have commend itself to mr fink-nottle he dart rapidly away and the cabman endeavor to detain he snatch at he overcoat mr fink-nottle contrived to extricate himself from the coat and it would seem that he appearance in the masquerade costume beneath it come as something of a shock to the cabman mr fink-nottle inform I that he hear a species of whistle gasp and look round observe the man crouch against the railing with he hand over he face mr fink-nottle think he be pray no doubt a uneducated superstitious fellow sir possibly a drinker well if he have not be one before i 'll bet he start be one shortly afterwards i expect he could scarcely wait for the pub to open very possibly in the circumstance he might have find a restorative agreeable sir and so in the circumstance might gussie too i should think what on earth do he do after that london late at night -- or even in the daytime for that matter -- be no place for a man in scarlet tights no sir he invite comment yes sir i can see the poor old bird duck down side-street skulk in alley-ways diving into dust-bin i gather from mr fink-nottle 's remark sir that something very much on those line be what occur eventually after a try night he find he way to mr sipperley 's residence where he be able to secure lodging and a change of costume in the morning i nestled against the pillow the brow a bit draw it be all very well to try to do old school friend a spot of good but i could not but feel that in espouse the cause of a lunkhead capable of muck thing up as gussie have do i have take on a contract almost too big for human consumption it seem to I that what gussie need be not so much the advice of a seasoned man of the world as a padded cell in colney hatch and a couple of good keeper to see that he do not set the place on fire indeed for a instant i have half a mind to withdraw from the case and hand it back to jeeve but the pride of the wooster restrain I when we wooster put we hand to the plough we do not readily sheathe the sword besides after that business of the mess-jacket anything resemble weakness would have be fatal i suppose you realize jeeve i say for though one dislike to rub it in these thing have to be point out that all this be you fault sir it be no good say ` sir ' you know it be if you have not insist on he go to that dance -- a mad project as i spot from the first -- this would not have happen yes sir but i confess i do not anticipate -- always anticipate everything jeeve i say a little sternly it be the only way even if you have allow he to wear a pierrot costume thing would not have pan out as they do a pierrot costume have pocket however i go on more kindly we need not go into that now if all this have show you what come of go about the place in scarlet tights that be something gain gussie wait without you say yes sir then shoot he in and i will see what i can do for he -6 - gussie on arrival prove to be still show trace of he grim experience the face be pale the eye gooseberry-like the ear droop and the whole aspect that of a man who have pass through the furnace and be catch in the machinery i hitch myself up a bit higher on the pillow and gaze at he narrowly it be a moment i could see when first aid be require and i prepare to get down to case well gussie hullo bertie what ho what ho these civility conclude i feel that the moment have come to touch delicately on the past i hear you have be through it a bit yes thanks to jeeve it be not jeeve 's fault entirely jeeve 's fault i do not see that i forget my money and latchkey -- and now you would better forget jeeve for you will be interested to hear gussie i say deem it best to put he in touch with the position of affair right away that he be no longer handle you little problem this seem to slip it across he properly the jaw fall the ear droop more limply he have be look like a dead fish he now look like a deader fish one of last year 's cast up on some lonely beach and leave there at the mercy of the wind and tide what yes you do not mean that jeeve be not go to -- no but dash it -- i be kind but firm you will be much better off without he surely you terrible experience of that awful night have tell you that jeeve need a rest the keenest of thinker strike a bad patch occasionally that be what have happen to jeeve i have see it come on for some time he have lose he form he want he plug decarbonize no doubt this be a shock to you i suppose you come here this morning to seek he advice of course i do on what point madeline bassett have go to stay with these people in the country and i want to know what he think i ought to do well as i say jeeve be off the case but bertie dash it -- jeeve i say with a certain asperity be no longer on the case i be now in sole charge but what on earth can you do i curb my resentment we wooster be fair-minded we can make allowance for man who have be parade london all night in scarlet tights that i say quietly we shall see sit down and let we confer i be bind to say the thing seem quite simple to I you say this girl have go to visit friend in the country it would appear obvious that you must go there too and flock round she like a poultice elementary but i can not plant myself on a lot of perfect stranger do not you know these people of course i do not i do not know anybody i purse the lip this do seem to complicate matter somewhat all that i know be that they name be traver and it be a place call brinkley court down in worcestershire i unpursed my lip gussie i say smile paternally it be a lucky day for you when bertram wooster interested himself in you affair as i foresaw from the start i can fix everything this afternoon you shall go to brinkley court a honor guest he quiver like a _ mousse _ i suppose it must always be rather a thrilling experience for the novice to watch I take hold but bertie you do not mean you know these traverse they be my aunt dahlia my gosh you see now i point out how lucky you be to get I behind you you go to

fix up the preliminary formality at brinkley the place be simply ill with atmosphere you will stroll with the girl in the shady walk you will sit with she on the shady lawn you will row on the lake with she and gradually you will find yourself work up to a point where -- by jove i believe you be right of course i be right i have get engage three time at brinkley no business result but the fact remain and i go there without the foggiest idea of indulge in the tender pash i have not the slightest intention of propose to anybody yet no sooner have i enter those romantic grounds than i find myself reach out for the nearest girl in sight and slapping my soul down in front of she it be something in the air i see exactly what you mean that be just what i want to be able to do -- work up to it and in london -- curse the place -- everything 's in such a rush that you do not get a chance quite you see a girl alone for about five minute a day and if you want to ask she to be you wife you

meeting each other every day and see a lot of each other be ` propinquity ' the word you wish sir it be i stake everything on propinquity jeeve propinquity in my opinion be what will do the trick at the moment as you be aware gussie be a mere jelly when in the presence but ask yourself how he will feel in a week or so after he and she have be help themselves to sausage out of the same dish day after day at the breakfast sideboard cut the same ham ladle out communal kidney and bacon -- why -- i break off abruptly i have have one of my idea golly jeeve sir here be a instance of how you have

freely as i drive down to brinkley in the old two-seater that afternoon the news of this rift or rupture of angelum 's and tuppy 's have disturb I greatly the project match you see be one on which i have always look with kindly approval too often when a chap of you acquaintance be plan to marry a girl you know you find yourself knit the brow a bit and chew the lower lip dubiously feel that he or she or both should be warn while there be yet time but i have never feel anything of this nature about tuppy and angelum tuppy when not make a ass of himself be a soundish sort of egg so be angelum a soundish sort of egg and as far as be in love be concern it have always seem to I that you would not have be far out in describe they as two heart that beat as one true they have have they little tiff notably on the occasion when tuppy -- with what he say be fearless honesty and i consider thorough goofiness -- have tell angelum that she new hat make she look like a pekinese but in every romance you have to budget for the occasional dust-up and after that incident i have suppose that he have learn he lesson and that from then on life would be one grand sweet song and now this wholly unforeseen sever of diplomatic relation have pop up through a trap i give the thing the cream of the wooster brain all the way down but it continue to beat I what could have cause the outbreak of hostility and i bunged my foot sedulously on the accelerator in order to get to aunt dahlia with the greatest possible speed and learn the inside history straight from the horse 's mouth and what with all six cylinder hit nicely i make good time and find myself closet with the relative shortly before the hour of the evening cocktail she seem glad to see I in fact she actually say she be glad to see I -- a statement no other aunt on the list would have commit herself to the customary reaction of these near and dear one to the spectacle of bertram arrive for a visit be a sort of sick horror decent of you to rally round bertie she say my place be by you side aunt dahlia i respond i could see at a g that the unfortunate affair have get in amongst she in no uncertain manner she usually cheerful map be clouded and the genial smile conspic by its a i press she hand sympathetically to indicate that my heart bleed for she bad show this my dear old flesh and blood i say i be afraid you have be have a sticky time you must be worry she snort emotionally she look like a aunt who have just bite into a bad oyster worry be right i have not have a peaceful moment since i get back from canne ever since i put my foot across this blast threshold say aunt dahlia return for the nonce to the hearty _ argot _ of the hunting field everything 's be at six and seven first there be that mix-up about the prize-giving she pause at this point and give I a look i have be mean to speak freely to you about you behavior in that matter bertie she say i have some good thing all store up but as you have rally round like this i suppose i shall have to let you off and anyway it be probably all for the best that you evade you obligation in that sickeningly craven way i have a idea that this spink-bottle of yours be go to be good if only he can keep off newt have he be talk about newt he have fix I with a glittering eye like the ancient mariner but if that be the worst i have to bear i would not mind what i be worry about be what tom say when he start talk uncle tom i wish there be something else you could call he except ` uncle tom ' say aunt dahlia a little testily every time you do it i expect to see he turn black and start play the banjo yes uncle tom if you must have it i shall have to tell he soon about lose all that money at baccarat and when i do he will go up like a rocket still no doubt time the great healer -- time the great healer be blow i have get to get a cheque for five hundred pound out of he for _ milady 's boudoir _ by August the third at the latest i be concerned apart from a nephew 's natural interest in a aunt 's refined weekly paper i have always have a soft spot in my heart for _ milady 's boudoir _ ever since i contribute that article to it on what the well-dressed man be wear sentimental possibly but we old journalist do have these feeling be the _ boudoir _ on the rock it will be if tom do not cough up it need help till it have turn the corner but be not it turn the corner two year ago it be and it be still at it till you have run a weekly paper for woman you do not know what corner be and you think the chance of get into uncle -- into my uncle by marriage 's rib be slight i 'll tell you bertie up till now when these subsidy be require i have always be able to come to tom in the gay confident spirit of a only child touch a indulgent father for chocolate cream but he be just have a demand from the income-tax people for a additional fifty-eight pound one and threepence and all he be be talk about since i get back have be ruin and the sinister trend of socialistic legislation and what will become of we all i could readily believe it this tom have a peculiarity i have notice in other very oofy man nick he for the paltriest sum and he let out a squawk you can hear at land 's end he have the stuff in gob but he hate give up if it be not for anatole 's cooking i doubt if he would bother to carry on thank god for anatole i say i bow my head reverently good old anatole i say aman say aunt dahlia then the look of holy ecstasy which be always the result of let the mind dwell however briefly on anatole 's cooking die out of she face but do not let I wander from the subject she resume i be tell you of the way hell 's foundation have be quiver since i get home first the prize-giving then tom and now on top of everything else this infernal quarrel between angelum and young glossop i nod gravely i be frightfully sorry to hear of that terrible shock what be the row about shark eh shark or rather one individual shark the brute that go for the poor child when she be aquaplan at canne you remember angelum 's shark certainly i remembered angelum 's shark a man of sensibility do not forget about a cousin nearly be chew by monster of the deep the episode be still green in my memory in a nutshell what have occur be this : you know how you aquaplane a motor-boat nip on ahead trail a rope you stand on a board hold the rope and the boat tow you along and every now and then you lose you grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to you board again a silly process it have always seem to I though many find it divert well on the occasion refer to angelum have just regain she board after take a toss when a great beastly shark come along and cannon into it fling she into the salty once more it take she quite a bit of time to get on again and make the motor-boat chap realize what be up and haul she to safety and during that interval you can readily picture she embarrassment accord to angela the finny denizen keep snap at she ankle virtually without cessation so that by the time help arrive she be feel more like a salted almond at a public dinner than anything human very shake the poor child have be i recall and have talk of nothing else for week i remember the whole incident vividly i say but how do that start the trouble she be tell he the story last night well she eye shine and she little hand clasp in girlish excitement no doubt and instead of give she the understanding and sympathy to which she be entitle what do you think this blast glossop do he sit listen like a lump of dough as if she have be talk about the weather and when she have finish he take he cigarette holder out of he mouth and say ' i expect it be only a float log ' he do not he do and when angelum describe how the thing have jump and snap at she he take he cigarette holder out of he mouth again and say ` ah probably a flatfish quite harmless no doubt it be just try to play ' well i mean what would you have do if you have be angela she have pride sensibility all the natural feeling of a good woman she tell he he be a ass and a fool and a idiot and do not know what he be talk about i must say i see the girl 's viewpoint it be only about once in a lifetime that anything sensational ever happen to one and when it do you do not want people take all the color out of it i remember at school have to read that stuff where that chap othello tell the girl what a hell of a time he have be have among the cannibal and what not well imagine he feeling if after he have describe some particularly sticky passage with a cannibal chief and be wait for the awestruck oh-h not really she have say that the whole thing have no doubt be greatly exaggerate and that the man have probably really be a prominent local vegetarian yes i see angelum 's point of view but do not tell I that when he see how shirty she be about it the chump do not back down he do not he argue and one thing lead to another until by easy stage they have arrive at the point where she be say that she do not know if he be aware of it but if he do not knock off starchy food and do exercise every morning he would be get as fat as a pig and he be talk about this modern habit of girl put make-up on they face of which he have always disapprove this continue for a while and then there be a loud pop and the air be full of mangled fragment of they engagement i be distract about it thank goodness you have come bertie nothing could have keep I away i reply touch i feel you need I yes quite or rather she say not you of course but jeeve the minute all this happen i thought of he the situation obviously cry out for jeeve if ever in the whole history of human affair there be a moment when that lofty brain be require about the home this be it i think if i have be stand up i would have stagger in fact i be pretty sure i would but it be not so dash easy to stagger when you be sit in a arm-chair only my face therefore show how deeply i have be sting by these word until she speak they i have be all sweetness and light -- the sympathetic nephew prepare to strain every nerve to do he bit i now freeze and the face become hard and set jeeve i say between clenched tooth oom beroofen say aunt dahlia i see that she have get the wrong angle i be not sneeze i be say ` jeeve ' and well you may what a man i be go to put the whole thing up to he there be nobody like jeeve my frigidity become more marked i venture to take issue with you aunt dahlia you take what issue you do do you i emphatically do jeeve be hopeless what quite hopeless he have lose he grip completely only a couple of day ago i be compel to take he off a case because he handling of it be so footling and anyway i resent this assumption if assumption be the word i want that jeeve be the only fellow with brain i object to the way everybody put thing up to he without consult I and let I have a stab at they first she seem about to speak but i check she with a gesture it be true that in the past i have sometimes see fit to seek jeeve 's advice it be possible that in the future i may seek it again but i claim the right to have a pop at these problem as they arise in person without have everybody behave as if jeeve be the only onion in the hash i sometimes feel that jeeve though admittedly not unsuccessful in the past have be lucky rather than gifted have you and jeeve have a row nothing of the kind you seem to have it in for he not at all and yet i must admit that there be a modicum of truth in what she say i have be feel pretty austere about the man all day and i 'll tell you why you remember that he catch that 1245 train with the luggage while i remain on in order to keep a luncheon engagement well just before i start out to the tryst i be potter about the flat and suddenly -- i do not know what put the suspicion into my head possibly the fellow 's manner have be furtive -- something seem to whisper to I to go and have a look in the wardrobe and it be as i have suspect there be the mess-jacket still on its hanger the hound have not pack it well as anybody at the drone will tell you bertram wooster be a pretty hard chap to outgeneral i shove the thing in a brown-paper parcel and put it in the back of the car and it be on a chair in the hall now but that do not alter the fact that jeeve have attempt to do the dirty on I and i suppose a certain what-d'you-call-it have creep into my manner during the above remark there have be no breach i say you might describe it as a pass coolness but no more we do not happen to see eye to eye with regard to my white mess-jacket with the brass button and i be compel to assert my personality but -- well it do not matter anyway the thing that matter be that you be talk piffle you poor fish jeeve lose he grip absurd why i see he for a moment when he arrive and he eye be absolutely glitter with intelligence i say to myself ` trust jeeve ' and i intend to you would be far better advise to let I see what i can accomplish aunt dahlia for heaven 's sake do not you start but in you 'll only make matter worse on the contrary it may interest you to know that while drive here i concentrate deeply on this trouble of angelum 's and be successful in formulate a plan base on the psychology of the individual which i be propose to put into effect at a early moment oh my god my knowledge of human nature tell I it will work bertie say aunt dahlia and she manner strike I as febrile lay off lay off for pity 's sake lay off i know these plan of yours i suppose you want to shove angelum into the lake and push young glossop in after she to save she life or something like that nothing of the kind it be the sort of thing you would do my scheme be far more subtle let I outline it for you no thanks i say to myself -- but not to I do listen for a second i will not right ho then i be dumb and have be from a child i perceive that little good could result from continue the discussion i wave a hand and shrug a shoulder very well aunt dahlia i say with dignity if you do not want to be in on the ground floor that be you affair but you be miss a intellectual treat and anyway no matter how much you may behave like the deaf adder of scripture which as you be doubtless aware the more one pipe the less it dance or word to that effect i shall carry on as plan i be extremely fond of angelum and i shall spare no effort to bring the sunshine back into she heart bertie you abysmal chump i appeal to you once more will you please lay off you 'll only make thing ten time as bad as they be already i remember reading in one of those historical novel once about a chap -- a buck he would have be no doubt or a macaroni or some such bird as that -- who when people say the wrong thing merely laugh down from lazy eyelid and flick a speck of dust from the irreproachable mechlin lace at he wrist this be practically what i do now at least i straighten my tie and smile one of those inscrutable smile of mine i then withdraw and go out for a saunter in the garden and the first chap i run into be young tuppy he brow be furrow and he be moodily bung stone at a flowerpot -8 - i think i have tell you before about young tuppy glossop he be the fellow if you remember who callously ignore the fact that we have be friend since boyhood bet I one night at the drone that i could swing myself across the swimming bath by the ring -- a childish feat for one of my lissomeness -- and then have see I well on the way loop back the last ring thus render it necessary for I to drop into the deep end in formal evening costume to say that i have not resent this foul deed which seem to I deserving of the title of the crime of the century would be palter with the truth i have resent it profoundly chafe not a little at the time and continue to chafe for some week but you know how it be with these thing the wound heal the agony abate i be not say mind you that have the opportunity present itself of drop a wet sponge on tuppy from some high spot or of put a eel in he bed or find some other form of self-expression of a like nature i would not have embrace it eagerly but that let I out i mean to say grievously injure though i have be it give I no pleasure to feel that the fellow 's bally life be be ruin by the loss of a girl whom despite all that have pass i be convince he still love like the dickens on the contrary i be heart and soul in favor of healing the breach and render everything hotsy-totsy once more between these two young sundered blighter you will have glean that from my remark to aunt dahlia and if you have be present at this moment and have see the kindly commiserate look i give tuppy you would have glean it still more it be one of those search melting look and be accompany by the hearty clasp of the right hand and the gentle lay of the leave on the collar-bone well tuppy old man i say how be you old man my commiseration deepen as i speak the word for there have be no lighting up of the eye no answering pressure of the palm no sign whatever in short of any disposition on he part to do spring dance at the sight of a old friend the man seem sandbagged melancholy as i remember jeeve say once about pongo twistleton when he be try to knock off smoking have mark he for she own not that i be surprise of course in the circ no doubt a certain moodiness be only natural i release the hand cease to knead the shoulder and produce the old case offer he a cigarette he take it dully be you here bertie he ask yes i be here just pass through or come to stay i think for a moment i might have tell he that i have arrive at brinkley court with the express intention of bring angelum and himself together once more of knit up the sever thread and so on and so forth and for perhaps half the time require for the lighting of a gasper i have almost decide to do so then i reflect better on the whole perhaps not to broadcast the fact that i propose to take he and angelum and play on they as on a couple of stringed instrument might have be injudicious chap do not always like be play on as on a stringed instrument it all depend i say i may remain i may push on my plan be uncertain he nod listlessly rather in the manner of a man who do not give a damn what i do and stand gaze out over the sunlit garden in build and appearance tuppy somewhat resemble a bulldog and he aspect now be that of one of these fine animal who have just be refuse a slice of cake it be not difficult for a man of my discernment to read what be in he mind and it occasion I no surprise therefore when he next word have to do with the subject marked with a cross on the agenda paper you have hear of this business of mine i suppose I and angelum i have indeed tuppy old man we have bust up i know some little friction i gather _ in re _ angelum 's shark yes i say it must have be a flatfish so my informant tell I who do you hear it from aunt dahlia i suppose she curse I properly oh no beyond refer to you in one passage as ` this blast glossop ' she be i think singularly temperate in she language for a woman who at one time hunt regularly with the quorn all the same i could see if you do not mind I say so old man that she feel you might have behave with a little more tact tact and i must admit i rather agree with she be it nice tuppy be it quite kind to take the bloom off angelum 's shark like that you must remember that angelum 's shark be very dear to she could you not see what a sock on the jaw it would be for the poor child to hear it describe by the man to whom she have give she heart as a flatfish i see that he be struggle with some powerful emotion and what about my side of the thing he demand in a voice choke with feel you side you do not suppose say tuppy with rise vehemence that i would have expose this dash synthetic shark for the flatfish it undoubtedly be if there have not be cause that lead up to it what induce I to speak as i do be the fact that angelum the little squirt have just be most offensive and i seize the opportunity to get a bit of my own back offensive exceedingly offensive purely on the strength of my have let fall some casual remark -- simply by way of say something and keep the conversation go -- to the effect that i wonder what anatole be go to give we for dinner she say that i be too material and ought not always to be think of food material my elbow as a matter of fact i be particularly spiritual quite i do not see any harm in wonder what anatole be go to give we for dinner do you of course not a mere ordinary tribute of respect to a great artist exactly all the same -- well i be only go to say that it seem a pity that the frail craft of love should come a stinker like this when a few manly word of contrition -- he stare at I you be not suggest that i should climb down it would be the fine big thing old egg i would not dream of climb down but tuppy -- no i would not do it but you love she do not you this touch the spot he quiver noticeably and he mouth twist quite the tortured soul i be not say i do not love the little blighter he say obviously move i love she passionately but that do not alter the fact that i consider that what she need most in this world be a swift kick in the pants a wooster could scarcely pass this tuppy old man it be no good say ` tuppy old man ' well i do say ` tuppy old man ' you tone shock I one raise the eyebrow where be the fine old chivalrous spirit of the glossop that be all right about the fine old chivalrous spirit of the glossop where be the sweet gentle womanly spirit of the angela tell a fellow he be get a double chin do she do that she do oh well girl will be girl forget it tuppy go to she and make it up he shake he head no it be too late remark have be pass about my tummy which it be impossible to overlook but tummy -- tuppy i mean -- be fair you once tell she she new hat make she look like a pekinese it do make she look like a pekinese that be not vulgar abuse it be sound constructive criticism with no motive behind it but the kindly desire to keep she from make a exhibition of herself in public wantonly to accuse a man of puff when he go up a flight of stair be something very different i begin to see that the situation would require all my address and ingenuity if the wedding bell be ever to ring out in the little church of market snodsbury bertram have plainly get to put in some shrewdish work i have gather during my conversation with aunt dahlia that there have be a certain amount of frank speech between the two contracting party but i have not realize till now that matter have go so far the pathos of the thing give I the pip tuppy have admit in so many word that love still animated the glossop bosom and i be convince that even after all that occur angelum have not cease to love he at the moment no doubt she might be wish that she could hit he with a bottle but deep down in she i be prepare to bet that there still linger all the old affection and tenderness only injured pride be keep these two apart and i feel that if tuppy would make the first move all would be well i have another whack at it she be broken-hearted about this rift tuppy how do you know have you see she no but i 'll bet she be she do not look it wear the mask no doubt jeeve do that when i assert my authority she wrinkle she nose at I as if i be a drain that have get out of order merely the mask i feel convinced she love you still and that a kindly word from you be all that be require i could see that this have move he he plainly waver he do a sort of twiddly on the turf with he foot and when he speak one spot the tremolo in the voice : you really think that absolutely h be if you be to go to she -- he shake he head i can not do that it would be fatal bing instantly would go my prestige i know girl grovel and the best of they get uppish he muse the only way to work the thing would be by tip she off in some indirect way that i be prepare to open negotiation should i sigh a bit when we meet do you think she would think you be puff that be true i light another cigarette and give my mind to the matter and first crack out of the box as be so often the way with the wooster i get a idea i remember the counsel i have give gussie in the matter of the sausage and ham i have get it tuppy there be one infallible method of indicate to a girl that you love she and it work just as well when you have have a row and want to make it up do not eat any dinner tonight you can see how impressive that would be she know how devoted you be to food he start violently i be not devote to food no no i be not devote to food at all quite all i mean -- this rot about I be devote to food say tuppy warmly have get to stop i be young and healthy and have a good appetite but that be not the same as be devote to food i admire anatole as a master of he craft and be always willing to consider anything he may put before I but when you say i be devote to food -- quite quite all i mean be that if she see you push away you dinner untasted she will realize that you heart be ache and will probably be the first to suggest blow the all clear tuppy be frown thoughtfully push my dinner away eh yes push away a dinner cook by anatole yes push it away untasted yes let we get this straight tonight at dinner when the butler offer I a _ ris de veau à la financiere _ or whatever it may be hot from anatole 's hand you wish I to push it away untasted yes he chew he lip one could sense the struggle go on within and then suddenly a sort of glow come into he face the old martyr probably use to look like that all right you 'll do it i will fine of course it will be agony i point out the silver line only for the moment you could slip down tonight after everyone be in bed and raid the larder he brighten that be right i could could not i i expect there would be something cold there there be something cold there say tuppy with grow cheerfulness a steak-and-kidney pie we have it for lunch today one of anatole 's ripest the thing i admire about that man say tuppy reverently the thing that i admire so enormously about anatole be that though a frenchman he do not like so many of these _ chef _ confine himself exclusively to french dish but be always willing and ready to weigh in with some good old simple english fare such as this steak-and-kidney pie to which i have allude a masterly pie bertie and it be not more than half finish it will do I nicely and at dinner you will push as arrange absolutely as arrange fine it be a excellent idea one of jeeve 's best you can tell he from I when you see he that i be much oblige the cigarette fall from my finger it be as though somebody have slap bertram wooster across the face with a wet dish-rag you be not suggest that you think this scheme i have be sketch out be jeeve 's of course it be it be no good try to kid I bertie you would not have think of a wheeze like that in a million year there be a pause i draw myself up to my full height then see that he be not look at I lower myself again come glossop i say coldly we have better be go it be time we be dress for dinner -9 - tuppy 's fatheaded word be still rankle in my bosom as i go up to my room they continue rankle as i shed the form-fitting and have not cease to rankle when clothe in the old dressing-gown i make my way along the corridor to the _ salle de bain _ it be not too much to say that i be pique to the tonsil i mean to say one do not court praise the adulation of the multitude mean very little to one but all the same when one have take the trouble to whack out a highly juicy scheme to benefit a in-the-soup friend in he hour of travail it be pretty foul to find he give the credit to one 's personal attendant particularly if that personal attendant be a man who go about the place not pack mess-jacket but after i have be splash about in the porcelain for a bit composure begin to return i have always find that in moment of heart-bowed-downness there be nothing that calm the bruised spirit like a good go at the soap and water i do not say i actually sing in the tub but there be time when it be a mere spin of the coin whether i would do so or not the spiritual anguish induce by that tactless speech have become noticeably lessen the discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish presumably the property of some former juvenile visitor contribute not a little to this new and happier frame of mind what with one thing and another i have not play with toy duck in my bath for year and i find the novel experience most invigorating for the benefit of those interested i may mention that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then let it go it shoot out of the water in a manner calculate to divert the most careworn ten minute of this and i be enable to return to the bedchamber much more the old merry bertram jeeve be there lay out the dinner disguise he greet the young master with he customary suavity good evening sir i respond in the same affable key good evening jeeve i trust you have a pleasant drive sir very pleasant thank you jeeve hand I a sock or two will you he do so and i commence to don well jeeve i say reach for the underlinen here we be again at brinkley court in the county of worcestershire yes sir a nice mess thing seem to have go and get themselves into in this rustic joint yes sir the rift between tuppy glossop and my cousin angelum would appear to be serious yes sir opinion in the servant ' hall be incline to take a grave view of the situation and the thought that spring to you mind no doubt be that i shall have my work cut out to fix thing up yes sir you be wrong jeeve i have the thing well in hand you surprise I sir i think i should yes jeeve i pondered on the matter most of the way down here and with the happiest result i have just be in conference with mr glossop and everything be tape out indeed sir might i inquire -- you know my method jeeve apply they have you i ask slip into the shirt and start to adjust the cravat be gnawing on the thing at all oh yes sir i have always be much attach to miss angelum and i feel that it would afford I great pleasure be i to be able to be of service to she a laudable sentiment but i suppose you draw blank no sir i be reward with a idea what be it it occur to I that a reconciliation might be effect between mr glossop and miss angelum by appeal to that instinct which prompt gentleman in time of peril to hasten to the rescue of -- i have to let go of the cravat in order to raise a hand i be shock do not tell I you be contemplate descend to that old he-saved-her-from-drowning gag i be surprised jeeve surprised and pained when i be discuss the matter with aunt dahlia on my arrival she say in a sniffy sort of way that she suppose i be go to shove my cousin angelum into the lake and push tuppy in to haul she out and i let she see pretty clearly that i consider the suggestion a insult to my intelligence and now if you word have the meaning i read into they you be moot precisely the same drivelling scheme really jeeve no sir not that but the thought do cross my mind as i walk in the grounds and pass the building where the fire-bell hang that a sudden alarm of fire in the night might result in mr glossop endeavor to assist miss angelum to safety i shiver rotten jeeve well sir -- no good not a bit like it i fancy sir -- no jeeve no more enough have be say let we drop the subj i finish tie the tie in silence my emotion be too deep for speech i know of course that this man have for the time be lose he grip but i have never suspect that he have go absolutely to piece like this remember some of the swift one he have pull in the past i shrink with horror from the spectacle of he present ineptitude or be it ineptness i mean this frightful disposition of he to stick straw in he hair and talk like a perfect ass it be the old old story i suppose a man 's brain whizz along for year exceed the speed limit and something suddenly go wrong with the steering-gear and it skid and come a smeller in the ditch a bit elaborate i say try to put the thing in as kindly a light as possible you old fail you can see that it be a bit elaborate possibly the plan i suggest might be consider open to that criticism sir but _ faute de mieux _ -- i do not get you jeeve a french expression sir signify ` for want of anything better ' a moment before i have be feel for this wreck of a once fine thinker nothing but a gentle pity these word jar the wooster pride induce asperity i understand perfectly well what _ faute de mieux _ mean jeeve i do not recently spend two month among we gallic neighbor for nothing besides i remember that one from school what cause my bewilderment be that you should be employ the expression well know that there be no bally _ faute de mieux _ about it at all where do you get that _ faute-de-mieux _ stuff do not i tell you i have everything tape out yes sir but -- what do you mean -- but well sir -- push on jeeve i be ready even anxious to hear you view well sir if i may take the liberty of remind you of it you plan in the past have not always be uniformly successful there be a silence -- rather a throb one -- during which i put on my waistcoat in a marked manner not till i have get the buckle at the back satisfactorily adjust do i speak it be true jeeve i say formally that once or twice in the past i may have miss the bus this however i attribute purely to bad luck indeed sir on the present occasion i shall not fail and i 'll tell you why i shall not fail because my scheme be root in human nature indeed sir it be simple not elaborate and furthermore base on the psychology of the individual indeed sir jeeve i say do not keep say ` indeed sir ' no doubt nothing be further from you mind than to convey such a suggestion but you have a way of stress the ` in ' and then come down with a thud on the ` deed ' which make it virtually tantamount to ` oh yeah ' correct this jeeve very good sir i tell you i have everything nicely line up would you care to hear what step i have take very much sir then listen tonight at dinner i have recommend tuppy to lay off the food sir tut jeeve surely you can follow the idea even though it be one that would never have occur to yourself have you forget that telegram i send to gussie fink-nottle steer he away from the sausage and ham this be the same thing push the food away untasted be a universally recognize sign of love it can not fail to bring home the gravy you must see that well sir -- i frowned i do not want to seem always to be criticize you method of voice production jeeve i say but i must inform you that that ` well sir ' of yours be in many respects fully as unpleasant as you ` indeed sir ' like the latter it seem to be tinge with a definite scepticism it suggest a lack of faith in my vision the impression i retain after hear you shoot it at I a couple of time be that you consider I to be talk through the back of my neck and that only a feudal sense of what be fitting restrain you from substitute for it the word ` say you ' oh no sir well that be what it sound like why do not you think this scheme will work i fear miss angelum will merely attribute mr glossop 's abstinence to indigestion sir i have not think of that and i must confess it shake I for a moment then i recover myself i see what be at the bottom of all this mortified by the consciousness of he own ineptness -- or ineptitude -- the fellow be simply try to hamper and obstruct i decide to knock the stuff out of he without further preamble oh i say you do do you well be that as it may it do not alter the fact that you have put out the wrong coat be so good jeeve i say indicate with a gesture the gent 's ordinary dinner jacket or _ smoking _ as we call it on the côte d'azur which be suspend from the hanger on the knob of the wardrobe as to shove that bally black thing in the cupboard and bring out my white mess-jacket with the brass button he look at I in a meaning manner and when i say a meaning manner i mean there be a respectful but at the same time uppish glint in he eye and a sort of muscular spasm flicker across he face which be not quite a quiet smile and yet be not quite not a quiet smile also the soft cough i regret to say sir that i inadvertently omit to pack the garment to which you refer the vision of that parcel in the hall seem to rise before my eye and i exchange a merry wink with it i may even have hum a bar or two i be not quite sure i know you do jeeve i say laugh down from lazy eyelid and nick a speck of dust from the irreproachable mechlin lace at my wrist but i do not you will find it on a chair in the hall in a brown-paper parcel the information that he low maneuver have be render null and void and that the thing be on the strength after all must have be the nastiest of jar but there be no play of expression on he finely chisel to indicate it there very seldom be on jeeve 's f-c in moment of discomfort as i have tell tuppy he wear a mask preserve throughout the quiet stolidity of a stuff moose you might just slide down and fetch it will you very good sir right ho jeeve and presently i be saunter towards the drawing-room with I good old j nestle snugly abaft the shoulder blade and dahlia be in the drawing-room she glance up at my entrance hullo eyesore she say what do you think you be make up as i do not get the purport the jacket you mean i query groping i do you look like one of the chorus of male guest at abernethy tower in act 2 of a tour musical comedy you do not admire this jacket i do not you do at canne well this be not canne but dash it -- oh never mind let it go if you want to give my butler a laugh what do it matter what do anything matter now there be a death-where-is-thy-sting-fullness about she manner which i find distasteful it be not often that i score off jeeve in the devastating fashion just describe and when i do i like to see happy smile face about I tail up aunt dahlia i urge buoyantly tail up be dash be she sombre response i have just be talk to tom tell he no listen to he i have not have the nerve to tell he yet be he still upset about that income-tax money upset be right he say that civilisation be in the melting-pot and that all think man can read the write on the wall what wall old testament ass belshazzar 's feast oh that yes i have often wonder how that gag be work with mirror i expect i wish i could use mirror to break it to tom about this baccarat business i have a word of comfort to offer here i have be turn the thing over in my mind since we last meeting and i think i see where she have get twist where she make she error it seem to I be in feeling she have get to tell uncle tom to my way of think the matter be one on which it would be better to continue to exercise a quiet reserve i do not see why you need mention that you lose that money at baccarat what do you suggest then let _ milady 's boudoir _ join civilisation in the melting-pot because that be what it will infallibly do unless i get a cheque by next week the printer have be show a nasty spirit for month you do not follow listen it be a understood thing i take it that uncle tom foot the _ boudoir _ bill if the bally sheet have be turn the corner for two year he must have get use to fork out by this time well simply ask he for the money to pay the printer i do just before i go to canne would not he give it to you certainly he give it to I he brass up like a officer and a gentleman that be the money i lose at baccarat oh i do not know that there be not much you do know a nephew 's love make I overlook the slur tut i say what do you say i say ` tut ' say it once again and i 'll biff you where you stand i have enough to endure without be tut at quite any tutting that be require i 'll attend to myself and the same apply to click the tongue if you be think of do that far from it good i stand awhile in thought i be concern to the core my heart if you remember have already bleed once for aunt dahlia this evening it now bleed again i know how deeply attach she be to this paper of hers see it go down the drain would be for she like watch a loved child sink for the third time in some pond or mere and there be no question that unless carefully prepare for the touch uncle tom would see a hundred _ milady 's boudoir _ go phut rather than take the rap then i see how the thing could be handle this aunt i perceive must fall into line with my other client tuppy glossop be knock off dinner to melt angelum gussie fink-nottle be knock off dinner to impress the bassett aunt dahlia must knock off dinner to soften uncle tom for the beauty of this scheme of mine be that there be no limit to the number of entrant come one come all the more the merrier and satisfaction guarantee in every case i have get it i say there be only one course to pursue eat less meat she look at I in a plead sort of way i would not swear that she eye be wet with unshed tear but i rather think they be certainly she clasp she hand in piteous appeal must you drivel bertie will not you stop it just this once just for tonight to please aunt dahlia i be not drivel i dare say that to a man of you high standard it do not come under the head of drivel but -- i see what have happen i have not make myself quite clear it be all right i say have no misgiving this be the real tabasco when i say ` eat less meat ' what i mean be that you must refuse you oats at dinner tonight just sit there look blister and wave away each course as it come with a weary gesture of resignation you see what will happen uncle tom will notice you loss of appetite and i be prepare to bet that at the conclusion of the meal he will come to you and say ` dahlia darling ' -- i take it he call you ` dahlia ' -- ` dahlia darling ' he will say ' i notice at dinner tonight that you be a bit off you feed be anything the matter dahlia darling ' ` why yes tom darling ' you will reply ` it be kind of you to ask darling the fact be darling i be terribly worry ' ` my darling ' he will say -- aunt dahlia interrupt at this point to observe that these traverse seem to be a pretty soppy couple of blighter to judge by they dialogue she also wish to know when i be go to get to the point i give she a look ` my darling ' he will say tenderly ` be there anything i can do ' to which you reply will be that there jolly well be -- viz reach for he cheque-book and start write i be watch she closely as i speak and be please to note respect suddenly dawn in she eye but bertie this be positively bright i tell you jeeve be not the only fellow with brain i believe it would work it be bind to work i have recommend it to tuppy young glossop in order to soften angelum splendid and to gussie fink-nottle who want to make a hit with the bassett well well well what a busy little brain it be always work aunt dahlia always work you be not the chump i take you for bertie when do you ever take I for a chump oh some time last summer i forget what give I the idea yes bertie this scheme be bright i suppose as a matter of fact jeeve suggest it jeeve do not suggest it i resent these implication jeeve have nothing to do with it whatsoever well all right no need to get excite about it yes i think it will work tom 's devoted to I who would not be i 'll do it and then the rest of the party trickle in and we toddle down to dinner condition be as they be at brinkley court -- i mean to say the place be load down above the plimsoll mark with ache heart and stand room only as regard tortured soul -- i have not expect the evening meal to be particularly effervescent nor be it silent sombre the whole thing more than a bit like christmas dinner on devil 's island i be glad when it be over what with have on top of she other trouble to rein herself back from the trough aunt dahlia be a total loss as far as anything in the shape of brilliant badinage be concern the fact that he be fifty quid in the red and expect civilisation to take a toss at any moment have cause uncle tom who always look a bit like a pterodactyl with a secret sorrow to take on a deeper melancholy the bassett be a silent bread crumbler angelum might have be hew from the living rock tuppy have the air of a condemn murderer refuse to make the usual hearty breakfast before tooling off to the execution shed and as for gussie fink-nottle many a experienced undertaker would have be deceive by he appearance and start embalm he on sight this be the first glimpse i have have of gussie since we part at my flat and i must say he demeanor disappoint I i have be expect something a great deal more sparkling at my flat on the occasion allude to he have if you recall practically give I a sign guarantee that all he need to touch he off be a rural setting yet in this aspect now i could detect no indication whatsoever that he be about to round into mid-season form he still look like a cat in a adage and it do not take I long to realize that my very first act on escape from this morgue must be to draw he aside and give he a pep talk if ever a chap want the clarion note it look as if it be this fink-nottle in the general exodus of mourner however i lose sight of he and owe to the fact that aunt dahlia rope I in for a game of backgammon it be not immediately that i be able to institute a search but after we have be play for a while the butler come in and ask she if she would speak to anatole so i manage to get away and some ten minute later have fail to find scent in the house i start to throw out the drag-net through the grounds and flush he in the rose garden he be smell a rose at the moment in a limp sort of way but remove the beak as i approach well gussie i say i have beam genially upon he as i speak such be my customary policy on meet a old pal but instead of beam back genially he give I a most unpleasant look he attitude perplex I it be as if he be not glad to see bertram for a moment he stand let this unpleasant look play upon I as it be and then he speak you and you ` well gussie ' he say this between clenched tooth always a unmatey thing to do and i find myself more fogged than ever how do you mean -- I and my ` well gussie ' i like you nerve come bound about the place say ` well gussie ' that be about all the ` well gussie ' i shall require from you wooster and it be no good look like that you know what i mean that damned prize-giving it be a dastardly act to crawl out as you do and shove it off on to I i will not mince my word it be the act of a hound and a stinker now though as i have show i have devote most of the time on the journey down to meditate upon the case of angelum and tuppy i have not neglect to give a thought or two to what i be go to say when i encounter gussie i have foresee that there might be some little temporary unpleasantness when we meet and when a difficult interview be in the offing bertram wooster like to have he story ready so now i be able to reply with a manly disarm frankness the sudden introduction of the topic have give I a bit of a jolt it be true for in the stress of recent happening i have rather let that prize-giving business slide to the back of my mind but i have speedily recover and as i say be able to reply with a manly df but my dear chap i say i take it for grant that you would understand that that be all part of my scheme he say something about my scheme which i do not catch absolutely ` crawl out ' be entirely the wrong way to put it you do not suppose i do not want to distribute those prize do you leave to myself there be nothing i would find a greater treat but i see that the square generous thing to do be to step aside and let you take it on so i do so i feel that you need be greater than mine you do not mean to say you be not look forward to it he utter a coarse expression which i would not have think he would have know it just show that you can bury yourself in the country and still somehow acquire a vocabulary no doubt one pick up thing from the neighbor -- the vicar the local doctor the man who bring the milk and so on but dash it i say can not you see what this be go to do for you it will send you stock up with a jump there you will be up on that platform a romantic impressive figure the star of the whole proceedings the what-d'you-call-it of all eye madeline bassett will be all over you she will see you in a totally new light she will will she certainly she will augustus fink-nottle the newt ' friend she know she be acquaint with augustus fink-nottle the dog ' chiropodist but augustus fink-nottle the orator -- that 'll knock she sideways or i know nothing of the female heart girl go potty over a public man if ever anyone do anyone else a kindness it be i when i give this extraordinary attractive assignment to you he seem impress by my eloquence could not have help himself of course the fire fade from behind he horn-rimmed spectacles and in its place appear the old fish-like goggle ` mye he say meditatively have you ever make a speech bertie dozen of time it be pie nothing to it why i once address a girl ' school you be not nervous not a bit how do you go they hang on my lip i hold they in the hollow of my hand they do not throw egg or anything not a thing he expel a deep breath and for a space stand stare in silence at a pass slug well he say at length it may be all right possibly i be let the thing prey on my mind too much i may be wrong in suppose it the fate that be worse than death but i 'll tell you this much : the prospect of that prize-giving on the thirty-first of this month have be turn my existence into a nightmare i have not be able to sleep or think or eat by the way that remind I you never explain that cipher telegram about the sausage and ham it be not a cipher telegram i want you to go light on the food so that she would realize you be in love he laugh hollowly i see well i have be do that all right yes i be notice at dinner splendid i do not see what be splendid about it it be not go to get I anywhere i shall never be able to ask she to marry I i could not find nerve to do that if i live on wafer biscuit for the rest of my life but dash it gussie in these romantic surroundings i should have think the whisper tree alone -- i do not care what you would have think i can not do it oh come i can not she seem so aloof so remote she do not yes she do especially when you see she sideways have you see she sideways bertie that cold pure profile it just take all the heart out of one it do not i tell you it do i catch sight of it and the word freeze on my lip he speak with a sort of dull despair and so manifest be he lack of ginger and the spirit that win to success that for a instant i confess i feel a bit stymie it seem hopeless to go on try to steam up such a human jellyfish then i see the way with that extraordinary quickness of mine i realize exactly what must be do if this fink-nottle be to be enable to push he nose past the judge ' box she must be soften up i say be what soften up sweeten work on preliminary spadework must be put in here gussie be the procedure i propose to adopt : i shall now return to the house and lug this bassett out for a stroll i shall talk to she of heart that yearn intimate that there be one actually on the premise i shall pitch it strong spare no effort you meanwhile will lurk on the outskirts and in about a quarter of a hour you will come along and carry on from there by that time she emotion have be stir you ought to be able to do the rest on you head it will be like leap on to a move bus i remember when i be a kid at school have to learn a poem of sort about a fellow name pig-something -- a sculptor he would have be no doubt -- who make a statue of a girl and what should happen one morning but that the bally thing suddenly come to life a pretty nasty shock for the chap of course but the point i be work round to be that there be a couple of line that go if i remember correctly : _ she start she move she seem to feel the stir of life along she keel _ and what i be drive at be that you could not get a better description of what happen to gussie as i speak these heartening word he brow clear he eye brighten he lose that fishy look and he gaze at the slug which be still on the long long trail with something approach bonhomie a marked improvement i see what you mean you will sort of pave the way as it be that be right spadework it be a terrific idea bertie it will make all the difference quite but do not forget that after that it will be up to you you will have to haul up you slacks and give she the old oil or my effort will have be in vain something of he former gawd-help-us-ness seem to return to he he gasp a bit that be true what the dickens shall i say i restrain my impatience with a effort the man have be at school with I dash it there be hundred of thing you can say talk about the sunset the sunset certainly half the married man you meet begin by talk about the sunset but what can i say about the sunset well jeeve get off a good one the other day i meet he air the dog in the park one evening and he say ` now fade the glimmer landscape on the sight sir and all the air a solemn stillness hold ' you might use that what sort of landscape glimmer _ g _ for ` gastritis ' _ l _ for ` lizard ' -- oh glimmer yes that be not bad glimmer landscape solemn stillness yes i call that pretty good you could then say that you have often think that the star be god 's daisy chain but i have not i dare say not but she have hand she that one and i do not see how she can help feeling that you be a twin soul god 's daisy chain god 's daisy chain and then you go on about how twilight always make you sad i know you be go to say it do not but on this occasion it have jolly well get to why that be just what she will ask and you will then have get she going because you will reply that it be because yours be such a lonely life it would not be a bad idea to give she a brief description of a typical home evening at you lincolnshire residence show how you pace the meadow with a heavy tread i generally sit indoors and listen to the wireless no you do not you pace the meadow with a heavy tread wish that you have someone to love you and then you speak of the day when she come into you life like a fairy princess absolutely i say with approval i have not expect such a hot one from such a quarter like a fairy princess nice work gussie and then well after that it be easy you say you have something you want to say to she and then you snap into it i do not see how it can fail if i be you i should do it in this rise garden it be well establish that there be no sounder move than to steer the adore object into rise garden in the gloaming and you have better have a couple of quick one first quick one snifter drink do you mean but i do not drink what i have never touch a drop in my life this make I a bit dubious i must confess on these occasion it be generally concede that a moderate skinful be of the essence however if the fact be as he have state i suppose there be nothing to be do about it well you 'll have to make out as best you can on ginger pop i always drink orange juice orange juice then tell I gussie to settle a bet do you really like that muck very much then there be no more to be say now let 's just have a run through to see that you have get the lay-out straight start off with the glimmer landscape star god 's daisy chain twilight make you feel sad because mine lonely life describe life talk about the day i meet she add fairy-princess gag say there be something you want to say to she heave a couple of sigh grab she hand and give she the work right and confident that he have grasp the scenario and that everything might now be expect to proceed through the proper channel i pick up the foot and hasten back to the house it be not until i have reach the drawing-room and be enable to take a square look at the bassett that i find the debonair gaiety with which i have embark on this affair begin to wane a trifle behold she at close range like this i suddenly become cognisant of what i be in for the thought of stroll with this rummy specimen undeniably give I a most unpleasant sinking feeling i could not but remember how often when in she company at canne i have gaze dumbly at she wish that some kindly motorist in a racing car would ease the situation by come along and ram she amidship as i have already make abundantly clear this girl be not one of my most congenial buddy however a wooster 's word be he bond wooster may quail but they do not edge out only the keenest ear could have detect the tremor in the voice as i ask she if she would care to come out for half a hour lovely evening i say yes lovely be not it lovely remind I of canne how lovely the evening be there lovely i say lovely say the bassett lovely i agree that complete the weather and news bulletin for the french riviera another minute and we be out in the great open space she coo a bit about the scenery and self reply oh rather quite and wonder how best to approach the matter in hand -10 - how different it all would have be i could not but reflect if this girl have be the sort of girl one chirrup cheerily to over the telephone and take for spin in the old two-seater in that case i would simply have say listen and she would have say what and i would have say you know gussie fink-nottle and she would have say yes and i would have say he love you and she would have say either what that mutt well thank heaven for one good laugh today or else in more passionate vein hot dog tell I more i mean to say in either event the whole thing over and do with in under a minute but with the bassett something less snappy and a good deal more glutinous be obviously indicate what with all this daylight-saving stuff we have hit the great open space at a moment when twilight have not yet begin to cheese it in favor of the shades of night there be a fag-end of sunset still function star be begin to peep out bat be fool round the garden be full of the aroma of those niffy white flower which only start to put in they heavy work at the end of the day -- in short the glimmer landscape be fading on the sight and all the air hold a solemn stillness and it be plain that this be have the worst effect on she she eye be enlarged and she whole map a good deal too suggestive of the soul 's awaken for comfort she aspect be that of a girl who be expect something fairly fruity from bertram in these circ conversation inevitably flag a bit i be never at my best when the situation seem to call for a certain soupiness and i have hear other member of the drone say the same thing about themselves i remember pongo twistleton tell I that he be out in a gondola with a girl by moonlight once and the only time he speak be to tell she that old story about the chap who be so good at swim that they make he a traffic cop in venice fall rather flat he assure I and it be not much later when the girl say she think it be get a little chilly and how about push back to the hotel so now as i say the talk rather hang fire it have be all very well for I to promise gussie that i would cut loose to this girl about ache heart but you want a cue for that sort of thing and when toddle along we reach the edge of the lake and she finally speak conceive my chagrin when i discover that what she be talk about be star not a bit of good to I oh look she say she be a confirm oh-looker i have notice this at canne where she have draw my attention in this manner on various occasion to such diverse object as a french actress a provençal fill station the sunset over the estorel michael arlen a man selling color spectacles the deep velvet blue of the mediterranean and the late mayor of new york in a striped one-piece bathing suit oh look at that sweet little star up there all by itself i see the one she mean a little chap operating in a detach sort of way above a spinney yes i say i wonder if it feel lonely oh i should not think so a fairy must have be cry eh do not you remember ` every time a fairy shed a tear a wee bit star be bear in the milky way ' have you ever think that mr wooster i never have most improbable i consider and it do not seem to I to check up with she statement that the star be god 's daisy chain i mean you can not have it both way however i be in no mood to dissect and criticize i see that i have be wrong in suppose that the star be not germane to the issue quite a decent cue they have provide and i leap on it promptly : talking of shed tear -- but she be now on the subject of rabbit several of which be mess about in the park to we right oh look the little bunny talk of shed tear -- do not you love this time of the evening mr wooster when the sun have go to bed and all the bunny come out to have they little supper when i be a child i use to think that rabbit be gnome and that if i hold my breath and stay quite still i should see the fairy queen indicate with a reserved gesture that this be just the sort of loony thing i should have expect she to think as a child i return to the point talking of shed tear i say firmly it may interest you to know that there be a ache heart in brinkley court this hold she she cheese the rabbit theme she face which have be aglow with what i suppose be a pretty animation cloud she unshipp a sigh that sound like the wind go out of a rubber duck ah yes life be very sad be not it it be for some people this ache heart for instance those wistful eye of hers drench iris and they use to dance like elf of delight and all through a foolish misunderstanding about a shark what a tragedy misunderstanding be that pretty romance broken and over just because mr glossop would insist that it be a flatfish i see that she have get the wire cross i be not talk about angelum but she heart be ache i know it be ache but so be somebody else 's she look at I perplexed somebody else mr glossop 's you mean no i do not mrs traver 's the exquisite code of politeness of the wooster prevent I clipping she one on the ear-hole but i would have give a shilling to be able to do it there seem to I something deliberately fat-headed in the way she persist in miss the gist no not aunt dahlia 's either i be sure she be dreadfully upset quite but this heart i be talk about be not ache because of tuppy 's row with angelum it be ache for a different reason altogether i mean to say -- dash it you know why heart ache she seem to shimmy a bit she voice when she speak be whispery : you mean -- for love absolutely right on the bull 's - eye for love oh mr wooster i take it you believe in love at first sight i do indeed well that be what happen to this ache heart it fall in love at first sight and ever since it be be eat itself out as i believe the expression be there be a silence she have turn away and be watch a duck out on the lake it be tuck into weed a thing i have never be able to understand anyone want to do though i suppose if you face it squarely they be no worse than spinach she stand drink it in for a bit and then it suddenly stand on its head and disappear and this seem to break the spell oh mr wooster she say again and from the tone of she voice i could see that i have get she go for you i mean to say i proceed start to put in the fancy touch i dare say you have notice on these occasion that the difficulty be to plant the main idea to get the general outline of the thing well fix the rest be mere detail work i do not say i become glib at this juncture but i certainly become a dash glibber than i have be it be have the dickens of a time can not eat can not sleep -- all for love of you and what make it all so particularly rotten be that it -- this ache heart -- can not bring itself up to the scratch and tell you the position of affair because you profile have go and give it cold foot just as it be about to speak it catch sight of you sideways and word fail it silly of course but there it be i hear she give a gulp and i see that she eye have become moistish drenched iris if you care to put it that way lend you a handkerchief no thank you i be quite all right it be more than i could say for myself my effort have leave I weak i do not know if you suffer in the same way but with I the act of talk anything in the nature of real mashed potato always induce a sort of prickly sensation and a hideous feeling of shame together with a marked starting of the pore i remember at my aunt agatha 's place in hertfordshire once be put on the spot and force to enact the role of king edward iii say goodbye to that girl of he fair rosamund at some sort of pageant in aid of the distressed daughter of the clergy it involve some rather warmish medieval dialogue i recall racy of the day when they call a spade a spade and by the time the whistle blow i 'll bet no daughter of the clergy be half as distressed as i be not a dry stitch my reaction now be very similar it be a highly liquid bertram who hear he _ vis-à-vi _ give a couple of hiccup and start to speak bent a attentive ear please do not say any more mr wooster well i be not go to of course i understand i be glad to hear this yes i understand i will not be so silly as to pretend not to know what you mean i suspect this at canne when you use to stand and stare at I without speak a word but with whole volume in you eye if angelum 's shark have bite I in the leg i could not have leap more convulsively so tensely have i be concentrate on gussie 's interest that it have not so much as cross my mind that another and a unfortunate construction could be place on those word of mine the persp already bedew my brow become a regular niagara my whole fate hang upon a woman 's word i mean to say i could not back out if a girl think a man be propose to she and on that understanding book he up he can not explain to she that she have get hold of entirely the wrong end of the stick and that he have not the smallest intention of suggest anything of the kind he must simply let it ride and the thought of be engage to a girl who talk openly about fairy be bear because star blow they nose or whatever it be frankly appal I she be carry on with she remark and as i listen i clenched my fist till i should not wonder if the knuckle do not stand out white under the strain it seem as if she would never get to the nub yes all through those day at canne i could see what you be try to say a girl always know and then you follow I down here and there be that same dumb yearning look in you eye when we meet this evening and then you be so insistent that i should come out and walk with you in the twilight and now you stammer out those halt word no this do not come as a surprise but i be sorry -- the word be like one of jeeve 's pick-me-up just as if a glassful of meat sauce red pepper and the yolk of a egg -- though as i say i be convince that these be not the sole ingredient -- have be shoot into I i expand like some lovely flower blossom in the sunshine it be all right after all my guardian angel have not be asleep at the switch -- but i be afraid it be impossible she pause impossible she repeat i have be so busy feeling save from the scaffold that i do not get on to it for a moment that a early reply be desire oh right ho i say hastily i be sorry quite all right sorrier than i can say do not give it another thought we can still be friend oh rather then shall we just say no more about it keep what have happen as a tender little secret between ourselves absolutely we will like something lovely and fragrant lay away in lavender in lavender -- right there be a longish pause she be gaze at I in a divinely pity sort of way much as if i have be a snail she have happen accidentally to bring she short french vamp down on and i long to tell she that it be all right and that bertram so far from be the victim of despair have never feel fizzier in he life but of course one can not do that sort of thing i simply say nothing and stand there look brave i wish i could she murmur could i say for my attensh have be wander feel towards you as you would like I to feel oh ah but i can not i be sorry absolutely ok fault on both side no doubt because i be fond of you mr -- no i think i must call you bertie may i oh rather because we be real friend quite i do like you bertie and if thing be different -- i wonder -- eh after all we be real friend we have this common memory you have a right to know i do not want you to think -- life be such a muddle be not it to many man no doubt these broken utterance would have appear mere drool and would have be dismiss as such but the wooster be quicker-witted than the ordinary and can read between the line i suddenly divine what it be that she be try to get off the chest you mean there be someone else she nod you be in love with some other bloke she nod engage what this time she shake the pumpkin no not engage well that be something of course nevertheless from the way she speak it certainly look as if poor old gussie might as well scratch he name off the entry list and i do not at all like the prospect of have to break the bad news to he i have study the man closely and it be my conviction that this would about be he finish gussie you see be not like some of my pal -- the name of bingo little be one that spring to the lip -- who if turn down by a girl would simply say well bung-oh and toddle off quite happily to find another he be so manifestly a bird who have fail to score in the first chukker would turn the thing up and spend the rest of he life brood over he newt and grow long gray whisker like one of those chap you read about in novel who live in the great white house you can just see over there through the tree and shut themselves off from the world and have pained face i be afraid he do not care for I in that way at least he have say nothing you understand that i be only tell you this because -- oh rather it be odd that you should have ask I if i believe in love at first sight she half close she eye ` who ever love that loved not at first sight ' she say in a rummy voice that bring back to I -- i do not know why -- the picture of my aunt agatha as boadicea recite at that pageant i be speak of it be a silly little story i be stay with some friend in the country and i have go for a walk with my dog and the poor wee mite get a nasty thorn in he little foot and i do not know what to do and then suddenly this man come along -- hark back once again to that pageant in sketch out for you my emotion on that occasion i show you only the darker side of the picture there be i should now mention a splendid aftermath when have climb out of my suit of chain mail and sneak off to the local pub i enter the saloon bar and request mine host to start pour a moment later a tankard of they special home-brewed be in my hand and the ecstasy of that first gollup be still green in my memory the recollection of the agony through which i have pass be just what be need to make it perfect it be the same now when i realize listen to she word that she must be refer to gussie -- i mean to say there could not have be a whole platoon of man take thorn out of she dog that day the animal be not a pin-cushion -- and become aware that gussie who a instant before have to all appearance go so far back in the bet as not to be worth a quotation be the big winner after all a positive thrill permeate the frame and there escape my lip a wow so crisp and hearty that the bassett leap a liberal inch and a half from terra firma i beg you pardon she say i wave a jaunty hand nothing i say nothing just remember there be a letter i have to write tonight without fail if you do not mind i think i 'll be go in here i say come gussie fink-nottle he will look after you and as i speak gussie come sidle out from behind a tree i pass away and leave they to it as regard these two everything be beyond a question absolutely in order all gussie have to do be keep he head down and not press already i feel as i legged it back to the house the happy end must have begin to function i mean to say when you leave a girl and a man each of whom have admit in set term that she and he love he and she in close juxtaposition in the twilight there do not seem much more to do but start price fish slice something attempt something do seem to I to have earn two-penn ` orth of wassail in the smoking-room i proceed thither -11 - the makings be neatly lay out on a side-table and to pour into a glass a inch or so of the raw spirit and shoosh some soda-water on top of it be with I the work of a moment this do i retire to a arm-chair and put my foot up sip the mixture with carefree enjoyment rather like caesar have one in he tent the day he overcome the nervius as i let the mind dwell on what must even now be take place in that peaceful garden i feel buck and uplift though never for a instant falter in my opinion that augustus fink-nottle be nature 's final word in cloth-headed guffin i like the man wish he well and could not have feel more deeply involve in the success of he woo if i and not he have be under the ether the thought that by this time he might quite easily have complete the preliminary _ pourparler _ and be deep in a informal discussion of honeymoon plan be very pleasant to I of course consider the sort of girl madeline bassett be -- star and rabbit and all that i mean -- you might say that a sober sadness would have be more fitting but in these matter you have get to realize that taste differ the impulse of right-thinking man might be to run a mile when they see the bassett but for some reason she appeal to the deep in gussie so that be that i have reach this point in my meditation when i be arouse by the sound of the door open somebody come in and start move like a leopard toward the side-table and lower the foot i perceive that it be tuppy glossop the sight of he give I a momentary twinge of remorse remind I as it do that in the excitement of get gussie fix up i have rather forget about this other client it be often that way when you be try to run two case at once however gussie now be off my mind i be prepare to devote my whole attention to the glossop problem i have be much please by the way he have carry out the task assign he at the dinner-table no easy one i can assure you for the browsing and sluicing have be of the highest quality and there have be one dish in particular -- i allude to the _ nonnette de poulet agnès sorel _ -- which might well have break down the most iron resolution but he have pass it up like a professional fasting man and i be proud of he oh hullo tuppy i say i want to see you he turn snifter in hand and it be easy to see that he privation have try he sorely he be look like a wolf on the steppe of russium which have see its peasant shin up a high tree yes he say rather unpleasantly well here i be well how do you mean -- well make you report what report have you nothing to tell I about angelum only that she be a blister i be concern have not she come clustering round you yet she have not very odd why odd she must have note you lack of appetite he bark raspingly as if he be have trouble with the tonsil of the soul lack of appetite i be as hollow as the grand canyon courage tuppy think of gandhus what about gandhus he have not have a square meal for year nor have i or i could swear i have not gandhi my left foot i see that it might be best to let the gandhus _ motif _ slide i go back to where we have start she be probably look for you now who be angelum yes she must have notice you supreme sacrifice i do not suppose she notice it at all the little fathead i 'll bet it do not register in any way whatsoever come tuppy i urge this be morbid do not take this gloomy view she must at least have spot that you refuse those _ nonnette de poulet agnès sorel _ it be a sensational renunciation and stick out like a sore thumb and the _ cèpes à la rossini _ -- a hoarse cry break from he twisted lip : will you stop it bertie do you think i be make of marble be not it bad enough to have sit watch one of anatole 's supremest dinner flit by course after course without have you make a song about it do not remind I of those _ nonnette _ i can not stand it i endeavor to hearten and console be brave tuppy fix you thought on that cold steak-and-kidney pie in the larder as the good book say it cometh in the morning yes in the morning and it be now about half-past nine at night you would bring that pie up would not you just when i be try to keep my mind off it i see what he mean hour must pass before he could dig into that pie i drop the subject and we sit for a pretty good time in silence then he rise and begin to pace the room in a overwrought sort of way like a zoo lion who have hear the dinner-gong go and be hope the keeper will not forget he in the general distribution i avert my gaze tactfully but i could hear he kick chair and thing it be plain that the man 's soul be in travail and he blood pressure high presently he return to he seat and i see that he be look at I intently there be that about he demeanor that lead I to think that he have something to communicate nor be i wrong he tap I significantly on the knee and speak : bertie hullo shall i tell you something certainly old bird i say cordially i be just begin to feel that the scene could do with a bit more dialogue this business of angelum and I yes i have be put in a lot of solid think about it oh yes i have analyze the situation pitilessly and one thing stand out as clear as dammit there have be dirty work afoot i do not get you all right let I review the fact up to the time she go to canne angelum love I she be all over I i be the blue-eyed boy in every sense of the term you 'll admit that indisputably and directly she come back we have this bust-up quite about nothing oh dash it old man nothing you be a bit tactless what about she shark i be frank and candid about she shark and that be my point do you seriously believe that a trifling disagreement about shark would make a girl hand a man he hat if she heart be really he certainly it beat I why he could not see it but then poor old tuppy have never be very hot on the finer shades he be one of those large tough football-playing bloke who lack the more delicate sensibility as i have hear jeeve call they excellent at block a punt or walk across a opponent 's face in cleated boot but not so good when it come to understand the highly-strung female temperament it simply would not occur to he that a girl might be prepare to give up she life 's happiness rather than waive she shark rot it be just a pretext what be this shark business she want to get rid of I and grab at the first excuse no no i tell you she do but what on earth would she want to get rid of you for exactly that be the very question i ask myself and here be the answer : because she have fall in love with somebody else it stick out a mile there be no other possible solution she go to canne all for I she come back all off I obviously during those two month she must have transfer she affection to some foul blister she meet out there no no do not keep say ` no no ' she must have do well i 'll tell you one thing and you can take this as official if ever i find this slimy slithery snake in the grass he have better make all the necessary arrangement at he favorite nursing-home without delay because i be go to be very rough with he i propose if and when find to take he by he beastly neck shake he till he froth and pull he inside out and make he swallow himself with which word he biff off and i have give he a minute or two to get out of the way rise and make for the drawing-room the tendency of female to roost in drawing-room after dinner be well marked i expect to find angelum there it be my intention to have a word with angelum to tuppy 's theory that some insinuate bird have steal the girl 's heart from he at canne i have give as i have indicate little credence consider it the mere unbalanced apple sauce of a bereaved man it be of course the shark and nothing but the shark that have cause love 's young dream to go temporarily off the boil and i be convince that a word or two with the cousin at this juncture would set everything right for frankly i think it incredible that a girl of she natural sweetness and tender-heartedness should not have be move to she foundation by what she have see at dinner that night even sepping aunt dahlia 's butler a cold unemotional man have gasp and practically reel when tuppy wave aside those _ nonnette de poulet agnès sorel _ while the footman standing by with the potato have stare like one see a vision i simply refuse to consider the possibility of the significance of the thing have be lose on a nice girl like angelum i fully expect to find she in the drawing-room with she heart bleed freely all ripe for a immediate reconciliation in the drawing-room however when i enter only aunt dahlia meet the eye it seem to I that she give I rather a jaundiced look as i hove in sight but this have so recently behold tuppy in he agony i attribute to the fact that she like he have be go light on the menu you can not expect a empty aunt to beam like a full aunt oh it be you be it she say well it be of course where 's angelum i ask go to bed already she say she have a headache h be i be not so sure that i like the sound of that so much a girl who have observe the sundered lover sensationally off he feed do not go to bed with headache if love have be reborn in she heart she stick around and give he the swift remorseful glance from beneath the droop eyelash and generally endeavor to convey to he that if he want to get together across a round table and try to find a formulum she be all for it too yes i be bind to say i find that going-to-bed stuff a bit disquieting go to bed eh i murmured musingly what do you want she for i think she might like a stroll and a chat be you go for a stroll say aunt dahlia with a sudden show of interest where oh hither and thither then i wonder if you would mind do something for I give it a name it will not take you long you know that path that run past the greenhouse into the kitchen garden if you go along it you come to a pond that be right well will you get a good stout piece of rope or cord and go down that path till you come to the pond -- to the pond right -- and look about you till you find a nice heavy stone or a fairly large brick would do i see i say though i do not be still fogged stone or brick yes and then then say the relative i want you like a good boy to fasten the rope to the brick and tie it around you damned neck and jump into the pond and drown yourself in a few day i will send and have you fish up and bury because i shall need to dance on you grave i be more fogged than ever and not only fog -- wound and resentful i remember read a book where a girl suddenly flee from the room afraid to stay for fear dreadful thing would come tumble from she lip determine that she would not remain another day in this house to be insult and misunderstand i feel much about the same then i remind myself that one have get to make allowance for a woman with only about half a spoonful of soup inside she and i check the red-hot crack that rise to the lip what i say gently be this all about you seem pip with bertram pip noticeably pip why this ill-concealed animus a sudden flame shot from she eye singe my hair who be the ass who be the chump who be the dither idiot who talk I against my better judgment into go without my dinner i might have guess -- i see that i have divine correctly the cause of she strange mood it be all right aunt dahlia i know just how you be feel a bit on the hollow side what but the agony will pass if i be you i would sneak down and raid the larder after the household have go to bed i be tell there be a pretty good steak-and-kidney pie there which will repay inspection have faith aunt dahlia i urge pretty soon uncle tom will be along full of sympathy and anxious inquiry will he do you know where he be now i have not see he he be in the study with he face bury in he hand mutter about civilization and melting pot eh why because it have just be my painful duty to inform he that anatole have give notice i own that i reel what give notice as the result of that drivelling scheme of yours what do you expect a sensitive temperamental french cook to do if you go about urge everybody to refuse all food i hear that when the first two course come back to the kitchen practically untouch he feeling be so hurt that he cry like a child and when the rest of the dinner follow he come to the conclusion that the whole thing be a study and calculate insult and decide to hand in he portfolio golly you may well say ` golly ' anatole god 's gift to the gastric juice go like the dew off the petal of a rose all through you idiocy perhaps you understand now why i want you to go and jump in that pond i might have know that some hideous disaster would strike this house like a thunderbolt if once you wriggle you way into it and start try to be clever harsh word of course as from aunt to nephew but i bear she no resentment no doubt if you look at it from a certain angle bertram might be consider to have make something of a floater i be sorry what be the good of be sorry i act for what i deem the best another time try act for the worst then we may possibly escape with a mere flesh wound uncle tom 's not feel too buck about it all you say he be groan like a lose soul and any chance i ever have of get that money out of he have go i stroke the chin thoughtfully there be i have to admit reason in what she say none know better than i how terrible a blow the passing of anatole would be to uncle tom i have state earlier in this chronicle that this curious object of the seashore with whom aunt dahlia have link she lot be a bloke who habitually look like a pterodactyl that have suffer and the reason he do so be that all those year he spend in make million in the far east put he digestion on the blink and the only cook that have ever be discover capable of push food into he without start something like old home week in moscow under the third waistcoat button be this uniquely gifted anatole deprive of anatole 's service all he be likely to give the wife of he b be a dirty look yes unquestionably thing seem to have strike a somewhat rocky patch and i must admit that i find myself at moment of go to press a little destitute of constructive idea confident however that these would come ere long i keep the stiff upper lip bad i concede quite bad beyond a doubt certainly a nasty jar for one and all but have no fear aunt dahlia i will fix everything i have allude earlier to the difficulty of stagger when you be sit down show that it be a feat of which i personally be not capable aunt dahlia to my amazement now do it apparently without a effort she be well wedge into a deep arm-chair but nevertheless she stagger like billy-o a sort of spasm of horror and apprehension contorted she face if you dare to try any more of you lunatic scheme -- i see that it would be fruitless to try to reason with she quite plainly she be not in the vein content myself accordingly with a gesture of loving sympathy i leave the room whether she do or do not throw a handsomely bind volume of the work of alfred lord tennyson at I i be not in a position to say i have see it lie on the table beside she and as i close the door i remember receive the impression that some blunt instrument have crash against the woodwork but i be feel too pre-occupied to note and observe i blame myself for not have take into consideration the possible effect of a sudden abstinence on the part of virtually the whole strength of the company on one of anatole 's impulsive provençal temperament these gaul i should have remember can not take it they tendency to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation be well know no doubt the man have put he whole soul into those _ nonnette de poulet _ and to see they come homing back to he must have gash he like a knife however spilt milk blow nobody any good and it be useless to dwell upon it the task now confront bertram be to put matter right and i be pacing the lawn ponder to this end when i suddenly hear a groan so lost-soulish that i think it must have proceed from uncle tom escape from captivity and come to groan in the garden look about I however i could discern no uncle puzzle i be about to resume my meditation when the sound come again and peer into the shadow i observe a dim form seat on one of the rustic bench which so liberally dot this pleasance and another dim form standing beside same a second and more penetrate glance and i have assemble the fact these dim form be in the order name gussie fink-nottle and jeeve and what gussie be do groan all over the place like this be more than i could understand because i mean to say there be no possibility of error he be not singing as i approach he give a encore and it be beyond question a groan moreover i could now see he clearly and he whole aspect be definitely sand-bagged good evening sir say jeeve mr fink-nottle be not feel well nor be i gussie have begin to make a low bubble noise and i could no longer disguise it from myself that something must have go seriously wrong with the work i mean i know marriage be a pretty solemn business and the realization that he be in for it frequently churn a chap up a bit but i have never come across a case of a newly-engaged man take it on the chin so completely as this gussie look up he eye be dull he clutch the thatch goodbye bertie he say rise i seem to spot a error you mean ` hullo ' do not you no i do not i mean goodbye i be off off where to the kitchen garden to drown myself do not be a ass i be not a ass be i a ass jeeve possibly a little injudicious sir drown myself you mean yes sir you think on the whole not drown myself i should not advocate it sir very well jeeve i accept you ruling after all it would be unpleasant for mr traver to find a swollen body float in she pond yes sir and she have be very kind to I yes sir and you have be very kind to I jeeve thank you sir so have you bertie very kind everybody have be very kind to I very very kind very kind indeed i have no complaint to make all right i 'll go for a walk instead i follow he with bulge eye as he totter off into the dark jeeve i say and i be free to admit that in my emotion i bleated like a lamb draw itself to the attention of the parent sheep what the dickens be all this mr fink-nottle be not quite himself sir he have pass through a try experience i endeavor to put together a brief synopsis of previous event i leave he out here with miss bassett yes sir i have soften she up yes sir he know exactly what he have to do i have coach he thoroughly in line and business yes sir so mr fink-nottle inform I well then -- i regret to say sir that there be a slight hitch you mean something go wrong yes sir i could not fathom the brain seem to be totter on its throne but how could anything go wrong she love he jeeve indeed sir she definitely tell I so all he have to do be propose yes sir well do not he no sir then what the dickens do he talk about newt sir newt yes sir newts yes sir but why do he want to talk about newt he do not want to talk about newt sir as i gather from mr fink-nottle nothing could have be more alien to he plan i simply could not grasp the trend but you can not force a man to talk about newt mr fink-nottle be the victim of a sudden unfortunate spasm of nervousness sir upon find himself alone with the young lady he admit to have lose he morale in such circumstance gentleman frequently talk at random say the first thing that chance to enter they head this in mr fink-nottle 's case would seem to have be the newt its treatment in sickness and in health the scale fall from my eye i understand i have have the same sort of thing happen to I in moment of crisis i remember once detain a dentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspid and hold he up for nearly ten minute with a story about a scotchman a irishman and a jew purely automatic the more he try to jab the more i say hoot mon begorrah and oy oy when one lose one 's nerve one simply babble i could put myself in gussie 's place i could envisage the scene there he and the bassett be alone together in the evening stillness no doubt as i have advise he have shoot the work about sunset and fairy princess and so forth and then have arrive at the point where he have to say that bit about have something to say to she at this i take it she lower she eye and say oh yes he then i should imagine say it be something very important to which she response would one assume have be something on the line of really or indeed or possibly just the sharp intake of the breath and then they eye meet just as mine meet the dentist 's and something suddenly seem to catch he in the pit of the stomach and everything go black and he hear he voice start to drool about newt yes i could follow the psychology nevertheless i find myself blame gussie on discover that he be stress the newt note in this manner he ought of course to have tune out even if it have mean sit there say nothing no matter how much of a twitter he be in he should have have sense enough to see that he be throw a spanner into the work no girl when she have be lead to expect that a man be about to pour forth he soul in a fervor of passion like to find he suddenly shelve the whole topic in favor of a address on aquatic salamandrida bad jeeve yes sir and how long do this nuisance continue for some not inconsiderable time i gather sir accord to mr fink-nottle he supply miss bassett with very full and complete information not only with respect to the common newt but also the crest and palmate variety he describe to she how newt during the breed season live in the water subsist upon tadpole insect larva and crustacean how later they make they way to the land and eat slug and worm and how the newly bear newt have three pair of long plumlike external gill and he be just observe that newt differ from salamander in the shape of the tail which be compress and that a marked sexual dimorphism prevail in most species when the young lady rise and say that she think she would go back to the house and then -- she go sir i stand muse more and more it be begin to be bear in upon I what a particularly difficult chap gussie be to help he seem to so marked a extent to lack snap and finish with infinite toil you manoeuvre he into a position where all he have to do be charge ahead and he do not charge ahead but go off sideways miss the objective completely difficult jeeve yes sir in happier circ of course i would have canvass he view on the matter but after what have occur in connection with that mess-jacket my lip be seal well i must think it over yes sir burnish the brain a bit and endeavor to find the way out yes sir well good night jeeve good night sir he shimmer off leave a pensive bertram wooster standing motionless in the shadow it seem to I that it be hard to know what to do for the best -12 - i do not know if it have happen to you at all but a thing i have notice with myself be that when i be confront by a problem which seem for the moment to stump and baffle a good sleep will often bring the solution in the morning it be so on the present occasion the nib who study these matter claim i believe that this have get something to do with the subconscious mind and very possibly they may be right i would not have say off-hand that i have a subconscious mind but i suppose i must without know it and no doubt it be there sweating away diligently at the old stand all the while the corporeal wooster be get he eight hour for directly i open my eye on the morrow i see daylight well i do not mean that exactly because naturally i do what i mean be that i find i have the thing all map out the good old subconscious m have deliver the goods and i perceive exactly what step must be take in order to put augustus fink-nottle among the practise romeo i should like you if you can spare I a moment of you valuable time to throw you mind back to that conversation he and i have have in the garden on the previous evening not the glimmer landscape bit i do not mean that but the conclude passage of it have do so you will recall that when he inform I that he never touch alcoholic liquor i shake the head a bit feeling that this must inevitably weaken he as a force where propose to girl be concern and event have show that my fear be well found put to the test with nothing but orange juice inside he he have prove a complete bust in a situation call for word of molten passion of a nature calculate to go through madeline bassett like a red-hot gimlet through half a pound of butter he have say not a syllable that could bring a blush to the cheek of modesty merely deliver a well-phrased but in the circumstance quite misplace lecture on newt a romantic girl be not to be win by such tactic obviously before attempt to proceed further augustus fink-nottle must be induce to throw off the shackle inhibition of the past and fuel up it must be a prime confident fink-nottle who square up to the bassett for round no 2 only so could the _ morning post _ make its ten bob or whatever it be for print the announcement of the forthcoming nuptials have arrive at this conclusion i find the rest easy and by the time jeeve bring I my tea i have evolve a plan complete in every detail this i be about to place before he -- indeed i have get as far as the preliminary i say jeeve -- when we be interrupt by the arrival of tuppy he come listlessly into the room and i be pained to observe that a night 's rest have effect no improvement in the unhappy wreck 's appearance indeed i should have say if anything that he be look rather more moth-eaten than when i have see he last if you can visualize a bulldog which have just be kick in the rib and have its dinner sneak by the cat you will have hildebrand glossop as he now stand before I stap my vitals tuppy old corpse i say concern you be look pretty blue round the rim jeeve slide from the presence in that tactful eel-like way of he and i motion the remains to take a seat what be the matter i say he come to anchor on the bed and for awhile sit pick at the coverlet in silence i have be through hell bertie through where hell oh hell and what take you there once more he become silent stare before he with sombre eye follow he gaze i see that he be look at a enlarged photograph of my uncle tom in some sort of masonic uniform which stand on the mantelpiece i have try to reason with aunt dahlia about this photograph for year place before she two alternative suggestion : -lrb- a -rrb- to burn the beastly thing or -lrb- b -rrb- if she must preserve it to shove I in another room when i come to stay but she decline to accede she say it be good for I a useful discipline she maintain teaching I that there be a darker side to life and that we be not put into this world for pleasure only turn it to the wall if it hurt you tuppy i say gently eh that photograph of uncle tom as the bandmaster i do not come here to talk about photograph i come for sympathy and you shall have it what be the trouble worry about angelum i suppose well have no fear i have another well-laid plan for encompass that young shrimp i 'll guarantee that she will be weep on you neck before yonder sun have set he bark sharply a fat chance tup tushy eh i mean ` tush tuppy

last night oh you go to the larder last night i do and angelum be there she be and you aunt also you uncle i see that i should require foot-note all this be new stuff to I i have stay at brinkley court quite a lot in my time but i have no idea the larder be such a social vortex more like a snack bar on a race-course than anything else it seem to have become tell I the whole story in you own word i say omit no detail however apparently slight for one never know how important the most trivial detail may be he inspect the photograph for a moment with grow gloom all right he say this be what happen you know my view about that steak-and-kidney pie quite well round about one be i think the time be ripe i steal from my room and go downstairs the pie seem to beckon I i nod i know how pie do i get to the larder i fish it out i set it on the table i find knife and fork i collect salt mustard and pepper there be some cold potato i add those and i be about to pitch in when i hear a sound behind I and there be you aunt at the door in a blue-and-yellow dress gown embarrassing most i suppose you do not know where to look i look at angelum she come in with my aunt no with you uncle a minute or two later he be wear mauve pyjamas and carry a pistol have you ever see you uncle in pyjamas and a pistol never you have not miss much tell I tuppy i ask for i be anxious to ascertain this

to you aunt ` god bless my soul dahlia what be you do here ' to which she reply ` well if it come to that my merry somnambulist what be you ' you uncle then say that he think there must be burglar in the house as he have hear noise i nod again i could follow the trend ever since the scullery window be find open the year shine light be disqualify in the cesarewitch for boring uncle tom have have a marked complex about burglar i can still recall my emotion when pay my first visit after he have bar put on all the window and attempt to thrust the head out in order to get a sniff of country air i nearly fractured my skull on a sort of iron grille as worn by the tougher kind of mediaeval prison ` what sort of noise ' say you aunt ` funny noise ' say you uncle whereupon angelum -- with a nasty steely tinkle in she voice the little buzzard -- observe ' i expect it be mr glossop eat ' and then she do give I a look it be the sort of wonder revolt look a very spiritual woman would give a fat man gulp soup in a restaurant the kind of look that make a fellow feel he be forty-six round the waist and have great roll of superfluous flesh pour down over the back of he collar and still speak in the same unpleasant tone she add ' i ought to have tell you father that mr glossop always like to have a good meal three or four time during the night it help to keep he go till breakfast he have the most amazing appetite see he have practically finish a large steak-and-kidney pie already ' as he speak these word a feverish animation sweep over tuppy he eye glitter with a strange light and he thump the bed violently with he fist nearly catch I a juicy one on the leg that be what hurt bertie that be what sting i have not so much as start on that pie but that be a woman all over the eternal feminine she continue she remark ` you have no idea ' she say ` how mr glossop love food he just live for it he always eat six or seven meal a day and then start in again after bedtime i think it be rather wonderful ' you aunt seem interested and say it remind she of a boa constrictor angelum say do not she mean a python and then they argue as to which of the two it be you uncle meanwhile poke about with that damned pistol of he till human life be not safe in the vicinity and the pie lie there on the table and I unable to touch it you begin to understand why i say i have be through hell quite can not have be at all pleasant presently you aunt and angelum settle they discussion decide that angelum be right and that it be a python that i remind they of and shortly after that we all push back to bed angelum warn I in a motherly voice not to take the stair too quickly after seven or eight solid meal she say a man of my build ought to be very careful because of the danger of apoplectic fit she say it be the same with dog when they become very fat and overfed you have to see that they do not hurry upstairs as it make they puff and pant and that be bad for they heart she ask you aunt if she remember the late spaniel ambrose and you aunt say ` poor old ambrose you could not keep he away from the garbage pail ' and angelum say ` exactly so do please be careful mr glossop ' and you tell I she love I still i do my best to encourage girlish banter what girlish banter be dash she be right off I once she ideal i be now less than the dust beneath she chariot wheel she become infatuate with this chap whoever he be at canne and now she can not stand the sight of I i raise my eyebrow my dear tuppy you be not show you usual good sense in this angela-chap-at-cannes matter if you will forgive I say so you have get a _ idée fixe _ a what a _ idée fixe _ you know one of those thing fellow get like uncle tom 's delusion that everybody who be know even slightly to the police be lurk in the garden wait for a chance to break into the house you keep talk about this chap at canne and there never be a chap at canne and i 'll tell you why i be so sure about this during those two month on the riviera it so happen that angelum and i be practically inseparable if there have be somebody nose round she i should have spot it in a second he start i could see that this have impressed he oh she be with you all the time at canne be she i do not suppose she say two word to anybody else except of course idle conv at the crowded dinner table or a chance remark in a throng at the casino i see you mean that anything in the shape of mixed bathing and moonlight stroll she conduct solely in you company that be right it be quite a joke in the hotel you must have enjoy that oh rather i have always be devote to angela oh yes when we be kid she use to call herself my little sweetheart she do absolutely i see he sit plunge in thought while i glad to have set he mind at rest proceed with my tea and presently there come the banging of a gong from the hall below and he start like a war horse at the sound of the bugle breakfast he say and be off to a fly start leave I to brood and ponder and the more i brood and ponder the more do it seem to I that everything now look pretty smooth tuppy i could see despite that painful scene in the larder still love angelum with all the old fervor this mean that i could rely on that plan to which i have refer to bring home the bacon and as i have find the way to straighten out the gussie-bassett difficulty there seem nothing more to worry about it be with a uplifted heart that i address jeeve as he come in to remove the tea tray -13 - jeeve i say sir i have just be have a chat with young tuppy jeeve do you happen to notice that he be not look very roguish this morning yes sir it seem to I that mr glossop 's face be sickly o'er with the pale cast of thought quite he meet my cousin angelum in the larder last night and a rather painful interview ensue i be sorry sir not half so sorry as he be she find he closet with a steak-and-kidney pie and appear to have be a bit caustic about fat man who live for food alone most disturbing sir very in fact many people would say that thing have go so far between these two nothing now could bridge the chasm a girl who could make crack about human python who eat nine or ten meal a day and ought to be careful not to hurry upstairs because of the danger of apoplectic fit be a girl many people would say in whose heart love be dead would not people say that jeeve undeniably sir they would be wrong you think so sir i be convince of it i know these female you can not go by what they say you feel that miss angelum 's stricture should not be take too much _ au pie de la lettre _ sir eh in english we should say ` literally ' literally that be exactly what i mean you know what girl be a tiff occur and they shoot they head off but underneath it all the old love still remain be i correct quite correct sir the poet scott -- right ho jeeve very good sir and in order to bring that old love whiz to the surface once more all that be require be the proper treatment by ` proper treatment ' sir you mean -- clever handling jeeve a spot of the good old snaky work i see what must be do to jerk my cousin angelum back to normalcy i 'll tell you shall i if you would be so kind sir i light a cigarette and eye he keenly through the smoke he wait respectfully for I to unleash the word of wisdom i must say for jeeve that -- till as he be so apt to do he start shove he oar in and cavilling and obstruct -- he make a very good audience i do not know if he be actually agog but he look agog and that be the great thing suppose you be stroll through the illimitable jungle jeeve and happen to meet a tiger cub the contingency be a remote one sir never mind let we suppose it very good sir let we now suppose that you slosh that tiger cub and let we suppose further that word reach its mother that it be be put upon what would you expect the attitude of that mother to be in what frame of mind do you consider that that tigress would approach you i should anticipate a certain show of annoyance sir and rightly due to what be know as the maternal instinct what yes sir very good jeeve we will now suppose that there have recently be some little coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress for some day let we say they have not be on speak term do you think that that would make any difference to the vim with which the latter would leap to the former 's aid no sir exactly here then in brief be my plan jeeve i be go to draw my cousin angelum aside to a secluded spot and roast tuppy properly roast sir knock slam tick-off abuse denounce i shall be very terse about tuppy give it as my opinion that in all essential he be more like a wart hog than a ex-member of a fine old english public school what will ensue hear he attack my cousin angelum 's womanly heart will be as sick as mud the maternal tigress in she will awake no matter what difference they may have have she will remember only that he be the man she love and will leap to he defense and from that to fall into he arm and bury the dead past will be but a step how do you react to that the idea be a ingenious one sir we wooster be ingenious jeeve exceedingly ingenious yes sir as a matter of fact i be not speak without a knowledge of the form book i have test this theory indeed sir yes in person and it work i be stand on the eden rock at antibe last month idly watch the bather disport themselves in the water and a girl i know slightly pointed at a male diver and ask I if i do not think he leg be about the silliest-looking pair of prop ever issue to human be i reply that i do indeed and for the space of perhaps two minute be extraordinarily witty and satirical about this bird 's underpinning at the end of that period i suddenly feel as if i have be catch up in the tail of a cyclone begin with a _ critique _ of my own limb which she say justly enough be nothing to write home about this girl go on to dissect my manners moral intellect general physique and method of eat asparagus with such acerbity that by the time she have finish the best you could say of bertram be that so far as be know he have never actually commit murder or set fire to a orphan asylum subsequent investigation prove that she be engage to the fellow with the leg and have have a slight disagreement with he the evening before on the subject of whether she should or should not have make a original call of two spade have seven but without the ace that night i see they dine together with every indication of relish they difference make up and the lovelight once more in they eye that show you jeeve yes sir i expect precisely similar result from my cousin angelum when i start roast tuppy by lunchtime i should imagine the engagement will be on again and the diamond-and-platinum ring glittering as of yore on she third finger or be it the fourth scarcely by luncheon time sir miss angelum 's maid inform I that miss angelum drive off in she car early this morning with the intention of spend the day with friend in the vicinity well within half a hour of whatever time she come back then these be mere straw jeeve do not let we chop they no sir the point be that as far as tuppy and angelum be concern we may say with confidence that everything will shortly be hotsy-totsy once more and what a agreeable thought that be jeeve very true sir if there be one thing that give I the pip it be two loving heart be estrange i can readily appreciate the fact sir i place the stub of my gasper in the ash tray and light another to indicate that that complete chap i right ho then so much for the western front we now turn to the eastern sir i speak in parable jeeve what i mean be we now approach the matter of gussie and miss bassett yes sir here jeeve more direct method be require in handle the case of augustus fink-nottle we must keep always in mind the fact that we be deal with a poop a sensitive plant would perhaps be a kinder expression sir no jeeve a poop and with poop one have to employ the strong forceful straightforward policy psychology do not get you anywhere you if i may remind you without wound you feeling fall into the error of muck about with psychology in connection with this fink-nottle and the result be a wash-out you attempt to push he over the line by rig he out in a mephistophele costume and send he off to a fancy-dress ball you view be that scarlet tights would embolden he futile the matter be never actually put to the test sir no because he do not get to the ball and that strengthen my argument a man who can set out in a cab for a fancy-dress ball and not get there be manifestly a poop of no common order i do not think i have ever know anybody else who be such a dash silly ass that he could not even get to a fancy-dress ball have you jeeve no sir but do not forget this because it be the point i wish above all to make : even if gussie have get to that ball even if those scarlet tights take in conjunction with he horn-rimmed spectacles have not give the girl a fit of some kind even if she have rally from the shock and he have be able to dance and generally hobnob with she even then you effort would have be fruitless because mephistophele costume or no mephistophele costume augustus fink-nottle would never have be able to summon up the courage to ask she to be he all that would have result would have be that she would have get that lecture on newt a few day earlier and why jeeve shall i tell you why yes sir because he would have be attempt the hopeless task of try to do the thing on orange juice sir gussie be a orange-juice addict he drink nothing else i be not aware of that sir i have it from he own lip whether from some hereditary taint or because he promise he mother he would not or simply because he do not like the taste of the stuff gussie fink-nottle have never in the whole course of he career push so much as the simplest gin and tonic over the larynx and he expect -- this poop expect jeeve -- this wabbling shrink diffident rabbit in human shape expect under these condition to propose to the girl he love one hardly know whether to smile or weep what you consider total abstinence a handicap to a gentleman who wish to make a proposal of marriage sir the question amaze I why dash it i say astounded you must know it be use you intelligence jeeve reflect what propose mean it mean that a decent self-respecting chap have get to listen to himself say thing which if speak on the silver screen would cause he to dash to the box-office and demand he money back let he attempt to do it on orange juice and what ensue shame seal he lip or if it do not do that make he lose he morale and start to babble gussie for example as we have see babble of syncopated newt palmated newt sir palmated or syncopated it do not matter which the point be that he babble and be go to babble again if he have another try at it unless -- and this be where i want you to follow I very closely jeeve -- unless step be take at once through the proper channel only active measure promptly apply can provide this poor pusillanimous poop with the proper pep and that be why jeeve i intend tomorrow to secure a bottle of gin and lace he luncheon orange juice with it liberally sir i click the tongue i have already have occasion jeeve i say rebukingly to comment on the way you say ` well sir ' and ` indeed sir ' i take this opportunity of inform you that i object equally strongly to you ` sir ' pure and simple the word seem to suggest that in you opinion i have make a statement or moot a scheme so bizarre that you brain reel at it in the present instance there be absolutely nothing to say ` sir ' about the plan i have put forward be entirely reasonable and icily logical and should excite no sirring whatsoever or do not you think so well sir -- jeeve i beg you pardon sir the expression escape I inadvertently what i intend to say since you press I be that the action which you propose do seem to I somewhat injudicious injudicious i do not follow you jeeve a certain amount of risk would enter into it in my opinion sir it be not always a simple matter to gauge the effect of alcohol on a subject unaccustomed to such stimulant i have know it to have distressing result in the case of parrot parrot i be think of a incident of my earlier life sir before i enter you employment i be in the service of the late lord brancaster at the time a gentleman who own a parrot to which he be greatly devoted and one day the bird chance to be lethargic and he lordship with the kindly intention of restore it to its customary animation offer it a portion of seed cake steep in the '84 port the bird accept the morsel gratefully and consume it with every indication of satisfaction almost immediately afterwards however its manner become markedly feverish have bite he lordship in the thumb and sing part of a sea-chanty it fall to the bottom of the cage and remain there for a considerable period of time with its leg in the air unable to move i merely mention this sir in order to -- i put my finger on the flaw i have spot it all along but gussie be not a parrot no sir but -- it be high time in my opinion that this question of what young gussie really be be thresh out and clear up he seem to think he be a male newt and you now appear to suggest that he be a parrot the truth of the matter be that he be just a plain ordinary poop and need a snootful as badly as ever man do so no more discussion jeeve my mind be make up there be only one way of handle this difficult case and that be the way i have outline very good sir right ho jeeve so much for that then now here 's something else : you notice that i say i be go to put this project through tomorrow and no doubt you wonder why i say tomorrow why do i jeeves because you feel that if it be do when ` tis do then ` twere well it be do quickly sir partly jeeve but not altogether my chief reason for fix the date as specify be that tomorrow though you have doubtless forget be the day of the distribution of prize at market snodsbury grammar school at which as you know gussie be to be the male star and master of the revel so you see we shall by lace that juice not only embolden he to propose to miss bassett but also put he so into shape that he will hold that market snodsbury audience spellbound in fact you will be kill two bird with one stone sir exactly a very neat way of put it and now here be a minor point on second thought i think the best plan will be for you not I to lace the juice sir jeeve i beg you pardon sir and i 'll tell you why that will be the best plan because you be in a position to obtain ready access to the stuff it be serve to gussie daily i have notice in a individual jug this jug will presumably be lie about the kitchen or somewhere before lunch tomorrow it will be the simplest of task for you to slip a few finger of gin in it no doubt sir but -- do not say ` but ' jeeve i fear sir -- ' i fear sir ' be just as bad what i be endeavor to say sir be that i be sorry but i be afraid i must enter a unequivocal _ nolle prosequus _ do what the expression be a legal one sir signify the resolve not to proceed with a matter in other word eager though i be to carry out you instruction sir as a general rule on this occasion i must respectfully decline to co-operate you will not do it you mean precisely sir i be stunned i begin to understand how a general must feel when he have order a regiment to charge and have be tell that it be not in the mood jeeve i say i have not expect this of you no sir no indeed naturally i realize that lacing gussie 's orange juice be not one of those regular duty for which you receive the monthly stipend and if you care to stand on the strict letter of the contract i suppose there be nothing to be do about it but you will permit I to observe that this be scarcely the feudal spirit i be sorry sir it be quite all right jeeve quite all right i be not angry only a little hurt very good sir right ho jeeve -14 - investigation prove that the friend angelum have go to spend the day with be some stately-home owner of the name of stretchley-budd hang out in a joint call kingham manor about eight mile distant in the direction of pershore i do not know these bird but they fascination must have be considerable for she tear herself away from they only just in time to get back and dress for dinner it be accordingly not until coffee have be consume that i be able to get matter move i find she in the drawing-room and at once proceed to put thing in train it be with very different feeling from those which have animated the bosom when approach the bassett twenty-four hour before in the same manner in this same drawing-room that i head for where she sit as i have tell tuppy i have always be devote to angelum and there be nothing i like better than a ramble in she company and i could see by the look of she now how sorely in need she be of my aid and comfort frankly i be shock by the unfortunate young prune 's appearance at canne she have be a happy smile english girl of the best type full of bean and buck she face now be pale and draw like that of a hockey centre-forward at a girl ' school who in addition to get a fruity one on the shin have just be penalize for stick in any normal gather she demeanor would have excite instant remark but the standard of gloom at brinkley court have become so high that it pass unnoticed indeed i should not wonder if uncle tom crouch in he corner wait for the end do not think she be look indecently cheerful i get down to the agenda in my debonair way what ho angelum old girl hullo bertie darling glad you be back at last i miss you do you darling i do indeed care to come for a saunter i would love it fine i have much to say to you that be not for the public ear i think at this moment poor old tuppy must have get a sudden touch of cramp he have be sit hard by stare at the ceiling and he now give a sharp leap like a gaff salmon and upset a small table contain a vase a bowl of potpourri two china dog and a copy of omar khayyám bind in limp leather aunt dahlia utter a startled hunting cry uncle tom who probably imagine from the noise that this be civilization crash at last help thing along by break a coffee-cup tuppy say he be sorry aunt dahlia with a deathbed groan say it do not matter and angelum have stare haughtily for a moment like a princess of the old régime confront by some notable example of gaucherie on the part of some particularly foul member of the underworld accompany I across the threshold and presently i have deposit she and self on one of the rustic bench in the garden and be ready to snap into the business of the evening i consider it best however before do so to ease thing along with a little informal chitchat you do not want to rush a delicate job like the one i have in hand and so for a while we speak of neutral topic she say that what have keep she so long at the stretchley-budd be that hilda stretchley-budd have make she stop on and help with the arrangement for they servant ' ball tomorrow night a task which she could not very well decline as all the brinkley court domestic staff be to be present i say that a jolly night 's revelry might be just what be need to cheer anatole up and take he mind off thing to which she reply that anatole be not go on be urge to do so by aunt dahlia she say he have merely shake he head sadly and go on talking of return to provence where he be appreciate it be after the sombre silence induce by this statement that angelum say the grass be wet and she think she would go in this of course be entirely foreign to my policy no do not do that i have not have a chance to talk to you since you arrive i shall ruin my shoe put you foot up on my lap all right and you can tickle my ankle quite matter be accordingly arrange on these line and for some minute we continue chat in desultory fashion then the conversation peter out i make a few observation _ in re _ the scenic effect feature the twilight hush the peeping star and the soft glimmer of the water of the lake and she say yes something rustle in the bush in front of we and i advance the theory that it be possibly a weasel and she say it might be but it be plain that the girl be distraite and i consider it best to waste no more time well old thing i say i have hear all about you little dust-up so those wedding bell be not go to ring out what no definitely over be it yes well if you want my opinion i think that be a bit of goose for you angela old girl i think you be extremely well out of it it be a mystery to I how you stand this glossop so long take he for all in all he rank very low down among the wine and spirit a washout i should describe he as a frightful oik and a mass of side to boot i would pity the girl who be link for life to a bargee like tuppy glossop and i emit a hard laugh -- one of the sneering kind i always think you be such friend say angelum i let go another hard one with a bit more top spin on it than the first time : friend absolutely not one be civil of course when one meet the fellow but it would be absurd to say one be a friend of he a club acquaintance and a mere one at that and then one be at school with the man at eton good heaven no we would not have a fellow like that at eton at a kid 's school before i go there a grubby little brute he be i recollect cover with ink and mire generally wash only on alternate thursday in short a notable outsider shun by all i pause i be more than a bit perturb apart from the agony of have to talk in this fashion of one who except when he be loop back ring and cause I to plunge into swim bath in correct evening costume have always be a very dear and esteem crony i do not seem to be get anywhere business be not result stare into the bush without a yip she appear to be bear these slur and innuendo of mine with a easy calm i have another pop at it : ` uncouth ' about sum it up i doubt if i have ever see a uncouther kid than this glossop ask anyone who know he in those day to describe he in a word and the word they will use be ` uncouth ' and he be just the same today it be the old story the boy be the father of the man she appear not to have hear the boy i repeat not wish she to miss that one be the father of the man what be you talk about i be talk about this glossop i think you say something about somebody 's father i say the boy be the father of the man what boy the boy glossop he have not get a father i never say he have i say he be the father of the boy -- or rather of the man what man i see that the conversation have reach a point where unless care be take we should be muddle the point i be try to make i say be that the boy glossop be the father of the man glossop in other word each loathsome fault and blemish that lead the boy glossop to be frown upon by he fellow be present in the man glossop and cause he -- i be speak now of the man glossop -- to be a hissing and a byword at place like the drone where a certain standard of decency be demand from the inmate ask anyone at the drone and they will tell you that it be a black day for the dear old club when this chap glossop somehow wriggle into the list of member here you will find a man who dislike he face there one who could stand he face if it be not for he habit but the universal consensus of opinion be that the fellow be a bounder and a tick and that the moment he show sign of want to get into the place he should have be meet with a firm _ nolle prosequus _ and heartily blackball i have to pause again here partly in order to take in a spot of breath and partly to wrestle with the almost physical torture of say these frightful thing about poor old tuppy there be some chap i resume force myself once more to the nauseous task who in spite of look as if they have sleep in they clothes can get by quite nicely because they be amiable and suave there be other who for all that they excite adverse comment by be fat and uncouth find themselves on the credit side of the ledger owe to they wit and sparkling humor but this glossop i regret to say fall into neither class in addition to look like one of those thing that come out of hollow tree he be universally admit to be a dumb brick of the first water no soul no conversation in short any girl who have be rash enough to get engage to he have manage at the eleventh hour to slide out be justly entitle to consider herself dash lucky i pause once more and cock a eye at angelum to see how the treatment be take all the while i have be speak she have sit gaze silently into the bush but it seem to I incredible that she should not now turn on I like a tigress accord to specification it beat I why she have not do it already it seem to I that a mere tithe of what i have say if say to a tigress about a tiger of which she be fond would have make she -- the tigress i mean -- hit the ceiling and the next moment you could have knock I down with a toothpick yes she say nod thoughtfully you be quite right eh that be exactly what i have be think myself what ` dumb brick ' it just describe he one of the six silliest ass in england i should think he must be i do not speak i be endeavor to adjust the faculty which be in urgent need of a bit of first-aid treatment i mean to say all this have come as a complete surprise in formulate the well-laid plan which i have just be put into effect the one contingency i have not budget for be that she might adhere to the sentiment which i express i have brace myself for a gush of stormy emotion i be expect the tearful tick off the girlish recrimination and all the rest of the bag of trick along those line but this cordial agreement with my remark i have not foresee and it give I what you might call pause for think she proceed to develop she theme speak in ring enthusiastic tone as if she love the topic jeeve could tell you the word i want i think it be ecstatic unless that be the sort of rash you get on you face and have to use ointment for but if that be the right word then that be what she manner be as she ventilate the subject of poor old tuppy if you have be able to go simply by the sound of she voice she might have be a court poet cut loose about a oriental monarch or gussie fink-nottle describe he last consignment of newt it be so nice bertie talk to somebody who really take a sensible view about this man glossop mother say he be a good chap which be simply absurd anybody can see that he be absolutely impossible he be conceit and opinionative and argue all the time even when he know perfectly well that he be talk through he hat and he smoke too much and eat too much and drink too much and i do not like the color of he hair not that he 'll have any hair in a year or two because he be pretty thin on the top already and before he know where he be he 'll be as bald as a egg and he be the last man who can afford to go bald and i think it be simply disgust the way he gorge all the time do you know i find he in the larder at one o'clock this morning absolutely wallow in a steak-and-kidney pie there be hardly any of it leave and you remember what a enormous dinner he have quite disgusting i call it but i can not stop out here all night talk about man who be not worth waste a word on and have not even enough sense to tell shark from flatfish i be go in and gather about she slim shoulder the shawl which she have put on as a protection against the evening dew she buzz off leave I alone in the silent night well as a matter of fact not absolutely alone because a few moment later there be a sort of upheaval in the bush in front of I and tuppy emerge -15 - i give he the eye the evening have begin to draw in a bit by now and the visibility in consequence be not so hot but there still remain ample light to enable I to see he clearly and what i see convinced I that i should be a lot easier in my mind with a stout rustic bench between we i rise accordingly model my style on that of a rocket pheasant and proceed to deposit myself on the other side of the object name my prompt agility be not without its effect he seem somewhat take aback he come to a halt and for about the space of time require to allow a bead of persp to trickle from the top of the brow to the tip of the nose stand gaze at I in silence so he say at length and it come as a complete surprise to I that fellow ever really do say so i have always think it be just a thing you read in book like quotha i mean to say or odds bodikin or even eh ba goom still there it be quaint or not quaint bizarre or not bizarre he have say so and it be up to I to cope with the situation on those line it would have be a duller man than bertram wooster who have fail to note that the dear old chap be a bit steam up whether he eye be actually shooting forth flame i could not tell you but there appear to I to be a distinct incandescence for the rest he fist be clench he ear quiver and the muscle of he jaw rotate rhythmically as if he be make a early supper off something he hair be full of twig and there be a beetle hang to the side of he head which would have interested gussie fink-nottle to this however i pay scant attention there be a time for study beetle and a time for not study beetle so he say again now those who know bertram wooster best will tell you that he be always at he shrewdest and most level-headed in moment of peril who be it who when grip by the arm of the law on boat-race night not so many year ago and haul off to vine street police station assume in a flash the identity of eustace h plimsoll of the laburnum alleyn road west dulwich thus save the grand old name of wooster from be drag in the mire and avoid wide publicity of the wrong sort who be it but i need not labor the point my record speak for itself three time pinch but never once sentence under the correct label ask anyone at the drone about this so now in a situation threaten to become every moment more scaly i do not lose my head i preserve the old sang-froid smile a genial and affectionate smile and hope that it be not too dark for it to register i speak with a jolly cordiality : why hallo tuppy you here he say yes he be here be here long i have fine i want to see you well here i be come out from behind that bench no thanks old man i like lean on it it seem to rest the spine in about two seconds say tuppy i be go to kick you spine up through the top of you head i raise the eyebrow not much good of course in that light but it seem to help the general composition be this hildebrand glossop speak i say he reply that it be add that if i want to make sure i might move a few foot over in he direction he also call I a opprobrious name i raise the eyebrow again come come tuppy do not let we let this little chat become acrid be ` acrid ' the word i want i could not say he reply begin to sidle round the bench i see that anything i might wish to say must be say quickly already he have sidle some six foot and though by dint of sidle too i have manage to keep the bench between we who could predict how long this happy state of affair would last i come to the point therefore i think i know what be on you mind tuppy i say if you be in those bush during my conversation with the recent angelum i dare say you hear what i be say about you i do i see well we will not go into the ethic of the thing eavesdropping some people might call it and i can imagine stern critic draw in the breath to some extent consider it -- i do not want to hurt you feeling tuppy -- but consider it un-english a bit un-english tuppy old man you must admit i be scotch really i say i never know that before rummy how you do not suspect a man of be scotch unless he be mac-something and say ` och aye ' and thing like that i wonder i go on feeling that a academic discussion on some neutral topic might ease the tension if you can tell I something that have puzzle I a good deal what exactly be it that they put into haggis i have often wonder about that from the fact that he only response to the question be to leap over the bench and make a grab at I i gather that he mind be not on haggis however i say leap over the bench in my turn that be a side issue if to come back to it you be in those bush and hear what i be say about you -- he begin to move round the bench in a nor ' - nor ' - easterly direction i follow he example set a course sou ' - sou ' - west no doubt you be surprise at the way i be talk not a bit what do nothing strike you as odd in the tone of my remark it be just the sort of stuff i should have expect a treacherous sneak hound like you to say my dear chap i protest this be not you usual form a bit slow in the uptake surely i should have think you would have spot right away that it be all part of a well-laid plan i 'll get you in a jiffy say tuppy recover he balance after a swift clutch at my neck and so probable do this seem that i delay no longer but hasten to place all the fact before he speak rapidly and keep move i related my emotion on receipt of aunt dahlia 's telegram my instant rush to the scene of the disaster my meditation in the car and the eventual framing of this well-laid plan of mine i speak clearly and well and it be with considerable concern consequently that i hear he observe -- between clenched tooth which make it worse -- that he do not believe a damned word of it but tuppy i say why not to I the thing ring true to the last drop what make you sceptical confide in I tuppy he halt and stand take a breather tuppy pungently though angelum might have argue to the contrary be not really fat during the winter month you will find he constantly boot the football with merry shout and in the summer the tennis racket be seldom out of he hand but at the recently conclude evening meal feeling no doubt that after that painful scene in the larder there be nothing to be gain by further abstinence he have rather let himself go and as it be make up leeway and after really immerse himself in one of anatole 's dinner a man of he sturdy build tend to lose elasticity a bit during the exposition of my plan for he happiness a certain animation have creep into this round-and-round-the mulberry-bush jamboree of ours -- so much so indeed that for the last few minute we might have be a rather oversized greyhound and a somewhat slimmer electric hare do they stuff on a circular track for the entertainment of the many-headed this it appear have take it out of he a bit and i be not displeased i be feel the strain myself and welcome a lull it absolutely beat I why you do not believe it i say you know we have be pal for year you must be aware that except at the moment when you cause I to do a nose dive into the drone ' swimming bath a incident which i long since decide to put out of my mind and let the dead past bury its dead about if you follow what i mean -- except on that one occasion as i say i have always regard you with the utmost esteem why then if not for the motive i have outline should i knock you to angelum answer I that be very careful what do you mean be very careful well as a matter of fact i do not quite know myself it be what the magistrate have say to I on the occasion when i stand

during the court season talking of beetle when all the time you know you be a treacherous sneak hound it be a debatable point of course why treacherous sneak hound should be consider ineligible to

explanation i have tell you that i act throughout from the best and kindliest motive in roast you to angela it cut I to the quick to have to speak like that and only the recollection of we lifelong friendship would have make I do it and now you say you do not believe I and call I name for which i be not sure i could not have you up before a beak and jury and mulct you in very substantial damages i should have to consult my solicitor of course but it would surprise I very much if a action do not lie be reasonable tuppy suggest another motive i could have have just one i will do you think i do not know you be in love with angelum yourself what and you knock I in order to poison she mind against I and finally remove I from you path i have never hear anything so absolutely loopy in my life why dash it i have know angelum since she be so high you do not fall in love with close relation you have know since they be so high besides be not there something in the book of rule about a man may not marry he cousin or be i thinking of grandmother tuppy my dear old ass i cry this be pure banana oil you have come unscrewed oh yes I in love with angelum ha-ha you can not get out of it with ha-ha 's she call you ` darling ' i know and i disapprove this habit of the younger g of scatter ` darling ' about like birdseed be one that i deprecate lax be how i should describe it you tickle she ankle in a purely cousinly spirit it do not mean a thing why dash it you must know that in the deeper and truer sense i would not touch angelum with a barge pole oh and why not not good enough for you you misunderstand I i hasten to reply when i say i would not touch angelum with a barge pole i intend merely to convey that my feeling towards she be those of distant though cordial esteem in other word you may rest assure that between this young prune and myself there never have be and never could be any sentiment warmer and stronger than that of ordinary friendship i believe it be you who tip she off that i be in the larder last night so that she could find I there with that pie thus damaging my prestige my dear tuppy a wooster i be shock you think a wooster would do that he breathe heavily listen he say it be no good you standing there argue you can not get away from the fact somebody steal she from I at canne you tell I yourself that she be with you all the time at canne and hardly see anybody else you gloat over the mixed bathing and those moonlight walk you have together -- not gloat just mention they so now you understand why as soon as i can get you clear of this damned bench i be go to tear you limb from limb why they have these bally bench in garden say tuppy discontentedly be more than i can see they only get in the way he cease and grab out miss I by a hair 's breadth it be a moment for swift thinking and it be at such moment as i have already indicate that bertram wooster be at he best i suddenly remember the recent misunderstanding with the bassett and with a flash of clear vision see that this be where it be go to come in handy you have get it all wrong tuppy i say move to the left true i see a lot of angelum but my dealings with she be on a basis from start to finish of the purest and most wholesome camaraderie i can prove it during that sojourn in canne my affection be engage elsewhere what engage elsewhere my affection during that sojourn i have strike the right note he stop sidle he clutch hand fall to he side be that true quite official who be she my dear tuppy do one bandy a woman 's name one do if one do not want one 's ruddy head pull off i see that it be a special case madeline bassett i say who madeline bassett he seem stunned you stand there and tell I you be in love with that bassett disaster i would not call she ` that bassett disaster ' tuppy not respectful dash be respectful i want the fact you deliberately assert that you love that weird gawd-help-us i do not see why you should call she a weird gawd-help-us either a very charming and beautiful girl odd in some of she view perhaps -- one do not quite see eye to eye with she in the matter of star and rabbit -- but not a weird gawd-help-us anyway you stick to it that you be in love with she i do it sound thin to I wooster very thin i see that it would be necessary to apply the finish touch i must ask you to treat this as entirely confidential glossop but i may as well inform you that it be not twenty-four hour since she turn I down turn you down like a bedspread in this very garden twenty-four hour call it twenty-five so you will readily see that i can not be the chap if any who steal angelum from you at canne and i be on the brink of add that i would not touch angelum with a barge pole when i remembered i have say it already and it have not go frightfully well i desisted therefore my manly frankness seem to be produce good result the homicidal glare be die out of tuppy 's eye he have the aspect of a hire assassin who have pause to think thing over i see he say at length all right then sorry you be trouble do not mention it old man i respond courteously for the first time since the bush have begin to pour forth glossops bertram wooster could be say to have breathe freely i do not say i actually come out from behind the bench but i do let go of it and with something of the relief which those three chap in the old testament must have experience after slide out of the burning fiery furnace i even grope tentatively for my cigarette case the next moment a sudden snort make I take my finger off it as if it have bite I i be distressed to note in the old friend a return of the recent frenzy what the hell do you mean by tell she that i use to be cover with ink when i be a kid my dear tuppy -- i be almost finickingly careful about my personal cleanliness as a boy you could have eat you dinner off I quite but -- and all that stuff about have no soul i be crawl with soul and be look on as a outsider at the drone -- but my dear old chap i explain that it be all part of my ruse or scheme it be be it well in future do I a favor and leave I out of you foul ruse just as you say old boy all right then that be understand he relapse into silence standing with fold arm stare before he rather like a strong silent man in a novel when he be just be give the bird by the girl and be think of look in at the rocky mountain and bump off a few bear he manifest pippedness excite my compash and i venture a kindly word i do not suppose you know what _ au pied de la lettre _ mean tuppy but that be how i do not think you ought to take all that stuff angelum be say just now too much he seem interested what the devil he ask be you talk about i see that i should have to make myself clearer do not take all that guff of hers too literally old man you know what girl be like i do he say with another snort that come straight up from he instep and i wish i would never meet one i mean to say it be obvious that she must have spot you in those bush and be simply talk to score off you there you be i mean if you follow the psychology and she see you and in that impulsive way girl have she seize the opportunity of ribbing you a bit -- just tell you a few home truth i mean to say home truth that be right he snort once more cause I to feel rather like royalty receive a twenty-one gun salute from the fleet i can not remember ever have meet a better right-and-left-hand snorter what do you mean ` home truth ' i be not fat no no and what be wrong with the color of my hair quite in order tuppy old man the hair i mean and i be not a bit thin on the top what the dickens be you grin about not grin just smile slightly i be conjure up a sort of vision if you know what i mean of you as see through angelum 's eye fat in the middle and thin on the top rather funny you think it funny do you not a bit you would better not quite it seem to I that the conversation be become difficult again i wish it could be terminate and so it be for at this moment something come shimmering through the laurel in the quiet evenfall and i perceive that it be angelum she be look sweet and saintlike and she have a plate of sandwich in she hand ham i be to discover later if you see mr glossop anywhere bertie she say she eye rest dreamily on tuppy 's facade i wish you would give he these i be so afraid he may be hungry poor fellow it be nearly ten o'clock and he have not eat a morsel since dinner i 'll just leave they on this bench she push off and it seem to I that i might as well go with she nothing to keep I here i mean we move towards the house and presently from behind we there sound in the night the splinter crash of a well-kicked plate of ham sandwich accompany by the muffle oath of a strong man in he wrath how still and peaceful everything be say angelum -16 - sunshine be gilding the grounds of brinkley court and the ear detect a marked twittering of bird in the ivy outside the window when i wake next morning to a new day but there be no corresponding sunshine in bertram wooster 's soul and no answering twitter in he heart as he sit up in bed sip he cup of strengthen tea it could not be deny that to bertram review the happening of the previous night the tuppy-angelum situation seem more or less to have slip a cog with every desire to look for the silver lining i could not but feel that the rift between these two haughty spirit have now reach such impressive proportion that the task of bridge same would be beyond even my power i be a shrewd observer and there have be something in tuppy 's manner as he boot that plate of ham sandwich that seem to tell I that he would not lightly forgive in these circ i deem it best to shelve they problem for the nonce and turn the mind to the matter of gussie which present a brighter picture with regard to gussie everything be in train jeeve 's morbid scruple about lace the chap 's orange juice have put I to a good deal of trouble but i have surmount every obstacle in the old wooster way i have secure a abundance of the necessary spirit and it be now lie in its flask in the drawer of the dressing-table i have also ascertain that the jug duly fill would be stand on a shelf in the butler 's pantry round about the hour of one to remove it from that shelf sneak it up to my room and return it lace in good time for the midday meal would be a task call no doubt for address but in no sense a exact one it be with something of the emotion of one prepare a treat for a deserving child that i finish my tea and roll over for that extra spot of sleep which just make all the difference when there be man 's work to be do and the brain must be keep clear for it and when i come downstairs a hour or so later i know how right i have be to formulate this scheme for gussie 's buck up i run into he on the lawn and i could see at a glance that if ever there be a man who need a snappy stimulant it be he all nature as i have indicate be smile but not augustus fink-nottle he be walk round in circle mutter something about not propose to detain we long but on this auspicious occasion feeling compel to say a few word ah gussie i say arrest he as he be about to start another lap a lovely morning be it not even if i have not be aware of it already i could have divine from the abruptness with which he damned the lovely morning that he be not in merry mood i address myself to the task of bring the rose back to he cheek i have get good news for you gussie he look at I with a sudden sharp interest have market snodsbury grammar school burn down not that i know of have mumps break out be the place close on account of measles no no then what do you mean you have get good news i endeavor to soothe you must not take it so hard gussie why worry about a laughably simple job like distribute prize at a school laughably simple eh do you realize i have be sweating for day and have not be able to think of a thing to say yet except that i will not detain they long you bet i will not detain they long i have be time my speech and it last five seconds what the devil be i to say bertie what do you say when you be distribute prize i consider once at my private school i have win a prize for scripture knowledge so i suppose i ought to have be full of inside stuff but memory elude I then something emerge from the mist you say the race be not always to the swift why well it be a good gag it generally get a hand i mean why be not it why be not the race to the swift ah there you have I but the nib say it be not but what do it mean i take it it be suppose to console the chap who have not win prize what be the good of that to I i be not worry about they it be the one that have win prize that i be worry about the little blighter who will come up on the platform suppose they make face at I they will not how do you know they will not it be probably the first thing they 'll think of and even if they do not -- bertie shall i tell you something what i have a good mind to take that tip of yours and have a drink i smile he little know about sum up what i be think oh you 'll be all right i say he become fevered again how do you know i 'll be all right i be sure to blow up in my line tush or drop a prize tut or something i can feel it in my bone as sure as i be stand here something be go to happen this afternoon which will make everybody laugh themselves sick at I i can hear they now like hyena bertie hullo do you remember that kid ' school we go to before eton quite it be there i win my scripture prize never mind about you scripture prize i be not talk about you scripture prize do you recollect the bosher incident i do indeed it be one of the high spot of my youth major-general sir wilfr bosher come to distribute the prize at that school proceed gussie in a dull toneless voice he drop a book he stoop to pick it up and as he stoop he trousers split up the back how we roar gussie 's face twist we do little swine that we be instead of remain silent and exhibit a decent sympathy for a gallant officer at a peculiarly embarrassing moment we howl and yell with mirth i loudest of any that be what will happen to I this afternoon bertie it will be a judgment on I for laugh like that at major-general sir wilfred bosher no no gussie old man you trousers will not split how do you know they will not better man than i have split they trousers general bosher be a dso with a fine record of service on the north-western frontier of indium and he trousers split i shall be a mockery and a scorn i know it and you fully cognizant of what i be in for come babble about good news what news could possibly be good to I at this moment except the information that bubonic plague have break out among the scholar of market snodsbury grammar school and that they be all confine to they bed with spot the moment have come for I to speak i lay a hand gently on he shoulder he brush it off i lay it on again he brush it off once more i be endeavor to lay it on for the third time when he move aside and desire with a certain petulance to be inform if i think i be a ruddy osteopath i find he manner try but one have to make allowance i be tell myself that i should be see a very different gussie after lunch when i say i have good news old man i mean about madeline bassett the febrile gleam die out of he eye to be replace by a look of infinite sadness you can not have good news about she i have dish myself there completely not at all i be convince that if you take another whack at she all will be well and keep it snappy i related what have pass between the bassett and myself on the previous night so all you have to do be play a return date and you can not fail to swing the voting you be she dream man he shake he head no what no use what do you mean not a bit of good try but i tell you she say in so many word -- it do not make any difference she may have love I once last night will have kill all that of course it will not it will she despise I now not a bit of it she know you simply get cold foot and i should get cold foot if i try again it be no good bertie i be hopeless and there be a end of it fate make I the sort of chap who can not say ` bo ' to a goose it be not a question of say ` bo ' to a goose the point do not arise at all it be simply a matter of -- i know i know but it be no good i can not do it the whole thing be off i be not go to risk a repetition of last night 's fiasco you talk in a light way of take another whack at she but you do not know what it mean you have not be through the experience of start to ask the girl you love to marry you and then suddenly find yourself talk about the plumlike external gill of the newly-born newt it be not a thing you can do twice no i accept my destiny it be all over and now bertie like a good chap shove off i want to compose my speech i can not compose my speech with you muck around if you be go to continue to muck around at least give I a couple of story the little hell hound be sure to expect a story or two do you know the one about -- no good i do not want any of you off-colour stuff from the drone ' smoking-room i need something clean something that will be a help to they in they after life not that i care a damn about they after life except that i hope they 'll all choke i hear a story the other day i can not quite remember it but it be about a chap who snore and disturb the neighbor and it end ` it be he adenoids that adenoid they ' he make a weary gesture you expect I to work that in do you into a speech to be deliver to a audience of boy every one of whom be probably riddled with adenoids damn it they would rush the platform leave I bertie push off that be all i ask you to do push off lady and gentleman say gussie in a low soliloquize sort of way i do not propose to detain this auspicious occasion long -- it be a thoughtful wooster who walk away and leave he at it more than ever i be congratulating myself on have have the sterling good sense to make all my arrangement so that i could press a button and set thing move at a instant 's notice until now you see i have rather entertain a sort of hope that when i have reveal to he the bassett 's mental attitude nature would have do the rest brace he up to such a extent that artificial stimulant would not be require because naturally a chap do not want to have to sprint about country house lug jug of orange juice unless it be absolutely essential but now i see that i must carry on as plan the total absence of pep ginger and the right spirit which the man have display during these conversational exchange convince I that the strongest measure would be necessary immediately upon leave he therefore i proceed to the pantry wait till the butler have remove himself elsewhere and nip in and secure the vital jug a few moment later after a wary passage of the stair i be in my room and the first thing i see there be jeeve fool about with trousers he give the jug a look which -- wrongly as it be to turn out -- i diagnose as censorious i draw myself up a bit i intend to have no rot from the fellow yes jeeve sir you have the air of one about to make a remark jeeve oh no sir i note that you be in possession of mr fink-nottle 's orange juice i be merely about to observe that in my opinion it would be injudicious to add spirit to it that be a remark jeeve and it be precisely -- because i have already attend to the matter sir what yes sir i decide after all to acquiesce in you wish i stare at the man astounded i be deeply move well i mean would not any chap who have be go about think that the old feudal spirit be dead and then suddenly find it be not have be deeply move jeeve i say i be touch thank you sir touch and gratify thank you very much sir but what cause this change of heart i chance to encounter mr fink-nottle in the garden sir while you be still in bed and we have a brief conversation and you come away feel that he need a bracer very much so sir he attitude strike I as defeatist i nod i feel the same ` defeatist ' sum it up to a nicety do you tell he he attitude strike you as defeatist yes sir but it do not do any good no sir very well then jeeve we must act how much gin do you put in the jug a liberal tumblerful sir would that be a normal dose for a adult defeatist do you think i fancy it should prove adequate sir i wonder we must not spoil the ship for a ha ` porth of tar i think i 'll add just another fluid ounce or so i would not advocate it sir in the case of lord brancaster 's parrot -- you be fall into you old error jeeve of think that gussie be a parrot fight against this i shall add the oz very good sir and by the way jeeve mr fink-nottle be in the market for bright clean story to use in he speech do you know any i know a story about two irishman sir pat and mike yes sir who be walk along broadway yes sir just what he want any more no sir well every little help you have better go and tell it to he very good sir he pass from the room and i unscrew the flask and tilted into the jug a generous modicum of its contents and scarcely have i do so when there come to my ear the sound of footstep without i have only just time to shove the jug behind the photograph of uncle tom on the mantelpiece before the door open and in come gussie curveting like a circus horse what-ho bertie he say what-ho what-ho what-ho and again what-ho what a beautiful world this be bertie one of the nicest i ever meet i stare at he speechless we wooster be as quick as lightning and i see at once that something have happen i mean to say i tell you about he walk round in circle i record what pass between we on the lawn and if i portray the scene with anything like adequate skill the picture you will have retain of this fink-nottle will have be that of a nervous wreck sag at the knee green about the gill and pick feverishly at the lapel of he coat in a ecstasy of craven fear in a word defeatist gussie during that interview have in fine exhibit all the earmark of one lick to a custard vastly different be the gussie who stand before I now self-confidence seem to ooze from the fellow 's every pore he face be flush there be a jovial light in he eye the lip be part in a swashbuckling smile and when with a genial hand he slosh I on the back before i could sidestep it be as if i have be kick by a mule well bertie he proceed as blithely as a linnet without a thing on he mind you will be glad to hear that you be right you theory have be test and prove correct i feel like a fight cock my brain cease to reel i see all have you be have a drink i have as you advise unpleasant stuff like medicine burn you throat too and make one as thirsty as the dickens how anyone can mop it up as you do for pleasure beat I still i would be the last to deny that it tune up the system i could bite a tiger what do you have whisky at least that be the label on the decanter and i have no reason to suppose that a woman like you aunt -- staunch true-blue british -- would deliberately deceive the public if she label she decanter whisky then i consider that we know where we be a whisky and soda eh you could not have do better soda say gussie thoughtfully i know there be something i have forget do not you put any soda in it it never occur to I i just nip into the dining-room and drink out of the decanter how much oh about ten swallow twelve maybe or fourteen say sixteen medium-sized gulp gosh i be thirsty he move over to the wash-stand and drink deeply out of the water bottle i cast a covert glance at uncle tom 's photograph behind he back for the first time since it have come into my life i be glad that it be so large it hide its secret well if gussie have catch sight of that jug of orange juice he would unquestionably have be on to it like a knife well i be glad you be feel brace i say he move buoyantly from the wash-hand stand and endeavor to slosh I on the back again foiled by my nimble footwork he stagger to the bed and sit down upon it brace do i say i could bite a tiger you do make it two tiger i could chew hole in a steel door what a ass you must have think I out there in the garden i see now you be laugh in you sleeve no no yes insist gussie that very sleeve he say point and i do not blame you i can not imagine why i make all that fuss about a potty job like distribute prize at a rotten little country grammar school can you imagine bertie exactly nor can i imagine there be simply nothing to it i just shin up on the platform drop a few gracious word hand the little blighter they prize and hop down again admire by all not a suggestion of split trousers from start to finish i mean why should anybody split he trousers i can not imagine can you imagine no nor can i imagine i shall be a riot i know just the sort of stuff that be need -- simple manly optimistic stuff straight from the shoulder this shoulder say gussie tap why i be so nervous this morning i can not imagine for anything simpler than distribute a few footle book to a bunch of grimy-faced kid i can not imagine still for some reason i can not imagine i be feel a little nervous but now i feel fine bertie -- fine fine fine -- and i say this to you as a old friend because that be what you be old man when all the smoke have clear away -- a old friend i do not think i have ever meet a older friend how long have you be a old friend of mine bertie oh year and year imagine though of course there must have be a time when you be a new friend hullo the luncheon gong come on old friend and rise from the bed like a perform flea he make for the door i follow rather pensively what have occur be of course so much velvet as you might say i mean i have want a brace fink-nottle -- indeed all my plan have have a brace fink-nottle as they end and aim -- but i find myself wonder a little whether the fink-nottle now slide down the banister be not perhaps a shade too brace he demeanor seem to I that of a man who might quite easily throw bread about at lunch fortunately however the settle gloom of those round he exercise a restrain effect upon he at the table it would have need a far more plastered man to have be rollick at such a gathering i have tell the bassett that there be ache heart in brinkley court and it now look probable that there would shortly be ache tummy anatole i learn have retire to he bed with a fit of the vapor and the meal now before we have be cook by the kitchen maid -- as c3 a performer as ever wield a skillet this come on top of they other trouble induce in the company a pretty unanimous silence -- a solemn stillness as you might say -- which even gussie do not seem prepared to break except therefore for one short snatch of song on he part nothing untoward mark the occasion and presently we rise with instruction from aunt dahlia to put on festal raiment and be at market snodsbury not later than 330 this leave I ample time to smoke a gasper or two in a shady bower beside the lake i do so repair to my room round about the hour of three jeeve be on the job add the final polish to the old topper and i be about to apprise he of the latest development in the matter of gussie when he forestall I by observe that the latter have only just conclude a agreeable visit to the wooster bedchamber i find mr fink-nottle seat here when i arrive to lay out you clothes sir indeed jeeve gussie be in here be he yes sir he leave only a few moment ago he be drive to the school with mr and mr traver in the large car do you give he you story of the two irishman yes sir he laugh heartily good have you any other contribution for he i venture to suggest that he might mention to the young gentleman that education be a draw out not a put in the late lord brancaster be much addict to present prize at school and he invariably employ this dictum and how do he react to that he laugh heartily sir this surprised you no doubt this practically incessant merriment i mean yes sir you think it odd in one who when you last see he be well up in group a of the defeatist yes sir there be a ready explanation jeeve since you last see he gussie have be on a bender he be as tight as a owl indeed sir absolutely he nerve crack under the strain and he sneak into the dining-room and start mop the stuff up like a vacuum cleaner whisky would seem to be what he fill the radiator with i gather that he use up most of the decanter golly jeeve it be lucky he do not get at that lace orange juice on top of that what extremely sir i eye the jug uncle tom 's photograph have fall into the fender and it be stand there right out in the open where gussie could not have help see it mercifully it be empty now it be a most prudent act on you part if i may say so sir to dispose of the orange juice i stare at the man what do not you no sir jeeve let we get this clear be it not you who throw away that oj no sir i assume when i enter the room and find the pitcher empty that you have do so we look at each other awed two mind with but a single thought i very much fear sir -- so do i jeeve it would seem almost certain -- quite certain weigh the fact sift the evidence the jug be stand on the mantelpiece for all eye to behold gussie have be complain of thirst you find he in here laugh heartily i think that there can be little doubt jeeve that the entire contents of that jug be at this moment repose on top of the exist cargo in that already brilliantly light man 's interior disturbing jeeve most disturbing sir let we face the position force ourselves to be calm you insert in that jug -- shall we say a tumblerful of the right stuff fully a tumblerful sir and i add of my plenty about the same amount yes sir and in two shake of a duck 's tail gussie with all that lap about inside he will be distribute the prize at market snodsbury grammar school before a audience of all that be fairest and most refine in the county yes sir it seem to I jeeve that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest yes sir what in you opinion will the harvest be one find it difficult to hazard a conjecture sir you mean imagination boggle yes sir i inspect my imagination he be right it boggle -17 - and yet jeeve i say twiddle a thoughtful steering wheel there be always the bright side some twenty minute have elapse and have pick the honest fellow up outside the front door i be drive in the two-seater to the picturesque town of market snodsbury since we have part -- he to go to he lair and fetch he hat i to remain in my room and complete the formal costume -- i have be do some close think the result of this i now proceed to hand on to he however dark the prospect may be jeeve however murkily the storm cloud may seem to gather a keen eye can usually discern the blue bird it be bad no doubt that gussie should be go some ten minute from now to distribute prize in a state of advanced intoxication but we must never forget that these thing cut both way you imply sir -- precisely i be thinking of he in he capacity of wooer all this ought to have put he in rare shape for offer he hand in marriage i shall be vastly surprise if it will not turn he into a sort of caveman have you ever see jame cagney in the movie yes sir something on those line i hear he cough and snipe he with a sideways glance he be wear that informative look of he then you have not hear sir eh you be not aware that a marriage have be arrange and will shortly take place between mr fink-nottle and miss bassett what yes sir when do this happen shortly after mr fink-nottle have leave you room sir ah in the post-orange-juice era yes sir but be you sure of you fact how do you know my informant be mr fink-nottle himself sir he appear anxious to confide in I he story be somewhat incoherent but i have no difficulty in apprehend its substance preface he remark with the statement that this be a beautiful world he laugh heartily and say that he have become formally engage no detail no sir but one can picture the scene yes sir i mean imagination do not boggle no sir and it do not i could see exactly what must have happen insert a liberal dose of mixed spirit in a normally abstemious man and he become a force he do not stand around twiddle he finger and stammer he act i have no doubt that gussie must have reach for the bassett and clasp she to he like a stevedore handle a sack of coal and one could readily envisage the effect of that sort of thing on a girl of romantic mind well well well jeeve yes sir this be splendid news yes sir you see now how right i be yes sir it must have be rather a eye-opener for you watch I handle this case yes sir the simple direct method never fail no sir whereas the elaborate do yes sir right ho jeeve we have arrive at the main entrance of market snodsbury grammar school i park the car and go in well content true the tuppy-angelum problem still remain unsolved and aunt dahlia 's five hundred quid seem as far off as ever but it be gratify to feel that good old gussie 's trouble be over at any rate the grammar school at market snodsbury have i understand be build somewhere in the year 1416 and as with so many of these ancient foundation there still seem to brood over its great hall where the afternoon 's festivity be to take place not a little of the fug of the century it be the hottest day of the summer and though somebody have open a tentative window or two the atmosphere remain distinctive and individual in this hall the youth of market snodsbury have be eat its daily lunch for a matter of five hundred year and the flavor linger the air be sort of heavy and languorous if you know what i mean with the scent of young england and boil beef and carrot aunt dahlia who be sit with a bevy of the local nib in the second row sight I as i enter and wave to I to join she but i be too smart for that i wedge myself in among the standee at the back lean up against a chap who from the aroma might have be a corn chandler or something on that order the essence of strategy on these occasion be to be as near the door as possible the hall be gaily decorate with flag and color paper and the eye be further refresh by the spectacle of a mixed drive of boy parent and what not the former run a good deal to shiny face and eton collar the latter stress the black-satin note rather when female and look as if they coat be too tight if male and presently there be some applause -- sporadic jeeve have since tell I it be -- and i see gussie be steer by a bearded bloke in a gown to a seat in the middle of the platform and i confess that as i beheld he and feel that there but for the grace of god go bertram wooster a shudder run through the frame it all remind I so vividly of the time i have address that girl ' school of course look at it dispassionately you may say that for horror and peril there be no comparison between a almost human audience like the one before I and a mob of small girl with pigtail down they back and this i concede be true nevertheless the spectacle be enough to make I feel like a fellow watch a pal go over niagara fall in a barrel and the thought of what i have escape cause everything for a moment to go black and swim before my eye when i be able to see clearly once more i perceive that gussie be now seat he have he hand on he knee with he elbow out at right angle like a nigger minstrel of the old school about to ask mr bone why a chicken cross the road and he be stare before he with a smile so fixed and pebble-beached that i should have think that anybody could have guess that there sit one in whom the old familiar juice be plash up against the back of the front tooth in fact i see aunt dahlia who have assist at so many hunting dinner in she time be second to none as a judge of the symptom give a start and gaze long and earnestly and she be just say something to uncle tom on she leave when the bearded bloke step to the footlights and start make a speech from the fact that he speak as if he have a hot potato in he mouth without get the raspberry from the lad in the ringside seat i deduce that he must be the head master with he arrival in the spotlight a sort of perspire resignation seem to settle on the audience personally i snuggle up against the chandler and let my attention wander the speech be on the subject of the doings of the school during the past term and this part of a prize-giving be always apt rather to fail to grip the visit stranger i mean you know how it be you be tell that jb brewster have win a exhibition for classic at cat 's cambridge and you feel that it be one of those story where you can not see how funny it be unless you really know the fellow and the same apply to g bullett be award the lady jane wix scholarship at the birmingham college of veterinary science in fact i and the corn chandler who be look a bit fagged i think as if he have have a hard morning chandle the corn be begin to doze lightly when thing suddenly brisk up bring gussie into the picture for the first time today say the bearded bloke we be all happy to welcome as the guest of the afternoon mr fitz-wattle -- at the beginning of the address gussie have subside into a sort of daydream with he mouth hang open about half-way through faint sign of life have begin to show and for the last few minute he have be try to cross one leg over the other and fail and have another shot and fail again but only now do he exhibit any real animation he sit up with a jerk fink-nottle he say open he eye fitz-nottle fink-nottle i should say fink-nottle of course you should you silly ass say gussie genially all right get on with it and close he eye he begin try to cross he leg again i could see that this little spot of friction have rattle the bearded bloke a bit he stand for a moment fumble at the fungus with a hesitate hand but they make these head master of tough stuff the weakness pass he come back nicely and carry on we be all happy i say to welcome as the guest of the afternoon mr fink-nottle who have kindly consent to award the prize this task as you know be one that should have devolve upon that well-beloved and vigorous member of we board of governor the rev william plomer and we be all i be sure very sorry that illness at the last moment should have prevent he from be here today but if i may borrow a familiar metaphor from the -- if i may employ a homely metaphor familiar to you all -- what we lose on the swing we gain on the roundabout he pause and beam rather freely to show that this be comedy i could have tell the man it be no use not a ripple the corn chandler lean against I and mutter whoddidesay but that be all it be always a nasty jar to wait for the laugh and find that the gag have not get across the bearded bloke be visibly discompose at that however i think he would have get by have he not at this juncture unfortunately stir gussie up again in other word though deprive of mr plomer we have with we this afternoon mr fink-nottle i be sure that mr fink-nottle 's name be one that need no introduction to you it be i venture to assert a name that be familiar to we all not to you say gussie and the next moment i see what jeeve have mean when he have describe he as laugh heartily heartily be absolutely the _ mot juste _ it sound like a gas explosion you do not seem to know it so dash well what what say gussie and remind apparently by the word what of the word wattle he repeat the latter some sixteen time with a rise inflection wattle wattle wattle he conclude right-ho push on but the bearded bloke have shoot he bolt he stand there lick at last and watch he closely i could see that he be now at the crossroads i could spot what he be think as clearly as if he have confide it to my personal ear he want to sit down and call it a day i mean but the thought that give he pause be that if he do he must then either uncork gussie or take the fink-nottle speech as read and get straight on to the actual prize-giving it be a dash tricky thing of course to have to decide on the spur of the moment i be read in the paper the other day about those bird who be try to split the atom the nub be that they have not the foggiest as to what will happen if they do it may be all right on the other hand it may not be all right and pretty silly a chap would feel no doubt if have split the atom he suddenly find the house go up in smoke and himself tear limb from limb so with the bearded bloke whether he be abreast of the inside fact in gussie 's case i do not know but it be obvious to he by this time that he have run into something pretty hot trial gallop have show that gussie have he own way of do thing those interruption have be enough to prove to the perspicacious that here seat on the platform at the big binge of the season be one who if push forward to make a speech might let himself go in a rather epoch-making manner on the other hand chain he up and put a green-baize cloth over he and where be you the proceeding would be over about half a hour too soon it be as i say a difficult problem to have to solve and leave to himself i do not know what conclusion he would have come to personally i think he would have play it safe as it happen however the thing be take out of he hand for at this moment gussie have stretch he arm and yawn a bit switch on that pebble-beached smile again and tack down to the edge of the platform speech he say affably he then stand with he thumb in the armhole of he waistcoat wait for the applause to die down it be some time before this happen for he have get a very fine hand indeed i suppose it be not often that the boy of market snodsbury grammar school come across a man public-spirited enough to call they head master a silly ass and they show they appreciation in no uncertain manner gussie may have be one over the eight but as far as the majority of those present be concern he be sit on top of the world boy say gussie i mean lady and gentleman and boy i do not detain you long but i suppose on this occasion to feel compel to say a few auspicious word lady -- and boy and gentleman -- we have all listen with interest to the remark of we friend here who forget to shave this morning -- i do not know he name but then he do not know mine -- fitz-wattle i mean absolutely absurd -- which square thing up a bit -- and we be all sorry that the reverend what-ever-he-was-called should be die of adenoids but after all here today go tomorrow and all flesh be as grass and what not but that be not what i want to say what i want to say be this -- and i say it confidently -- without fear of contradiction -- i say in short i be happy to be here on this auspicious occasion and i take much pleasure in kindly award the prize consist of the handsome book you see lay out on that table as shakespeare say there be sermon in book stone in the run brook or rather the other way about and there you have it in a nutshell it go well and i be not surprised i could not quite follow some of it but anybody could see that it be real ripe stuff and i be amaze that even the course of treatment he have be take could have render so normally tongue-tie a dumb brick as gussie capable of it it just show what any member of parliament will tell you that if you want real oratory the preliminary noggin be essential unless pie-eyed you can not hope to grip gentleman say gussie i mean lady and gentleman and of course boy what a beautiful world this be a beautiful world full of happiness on every side let I tell you a little story two irishman pat and mike be walk along broadway and one say to the other ` begorrah the race be not always to the swift ' and the other reply ` faith and begob education be a draw out not a put in ' i must say it seem to I the rottenest story i have ever hear and i be surprise that jeeve should have consider it worth while shove into a speech however when i tax he with this later he say that gussie have alter the plot a good deal and i dare say that account for it at any rate that be the _ conte _ as gussie tell it and when i say that it get a very fair laugh you will understand what a popular favorite he have become with the multitude there might be a bearded bloke or so on the platform and a small section in the second row who be wish the speaker would conclude he remark and resume he seat but the audience as a whole be for he solidly there be applause and a voice cry : hear hear yes say gussie it be a beautiful world the sky be blue the bird be sing there be optimism everywhere and why not boy and lady and gentleman i be happy you be happy we be all happy even the meanest irishman that walk along broadway though as i say there be two of they -- pat and mike one draw out the other put in i should like you boy take the time from I to give three cheer for this beautiful world all together now presently the dust settle down and the plaster stop fall from the ceiling and he go on people who say it be not a beautiful world do not know what they be talk about drive here in the car today to award the kind prize i be reluctantly compel to tick off my host on this very point old tom traver you will see he sit there in the second row next to the large lady in beige he point helpfully and the hundred or so market snods-buryian who crane they neck in the direction indicate be able to observe uncle tom blush prettily i tick he off properly the poor fish he express the opinion that the world be in a deplorable state i say ` do not talk rot old tom traver ' ' i be not accustom to talk rot ' he say ` then for a beginner ' i say ` you do it dash well ' and i think you will admit boy and lady and gentleman that that be tell he the audience seem to agree with he the point go big the voice that have say hear hear say hear hear again and my corn chandler hammer the floor vigorously with a large-size walking stick well boy resume gussie have shoot he cuff and smirk horribly this be the end of the summer term and many of you no doubt be leave the school and i do not blame you because there be a frost in here you could cut with a knife you be go out into the great world soon many of you will be walk along broadway and what i want to impress upon you be that however much you may suffer from adenoids you must all use every effort to prevent yourselve become pessimist and talk rot like old tom traver there in the second row the fellow with a face rather like a walnut he pause to allow those wish to do so to refresh themselves with another look at uncle tom and i find myself muse in some little perplexity long association with the member of the drone have put I pretty well in touch with the various way in which a overdose of the blushful hippocrene can take the individual but i have never see anyone react quite as gussie be do there be a snap about he work which i have never witness before even in barmy fotheringay-phipp on new year 's eve jeeve when i discuss the matter with he later say it be something to do with inhibition if i catch the word correctly and the suppression of i think he say the ego what he mean i gather be that owe to the fact that gussie have just complete a five year ' stretch of blameless seclusion among the newt all the goofiness which ought to have be spread out thin over those five year and have be bottle up during that period come to the surface on this occasion in a lump -- or if you prefer to put it that way like a tidal wave there may be something in this jeeve generally know anyway be that as it may i be dash glad i have have the shrewdness to keep out of that second row it might be unworthy of the prestige of a wooster to squash in among the proletariat in the standing-room-only section but at least i feel i be out of the danger zone so thoroughly have gussie get it up he nose by now that it seem to I that have he sight I he might have become personal about even a old school friend if there be one thing in the world i can not stand proceed gussie it be a pessimist be optimist boy you all know the difference between a optimist and a pessimist a optimist be a man who -- well take the case of two irishman walk along broadway one be a optimist and one be a pessimist just as one 's name be pat and the other 's mike why hullo bertie i do not know you be here too late i endeavor to go to earth behind the chandler only to discover that there be no chandler there some appointment suddenly remember -- possibly a promise to he wife that he would be home to tea -- have cause he to ooze away while my attention be elsewhere leave I right out in the open between I and gussie who be now point in a offensive manner there be nothing but a sea of interested face look up at I now there boom gussie continue to point be a instance of what i mean boy and lady and gentleman take a good look at that object stand up there at the back -- morning coat trousers as worn quiet gray tie and carnation in buttonhole -- you can not miss he bertie wooster that be and as foul a pessimist as ever bite a tiger i tell you i despise that man and why do i despise he because boy and lady and gentleman he be a pessimist he attitude be defeatist when i tell he i be go to address you this afternoon he try to dissuade I and do you know why he try to dissuade I because he say my trousers would split up the back the cheer that greet this be the loudest yet anything about splitting trousers go straight to the simple heart of the young scholar of market snodsbury grammar school two in the row in front of I turn purple and a small lad with freckle seat beside they ask I for my autograph let I tell you a story about bertie wooster a wooster can stand a good deal but he can not stand have he name bandy in a public place pick my foot up softly i be in the very process of execute a quiet sneak for the door when i perceive that the bearded bloke have at last decide to apply the closure why he have not do so before be beyond I spell-bound i take it and of course when a chap be go like a breeze with the public as gussie have be it be not so dash easy to chip in however the prospect of hear another of gussie 's anecdote seem to have do the trick rise rather as i have rise from my bench at the beginning of that painful scene with tuppy in the twilight he make a leap for the table snatch up a book and come bear down on the speaker he touch gussie on the arm and gussie turn sharply and see a large bloke with a beard apparently about to bean he with a book spring back in a attitude of self-defence perhaps as time be get on mr fink-nottle we have better -- oh ah say gussie get the trend he relax the prize eh of course yes right-ho yes might as well be shove along with it what be this one spelling and dictation -- pk purvi announce the bearded bloke spelling and dictation -- pk purvi echo gussie as if he be call coal forward pk purvi now that the whistle have be blow on he speech it seem to I that there be no longer any need for the strategic retreat which i have be plan i have no wish to tear myself away unless i have to i mean i have tell jeeve that this binge would be fraught with interest and it be fraught with interest there be a fascination about gussie 's method which grip and make one reluctant to pass the thing up provide personal innuendo be steer clear of i decide accordingly to remain and presently there be a musical squeak and pk purvi climb the platform the spelling-and-dictation champ be about three foot six in he squeak shoe with a pink face and sandy hair gussie pat he hair he seem to have take a immediate fancy to the lad you pk purvi sir yes sir it be a beautiful world pk purvi sir yes sir ah you have notice it have you good you marry by any chance sir no sir get marry pk purvi say gussie earnestly it be the only life well here 's you book look rather bilge to I from a glance at the title page but such as it be here you be pk purvi squeak off amidst sporadic applause but one could not fail to note that the sporadic be follow by a rather strained silence it be evident that gussie be striking something of a new note in market snodsbury scholastic circle look be exchange between parent and parent the bearded bloke have the air of one who have drain the bitter cup as for aunt dahlia she demeanor now tell only too clearly that she last doubt have be resolve and she verdict be in i see she whisper to the bassett who sit on she right and the bassett nod sadly and look like a fairy about to shed a tear and add another star to the milky way gussie after the departure of pk purvi have fall into a sort of daydream and be stand with he mouth open and he hand in he pocket become abruptly aware that a fat kid in knickerbockers be at he elbow he start violently hullo he say visibly shake who be you this say the bearded bloke be rv smethurst what be he do here ask gussie suspiciously you be present he with the draw prize mr fink-nottle this apparently strike gussie as a reasonable explanation he face clear that be right too he say well here it be cocky you off he say as the kid prepare to withdraw sir yes sir wait rv smethurst not so fast before you go there be a question i wish to ask you but the beard bloke 's aim now seem to be to rush the ceremony a bit he hustle rv smethurst off stage rather like a chucker-out in a pub regretfully eject a old and respected customer and start paging gg simmon a moment later the latter be up and come and conceive my emotion when it be announce that the subject on which he have click be scripture knowledge one of we i mean to say gg simmon be a unpleasant perky-looking stripling mostly front tooth and spectacles but i give he a big hand we scripture-knowledge shark stick together gussie i be sorry to see do not like he there be in he manner as he regard gg simmon none of the chumminess which have mark it during he interview with pk purvi or in a somewhat lesser degree with rv smethurst he be cold and distant well gg simmon sir yes sir what do you mean -- sir yes sir dash silly thing to say so you have win the scripture-knowledge prize have you sir yes sir yes say gussie you look just the sort of little tick who would and yet he say pause and eye the child keenly how be we to know that this have all be open and above board let I test you gg simmon what be what be - his-name -- the chap who beget thingummy can you answer I that simmon sir no sir gussie turn to the bearded bloke fishy he say very fishy this boy appear to be totally lack in scripture knowledge the bearded bloke pass a hand across he forehead i can assure you mr fink-nottle that every care be take to ensure a correct mark and that simmon outdistance he competitor by a wide margin well if you say so say gussie doubtfully all right gg simmon take you prize sir thank you sir but let I tell you that there be nothing to stick on side about in win a prize for scripture knowledge bertie wooster -- i do not know when i have have a nastier shock i have be go on the assumption that now that they have stop he make he speech gussie 's fang have be draw as you might say to duck my head down and resume my edge toward the door be with I the work of a moment bertie wooster win the scripture-knowledge prize at a kid ' school we be at together and you know what he be like but of course bertie frankly cheat he succeed in scrounge that scripture-knowledge trophy over the head of better man by means of some of the rawest and most brazen swindle method ever witness even at a school where such thing be common if that man 's pocket as he enter the examination-room be not stuff to bursting-point with list of the king of judah -- i hear no more a moment later i be out in god 's air fumble with a fevered foot at the self-starter of the old car the engine race the clutch slide into position i toot and drive off my ganglion be still vibrate as i run the car into the stable of brinkley court and it be a much shake bertram who totter up to he room to change into something loose have don flannel i lay down on the bed for a bit and i suppose i must have doze off for the next thing i remember be find jeeve at my side i sit up my tea jeeve no sir it be nearly dinner-time the mist clear away i must have be asleep yes sir nature take its toll of the exhaust frame yes sir and enough to make it yes sir and now it be nearly dinner-time you say all right i be in no mood for dinner but i suppose you have better lay out the clothes it will not be necessary sir the company will not be dress tonight a cold collation have be set out in the dining-room why 's that it be mrs traver 's wish that this should be do in order to minimize the work for the staff who be attend a dance at sir percival stretchley-budd 's residence tonight of course yes i remember my cousin angelum tell I tonight 's the night what you go jeeve no sir i be not very fond of this form of entertainment in the rural district sir i know what you mean these country binge be all the same a piano one fiddle and a floor like sandpaper be anatole go angelum hint not miss angelum be correct sir monsieur anatole be in bed temperamental blighter these frenchman yes sir there be a pause well jeeve i say it be certainly one of those afternoon what yes sir i can not recall one more packed with incident and i leave before the finish yes sir i observe you departure you could not blame I for withdraw no sir mr fink-nottle have undoubtedly become embarrassingly personal be there much more of it after i go no sir the proceedings terminate very shortly mr fink-nottle 's remark with reference to master gg simmon bring about a early closure but he have finish he remark about gg simmon only temporarily sir he resume they immediately after you departure if you recollect sir he have already proclaimed himself suspicious of master simmon 's bona fide and he now proceed to deliver a violent verbal attack upon the young gentleman assert that it be impossible for he to have win the scripture-knowledge prize without systematic cheating on a impressive scale he go so far as to suggest that master simmon be well know to the police golly jeeve yes sir the word do create a considerable sensation the reaction of those present to this accusation i should describe as mixed the young student appear pleased and applaud vigorously but master simmon 's mother rise from she seat and address mr fink-nottle in term of strong protest do gussie seem take aback do he recede from he position no sir he say that he could see it all now and hint at a guilty liaison between master simmon 's mother and the head master accuse the latter of have cook the mark as he expression be in order to gain favor with the former you do not mean that yes sir egad jeeve and then -- they sing the national anthem sir surely not yes sir at a moment like that yes sir well you be there and you know of course but i should have think the last thing gussie and this woman would have do in the circ would have be to start singing duet you misunderstand I sir it be the entire company who sing the head master turn to the organist and say something to he in a low tone upon which the latter begin to play the national anthem and the proceedings terminate i see about time too yes sir mr simmon 's attitude have become unquestionably menacing i ponder what i have hear be of course of a nature to excite pity and terror not to mention alarm and despondency and it would be palter with the truth to say that i be pleased about it on the other hand it be all over now and it seem to I that the thing to do be not to mourn over the past but to fix the mind on the bright future i mean to say gussie might have lower the exist worcestershire record for goofiness and definitely forfeit all chance of become market snodsbury 's favorite son but you could not get away from the fact that he have propose to madeline bassett and you have to admit that she have accept he i put this to jeeve a frightful exhibition i say and one which will very possibly ring down history 's page but we must not forget jeeve that gussie though now doubtless look upon in the neighborhood as the world 's worst freak be all right otherwise no sir i do not get quite this when you say ` no sir ' do you mean ` yes sir ' no sir i mean ` no sir ' he be not all right otherwise no sir but he be betroth no longer sir miss bassett have sever the engagement you do not mean that yes sir i wonder if you have notice a rather peculiar thing about this chronicle i allude to the fact that at one time or another practically everybody play a part in it have have occasion to bury he or she face in he or she hand i have participate in some pretty glutinous affair in my time but i think that never before or since have i be mix up with such a solid body of brow clutcher uncle tom do it if you remember so do gussie so do tuppy so probably though i have no datum do anatole and i would not put it past the bassett and aunt dahlia i have no doubt would have do it too but for the risk of disarrange the carefully fix coiffure well what i be try to say be that at this juncture i do it myself up go the hand and down go the head and in another jiffy i be clutch as energetically as the best of they and it be while i be still massage the coconut and wonder what the next move be that something barge up against the door like the delivery of a ton of coal i think this may very possibly be mr fink-nottle himself sir say jeeve he intuition however have lead he astray it be not gussie but tuppy he come in and stand breathing asthmatically it be plain that he be deeply stir -18 - i eyed he narrowly i do not like he look mark you i do not say i ever have much because nature when plan this sterling fellow shove in a lot more lower jaw than be absolutely necessary and make the eye a bit too keen and pierce for one who be neither a empire builder nor a traffic policeman but on the present occasion in addition to offend the aesthetic sense this glossop seem to I to be wear a distinct air of menace and i find myself wish that jeeve be not always so dash tactful i mean it be all very well to remove yourself like a eel slide into mud when the employer have a visitor but there be moment -- and it look to I as if this be go to be one of they -- when the truer tact be to stick round and stand ready to lend a hand in the free-for-all for jeeve be no longer with we i have not see he go and i have not hear he go but he have go as far as the eye could reach one note nobody but tuppy and in tuppy 's demeanor as i say there be a certain something that tend to disquiet he look to I very much like a man who have come to reopen that matter of my tickle angelum 's ankle however he opening remark tell I that i have be alarming myself unduly it be of a pacific nature and come as a great relief bertie he say i owe you a apology i have come to make it my relief on hear these word contain as they do no reference of any sort to tickled ankle be as i say great but i do not think it be any greater than my surprise month have pass since that painful episode at the drone and until now he have not give a sign of remorse and contrition indeed word have reach I through private source that he frequently tell the story at dinner and other gathering and when do so laugh he silly head off i find it hard to understand accordingly what could have cause he to abase himself at this later date presumably he have be give the elbow by he better self but why still there it be my dear chap i say gentlemanly to the gill do not mention it what be the sense of say ` do not mention it ' i have mention it i mean do not mention it any more do not give the matter another thought we all of we forget ourselves sometimes and do thing which in we calmer moment we regret no doubt you be a bit tight at the time what the devil do you think you be talk about i do not like he tone brusque correct I if i be wrong i say with a certain stiffness but i assume that you be apologize for you foul conduct in loop back the last ring that night in the drone cause I to plunge into the swimming b in the full soup and fish ass not that at all then what this bassett business what bassett business bertie say tuppy when you tell I last night that you be in love with madeline bassett i give you the impression that i believe you but i do not the thing seem too incredible however since then i have make inquiry and the fact appear to square with you statement i have now come to apologize for doubt you make inquiry i ask she if you have propose to she and she say yes you have tuppy you do not i do have you no delicacy no proper feeling no oh well right-ho of course but i think you ought to have delicacy be dash i want to be certain that it be not you who steal angelum from I i now know it be not so long as he know that i do not so much mind he have no delicacy ah i say well that be fine hold that think i have find out who it be what he stand brood for a moment he eye be smoulder with a dull fire he jaw stick out like the back of jeeve 's head bertie he say do you remember what i swear i would do to the chap who steal angelum from I as nearly as i recall you plan to pull he inside out -- -- and make he swallow himself correct the program still hold good but tuppy i keep assure you as a competent eyewitness that nobody snitch angelum from you during that canne trip no but they do after she get back what do not keep say ` what ' you hear but she have not see anybody since she get back oh no how about that newt bloke gussie precisely the serpent fink-nottle this seem to I absolute gibbering but gussie love the bassett you can not all love this blighted bassett what astonish I be that anyone can do it he love angelum i tell you and she love he but angelum handed you you hat before gussie ever get here no she do not couple of hour after he could not have fall in love with she in a couple of hour why not i fall in love with she in a couple of minute i worship she immediately we meet the popeyed little excrescence but dash it -- do not argue bertie the fact be all docket she love this newt-nuzzling blister quite absurd laddie -- quite absurd oh he grind a heel into the carpet -- a thing i have often read about but have never see do before then perhaps you will explain how it be that she happen to come to be engage to he you could have knock I down with a f engage to he she tell I herself she be kid you she be not kid I shortly after the conclusion of this afternoon 's binge at market snodsbury grammar school he ask she to marry he and she appear to have right-hoed without a murmur there must be some mistake there be the snake fink-nottle make it and by now i bet he realize it i have be chase he since 530 chase he all over the place i want to pull he head off i see quite you have not see he by any chance no well if you do say goodbye to he quickly and put in you order for lily oh jeeve sir i have not hear the door open but the man be on the spot once more my private belief as i think i have mention before be that jeeve do not have to open door he be like one of those bird in indium who bung they astral body about -- the chap i mean who have go into thin air in bombay reassemble the part and appear two minute later in calcutta only some such theory will account for the fact that he be not there one moment and be there the next he just seem to float from spot a to spot b like some form of gas have you see mr fink-nottle jeeve no sir i be go to murder he very good sir tuppy withdraw bang the door behind he and i put jeeve abreast jeeve i say do you know what mr fink-nottle be engage to my cousin angelum indeed sir well how about it do you grasp the psychology do it make sense only a few hour ago he be engage to miss bassett gentleman who have be discard by one young lady be often apt to attach themselves without delay to another sir it be what be know as a gesture i begin to grasp i see what you mean defiant stuff yes sir a sort of ` oh right-ho please yourself but if you do not want I there be plenty who do ' precisely sir my cousin george -- never mind about you cousin george jeeve very good sir keep he for the long winter evening what just as you wish sir and anyway i bet you cousin george be not a shrink non-goose-bo-ing jellyfish like gussie that be what astound I jeeve -- that it should be gussie who have be put in all this heavy gesture-making stuff you must remember sir that mr fink-nottle be in a somewhat inflamed cerebral condition that be true a bit above par at the moment as it be exactly sir well i 'll tell you one thing -- he 'll be in a jolly sight more inflamed cerebral condition if tuppy get hold of he what be the time just on eight o'clock sir then tuppy have be chase he for two hour and a half we must save the unfortunate blighter jeeve yes sir a human life be a human life what exceedingly true sir the first thing then be to find he after that we can discuss plan and scheme go forth jeeve and scour the neighborhood it will not be necessary sir if you will glance behind you you will see mr fink-nottle come out from beneath you bed and by jove he be absolutely right there be gussie emerge as state he be cover with fluff and look like a tortoise pop forth for a bit of a breather gussie i say jeeve say gussie sir say jeeve be that door lock jeeve no sir but i will attend to the matter immediately gussie sit down on the bed and i think for a moment that he be go to be in the mode by bury he face in he hand however he merely brush a dead spider from he brow have you lock the door jeeve yes sir because you can never tell that that ghastly glossop may not take it into he head to come -- the word back freeze on he lip he have not get any further than a _ b _ - ish sound when the handle of the door begin to twist and rattle he spring from the bed and for a instant stand look exactly like a picture my aunt agatha have in she dining-room -- the stag at bay -- landseer then he make a dive for the cupboard and be inside it before one really get on to it that he have start leap i have see fellow late for the 915 move less nippily i shoot a glance at jeeve he allow he right eyebrow to flicker slightly which be as near as he ever get to a display of the emotion hullo i yip let I in blast you respond tuppy 's voice from without who lock this door i consult jeeve once more in the language of the eyebrow he raise one of he i raise one of mine he raise he other i raise my other then we both raise both finally there seem no other policy to pursue i flung wide the gate and tuppy come shooting in now what i say as nonchalantly as i could manage why be the door lock demand tuppy i be in pretty good eyebrow-raising form by now so i give he a touch of it be one to have no privacy glossop i say coldly i instruct jeeve to lock the door because i be about to disrobe a likely story say tuppy and i be not sure he do not add forsooth you need not try to make I believe that you be afraid people be go to run excursion train to see you in you underwear you lock that door because you have get the snake fink-nottle conceal in here i suspect it the moment i would leave and i decide to come back and investigate i be go to search this room from end to end i believe he be in that cupboard what be in this cupboard just clothes i say have another stab at the nonchalant though extremely dubious as to whether it would come off the usual wardrobe of the english gentleman pay a country-house visit you be lie well i would not have be if he have only wait a minute before speak because the word be hardly out of he mouth before gussie be out of the cupboard i have comment on the speed with which he have go in it be as nothing to the speed with which he emerge there be a sort of whir and blur and he be no longer with we i think tuppy be surprise in fact i be sure he be despite the confidence with which he have state he view that the cupboard contain fink-nottle it plainly disconcert he to have the chap fizz out at he like this he gargle sharply and jump back about five foot the next moment however he have recover he poise and be gallop down the corridor in pursuit it only need aunt dahlia after they shout yoick or whatever be customary on these occasion to complete the resemblance to a brisk run with the quorn i sink into a handy chair i be not a man whom it be easy to discourage but it seem to I that thing have at last begin to get too complex for bertram jeeve i say all this be a bit thick yes sir the head rather swim yes sir i think you have better leave I jeeve i shall need to devote the very closest think to the situation which have arise very good sir the door close i light a cigarette and begin to ponder -19 - most chap in my position i imagine would have ponder all the rest of the evening without get a bite but we wooster have a uncanny knack of go straight to the heart of thing and i do not suppose it be much more than ten minute after i have start ponder before i see what have to be do what be need to straighten matter out i perceive be a heart-to - heart talk with angelum she have cause all the trouble by she mutton - head behavior in say yes instead of no when gussie in the grip of mixed drink and cerebral excitement have suggest team up she must obviously be properly tick off and make to return he to store a quarter of a hour later i have track she down to the summer-house in which she be take a cooler and be seat myself by she side angelum i say and if my voice be stern well whose would not have be this be all perfect drivel she seem to come out of a reverie she look at I inquiringly i be sorry bertie i do not hear what be you talk drivel about i be not talk drivel oh sorry i think you say you be be it likely that i would come out here in order to talk drivel very likely i think it best to haul off and approach the matter from another angle i have just be see tuppy oh and gussie fink-nottle oh yes it appear that you have go and get engage to the latter quite right well that be what i mean when i say it be all perfect drivel you can not possibly love a chap like gussie why not you simply can not well i mean to say of course she could not nobody could love a freak like gussie except a similar freak like the bassett the shot be not on the board a splendid chap of course in many way -- courteous amiable and just the fellow to tell you what to do till the doctor come if you have a sick newt on you hand -- but quite obviously not of mendelssohn 's march timber i have no doubt that you could have fling brick by the hour in england 's most densely populated district without endanger the safety of a single girl capable of become mr augustus fink-nottle without a anesthetic i put this to she and she be force to admit the justice of it all right then perhaps i do not then what i say keenly do you want to go and get engage to he for you unreasonable young fathead i think it would be fun fun and so it have be i have have a lot of fun out of it you should have see tuppy 's face when i tell he a sudden bright light shone upon I ha a gesture what you get engage to gussie just to score off tuppy i do well then that be what i be say it be a gesture yes i suppose you could call it that and i 'll tell you something else i 'll call it -- viz a dash low trick i be surprised at you young angelum i do not see why i curl the lip about half a inch be a female you would not you gentler sex be like that you pull off the rawest stuff without a pang you pride yourselve on it look at jael the wife of heber where do you ever hear of jael the wife of heber possibly you be not aware that i once win a scripture-knowledge prize at school oh yes i remember augustus mention it in he speech quite i say a little hurriedly i have no wish to be remind of augustus 's speech well as i say look at jael the wife of heber dig spike into the guest 's coconut while he be asleep and then go swank about the place like a girl guide no wonder they say ` oh woman woman ' who the chap who do coo what a sex but you be not propose to keep this up of course keep what up this rot of be engage to gussie i certainly be just to make tuppy look silly do you think he look silly i do so he ought to i begin to get the idea that i be not make real headway i remember when i win that scripture-knowledge prize have to go into the fact about balaam 's ass i can not quite recall what they be but i still retain a sort of general impression of something digging its foot in and put its ear back and refuse to co-operate and it seem to I that this be what angelum be do now she and balaam 's ass be so to speak sister under the skin there be a word begin with r -- re something -- recal something -- no it be go but what i be drive at be that be what this angelum be show herself silly young geezer i say she pinken i be not a silly young geezer you be a silly young geezer and what be more you know it i do not know anything of the kind here you be wreck tuppy 's life wreck gussie 's life all for the sake of a cheap score well it be no business of yours i sit on this promptly : no business of mine when i see two life i use to go to school with wreck ha besides you know you be potty about tuppy i be not be that so if i have a quid for every time i have see you gaze at he with the lovelight in you eye -- she gaze at I but without the lovelight oh for goodness sake go away and boil you head bertie i draw myself up that i reply with dignity be just what i be go to go away and boil at least i mean i shall now leave you i have say my say good but permit I to add -- i will not very good i say coldly in that case tinkerty tonk and i mean it to sting moody and discourage be about the two adjective you would have select to describe I as i leave the summer-house it would be idle to deny that i have expect better result from this little chat i be surprise at angelum odd how you never realize that every girl be at heart a vicious specimen until something go wrong with she love affair this cousin and i have be meet freely since the day when i wear sailor suit and she have not any front tooth yet only now be i begin to get on to she hidden depths a simple jolly kindly young pimple she have always strike I as -- the sort you could more or less rely on not to hurt a fly but here she be now laugh heartlessly -- at least i seem to remember hear she laugh heartlessly -- like something cold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie and fairly spit on she hand in she determination to bring tuppy 's gray hair in sorrow to the grave i have say it before and i 'll say it again -- girl be rummy old pop kiple never say a truer word than when he make that crack about the f of the s be more d than the m it seem to I in the circ that there be but one thing to do -- that be head for the dining-room and take a slash at the cold collation of which jeeve have speak i feel in urgent need of sustenance for the recent interview have pull I down a bit there be no gainsay the fact that this naked-emotion stuff reduce a chap 's vitality and put he in the vein for a good whack at the beef and ham to the dining-room accordingly i repair and have barely cross the threshold when i perceive aunt dahlia at the sideboard tuck into salmon mayonnaise the spectacle draw from I a quick oh ah for i be somewhat embarrassed the last time this relative and i have enjoy a _ tête-à-tête _ it will be remembered she have sketch out plan for drown I in the kitchen-garden pond and i be not quite sure what my present standing with she be i be relieve to find she in genial mood nothing could have exceed the cordiality with which she wave she fork hallo bertie you old ass be she very matey greet i think i should not find you far away from the food try some of this salmon excellent anatole 's i query no he be still in bed but the kitchen maid have strike a inspired streak it suddenly seem to have come home to she that she be not cater for a covey of buzzard in the sahara desert and she have put out something quite fit for human consumption there be good in the girl after all and i hope she enjoy herself at the dance i ladle out a portion of salmon and we fall into pleasant conversation chatting of this servant ' ball at the stretchley-budd and speculate idly i recall as to what sepping the butler would look like do the rumba it be not till i have clean up the first platter and be embark on a second that the subject of gussie come up consider what have pass at market snodsbury that afternoon it be one which i have be expect she to touch on earlier when she do touch on it i could see that she have not yet be inform of angelum 's engagement i say bertie she say meditatively chewing fruit salad this spink-bottle nottle bottle insist the aunt firmly after that exhibition of he this afternoon bottle and nothing but bottle be how i shall always think of he however what i be go to say be that if you see he i wish you would tell he that he have make a old woman very very happy except for the time when the curate trip over a loose shoelace and fall down the pulpit step i do not think i have ever have a more wonderful moment than when good old bottle suddenly start tick tom off from the platform in fact i think he whole performance in the most perfect taste i could not but demur those reference to myself -- those be what i like next best i think they be fine be it true that you cheat when you win that scripture-knowledge prize certainly not my victory be the outcome of the most strenuous and unremitting effort and how about this pessimism we hear of be you a pessimist bertie i could have tell she that what be occur in this house be rapidly make I one but i say no i be not that be right never be a pessimist everything be for the best in this best of all possible world it be a long lane that have no turn it s always darkest before the dawn have patience and all will come right the sun will shine although the day 's a gray one try some of this salad i follow she advice but even as i ply the spoon my thought be elsewhere i be perplexed it may have be the fact that i have recently be hobnob with so many bowed-down heart that make this cheeriness of hers seem so bizarre but bizarre be certainly what i find it i think you might have be a trifle peeved i say peeve by gussie 's maneuver on the platform this afternoon i confess that i have rather expect the tap foot and the draw brow nonsense what be there to be peeve about i take the whole thing as a great compliment proud to feel that any drink from my cellar could have produce such a majestic jag it restore one 's faith in post-war whisky besides i could not be peeve at anything tonight i be like a little child clap its hand and dancing in the sunshine for though it have be some time get a move on bertie the sun have at last break through the cloud ring out those joy bell anatole have withdraw he notice what oh very hearty congratulation thanks yes i work on he like a beaver after i get back this afternoon and finally vow he would ne'er consent he consent he stay on praise be and the way i look at it now be that god 's in he heaven and all 's right with -- she break off the door have open and we be plus a butler hullo sepping say aunt dahlia i think you have go not yet madam well i hope you will all have a good time thank you madam be there something you want to see I about yes madam it be with reference to monsieur anatole be it by you wish madam that mr fink-nottle be make face at monsieur anatole through the skylight of he bedroom -20 - there be one of those long silence pregnant i believe be what they be generally call aunt look at butler butler look at aunt i look at both of they a eerie stillness seem to envelop the room like a linseed poultice i happen to be bite on a slice of apple in my fruit salad at the moment and it sound as if carnera have jump off the top of the eiffel tower on to a cucumber frame aunt dahlia steady herself against the sideboard and speak in a low husky voice : face yes madam through the skylight yes madam you mean he be sit on the roof yes madam it have upset monsieur anatole very much i suppose it be that word upset that touch aunt dahlia off experience have teach she what happen when anatole get upset i have always know she as a woman who be quite active on she pin but i have never suspect she of be capable of the magnificent burst of speed which she now show pause merely to get a rich hunting-field expletive off she chest she be out of the room and make for the stair before i could swallow a sliver of -- i think -- banana and feeling as i have feel when i get that telegram of hers about angelum and tuppy that my place be by she side i put down my plate and hasten after she sepping follow at a lope gallop i say that my place be by she side but it be not so dash easy to get there for she be set a crack pace at the top of the first flight she must have lead by a matter of half a dozen length and be still shake off my challenge when she round into the second at the next landing however the gruelling go appear to tell on she for she slacken off a trifle and show symptom of roaring and by the time we be in the straight we be run practically neck and neck we entry into anatole 's room be as close a finish as you could have wish to see result : 1 _ aunt dahlia _ 2 _ bertram _ 3 _ sepping _ _ win by a short head half a staircase separated second and third _ the first thing that meet the eye on enter be anatole this wizard of the cooking-stove be a tubby little man with a moustache of the outsize or soup-strainer type and you can generally take a line through it as to the state of he emotion when all be well it turn up at the end like a sergeant-major 's when the soul be bruise it droop it be droop now strike a sinister note and if any shadow of doubt have remain as to how he be feel the way he be carry on would have dispel it he be stand by the bed in pink pyjamas wave he fist at the skylight through the glass gussie be stare down he eye be bulge and he mouth be open give he so strike a resemblance to some rare fish in a aquarium that one 's primary impulse be to offer he a ant 's egg watch this fist-waving cook and this goggling guest i must say that my sympathy be completely with the former i consider he thoroughly justify in wave all the fist he want to review the fact i mean to say there he have be lie in bed thinking idly of whatever french cook do think about when in bed and he have suddenly become aware of that frightful face at the window a thing to jar the most phlegmatic i know i should hate to be lie in bed and have gussie pop up like that a chap 's bedroom -- you can not get away from it -- be he castle and he have every right to look askance if gargoyle come glaring in at he while i stand muse thus aunt dahlia in she practical way be come straight to the point : what be all this anatole do a sort of swedish exercise start at the base of the spine carry on through the shoulder-blade and finish up among the back hair then he tell she in the chat i have have with this wonder man i have always find he english fluent but a bit on the mixed side if you remember he be with mr bingo little for a time before come to brinkley and no doubt he pick up a good deal from bingo before that he have be a couple of year with a american family at nice and have study under they chauffeur one of the maloney of brooklyn so what with bingo and what with maloney he be as i say fluent but a bit mixed he speak in part as follow : hot dog you ask I what be it listen make some attention a little I i have hit the hay but i do not sleep so good and presently i wake and up i look and there be one who make face against I through the dash window be that a pretty affair be that convenient if you think i like it you jolly well mistake yourself i be so mad as a wet hen and why not i be somebody be not it this be a bedroom what-what not a house for some ape then for what do blighter sit on my window so cool as a few cucumber make some face quite i say dash reasonable be my verdict he throw another look up at gussie and do exercise 2 -- the one where you clutch the moustache give it a tug and then start catch fly wait yet a little i be not finish i say i see this type on my window make a few face but what then do he buzz off when i shout a cry and leave I peaceable not on you life he remain plant there not give any damn and sit regard I like a cat watch a duck he make face against I and again he make face against I and the more i command that he should get to hell out of here the more he do not get to hell out of here he cry something towards I and i demand what be he desire but he do not explain oh no that arrive never he do but shrug he head what damn silliness be this amusing for I you think i like it i be not content with such folly i think the poor mutt 's loony _ je I fiche de ce type infect c'est idiot de faire comme ça l'oiseau allez-vous-en louffier _ tell the boob to go away he be mad as some march hatter i must say i think he be make out a jolly good case and evidently aunt dahlia feel the same she lay a quiver hand on he shoulder i will monsieur anatole i will she say and i could not have believe that robust voice capable of sink to such a absolute coo more like a turtle dive call to its mate than anything else it be quite all right she have say the wrong thing he do exercise 3 all right _ nom d'un nom d'un nom _ the hell you say it be all right of what use to pull stuff like that wait one half-moment not yet quite so quick my old sport it be by no means all right see yet again a little it be some very different dish of fish i can take a few smooth with a rough it be true but i do not find it agreeable when one play lark against I on my window that can not do a nice thing no i be a serious man i do not wish a few lark on my window i enjoy lark on my window worse as any it be very little all right if such rannygazoo be to arrive i do not remain any longer in this house no more i buzz off and do not stay plant sinister word i have to admit and i be not surprise that aunt dahlia hear they should have utter a cry like the wail of a master of hound see a fox shot anatole have begin to wave he fist again at gussie and she now join he sepping who be puff respectfully in the background do not actually wave he fist but he give gussie a pretty austere look it be plain to the thoughtful observer that this fink-nottle in get on to that skylight have do a mistaken thing he could not have be more unpopular in the home of gg simmon go away you crazy loon cry aunt dahlia in that ring voice of hers which have once cause nervous member of the quorn to lose stirrup and take toss from the saddle gussie 's reply be to waggle he eyebrow i could read the message he be try to convey i think he mean i say -- reasonable old bertram always try to throw oil on the troubled w 's -- that if he do he will fall down the side of the house and break he neck well why not say aunt dahlia i could see she point of course but it seem to I that there might be a nearer solution this skylight happen to be the only window in the house which uncle tom have not festoon with he bally bar i suppose he feel that if a burglar have the nerve to climb up as far as this he deserve what be come to he if you open the skylight he could jump in the idea get across sepping how do this skylight open with a pole madam then get a pole get two pole ten and presently gussie be mix with the company like one of those chap you read about in the papers the wretched man seem deeply conscious of he position i must say aunt dahlia 's bearing and demeanor do nothing to assist toward a restore composure of the amiability which she have exhibit when discuss this unhappy chump 's activity with I over the fruit salad no trace remain and i be not surprise that speech more or less freeze on the fink-nottle lip it be not often that aunt dahlia normally as genial a bird as ever encourage a gaggle of hound to get they nose down to it let she angry passion rise but when she do strong man climb tree and pull they up after they well she say in answer to this all that gussie could produce be a sort of strangle hiccough well aunt dahlia 's face grow darker hunting if indulge in regularly over a period of year be a pastime that seldom fail to lend a fairly deepish tinge to the patient 's complexion and she best friend could not have deny that even at normal time the relative 's map tend a little toward the crushed strawberry but never have i see it take on so pronounce a richness as now she look like a tomato struggle for self-expression well gussie try hard and for a moment it seem as if something be go to come through but in the end it turn out nothing more than a sort of death-rattle oh take he away bertie and put ice on he head say aunt dahlia give the thing up and she turn to tackle what look like the rather man 's size job of soothing anatole who be now carry on a muttered conversation with himself in a rapid sort of way seem to feel that the situation be one to which he could not do justice in bingo-cum-maloney anglo-american he have fall back on he native tongue word like _ marmiton de domange pignouf hurluberlu _ and _ roustisseur _ be flutter from he like bat out of a barn lose on I of course because though i sweat a bit at the gallic language during that canne visit i be still more or less in the esker-vous-avez stage i regret this for they sound good i assist gussie down the stair a cooler thinker than aunt dahlia i have already guess the hidden spring and motive which have lead he to the roof where she have see only a cockeyed reveller indulge himself in a drunken prank or whimsy i have spot the hunt fawn be tuppy after you i ask sympathetically what i believe be call a _ frisson _ shake he he nearly get I on the top landing i shin out through a passage window and scramble along a sort of ledge that baffle he what yes but then i find i have stick the roof slope down in all direction i could not go back i have to go on crawl along this ledge and then i find myself look down the skylight who be that chap that be anatole aunt dahlia 's chef french to the core that explain why i could not make he understand what ass these frenchman be they do not seem able to grasp the simplest thing you would have think if a chap see a chap on a skylight the chap would realize the chap want to be let in but no he just stand there wave a few fist yes silly idiot still here i be here you be yes -- for the moment eh i be think that tuppy be probably lurk somewhere he leap like a lamb in springtime what shall i do i consider this sneak back to you room and barricade the door that be the manly policy suppose that be where he be lurk in that case move elsewhere but on arrival at the room it transpire that tuppy if anywhere be infest some other portion of the house gussie shot in and i hear the key turn and feeling that there be no more that i could do in that quarter i return to the dining-room for further fruit salad and a quiet think and i have barely fill my plate when the door open and aunt dahlia come in she sink into a chair look a bit shopworn give I a drink bertie what sort any sort so long as it be strong approach bertram wooster along these line and you catch he at he best st bernard dog do the square thing by alpine traveller could not have bustle about more assiduously i fill the order and for some moment nothing be to be hear but the slosh sound of a aunt restore she tissue shove it down aunt dahlia i say sympathetically these thing take it out of one do not they you have have a toughish time no doubt soothing anatole i proceed help myself to anchovy paste on toast everything pretty smooth now i trust she gaze at I in a long linger sort of way she brow wrinkle as if in think attilum she say at length that be the name attila the hun eh i be try to think who you remind I of somebody who go about strew ruin and desolation and break up home which until he come along have be happy and peaceful attilum be the man it be amazing she say drinking I in once more to look at you one would think you be just a ordinary sort of amiable idiot -- certifiable perhaps but quite harmless yet in reality you be worse a scourge than the black death i tell you bertie when i contemplate you i seem to come up against all the underlie sorrow and horror of life with such a thud that i feel as if i have walk into a lamp post pained and surprised i would have speak but the stuff i have think be anchovy paste have turn out to be something far more gooey and adhesive it seem to wrap itself round the tongue and impede utterance like a gag and while i be still endeavor to clear the vocal cord for action she go on : do you realize what you start when you send that spink-bottle man down here as regard he get blotto and turn the prize-giving ceremony at market snodsbury grammar school into a sort of two-reel comic film i will say nothing for frankly i enjoy it but when he come leer at anatole through skylight just after i have with infinite pain and tact induce he to withdraw he notice and make he so temperamental that he will not hear of stay on after tomorrow -- the paste stuff give way i be able to speak : what yes anatole go tomorrow and i suppose poor old tom will have indigestion for the rest of he life and that be not all i have just see angelum and she tell I she be engage to this bottle temporarily yes i have to admit temporarily be blow she be definitely engage to he and talk with a sort of hideous coolness of get marry in October so there it be if the prophet job be to walk into the room at this moment i could sit swap hard-luck story with he till bedtime not that job be in my class he have boil well what be boil dash painful i understand nonsense i would take all the boil on the market in exchange for my trouble can not you realize the position i have lose the best cook to england my husband poor soul will probably die of dyspepsia and my only daughter for whom i have dream such a wonderful future be engage to be marry to a inebriated newt fancier and you talk about boil i correct she on a small point : i do not absolutely talk about boil i merely mention that job have they yes i agree with you aunt dahlia that thing be not look too oojah-cum-spiff at the moment but be of good cheer a wooster be seldom baffle for more than the nonce you rather expect to be come along shortly with another of you scheme at any minute she sigh resignedly i think as much well it need but this i do not see how thing could possibly be worse than they be but no doubt you will succeed in make they so you genius and insight will find the way carry on bertie yes carry on i be past care now i shall even find a faint interest in see into what darker and profounder abyss of hell you can plunge this home go to it lad what be that stuff you be eat i find it a little difficult to classify some sort of paste on toast rather like glue flavor with beef extract gimme say aunt dahlia listlessly be careful how you chew i advise it sticketh closer than a brother yes jeeve the man have materialize on the carpet absolutely noiseless as usual a note for you sir a note for I jeeve a note for you sir from whom jeeve from miss bassett sir from whom jeeve from miss bassett sir from miss bassett jeeve from miss bassett sir at this point aunt dahlia who have take one nibble at she whatever-it-was-on-toast and lay it down beg we -- a little fretfully i think -- for heaven 's sake to cut out the cross-talk vaudeville stuff as she have enough to bear already without have to listen to we do we imitation of the two mac always willing to oblige i dismiss jeeve with a nod and he flicker for a moment and be go many a spectre would have be less slippy but what i mused toy with the envelope can this female be write to I about why not open the damn thing and see a very excellent idea i say and do so and if you be interested in my movement proceed aunt dahlia head for the door i propose to go to my room do some yogi deep breathing and try to forget quite i say absently skim p l and then as i turn over a sharp howl break from my lip cause aunt dahlia to shy like a startled mustang do not do it she exclaim quiver in every limb yes but dash it -- what a pest you be you miserable object she sigh i remember year ago when you be in you cradle be leave alone with you one day and you nearly swallow you rubber comforter and start turn purple and i ass that i be take it out and save you life let I tell you young bertie it will go very hard with you if you ever swallow a rubber comforter again when only i be by to aid but dash it i cry do you know what be happen madeline bassett say she be go to marry I i hope it keep fine for you say the relative and pass from the room look like something out of a edgar allan poe story -21 - i do not suppose i be look so dash unlike something out of a edgar allan poe story myself for as you can readily imagine the news item which i have just record have get in amongst I properly if the bassett in the belief that the wooster heart have long be hers and be wait ready to be scoop in on demand have decide to take up she option i should as a man of honor and sensibility have no choice but to come across and kick in the matter be obviously not one that could be straighten out with a curt _ nolle prosequus _ all the evidence therefore seem to point to the fact that the doom have come upon I and what be more have come to stay and yet though it would be idle to pretend that my grip on the situation be quite the grip i would have like it to be i do not despair of arrive at a solution a lesser man catch in this awful snare would no doubt have throw in the towel at once and cease to struggle but the whole point about the wooster be that they be not lesser man by way of a start i read the note again not that i have any hope that a second perusal would enable I to place a different construction on its contents but it help to fill in while the brain be limber up i then to assist thought have another go at the fruit salad and in addition eat a slice of sponge cake and it be as i pass on to the cheese that the machinery start work i see what have to be do to the question which have be exercise the mind -- viz can bertram cope -- i be now able to reply with a confident absolutely the great wheeze on these occasion of dirty work at the crossroads be not to lose you head but to keep cool and try to find the ringleader once find the ringleader and you know where you be the ringleader here be plainly the bassett it be she who have start the whole imbroglio by chuck gussie and it be clear that before anything could be do to solve and clarify she must be induce to revise she view and take he on again this would put angelum back into circulation and that would cause tuppy to simmer down a bit and then we could begin to get somewhere i decide that as soon as i have have another morsel of cheese i would seek this bassett out and be pretty eloquent and at this moment in she come i might have foresee that she would be turn up shortly i mean to say heart may ache but if they know that there be a cold collation set out in the dining-room they be pretty sure to come pop in sooner or later she eye as she enter the room be fix on the salmon mayonnaise and she would no doubt have make a bee-line for it and start get hers have i not in the emotion of see she drop a glass of the best with which i be endeavor to bring about a calmer frame of mind the noise cause she to turn and for a instant embarrassment supervene a slight flush mantle the cheek and the eye pop a bit oh she say i have always find that there be nothing that help to ease you over one of these awkward moment like a spot of stage business find something to do with you hand and it be half the battle i grab a plate and hasten forward a touch of salmon thank you with a suspicion of salad if you please and to drink name the poison i think i would like a little orange juice she give a gulp not at the orange juice i do not mean because she have not get it yet but at all the tender association those two word provoke it be as if someone have mention spaghetti to the relict of a italian organ-grinder she face flush a deeper shade she register anguish and i see that it be no longer within the sphere of practical politics to try to confine the conversation to neutral topic like cold boil salmon so do she i imagine for when i as a preliminary to get down to brass tack say er she say er too simultaneously the brace of ers clash in mid-air i be sorry i beg you pardon you be say -- you be say -- no please go on oh right-ho i straighten the tie my habit when in this girl 's society and have at it : with reference to yours of even date -- she flush again and take a rather strained forkful of salmon you get my note yes i get you note i give it to jeeve to give it to you yes he give it to I that be how i get it there be another silence and as she be plainly shrink from talk turkey i be reluctantly compel to do so i mean somebody have get to too dash silly a male and female in we position simply stand eat salmon and cheese at one another without a word yes i get it all right i see you get it yes i get it i have just be read it and what i be rather want to ask you if we happen to run into each other be -- well what about it what about it that be what i say : what about it but it be quite clear oh quite perfectly clear very well express and all that but -- i mean -- well i mean deeply sensible of the honor and so forth -- but -- well dash it she have polish off she salmon and now put the plate down fruit salad no thank you spot of pie no thanks one of those glue thing on toast no thank you she take a cheese straw i find a cold egg which i have overlook then i say i mean to say just as she say i think i know and there be another collision i beg you pardon i be sorry do go on no you go on i wave my cold egg courteously to indicate that she have the floor and she start again : i think i know what you be try to say you be surprised yes you be think of -- exactly -- mr fink-nottle the very man you find what i have do hard to understand absolutely i do not wonder i do and yet it be quite simple she take another cheese straw she seem to like cheese straw quite simple really i want to make you happy dash decent of you i be go to devote the rest of my life to make you happy a very matey scheme i can at least do that but -- may i be quite frank with you bertie oh rather then i must tell you this i be fond of you i will marry you i will do my best to make you a good wife but my affection for you can never be the flamelike passion i feel for augustus just the very point i be work round to there as you say be the snag why not chuck the whole idea of hitch up with I wash it out altogether i mean if you love old gussie -- no longer oh come no what happen this afternoon have kill my love a smear of ugliness have be draw across a thing of beauty and i can never feel towards he as i do i see what she mean of course gussie have bung he heart at she foot she have pick it up and almost immediately after do so have discover that he have be stew to the eyebrow all the time the shock must have be severe no girl like to feel that a chap have get to be thoroughly plaster before he can ask she to marry he it wound the pride nevertheless i persevere but have you consider i say that you may have get a wrong line on gussie 's performance this afternoon admit that all the evidence point to a more sinister theory what price he simply have get a touch of the sun chap do get touch of the sun you know especially when the weather 's hot she look at I and i see that she be put in a bit of the old drenched-iris stuff it be like you to say that bertie i respect you for it oh no yes you have a splendid chivalrous soul not a bit yes you have you remind I of cyrano who cyrano de bergerac the chap with the nose yes i can not say i be any too pleased i feel the old beak furtively it be a bit on the prominent side perhaps but dash it not in the cyrano class it begin to look as if the next thing this girl would do would be to compare I to schnozzle durante he love but plead another 's cause oh i see what you mean now i like you for that bertie it be fine of you -- fine and big but it be no use there be thing which kill love i can never forget augustus but my love for he be dead i will be you wife well one have to be civil right ho i say thanks awfully then the dialogue sort of poof out once more and we stand eat cheese straw and cold egg respectively in silence there seem to exist some little uncertainty as to what the next move be fortunately before embarrassment could do much more supervening angelum come in and this break up the meeting then bassett announce we engagement and angelum kiss she and say she hope she would be very very happy and the bassett kiss she and say she hope she would be very very happy with gussie and angelum say she be sure she would because augustus be such a dear and the bassett kiss she again and angelum kiss she again and in a word the whole thing get so bally feminine that i be glad to edge away i would have be glad to do so of course in any case for if ever there be a moment when it be up to bertram to think and think hard this moment be that moment it be it seem to I the end not even on the occasion some year earlier when i have inadvertently become betrothed to tuppy 's frightful cousin honorium have i experience a deeper sense of be waist high in the gumbo and about to sink without trace i wander out into the garden smoking a tortured gasper with the iron well embedded in the soul and i have fall into a sort of trance try to picture what it would be like have the bassett on the premise for the rest of my life and at the same time if you follow I try not to picture what it would be like when i charge into something which might have be a tree but be not -- be in point of fact jeeve i beg you pardon sir he say i should have move to one side i do not reply i stand look at he in silence for the sight of he have open up a new line of think this jeeve now i reflect i have form the opinion that he have lose he grip and be no longer the force he have be but be it not possible i ask myself that i might be mistaken start he off explore avenue and might he not discover one through which i would be enable to sneak off to safety leave no hard feeling behind i find myself answer that it be quite on the card that he might after all he head still bulge out at the back as of old one note in the eye the same intelligent glitter mind you after what have pass between we in the matter of that white mess-jacket with the brass button i be not prepared absolutely to hand over to the man i would of course merely take he into consultation but recall some of he earlier triumph -- the sipperley case the episode of my aunt agatha and the dog mcintosh and the smoothly handle affair of uncle george and the barmaid 's niece be a few that spring to my mind -- i feel justified at least in offer he the opportunity of come to the aid of the young master in he hour of peril but before proceed further there be one thing that have get to be understand between we and understand clearly jeeve i say a word with you sir i be up against it a bit jeeve i be sorry to hear that sir can i be of any assistance quite possibly you can if you have not lose you grip tell I frankly jeeve be you in pretty good shape mentally yes sir still eat plenty of fish yes sir then it may be all right but there be just one point before i begin in the past when you have contrived to extricate self or some pal from some little difficulty you have frequently show a disposition to take advantage of my gratitude to gain some private end those purple sock for instance also the plus fours and the old etonian spat choose you moment with subtle cunning you come to I when i be weaken by relief and get I to get rid of they and what i be say now be that if you be successful on the present occasion there must be no rot of that description about that mess-jacket of mine very good sir you will not come to I when all be over and ask I to jettison the jacket certainly not sir on that understanding then i will carry on jeeve i be engage i hope you will be very happy sir do not be a ass i be engage to miss bassett indeed sir i be not aware -- nor be i it come as a complete surprise however there it be the official intimation be in that note you bring I odd sir what be odd sir that the contents of that note should have be as you describe it seem to I that miss bassett when she hand I the communication be far from be in a happy frame of mind she be far from be in a happy frame of mind you do not suppose she really want to marry I do you pshaw jeeve can not you see that this be simply another of those bally gesture which be rapidly render brinkley court a hell for man and beast dash all gesture be my view yes sir well what be to be do you feel that miss bassett despite what have occur still retain a fondness for mr fink-nottle sir she be pine for he in that case sir surely the best plan would be to bring about a reconciliation between they how you see you stand silent and twiddle the finger you be stump no sir if i twiddled my finger it be merely to assist thought then continue twiddle it will not be necessary sir you do not mean you have get a bite already yes sir you astound I jeeve let 's have it the device which i have in mind be one that i have already mention to you sir when do you ever mention any device to I if you will throw you mind back to the evening of we arrival sir you be good enough to inquire of I if i have any plan to put forward with a view to bring miss angelum and mr glossop together and i venture to suggest -- good lord not the old fire-alarm thing precisely sir you be still stick to that yes sir it show how much the ghastly blow i have receive have shake I when i say that instead of dismiss the proposal with a curt tchah or anything like that i find myself speculate as to whether there might not be something in it after all when he have first moot this fire-alarm scheme of he i have sit upon it if you remember with the maximum of promptitude and vigor rotten be the adjective i have employ to describe it and you may recall that i mused a bit sadly consider the idea conclusive proof of the general breakdown of a once fine mind but now it somehow begin to look as if it might have possibility the fact of the matter be that i have about reach the stage where i be prepare to try anything once however goofy just run through that wheeze again jeeve i say thoughtfully i remember think it cuckoo but it may be that i miss some of the finer shade you criticism of it at the time sir be that it be too elaborate but i do not think it be so in reality as i see it sir the occupant of the house hear the fire bell ring will suppose that a conflagration have break out i nod one could follow the train of think yes that seem reasonable whereupon mr glossop will hasten to save miss angelum while mr fink-nottle perform the same office for miss bassett be that base on psychology yes sir possibly you may recollect that it be a axiom of the late sir arthur conan doyle 's fictional detective sherlock holme that the instinct of everyone upon a alarm of fire be to save the object dearest to they it seem to I that there be a grave danger of see tuppy come out carry a steak-and-kidney pie but resume jeeve resume you think that this would clean everything up the relation of the two young couple could scarcely continue distant after such a occurrence sir perhaps you be right but dash it if we go ring fire bell in the night watch sha not we scare half the domestic staff into fit there be one of the housemaid -- jane i believe -- who already skip like the high hill if i so much as come on she unexpectedly round a corner a neurotic girl sir i agree i have notice she but by act promptly we should avoid such a contingency the entire staff with the exception of monsieur anatole will be at the ball at kingham manor tonight of course that just show the condition this thing have reduce I to forget my own name next well then let 's just try to envisage bong go the bell gussie rush and grab the bassett wait why should not she simply walk downstairs you be overlook the effect of sudden alarm on the feminine temperament sir that be true miss bassett 's impulse i would imagine sir would be to leap from she window well that be worse we do not want she spread out in a sort of _ purée _ on the lawn it seem to I that the flaw in this scheme of yours jeeve be that it be go to litter the garden with mangled corpse no sir you will recall that mr traver 's fear of burglar have cause he to have stout bar fix to all the window of course yes well it sound all right i say though still a bit doubtfully quite possibly it may come off but i have a feeling that it will slip up somewhere however i be in no position to cavil at even a 100 to 1 shot i will adopt this policy of yours jeeve though as i say with misgiving at what hour would you suggest bong the bell not before midnight sir that be to say some time after midnight yes sir right-ho then at 1230 on the dot i will bong very good sir -22 - i do not know why it be but there be something about the rural district after dark that always have a rummy effect on I in london i can stay out till all hour and come home with the milk without a tremor but put I in the garden of a country house after the strength of the company have go to roost and the place be shut up and a sort of goose-fleshy feeling steal over I the night wind stir the tree-tops twig crack bush rustle and before i know where i be the morale have go phut and i be expect the family ghost to come sneak up behind I make groan noise dash unpleasant the whole thing and if you think it improve matter to know that you be shortly about to ring the loudest fire bell in england and start a all-hands-to-the-pumps panic in that quiet darkened house you err i know all about the brinkley court fire bell the dickens of a row it make uncle tom in addition to not like burglar be a bloke who have always object to the idea of be cook in he sleep so when he buy the place he see to it that the fire bell should be something that might give you heart failure but which you could not possibly mistake for the drowsy chirping of a sparrow in the ivy when i be a kid and spend my holiday at brinkley we use to have fire drill after close time and many be the night i have have it jerk I out of the dreamless like the last trump i confess that the recollection of what this bell could do when it buckle down to it give I pause as i stand that night at 1230 pm prompt beside the outhouse where it be located the sight of the rope against the whitewashed wall and the thought of the bloodsome uproar which be about to smash the peace of the night into hash serve to deepen that rummy feeling to which i have allude moreover now that i have have time to meditate upon it i be more than ever defeatist about this scheme of jeeve 's jeeve seem to take it for grant that gussie and tuppy face with a hideous fate would have no thought beyond save the bassett and angelum i could not bring myself to share he sunny confidence i mean to say i know how moment when they be face with a hideous fate affect chap i remember freddie widgeon one of the most chivalrous bird in the drone tell I how there be a alarm of fire once at a seaside hotel where he be stay and so far from rush about save woman he be down the escape within ten seconds of the kick-off he mind concern with but one thing -- viz the personal well-being of f widgeon as far as any idea of do the delicately nurture a bit of good go he tell I he be prepare to stand underneath and catch they in blanket but no more why then should this not be so with augustus fink-nottle and hildebrand glossop such be my thought as i stand toy with the rope and i believe i should have turn the whole thing up have it not be that at this juncture there float into my mind a picture of the bassett hearing that bell for the first time come as a wholly new experience it would probably startle she into a decline and so agreeable be this reflection that i wait no longer but seize the rope brace the foot and snap into it well as i say i have not be expect that bell to hush thing up to any great extent nor do it the last time i have hear it i have be in my room on the other side of the house and even so it have hoik I out of bed as if something have explode under I stand close to it like this i get the full force and meaning of the thing and i have never hear anything like it in my puff i rather enjoy a bit of noise as a general rule i remember cats-meat potter-pirbright bring a police rattle into the drone one night and loose it off behind my chair and i just lay back and close my eye with a pleasant smile like someone in a box at the opera and the same apply to the time when my aunt agatha 's son young tho put a match to the parcel of guy fawke day firework to see what would happen but the brinkley court fire bell be too much for I i give about half a dozen tug and then feeling that enough be enough saunter round to the front lawn to ascertain what solid result have be achieve brinkley court have give of its best a glance tell I that we be play to capacity the eye rove to and fro note here uncle tom in a purple dress gown there aunt dahlia in the old blue and yellow it also fall upon anatole tuppy gussie angela the bassett and jeeve in the order name there they all be present and correct but -- and this be what cause I immediate concern -- i could detect no sign whatever that there have be any rescue work go on what i have be hope of course be to see tuppy bend solicitously over angelum in one corner while gussie fan the bassett with a towel in the other instead of which the bassett be one of the group which include aunt dahlia and uncle tom and seem to be busy try to make anatole see the bright side while angelum and gussie be respectively lean against the sundial with a peeved look and sit on the grass rub a barked shin tuppy be walk up and down the path all by himself a disturbing picture you will admit it be with a rather imperious gesture that i summon jeeve to my side well jeeve sir i eyed he sternly sir forsooth it be no good say ` sir ' jeeve look round you see for yourself you scheme have prove a bust certainly it would appear that matter have not arrange themselves quite as we anticipate sir we as i have anticipate sir that be more like it do not i tell you it would be a flop i remember that you do seem dubious sir dubious be no word for it jeeve i have not a scrap of faith in the idea from the start when you first moot it i say it be rotten and i be right i be not blame you jeeve it be not you fault that you have sprain you brain but after this -- forgive I if i hurt you feeling jeeve -- i shall know better than to allow you to handle any but the simplest and most elementary problem it be best to be candid about this do not you think kindest to be frank and straightforward certainly sir i mean the surgeon 's knife what precisely sir i consider -- if you will pardon I for interrupt you sir i fancy mr traver be endeavor to attract you attention and at this moment a ringing hoy which could have proceed only from the relative in question assure I that he view be correct just step this way a moment attilum if you do not mind boom that well-known -- and under certain condition well-loved -- voice and i move over i be not feel unmixedly at my ease for the first time it be begin to steal upon I that i have not prepare a really good story in support of my questionable behavior in ring fire bell at such a hour and i have know aunt dahlia to express herself with a hearty freedom upon far smaller provocation she exhibit however no sign of violence more a sort of frozen calm if you know what i mean you could see that she be a woman who have suffer well bertie dear she say here we all be quite i reply guardedly nobody missing be there i do not think so splendid so much healthier for we out in the open like this than frowsting in bed i have just drop off when you do you bell-ringing act for it be you my sweet child who ring that bell be it not i do ring the bell yes any particular reason or just a whim i think there be a fire what give you that impression dear i think i see flame where darling tell aunt dahlia in one of the window i see so we have all be drag out of bed and scared rigid because you have be see thing here uncle tom make a noise like a cork come out of a bottle and anatole whose moustache have hit a new low say something about some ape and if i be not mistake a _ rogommier _ -- whatever that be i admit i be mistaken i be sorry do not apologize ducky can not you see how pleased we all be what be you do out here anyway just take a stroll i see and be you propose to continue you stroll no i think i 'll go in now that be fine because i be think of go in too and i do not believe i could sleep know you be out here give rein to that powerful imagination of yours the next thing that would happen would be that you would think you see a pink elephant sit on the drawing-room window-sill and start throw brick at it well come on tom the entertainment seem to be over but wait the newt king wish a word with we yes mr fink-nottle gussie as he join we little group seem upset about something i say say on augustus i say what be we go to do speak for myself i intend to return to bed but the door 's shut what door the front door somebody must have shut it then i shall open it but it will not open then i shall try another door but all the other door be shut what who shut they i do not know i advance a theory the wind aunt dahlia 's eye meet mine do not try I too high she beg not now precious and indeed even as i speak it do strike I that the night be pretty still uncle tom say we must get in through a window aunt dahlia sigh a bit how could lloyd george do it could winston do it could baldwin do it no not since you have those bar of yours put on well well well god bless my soul ring the bell then the fire bell the door bell to what end thoma there be nobody in the house the servant be all at kingham but confound it all we can not stop out here all night can not we you just watch we there be nothing -- literally nothing -- which a country house party can not do with attilum here operate on the premise sepping presumably take the back-door key with he we must just amuse ourselves till he come back tuppy make a suggestion : why not take out one of the car and drive over to kingham and get the key from sepping it go well no question about that for the first time a smile light up aunt dahlia 's draw face uncle tom grunt approvingly anatole say something in provençal that sound complimentary and i think i detect even on angelum 's map a slight soften a very excellent idea say aunt dahlia one of the best nip round to the garage at once after tuppy have go some extremely flattering thing be say about he intelligence and resource and there be a disposition to draw rather invidious comparison between he and bertram painful for I of course but the ordeal do not last long for it could not have be more than five minute before he be with we again tuppy seem perturb i say it be all off why the garage be lock unlock it i have not the key shout then and wake waterbury who be waterbury the chauffeur ass he sleep over the garage but he be go to the dance at kingham it be the final wallop until this moment aunt dahlia have be able to preserve she frozen calm the dam now burst the year roll away from she and she be once more the dahlia wooster of the old yoicks-and-tantivy day -- the emotional free-speaking girl who have so often rise in she stirrup to yell derogatory personality at people who be head hound curse all dancing chauffeur what on earth do a chauffeur want to dance for i mistrust that man from the start something tell I he be a dancer well this finish it we be out here till breakfast-time if those blast servant come back before eight o'clock i shall be vastly surprise you will not get sepping away from a dance till you throw he out i know he the jazz 'll go to he head and he 'll stand clap and demand encore till he hand blister damn all dance butler what be brinkley court a respectable english country house or a crimson dancing school one might as well be live in the middle of the russian ballet well all right if we must stay out here we must we shall all be freeze stiff except -- here she direct at I not one of she friendliest glance -- except dear old attilum who be i observe well and warmly clothe we will resign ourselves to the prospect of freezing to death like the babe in the wood merely express a die wish that we old pal attilum will see that we be cover with leave no doubt he will also toll that fire bell of he as a mark of respect -- and what might you want my good man she break off and stand glaring at jeeve during the latter portion of she address he have be stand by in a respectful manner endeavor to catch the speaker 's eye if i might make a suggestion madam i be not say that in the course of we long association i have always find myself able to view jeeve with approval there be aspect of he character which have frequently cause coldness to arise between we he be one of those fellow who if you give they a thingummy take a what-d'you-call-it he work be often raw and he have be know to allude to I as mentally negligible more than once as i have show it have be my painful task to squelch in he a tendency to get uppish and treat the young master as a serf or peon these be grave defect but one thing i have never fail to hand the man he be magnetic there be about he something that seem to soothe and hypnotize to the best of my knowledge he have never encounter a charge rhinoceros but should this contingency occur i have no doubt that the animal meet he eye would check itself in mid-stride roll over and lie purr with its leg in the air at any rate he calm down aunt dahlia the nearest thing to a charge rhinoceros in under five seconds he just stand there look respectful and though i do not time the thing -- not have a stop-watch on I -- i should say it be not more than three seconds and a quarter before she whole manner undergo a astounding change for the better she melt before one 's eye jeeve you have not get a idea yes madam that great brain of yours have really click as ever in the hour of need yes madam jeeves say aunt dahlia in a shake voice i be sorry i speak so abruptly i be not myself i might have know that you would not come simply try to make conversation tell we this idea of yours jeeve join we little group of thinker and let we hear what you have to say make yourself at home jeeve and give we the good word can you really get we out of this mess yes madam if one of the gentleman would be willing to ride a bicycle a bicycle there be a bicycle in the gardener 's shed in the kitchen garden madam possibly one of the gentleman might feel disposed to ride over to kingham manor and procure the back-door key from mr sepping splendid jeeve thank you madam wonderful thank you madam attilum say aunt dahlia turn and speak in a quiet authoritative manner i have be expect it from the very moment those ill-judged word have pass the fellow 's lip i have have a presentiment that a determine effort would be make to elect I as the goat and i brace myself to resist and obstruct and as i be about to do so while i be in the very act of summon up all my eloquence to protest that i do not know how to ride a bike and could not possibly learn in the brief time at my disposal i be dash if the man do not go and nip I in the bud yes madam mr wooster would perform the task admirably he be a expert cyclist he have often boast to I of he triumph on the wheel i have not i have not do anything of the sort it be simply monstrous how one 's word get twist all i have ever do be to mention to he -- casually just as a interesting item of information one day in new york when we be watch the six-day bicycle race -- that at the age of fourteen while spend my holiday with a vicar of sort who have be tell off to teach I latin i have win the choir boy ' handicap at the local school treat a different thing from boast of one 's triumph on the wheel i mean he be a man of the world and must have know that the form of school treat be never of the hottest and if i be not mistaken i have specifically tell he that on the occasion refer to i have receive half a lap start and that willie punt the odds-on favorite to whom the race be expect to be a gift have be force to retire owe to have pinch he elder brother 's machine without ask the elder brother and the elder brother come along just as the pistol go and give he one on the side of the head and take it away from he thus render he a scratched-at-the-post non-starter yet from the way he talk you would have think i be one of those chap in sweater with medal all over they whose photograph bob up from time to time in the illustrated press on the occasion of they have ride from hyde park corner to glasgow in three seconds under the hour or whatever it be and as if this be not bad enough tuppy have to shove he oar in that be right say tuppy bertie have always be a great cyclist i remember at oxford he use to take all he clothes off on bump-supper night and ride around the quad singing comic song jolly fast he use to go too then he can go jolly fast now say aunt dahlia with animation he can not go too fast for I he may also sing comic song if he like and if you wish to take you clothes off bertie my lamb by all means do so but whether clothe or in the nude whether singing comic song or not singing comic song get a move on i find speech : but i have not ride for year then it be high time you begin again i have probably forget how to ride you 'll soon get the knack after you have take a toss or two trial and error the only way but it be mile to kingham so the sooner you be off the better but -- bertie dear but dash it -- bertie darling yes but dash it -- bertie my sweet and so it be arrange presently i be move sombrely off through the darkness jeeve at my side aunt dahlia call after I something about try to imagine myself the man who bring the good news from ghent to aix the first i have hear of the chap so jeeve i say as we reach the shed and my voice be cold and bitter this be what you great scheme have accomplish tuppy angelum gussie and the bassett not on speak term and self face with a eight-mile ride -- nine i believe sir -- a nine-mile ride and another nine-mile ride back i be sorry sir no good be sorry now where be this foul bone-shaker i will bring it out sir he do so i eyed it sourly where 's the lamp i fear there be no lamp sir no lamp no sir but i may come a fearful stinker without a lamp suppose i barge into something i break off and eye he frigidly you smile jeeve the thought amuse you i beg you pardon sir i be think of a tale my uncle cyril use to tell I as a child a absurd little story sir though i confess that i have always find it droll accord to my uncle cyril two man name nicholl and jackson set out to ride to brighton on a tandem bicycle and be so unfortunate as to come into collision with a brewer 's van and when the rescue party arrive on the scene of the accident it be discover that they have be hurl together with such force that it be impossible to sort they out at all adequately the keenest eye could not discern which portion of the fragment be nicholl and which jackson so they collect as much as they could and call it nixon i remember laugh very much at that story when i be a child sir i have to pause a moment to master my feeling you do eh yes sir you think it funny yes sir and you uncle cyril think it funny yes sir golly what a family next time you meet you uncle cyril jeeve you can tell he from I that he sense of humor be morbid and unpleasant he be dead sir thank heaven for that well give I the blast machine very good sir be the tyre inflate yes sir the nut firm the brake in order the sprocket run true with the differential gear yes sir right ho jeeve in tuppy 's statement that when at the university of oxford i have be know to ride a bicycle in the nude about the quadrangle of we mutual college there have be i can not deny a certain amount of substance correct however though he fact be so far as they go he have not tell all what he have omit to mention be that i have invariably be well oil at the time and when in that condition a chap be capable of feat at which in cooler moment he reason would rebel stimulate by the juice i believe man have even be know to ride alligator as i start now to pedal out into the great world i be icily sober and the old skill in consequence have desert I entirely i find myself wobble badly and all the story i have ever hear of nasty bicycle accident come back to I with a rush head by jeeve 's uncle cyril 's cheery little anecdote about nicholl and jackson pound wearily through the darkness i find myself at a loss to fathom the mentality of man like jeeve 's uncle cyril what on earth he could see funny in a disaster which have apparently involve the complete extinction of a human creature -- or at any rate of half a human creature and half another human creature -- be more than i could understand to I the thing be one of the most poignant tragedy that have ever be bring to my attention and i have no doubt that i should have continue to brood over it for quite a time have my thought not be divert by the sudden necessity of zigzag sharply in order to avoid a pig in the fairway for a moment it look like be real nicholls-and-jackson stuff but fortunately a quick zig on my part coincide with a adroit zag on the part of the pig enable I to win through and i continue my ride safe but with the heart flutter like a captive bird the effect of this narrow squeak upon I be to shake the nerve to the utmost the fact that pig be abroad in the night seem to bring home to I the perilous nature of my enterprise it set I thinking of all the other thing that could happen to a man out and about on a velocipede without a lamp after lighting-up time in particular i recall the statement of a pal of mine that in certain section of the rural district goat be accustom to stray across the road to the extent of they chain thereby form about as sound a booby trap as one could well wish he mention i remember the case of a friend of he whose machine get entangled with a goat chain and who be drag seven mile -- like skijoring in switzerland -- so that he be never the same man again and there be one chap who run into a elephant leave over from a travel circus indeed take it for all in all it seem to I that with the possible exception of be bite by shark there be virtually no front-page disaster that could not happen to a fellow once he have allow he dear one to override he better judgment and shove he out into the great unknown on a push-bike and i be not ashamed to confess that take it by and large the amount of quail i do from this point on be pretty considerable however in respect to goat and elephant i must say thing pan out unexpectedly well oddly enough i encounter neither but when you have say that you have say everything for in every other way the condition could scarcely have be fouler apart from the ceaseless anxiety of have to keep a eye skin for elephant i find myself much depress by bark dog and once i receive a most unpleasant shock when alight to consult a signpost i see sit on top of it a owl that look exactly like my aunt agatha so agitate indeed have my frame of mind become by this time that i think at first it be aunt agatha and only when reason and reflection tell I how alien to she habit it would be to climb signpost and sit on they could i pull myself together and overcome the weakness in short what with all this mental disturbance add to the more purely physical anguish in the billowy portion and the calf and ankle the bertram wooster who eventually topple off at the door of kingham manor be a very different bertram from the gay and insouciant _ boulevardier _ of bond street and piccadilly even to one unaware of the inside fact it would have be evident that kingham manor be throw its weight about a bit tonight light shine in the window music be in the air and as i draw nearer my ear detect the sibilant shuffling of the foot of butler footman chauffeur parlourmaid housemaid tweeny and i have no doubt cook who be busily tread the measure i suppose you could not sum it up much better than by say that there be a sound of revelry by night the orgy be take place in one of the ground-floor room which have french window open on to the drive and it be to these french window that i now make my way a orchestra be play something with a good deal of zip to it and under happier condition i dare say my foot would have start twitch in time to the melody but i have sterner work before I than to stand hoof it by myself on gravel drive i want that back-door key and i want it instanter scanning the throng within i find it difficult for a while to spot sepping presently however he heave in view do fearfully lissom thing in mid-floor i hi-seppings-ed a couple of time but he mind be too much on he job to be divert and it be only when the swirl of the dance have bring he within prod distance of my forefinger that a quick one to the lower rib enable I to claim he attention the unexpected buffet cause he to trip over he partner 's foot and it be with marked austerity that he turn as he recognize bertram however coldness melt to be replace by astonishment mr wooster i be in no mood for bandy word less of the ` mr wooster ' and more back-door key i say curtly give I the key of the back door sepping he do not seem to grasp the gist the key of the back door sir precisely the brinkley court back-door key but it be at the court sir i click the tongue annoy do not be frivolous my dear old butler i say i have not ride nine mile on a push-bike to listen to you try to be funny you have get it in you trousers pocket no sir i leave it with mr jeeve you do -- what yes sir before i come away mr jeeve say that he wish to walk in the garden before retire for the night he be to place the key on the kitchen window-sill i stare at the man dumbly he eye be clear he hand steady he have none of the appearance of a butler who have have a couple you mean that all this while the key have be in jeeve 's possession yes sir i could speak no more emotion have overmaster my voice i be at a loss and not abreast but of one thing it seem to I there could be no doubt for some reason not to be fathom now but most certainly to be go well into as soon as i have push this infernal sewing-machine of mine over those nine mile of lonely country road and get within striking distance of he jeeve have be do the dirty know that at any given moment he could have solve the whole situation he have keep aunt dahlia and other roost out on the front lawn _ en déshabille _ and worse still have stand calmly by and watch he young employer set out on a wholly unnecessary eighteen-mile bicycle ride i could scarcely believe such a thing of he of he uncle cyril yes with that distorted sense of humor of he uncle cyril might quite conceivably have be capable of such conduct but that it should be jeeve -- i leap into the saddle and stifle the cry of agony which rise to the lip as the bruise person touch the hard leather set out on the homeward journey -23 - i remember jeeve say on one occasion -- i forget how the subject have arise -- he may simply have throw the observation out as he do sometimes for I to take or leave -- that hell have no fury like a woman scorn and until tonight i have always feel that there be a lot in it i have never scorn a woman myself but pongo twistleton once scorn a aunt of he flatly refuse to meet she son gerald at paddington and give he lunch and see he off to school at waterloo and he never hear the end of it letter be write he tell I which have to be see to be believe also two very strong telegram and a bitter picture post card with a view of the little chilbury war memorial on it until tonight therefore as i say i have never question the accuracy of the statement scorn woman first and the rest nowhere be how it have always seem to I but tonight i revise my view if you want to know what hell can really do in the way of fury look for the chap who have be hornswoggle into take a long and unnecessary bicycle ride in the dark without a lamp mark that word unnecessary that be the part of it that really jab the iron into the soul i mean if it be a case of ride to the doctor 's to save the child with croup or go off to the local pub to fetch supplies in the event of the cellar have run dry no one would leap to the handlebars more readily than i young lochinvar absolutely but this business of be put through it merely to gratify one 's personal attendant 's diseased sense of the amusing be a bit too thick and i chafe from start to finish so what i mean to say although the providence which watch over good man see to it that i be enable to complete the homeward journey unscathed except in the billowy portion remove from my path all goat elephant and even owl that look like my aunt agatha it be a frowning and jaundiced bertram who finally come to anchor at the brinkley court front door and when i see a dark figure emerge from the porch to meet I i prepare to let myself go and uncork all that be fizz in the mind jeeve i say it be i bertie the voice which speak sound like warm treacle and even if i have not recognize it immediately as that of the bassett i should have know that it do not proceed from the man i be yearning to confront for this figure before I be wear a simple tweed dress and have employ my first name in its remark and jeeve whatever he moral defect would never go about in skirt call I bertie the last person of course whom i would have wish to meet after a long evening in the saddle but i vouchsafed a courteous what ho there be a pause during which i massaged the calf mine of course i mean you get in then i say in allusion to the change of costume oh yes about a quarter of a hour after you leave jeeve go search about and find the back-door key on the kitchen window-sill ha what nothing i think you say something no nothing and i continue to do so for at this juncture as have so often happen when this girl and i be closet the conversation once more go blue on we the night breeze whisper but not the bassett a bird twitter but not so much as a chirp escape bertram it be perfectly amazing the way she mere presence seem to wipe speech from my lip -- and mine for that matter from hers it begin to look as if we married life together would be rather like twenty year among the trappist monk see jeeve anywhere i ask eventually come through yes in the dining-room the dining-room wait on everybody they be have egg and bacon and champagne what do you say i have say nothing -- merely snort there be something about the thought of these people carelessly revel at a time when for all they know i be probably be drag about the countryside by goat or chew by elephant that strike home at I like a poison dart it be the sort of thing you read about as have happen just before the french revolution -- the haughty noble in they castle callously digging in and quaff while the unfortunate blighter outside be suffer frightful privation the voice of the bassett cut in on these mordant reflection : bertie hullo silence hullo i say again no response whole thing rather like one of those telephone conversation where you sit at you end of the wire say : hullo hullo unaware that the party of the second part have go off to tea eventually however she come to the surface again : bertie i have something to say to you what i have something to say to you i know i say ` what ' oh i think you do not hear what i say yes i hear what you say all right but not what you be go to say oh i see right-ho so that be straighten

you read tennyson not if i can help you remind I so much of those knight of the round table in the ` idyll of the king ' of course i have hear of they -- lancelot galahad and all that lot but i do not see where the resemblance come in it seem to I that she must be think of a couple of other fellow how do you mean you have such a great heart such a fine soul you be so generous so unselfish so chivalrous i have always feel that about you -- that you be one of the few really chivalrous man i have ever meet well dash difficult of course to know what to say when someone be give you the old oil on a scale like that i mutter a oh yes or something on those line and rub the billowy portion in some embarrassment and there be another silence break only by a sharp howl as i rub a bit too hard

like to go and get my maid to put I into something loose you go back to gussie i say and tell he that all be well she give a sort of hiccup and dart forward kiss I on the forehead unpleasant of course but as anatole would say i can take a few smooth with a rough the next moment she be leg it for the dining-room while i have bung the bicycle into a bush make for the stair i need not dwell upon my buckedness it can be readily imagine talk about chap with the noose round they neck and the hangman about to let she go and somebody gallop up on a foam horse wave the reprieve -- not in it absolutely not in it at all i do not know that i can give you a better idea of the state of my feeling than by say that as i start to cross the hall i be conscious of so profound a benevolence toward all create thing that i find myself think kindly thought even of jeeve i be about to mount the stair when a sudden what ho from my rear cause I to turn tuppy be stand in the hall he have apparently be down to

soap-dish but i be too preoccupy to give it a thought still at a loss i return to my room and there be jeeve and it be proof of my fogged condish that my first word to he be word not of reproach and stern recrimination but of inquiry : i say jeeve good evening sir i be inform that you have return i trust you have a enjoyable ride at any other moment a crack like that would have wake the fiend in

you gibber jeeve no sir it be essential that the lady and gentleman should be bring from the house in order that once out of door i could ensure that they remain there for the necessary period of time how do you mean my plan be base on psychology sir how it be a recognize fact sir that there be nothing that so satisfactorily unite individual who have be so unfortunate as to quarrel amongst themselves as a strong mutual dislike for some definite person in my own family if i may give a homely illustration it be a generally accept axiom that in time of domestic disagreement it be necessary only to invite my aunt annie for a visit to heal all breach between the other member of the household in the mutual animosity excite by aunt annie those who have become estrange be reconcile almost immediately remember this it occur to I that be you sir to be establish as the person responsible for the lady and gentleman be force to spend the night in the garden everybody would take so strong a dislike to you that in this common sympathy they would sooner or later come together i would have speak but he continue : and such prove to be the case all as you see sir be now well after you

suggest that you should bicycle to kingham manor when i inform the lady and gentleman that i have find the key and it be bear in upon they that you be have that long ride for nothing they animosity vanish immediately to be replace by cordial amusement there be much laughter there be eh yes sir i fear you may possibly have to submit to a certain amount of good-natured chaff but nothing more all
