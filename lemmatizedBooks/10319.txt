's first year at aknapoli and dave darrin 's second year at annapoli well i 'll meet dick and greg this come thanksgiving at any rate predict midshipman darrin you know what happen the Saturday after thanksgive on franklin field do not you belle you young man of annapoli and west point play football do not you ask belle do we demand dave he eye aglow with enthusiasm do not we though and mark I belle the navy be go to carry away the army 's scalp this year be you go to join the team ask belle i can not say until i get back but i have be train i hope to be call to the team so do dan i hope you and dan both make the eleven cry belle so that you can get away to see the game why we can see the game better retort dave if we do not make the team why be midshipman who do not belong to the eleven allow to see the game ask belle in some surprise be we demand dave belle do not you know what the army-navy game on the Saturday after thanksgive day be like the entire brigade of midshipman and the whole corps of cadet travel over to philadelphium there on franklin field before a average of thirty thousand yell spectator the great annual game of the two great national academy be fight out you have not go to see the annual game at philadelphium before this have you ask miss meade no why not because belle both year at thanksgive time danny boy and i have find ourselves so far behind in we study that we just take the time to stay behind and bone bone bone over we book and you think this year will be different oh yes when a man be half way through annapoli the study become easier to he you see in two year of the awful grind a fellow if he last that long have learn how to study in the right way i be go to get two ticket belle so that you and you mother can go to see the game and of course good old dick can do as much for laura bentley and she mother you 'll come of course to root you hardest for the navy just as laura will go and root for the army by the way have you hear whether dick and greg expect to play on the army eleven when they be here this summer they say they hope to play football with the army that be all i know dave about the plan of dick and greg i hope they do play cry midshipman darrin cheerily even with two such old gridiron war horse as dick and greg against we i believe that the navy team this year have some fellow who can take the army scalp with neatness and despatch dave ramble on for some time now with of the athletic doings at the naval academy it be not that he be so much interested in the subject -- at that particular moment -- but it be certainly fine to have belle meade for a interested listener well you be half way through you course put in belle at last you pass you last annual examination in June yes how do you stand in you exam i come through with honor dave declare unblushingly honor repeat belle delightedly oh dave i do not know you be one of the honor man of you class yes laugh midshipman dave though there be a decidedly serious look in he fine face belle i consider that any fellow who get by the examiner have pass with honor so we be all honor man that be now leave in the class several of the poor fellow have to write home last June ask they parent for the price of a ticket homeward but now that you have get half way through you be pretty sure to go the rest of the way safely belle insist that be almost too much of a brag to make belle the truth be no fellow be safe until he have be commission as a ensign and that be at least two year after he have graduate from the naval academy why even after examination you know a fellow have to go to sea for two year as a midshipman and then take another and final examination at sea a whole lot of fellow who manage to get through the academy find themselves go to piece on that examination at sea and then -- go on belle why if a fellow can not pass he exam he be drop from the service after he have already graduate from academy that be not fair cry belle meade no it be not quite fair assent midshipman dave with a shrug of he shoulder yet what be one go to do about it it be all in the game -- to take or leave who ever make the naval academy and the service so hard as that the girl want to know congress i guess laugh dave but act very likely on the advice of a lot of old admiral who be through themselves and who expect the youngster to know as much as the very admiral why belle when i be a few year younger and first begin to dream about go to the naval academy i have a mental picture of a very jolly life in which we sail the sea and absorb we knowledge i have a idea that the midshipman 's life be make up mainly of jolly lark ashore and afloat with plenty of athletics to keep we from ever feel dull of course i know we have to do some study but i do not imagine the study would be hard for a chap who have already go through a good high school you high school study do help do not they demand belle they help somewhat in the exam to enter annapoli but they have never help I with any of the study that i have have to tackle as a midshipman oh well you 'll get through the girl predict with cheery confidence i shall if it be really in I dave promise but i be not go to do any brag belle until i be safely through and have be out of the wood for a long time and you will not do any bragging then either it be not in you line what be dan dalzell go to do while he be home on leave sleep he say the lazy boy no he be a tired boy belle i think the past year have be even just a little harder on he than it have on I however of course dan will not really sleep he 'll be out by this afternoon just now i imagine that he be talk like wildfire with he mother it be a wrong guess however just then the telephone sound in the next room and belle go to answer it it be you shipmate dan she call laughingly he want to talk with you dave i wonder how the fellow ever guess that i be here smile darrin as he hastily join belle at the ` phone hello hail dalzell at the other end of the wire go to do anything in particular this afternoon david little giant yes i hope to make myself more or less agreeable to miss meade a small crowd

club house on the river 's bank on the way across town dave have be note the direction and force of the wind he do not altogether like it but do not say anything at the float he find tom foss ab canty ellum wright and susie dane await the midshipman and they fair companion all ready and wait for you amateur sailor call foss laughingly and here be the boat say be not she really a beauty good line nod dave darrin and she look speedy but you have change you mind about go out this afternoon have not you foss why demand the young fellow in very evident astonishment look at the water respond dave point to the white-cap which be run rather high for a inland stream pooh you be not afraid of a little foam on top of the water be you demand foss the wave be run pretty high for the inch of freeboard that you boat have remark darrin quietly and look at the sky to windward there be a bit more blow come out of those cloud yet say what do they teach you at annapoli grin foss to go sail only in calm weather since you ask dave reply as quietly as before though a slight flush mount to he face one of the thing they teach we at the naval academy be consideration for woman now if just we four fellow be go out i would not say a word do not think we girl be afraid break in belle with spirit i be well aware that you be not afraid darrin reply turn and look at she but i be afraid belle of what i might think of myself afterwards if i be a party to take you out in this boat when the river be run so much to whitecap do you think the boat be one of the kind that will turn turtle and sink the crowd demand tom foss flushing in turn i tell you darrin the craft be as tight and sound and as manageable as any boat of she length to be find anywhere on fresh water she be a fine boat dave assent but i do not feel like be responsible for what may happen to the young lady who be more especially under my escort and care there be too big a chance of danger this afternoon foss pooh mr sailor laugh ellum wright i 'll show you that some folk who do not know what annapoli look like be not frighten by toy wave miss ellum thereupon step into the launch and seat herself miss susie follow be not you people go asked ab canty i be not go if dave consider it so unwise that he would be worry about we safety belle answer promptly go laura call foss no though i thank you miss bentley reply if mr darrin object on the score of safety i be not go to torment he by disregard he opinion i be of about the same opinion as darrin if anyone care to know break in dan dalzell tom foss look at the other half of he party quizzically then call to canty cast off ab ha ha i never think to see united state sailor and embryo naval officer so much afraid of a little toss water chug-chug ellum and susie be laugh a bit teasingly as the motor start and the little craft dart away from the float and take to the wave beyond dave do not answer instead he grip dan 's nearer wrist muttering : do not you say it danny say what whatever hot word be come to you lip as long as we feel that we be right in not risk belle and laura never mind what the other think and say this breeze be so fine suggest laura what do you say if we seat ourselves here and watch the river for a while accordingly the four young people seat themselves the launch be the only craft in sight that be away from she mooring a sailboat and three canoe lay tie to the lee side of the float that be the off-side from the weather even they rock a good deal what kind of weather be come ask belle it be go to be pretty squally in all probability speak up midshipman dan do you see the big puff of wind in the cloud yonder it must take a sailor to see that sort of thing remark belle what i see in the cloud look like big fluffy mass of cotton streak with something darker that be the wind nod dave darrin now girl i do not want you to think I a muff that wind may swerve and not come this way although in all probability the wind will get this way and the water will be rougher if it do get rougher on the river and if we have take you two out and the boat have capsize then by some chance we might not have be able to get you to shore what would you folk then say to we if we have have the miserable luck to survive you you do just right laura declare promptly to tell the truth i do not want to disappoint either of you boy this afternoon but i do not believe the wind be quiet enough for boat on the river but mother remind I that i be go with two young man who have be train as sailor and that i ought to be as safe as i would in the home parlor well be not you smile belle meade do you really want to go out on the river belle dave ask not when you do not believe it to be safe i suppose foss will be joke around town about we be afraid of the water muttered dan what do you care ask dave quietly you be responsible to the united state government -- not to a few private citizen on the street of gridley you 'll take we out on the water before you leave be over will not you urge belle a dozen of time if you care to go dave reply quickly in a sailboat quiz belle it must be great fun to sail and i have never be in a sailboat i would rather take you out in a good solid rowboat dave answer slowly why have not you have much sailboat practice at annapoli yet we have have some darrin nod but i be afraid i do not believe much in small sailboat for girl ' party oh very well now belle you will begin to believe that i be a muff at heart darrin remonstrate i will not anyway dave laura break in i can see that you be merely determine that we shall take no risk when we go out with you i shall feel very safe in whatever you propose for water sport it be a good deal better to be safe than sorry when you have girl under you care dan dalzell add the motor boat a fast though a low-hulled craft have be long out of sight up the river presently there come a new turn to the wind dan wet a forefinger and hold it up to the breeze i hope foss have sense enough to run in somewhere and tie up until the come squall blow over dalzell remark be we go to have a storm belle ask quickly not rain if that be what you mean darrin reply but i believe the river be go to be pretty rough before long ere two minute more have pass dave suddenly rise and straighten himself look downstream girl he cry do you see the big roller come in truth the surface of the river be now begin to behave in a unusual way where heretofore the water have be choppy and whitecapp the water now break in longer foam-crested wave owe to the course of the wind the wave be roll upstream within five minute from the time when dave first call attention to the rougher water the wave have considerably increase in size oh i be glad i be not out on the water shiver laura so be i belle admit candidly do you believe tom foss can bring he boat down against such wave laura inquire oh no doubt he have have sense enough to run in somewhere and tie up predict midshipman dan charitably i hope so murmured belle but tom be a awfully stubborn fellow toot too-oo-oot sound a whistle up the river by ginger there come foss 's boat now mutter dan stand up and stare why do not the idiot make land he be get he craft away on the other side of the river look for quieter water muttered dave uneasily well be not that right ask belle right yes unless he make the mistake of try to cross the stream nod darrin then he 'll run he craft into the trough of the sea and -- well what demand belle as dave pause then when he be in the trough a big wave may roll he small boat over dan finish for he comrade do you really think there be danger of that demand laura look anxious i do not know murmured dave but i wish i have some way of signaling foss some way so that he could understand the signal what good would it do demand midshipman dalzell grimly tom would only laugh and say it be more old maidishness on the part of navy man there -- confound the idiot suddenly blaze dave darrin he be cross look at that boat wallow in the trough jupiter there she go over -- nearly all four young people on the float hold they breath for a instant the motor launch after almost have turn turtle right itself i wish i be at the wheel of the boat for about three minute mutter darrin hoarsely at that moment laura and belle both scream while dan dalzell shout : there she go -- for sure this time a bigger wave than usual have half fill the launch and cause it to careen before the little craft could right itself a second and a third wave roll along have complete the work the launch have sink chapter ii prove they training in the same instant without a word to each other dave darrin and dalzell have do the same thing that be they start to run and at the same time doff coat and vest leave these garment to flutter behind they as they reach the sailboat both midshipman cast off they shoe dave leap into the boat while dalzell throw off the bowline then board like a flash both youngster go at the lashing of the mainsail there be not a reef in dan discover go to take time for a close reef dave there be not time darrin mutter with drop of cold perspiration on he forehead as he toil we 'll have to go out under a full sail dan great scott mutter dalzell we may be too late to save any one as it be there jump to the halyard i have get the sheet dan dalzell begin to hoist with a will in a incredibly short time he have the sail hoist all the way up while darrin stern and whitefaced crouch and brace himself by the tiller grip the sheet with he left hand in a twinkling darrin have the wind in he canvas they have nearly a fair wind as they bound away from the float during these few instant of preparation neither belle nor laura have speak both girl realize the gravity of the situation and they know that a word from they might distract the rescuer from the work in hand know that he have the high fast wind with he dave steer straight for the last spot where he have see the motor launch though the boat be no longer visible and the distance too great for see the head of the swimmer if there be any darrin have take he bearing by tree on the further shore upstream at first to keep the sailboat from capsize the young skipper at the helm let the sheet well out then when dan hurriedly rejoin he darrin pass the sheet over to he comrade as to one who would know exactly what to do with it dan perched himself on the weather gunwale he weight there serve as ballast to keep the craft from capsize yet even so everything have to be do with the utmost skill for with the mainsail up the least fluke in handle the boat would send she over we have get to go fast and take all the chance mutter dave sure nod midshipman dan understandingly it would be no great scare to we if we do heel over into the drink it might mean a different story though for those who be already sop up the wet be not they splendid fellow cry laura yes answer belle she eye snap and she face glowing though i will not claim that they be any finer than you own west point boy that bring a add flush to the color in laura bentley 's face and she eye sparkle she gratitude for dick prescott now at west point with he chum greg holme have be she high school sweetheart and doubtless be to become she army sweetheart after he have make sure of he career dave and dan be expert glow miss bentley they 'll know just what to do they be better than mere expert return belle meade they be strong and manly to the core and with they there be no such word as fear when there be a duty to be do both dave and dan be peer fixedly ahead all the time that they drive the sailboat toward the scene of the late disaster i think i see a head cry darrin boy or girl demand midshipman dalzell can not tell at this distance and now the next wave have blot out what i think i see we have get to be patient utter dan the position of the midshipman be far from be free of danger with all they coolness and they undoubted skill in boat handling there be grave danger with the mainsail set that at any instant wind and wave would capsize the boat indeed dave be run the lee gunwale under water half the time trust to the human ballast supply by he comrade to keep they afloat see anything now demand dave no utter dan though i be work my eye three shift to try to make out something i 'll have to go to a oculist as soon as i get through with this this eyestrain be awful midshipman dan dalzell be really unconscious of the fact that he be joke it be second nature with he he would have jest -- unconsciously -- with death in its most awful form there i see a head -- two of they cry midshipman dave suddenly as he half rise and point hurrah -- from dan dan let the boat 's head fall off a point in order that he might see better around the mast on the weather side just where he must head he craft in the last dash in it be foss and ellum wright call dan as the fly sailboat get in closer over the foam-crested wave no it be not foss have susie can you make out canty and ellum demand darrin hoarsely not a sign dave maybe he be go under try to save ellum canty be one of we gridley high school boy so i would expect he to have both the nerve and the grace to go down with a girl if he could not save she as well as himself mutter darrin there be canty just come up can you make out ellum 's head no look hard i do not see she and -- there what be up nothing return dalzell soberly canty 's down -- just go down again i hope he be go down try to find and rescue ellum murmured dave they be now so close that the young midshipman would have be able to hear the shout of the imperil one have it not be that the wind blow the sound of voice away from the would-be rescuer better ease off the sheet a bit i guess davy call dan as he suit the action to the word we do not go to run 'em down no as he speak dave darrin bring the boat slightly around they be now close enough to see that tom foss be support dead weight in the person of susie who be unconscious wait the word from you on the sheet davy nod dan as the boat draw close to the only pair of survivor now visible let go the sheet call dave a instant later and dan let it run off clear hand the end of the rope to darrin can you head susie this way foss dalzell call i would rather have help come the faint answer tom foss be evidently well spend by he exertion in keep up the girl so long splash dan dalzell be in the water without wait to hear more the athletic young midshipman swam with a steadiness and speed that be glorious to see many a excellent swimmer in smooth water would dread buffet with such wave as be now roll dave darrin meanwhile hold on to the tiller and the paid-out sheet ready to maneuver the now pitch roll boat at a instant 's notice it take all he seamanship to keep the craft afloat though the sailboat be far better model for such water than the motor launch have be give she over to I and save yourself command dalzell cheerily as he reach tom foss think you can make it old fellow if i can not i ought to drown retorted tom foss as he strike out none too strongly this be all my fault you fellow give I better advice than i have sense to follow dan with a skill that he have acquire directly from the excellent instruction give he by the swimming master at the naval academy be now pilot the unconscious form of susie dane toward the sailboat even encumber as he be dan make the boat before tom foss could accomplish that feat alone truth to tell foss be very nearly all in have rescue be delay a few moment longer foss and he fair companion must have sink get hold of she davy call dan as he range up on the weather side of the toss boat darrin promptly lean over and lift the unconscious girl into the boat by the time he have do that tom foss reach up both hand seize the boat 's stern go to help I in he call i do not know dave answer dubiously if we can find ellum wright there may not be room with such a sea run this boat will not hold many no matter about I then mutter tom if ellum be not find right away i do not believe i care about go back to gridley dave 's response be swiftly to knot a noose and let it down over tom 's shoulder the other end of the line he make fast astern dalzell in the meantime have swim back again susie danes lay as still as death in the bottom of the boat as dalzell get back where he have first reach foss and susie he espy the head of ab canty some distance away ab call dan here what have become of ellum oh i wish i know be she afloat at all demand dan swimming nearer yes i keep she up for a couple of minute maybe then she get more scared wound she arm tight around I and we both sink we have a struggle under water i free myself but when i come to the top i find that my hand be clutch nothing but she empty jersey there it be now chatter ab he tooth knock against each other as he point to the garment in question on the top of a distant wave then ab sink for just a instant dalzell think canty have go below on purpose dan swam closer to be of assistance then he see the bubble of air come up rapidly canty give out -- he be go to drown gasp midshipman dan with horror like a flash dan dive below find and clutch at canty the young man return the grip with interest but midshipman dalzell struggle to the surface with he ab canty be exhaust out of he head and altogether past reasoning dan hate to do it but he have to strike the young man in the forehead canty give a gasp and cease to resist dave darrin watch have run the boat up close alongside as soon as the struggle pair appear above the wave you 'll have to take he in davy announce midshipman dalzell canty be not strong enough to tow behind and i be come aboard for a fresh look before i dive for miss wright you be go to stay aboard and manage the boat retort darrin quietly i be go in next oh all right if you want to half grumble dan but i be just begin to get use to it and to like it dan however follow order and take he seat by tiller and sheet as soon as they have tow canty safely in the boat tom foss lie and hold on at the stern be begin to chatter hard but say he be all right a brief instant of consultation the two midshipman hold then dave darrin hold he hand before he dive hard and deep into the water after nearly a minute he come up again but only to take a observation then he sink to explore more of the space under water for five minute darrin continue this make four dive in all and sink twice without diving i can not give this up and abandon a girl he mutter dan i have get to take more account of the current and work gradually downstream a little later dave rise with a whoop the instant that he head show above the water i have get she dave announce though he voice be hoarse and panting hurrah come from dan as he see the girl 's head show above the surface dalzell haul on the sheet run the boat in close dave grasp at the rail on the weather quarter while dan bent over he haul hard and so ellum wright be drag unconscious into the boat i would stay here in the water with you tom explain dave but i have get to be in the boat to do my share of handle she th-th-that 's all r-r-r-r-right chatter poor foss i be d-d-d-doing f-f-f-fine here -- c-c-c-couldn ' t h-help in the b-b-b-boat while lie to it have take some fine management on the part of the midshipman to keep the sailboat from capsize and now on this rough wave-strewn river they have to tack back against a nearly head wind look at the crowd on the clubhouse float gasp dan as soon as the naval chum have get they craft under way good thing mutter darrin we 'll need plenty of help i wonder how the crowd get wind of the thing in such short time you forget nudged darrin that there be a telephone in the clubhouse laura and belle be not give to lose they head undoubtedly they have be ` phone to gridley then they can not have overlook the need of physician venture dan especially as laura be the daughter of one as the boat draw nearer to the float the noise of cheer be bear to the ear of the midshipman more of the hero racket utter dan disgustedly i hope this will not get into the newspaper grunt darrin in a tone of something like real alarm say the fellow of the brigade would not do a thing but make we mount chair and read all the fulsome gush about this rescue and then after we would finish a straight reading groan dan we would have to sing it next to the tune of ` columbia the pride of the ocean ' ` gem of the ocean ' dan darrin correct though in the middle of the river the sailboat have many a close shave from capsize in the strong puff of wind especially with the load that the little craft carry yet dan dalzell at the tiller bring the boat at last in under the lee side of the float and there a score of pair of willing hand reach out with offer of help dr bentley be in the crowd as be two other gridley physician there be also two trained nurse and one of

spiteful fellow dave you must be on you guard against he belle urge i guess ardmore be wish he own guard have be more effective smile the midshipman caspar ardmore be busy within a hour after dave 's summary handling of he ardmore have never be consider a truly bad fellow though he be foppish conceited and wholly unable to understand why anything that he want should be deny he belle be now two year beyond she high school day and have develop into a most attractive young woman ardmore have fall victim to she charm and have decide that he would make a better husband for she than any naval officer could hence the young dandy have pursue miss meade with he attention upon find she with dave he have hope in he foolish way to put a end to darrin 's pretension ardmore therefore have meet only disaster be now engage in draw up a complaint to be send to the secretary of the navy complain that he have be set upon and treat with severe physical violence by midshipman darrin nor be there great difficulty in find three man out of the small crowd that have witness the assault to swear to affidavit that they have see darrin knock caspar ardmore down repeatedly all this evidence ardmore get together with great relish and mail the mass of stuff that same night to the secretary of the navy at washington then ardmore go out of town for three day behind he he leave a active toady who promise to keep watch of matter and to advise he it be through this toady that dave receive a intimation that he case would be attend to at washington belle also receive a hint and with it she go to darrin can the fellow really make any trouble for you dave she ask anxiously why yes admit dave anyone can make trouble for a midshipman to the extent that the charge must be investigate by the navy department if the secretary be satisfy that i be a reckless sort of bully he would decide that i be unfit to be a officer of the navy chapter iv in the view of the navy department dave darrin do not let the news of the charge disturb he outward serenity though he be inwardly aware that perjure evidence might work great harm to he future career until he be advise by the navy department that charge have be make against he he really could do nothing in the matter but that letter from the secretary be not long in come the letter inform midshipman darrin that he have be accuse of severely assault a citizen without just provocation and contain also some of the circumstance allege by caspar ardmore dave be command to forward he defense promptly this darrin do in a courteous answer as briefly as he could properly make it he admit knock ardmore down but state that he do it in resent a insult offer by ardmore to a young lady under he -lrb- darrin 's -rrb- escort at the time this letter he show belle it be the first step on my side in the matter he explain with a smile i should think the secretary of the navy ought to be satisfy with you answer and drop it at once reply belle he may but you think he will not it be likely belle that there will be a court of inquiry at least oh dear cry belle a few tear gleam in she eye now why should so much fuss be make over the matter because i be be train to be a officer in the navy a officer must be a gentleman as well any charge affect a naval officer 's honor or courtesy must be investigate in order that the government may know whether the accuse be fit to hold a officer 's commission the government would not be deal justly with the people if such standard be not observe and i be the cause of all this trouble for you cry belle no belle you be not you have nothing to do with the matter except indirectly ardmore be the one responsible for the trouble if he have not insult you he would not have get into any difficulty it seem too bad just the same it be annoy that be all dave assure she if i have to do the same thing over again for the same reason i would do it cheerfully mr meade hear of it all from she daughter without say a word as to she intention the mother herself write a letter to the secretary of the navy mr meade set forth the persistent fashion in which ardmore have seek to force he attention upon belle to the latter 's great annoyance mr meade 's letter declare that darrin have take the only possible means of save belle from future annoyance the mother 's letter to the secretary conclude by offer to procure statement from other people on the subject if the secretary wish mr meade receive a prompt reply from washington the secretary thank she for she statement and express entire belief in they by the same mail caspar ardmore just return to gridley receive this letter : refer to you letter and complaint bearing date of September 6 the department have to advise you that other statement have also be receive bear upon you accusation of a assault allege to have be commit upon you person by midshipman david darrin it be claim by the signer of other statement include that of midshipman darrin that

department beg to advise you that have not midshipman darrin resent the gross insult tender the woman under he protection he would thereby by such inaction have render himself liable to dismissal from the navy it be always the first duty of a gentleman to afford ample protection to any woman under he escort and care should you deny the statement quote above in favor of midshipman darrin and should you further desire to have the matter bring to issue before a duly appoint court of inquiry before which you would be require to appear as a material witness this department will be glad so to be advise if you do not make formal application for the appointment of such court of inquiry within the next few day no further action will be take in the matter very respectfully you obedient servant -lrb- sign -rrb- leok b chamber _ secretary of the navy _ as he read and realize how flat he charge have fall ardmore 's face pass through several shades of red of all the government red tape he mutter wrathfully i do not think the fool secretary would do anything like this i think he would just call darrin down hard and plenty and perhaps bounce he out of the naval academy humph i guess all these navy folk stand together there do not seem to be much justice about it ardmore thereupon take another vacation away from gridley a few day after he go midshipman darrin receive a brief communication from the secretary of the navy state that no further action have be take by the accuser and that the department be satisfy that the midshipman 's conduct have be fully justified therefore the matter would not be call to the attention of the naval academy authority for action so you see smile dave as he call at belle 's home and hand she the letter there be never any need to be worry until trouble break in earnest oh i be so glad cry belle she eye shine with delight i hope you will not meet that ardmore fellow again while you be home if i do promise dave i shall merely look over he head when we meet unless he repeat the offense that bring he that thrash ardmore however do not appear in gridley again during dave 's leave of absence dave and dan taste to the full the delight of life in the old home town until the day when it be necessary for they to take train and return to annapoli mother laura and i will go down to annapoli whenever we hear from you as to the best time for come miss meade promise at the railway station then she find chance to murmur in a voice too low for any of the other present to hear : and i 'll try hard not to be such a goose as i be last winter she refer to the trouble that have be make by another girl at annapoli the circumstance of which be wholly familiar to the reader of the earlier volume of this series i do not blame you for the way you feel last winter dave assure she heartily next time however i hope you 'll come to I first for a explanation there be not go to be any next time dave three minute later two midshipman be be whirl through the city limit of gridley chapter v navy football in the air back on the old familiar academy grounds both dave and dan undergo a unconscious brace as they pass the watchman at the main gate and step on each with a suit case in hand to the leave with bancroft hall in the distance they first move be as it must be to report they return to the officer in charge by that officer the two midshipman be assign to the room that they be to occupy during the come academic year once behind they door both young man hasten to get out of cit clothes and back into they beloved uniform there be worse livery to wear than uncle sam 's murmured dan dalzell when have array himself he glance down lovingly at the neat dark blue much worse reply dave briefly as have dress he set to work to help make they quarter neat enough to please even the captious eye of the discipline officer by the time that the two midshipman finish police they quarter no housekeeper in the land could have find the least sign of disorder rap-tap sound briskly at the door come in call dave the door open reveal midshipman hepson of the first class be you fellow to rights he call come in hepson urge dave yes we be to rights as far as quarter go hepson come no more than inside the door before he halt ask briskly : have you anything on nothing but we clothes grin dan and some hair you have no appointment or engagement then persist hepson my be here will not interfere with anything that you want to do not in the least dave reply oh then i 'll invite myself to a chair declare the first classman suit the action to the word now you fellow can guess why i be here you be captain of this year 's football eleven dave reply have that anything to do with you call everything admit hepson briskly have you fellow any notion that we have a poor eleven so far this year why i think it pretty good from the practice work that i see do in August darrin answer slowly a pretty good eleven do not win game sir retort hepson man we have get to strengthen the team all along the line or i 'll go down in naval academy history as captain of the worst lot of dub who ever chase a pigskin around the field be it as bad as that demand dan open he eye dalzell say hepson we eleven be rotten sir -- simply and fiercely useless if it be as bad as that hint dan innocently would not it be a prime good idea to draw we eleven from the field this year what strike the navy 's color and especially to the army glare mr hepson what be you talk about then i guess nod dan that we 'll have to stay in the ring and let it go by apologize to the army for get in they way on the field the Saturday after thanksgive we will not do that either by jingo retort midshipman hepson but we have get to strengthen we team we have get to practice every minute that the commandant will allow we for practice we have get to make a front-rank team out of -- nearly nothing be not there any good player who have be hold back ask dave darrin two that i know of darrin rejoin hepson fix he eye keenly on dave who be they you and dalzell we have not back out or refuse duty darrin retort quickly no but you have not push yourselve forward any either well we be hardly team material object dave modestly however i 'll promise for myself and dalzell too that we 'll turn out to all the practice we can and work like blaze will you cry midshipman hepson delightedly he jump up grasp each midshipman by the hand in turn but you do not want to bank on we too much darrin continue you know we have never play on anything as big as the navy team we use to be good enough little player on a country school team but it be different here let the coach and the captain find that out then grunt hepson but you 'll work you 'll try to make good you 'll try to make the team and some history we have lay down we life for the navy at any point and in any sort of game rejoin dave darrin simply good bully that be the way i like to hear a fellow talk glow hepson make toward the door you 'll turn out for practice to-morrow afternoon without fail if we be physically able promise midshipman darrin awfully oblige to you fellow cry hepson throw the door open and now you will not mind if i cut my visit short i have a lot of fellow to see you know the door bang and hepson be go say how 's the navy go to win under a chap as nervous as hepson ask dan that be not nervousness danny boy if it be not what be it then electricity elec -- oh say now -- it be electricity dave insist he be a live wire that man hepson he 'll pull we through on the field this year if any one can there be nothing like look on the bright side of thing murmur dalzell drum on he chair i would rather see hepson under estimate the navy team go on dave than feel too sure that it be invincible still i believe that the navy be go to put forward a mighty strong eleven this year though of course that be not say that we can beat the army why not demand dalzell almost fiercely because no matter how good a line we put forward the army may put forward a better now do not go toot the army 's bugle i be just consider the average of chance darrin return danny boy sometimes the navy win but most of the game of past year have go to the army so the chance be that we 'll be beat this year not if i have to die on the line to stop it glow dalzell at red heat maybe you will not even get on the navy line perhaps i will not either danny boy but you know we see by the army and navy journal that prescott and holme be play on the west point eleven this year holme be not necessarily such a much be he flare dan greg holme be a pretty handy man on the football field retort darrin warmly none ought to know that better than we after we have see holme pull out so many victory for the old high school team of course prescott be the better player but holme can back he up to amazing advantage do not we play about as good a game as that pair dalzell demand i do not know dave answer thoughtfully perhaps not quite as good a game you see in the old high school day dick prescott use to lead and i often back up he play so one could hardly compare we if you be in such a blue funk over the navy 's chance you would better keep off the line-up muttered midshipman dalzell oh i be in no funk return darrin smile however i be not go to be betray into any bragging until we have wipe the field up with the army -- if we can rap-tap come on the door i 'll wager that be farley whisper darrin or page -- from dan come in call dave the door open to let in farley with page crowd on he heel dave and dan both hasten forward to clasp hand with these try chum of other day see hepson ask dan yes nod farley he tell we he have gobble you hepson just leave we you be go to be on the eleven press dan if we can make it nod farley slowly i would like to play too but i be hope that the navy can hit on some one better than myself cold foot grin dan not exactly farley answer with a slight flush but it be a big thing to play on the navy 's fight eleven it seem almost too big a responsibility for any but a demi-god demi-god do not play football jeer dan they be nothing but idol anyway and they be two thousand year out of date what we want on the navy line be real human flesh and blood there 'll be blood on the doorstep of the moon if the army carry thing away from we this year predict page mournfully well all we can do be we best declare dave we 'll do that too and do it mightily wow what be that ta-ra-ra-ta-ra-ta sound musically in the corridor supper formation by jove gasp dan farley and page flee without a word soon the deck of bancroft hall swarm with young life then outside to seaward the brigade fall in by company military command ring out briskly roll be call report make and the brigade march in to supper what a joyous noisy affair it be some license in the way of boisterousness be allow this evening and most of the young man take full advantage of the fact swat a slice of bread soak in a glass of water and knead into a soppy ball strike dalzell full in the back of the neck plaster he collar and send a sticky mess down he spine i 'll fight the man who do that promise midshipman dan wheeling around then add cautiously : if he be a graduate there be naturally no graduate present except the officer at the furthest corner of the mess hall dan 's challenge provoke laughter many other prank be play but there be not room to record they here the meal over and the brigade dismiss some of the midshipman -- there be nearly eight hundred of they -- go to they own quarter or visit the room of crony hundred take the air in the grounds almost the sole topic be football hepson speedily have most of the member of the big squad gather about he other who could not hope to make in football gather near-by as though afraid of lose some of the talk remember gentleman until the army game be over it be to be nothing this year but work work work warn midshipman hepson with intense earnestness with nothing but football in the air dan soon catch the infection even more deeply than he chum hang it i be a dub groan dan lot of the fellow give up they leave in order to be here and practice why in the mischief do not i for the same reason that perhaps i do not sacrifice leave reply dave i be not ask to and you be not either be you no but i wish i have fling myself at hepson 's head and make he take I instead of go off to gridley like a deserter it be October now and what earthly chance dave have you and i to get in shape we 'll do we best danny boy or stay off the line there be nothing to be gain by lose we head regret will be equally worthless hepson call one midshipman have anyone invent the navy yell for this year yell repeat the football captain scornfully it be more to the purpose to fit ourselves to do something worth yell about have hepson get the blues ask another midshipman or only the rattle football be still in the air dominate the mind of the midshipman when a turn of the master switch shut off the light at tap chapter vi the hate of a rival the day follow be one of intense almost complicated routine there be book and supplies to be draw for the new academic year there be uniform and other article of apparel to be draw the section be detail and section marcher to be appoint there be detail of military organization to be announce some of the young man have to go up for physical examination even if only of the eye at the afternoon recreation hour hepson lead the big football squad out to the field hundred of midshsipmen go there to see how the navy would show up in the vitally important test at the outset hepson be everywhere like a buzz excitable wasp nor do he prove to be minus a sting at time i think sir suggest hepson go over to lieutenant-commander haven the head coach that it would be well for we to know something about the run speed of every candidate very good mr hepson try out any man that you be curious about reply the officer darrin dalzell page farley white bryant call the captain of the navy team each of you pick up a ball line up at this goal-line joyce will you take a stop-watch and go over to the other goal-line adam go along and assist joyce i want a record of the time it take each man to cover the distance run as fast as he can with the ball the man designate take they place i 'll run you first darrin announce the captain go like a streak if you can if you fall down it count zero start when i say ` go ' be you ready quite ready go at the word dave speed away like a shot hepson give a hand signal as he utter the start word that the time-keeper at the other end might know when to release the watch dave 's time be note then dan take a try cover the distance in only two fifth of a second more time than darrin have require farley be a second and three fifth behind darrin 's time page a full two seconds behind white and bryant then run but only succeed in about tie page 's work then six more man be call to the line and try out after that a third squad by this time midshipman hepson have he mind about make up as to the relative speed of some of the most likely man for the final navy team get out for some kick now call hepson when be you go to play football growl one man midshipman hepson turn on he like a flash jetson there be a substitute captain in the squad but you be not the man neither be you one of the coach oh you make I -- begin jetson but midshipman hepson cut he short with : if you can not keep silence when you have nothing to say you absence from the field will be consider a favor to the whole squad jetson scowl but say nothing more neither do he offer to retire from the field jetson have always be a kicker and a trouble mosquito whisper dan dalzell to he chum oh in a lot of way jetson be a nice fellow darrin reply quietly the greatest trouble that ail he be that he have just a trifle too large opinion of the importance of he own opinion there be a lot of we trouble in that way the kick practice be put through with dash and vim then midshipman hepson after a brief conference with the head coach call off the line-up for the provisional navy team follow this with a roster of the second team or rustler so call because they force the man of the navy team to rustle to keep they place dave darrin be call off for left tackle dan for left end farley and page hold the corresponding position on the right end of the line-up begin the game the rustler to have the ball call lieutenant-commander haven and mix it up lively navy call hepson who both on account of he size and other qualification play center at the whistle-blast the rustler kick it off -- a beautiful long arching curve the ball come to quarter-back who pass it to dave darrin then the fun begin the navy line hit the rustler hard and try to bump through dan dalzell devoted every ounce of he strength and every turn of he energy to boost darrin through -- and dave himself be not idle there be a instant of sullen hard resistance then somehow dave be shoot through the oppose line like a deer he speed dan hang to he flank it be up to the rustler ' halfback now and that bulky young midshipman leap to the fray cleverly bar the way at least the rustler ' halfback think he have darrin block it be never wise to take too much for grant as the halfback plant himself for the grapple dave suddenly drop through that opponent 's grip and go to the ground as though he have be shoot through dave darrin go under and past on one side between the halfback 's leg he be up again with dan at he back fullback come at they but dan bump that player aside dave dash on across the line score a touchdown never have the gridiron be the scene of greater excitement than in that rousing moment darrin darrin darrin come hoarsely from hundred of throat dalzell dalzell come the next gusty roar hepson wipe a moist brow with one hand there be two real player if they can keep that up mutter the captain of the eleven jetson have be the tackle oppose to dave just now jetson be nurse a bump to he vanity how on earth do i ever happen to let darrin through jetson demand of himself i will not do it again anyway if i can only make darrin look small i may get he place on the navy eleven darrin be a good fellow but i have get to make the team confound he the kick for goal fail then the navy take the ball and promptly enough the rustler come back with it jetson carry dave and dan meet the ball-carrier the rustler ' support fail and jetson go down with the ball nor could the second team advance the ball so it presently come to the navy man again i want you to put it through again like a cannon-ball darrin midshipman hepson whisper as they pass so the quarter-back call for a repetition of the play give different signal dave receive the ball with a rush of he old-time fervor and confidence dan start behind he as full of fire as ever in a fraction of a second the impact of the two oppose line come jetson go down one of he leg fly between darrin 's in such a way as to constitute a foul dave darrin go down on top of the ball half a dozen player sprawl over he the referee 's whistle blow jetson that be a mean deliberate trip remark darrin as he spring to he foot he speak coolly with a warning flash in he eye not on my part retort jetson you thrust you leg between mine as you go down coach sign to referee not to renew the game for the moment then lieutenant-commander haven and the two team captain crowd close i do not do it deliberately as you charge retorted jetson hot with anger you deny it insist dave i do on you word as a gentleman you do not intend a foul trip demand midshipman darrin i have already answer you answer I on you word as a gentleman i do not have to very good then retort dave turn away with a meaning smile hold on i pledge you my word as a gentleman that i do not intend to make a foul trip say jetson swiftly realize the error of he refusal in the meantime lieutenant-commander haven have turn to motley of the first class who be serve as referee mr motley demand coach do you see just what happen yes sir do you call it a foul trip i do sir if i be referee in a regular game i would penalize the team and order the player from the field mr jetson -- begin the coach but swift as a flash dave darrin interpose though respectfully salute at the same time will you pardon I sir mr jetson have give I he word that he do not intend a foul trip i accept he word without reservation very good then nod coach but mr jetson you will do well to be careful in the future and avoid even the appearance of evil yes sir very good sir answer jetson look decidedly sheepish in give he word jetson have tell the truth or have intend to the exact truth be that he really do not realize what he have do until it be too late to avoid the foul he have mean to stop darrin somehow pull that scrimmage off again direct coach haven dryly the ball be place the whistle sound and again dave receive the ball and try to break through with the rustler prepare for the move it be block and the ball be down jetson feel he face burn he know well enough that many of the player regard he with suspicion i suppose that suspicion will stick and my chance of make the navy eleven be now scantier than ever mutter the unfortunate midshipman to himself the whistle blow before any further advantage have be gain coach and midshipman hepson have gain considerable insight into the work of the team mr hepson say coach aside in the interval that follow you have do well i think to place two such man as darrin and dalzell on the provisional team i be glad you think so sir reply the navy football captain for that be the way it strike I if you keep they at the left flank you 'll have something like dynamite there smile coach mr darrin go through like a cannon-ball and dalzell be always just where darrin need he these man have play together before and they be use to team work sir say midshipman hepson so where do they play before come to annapoli on what be in they day one of the best high school eleven 's go sir oho do you know mr hepson they play more like college man than anything else it must have be a bully high school team that graduate they from the little that i have hear sir that high school team be a great one coach and captain walk back to the scene you will now play another ten-minute period direct mr haven jetson will withdraw from the second eleven during the next period and doyle will take he place so that be what coach and team captain be hatch up think midshipman jetson that give I a black eye and my chance of make the navy eleven be now worse than ever probably i will not even make sub as navy and rustler again collide in the fray jetson watch dave 's work narrowly furiously darrin always be a smooth one jetson declare angrily to himself and now just because he raise a ` holler ' my football prospects be set back for this year probably i can not make the eleven next year either and it be all darrin 's fault in form the second half the coach call : mr jetson will resume he place as right tackle on the second eleven jetson 's not here sir call a midshipman where be he ask coach haven i think he go off the field sir to un-tog he should not have leave the field without permission remark the coach coldly jetson hear of the remark that evening and he anger against dave darrin increase chapter vii do jetson do it no sooner have release from study sound through big and handsome bancroft hall than there come a tap at dave darrin 's door come in call dave hepson come in first follow by a score of other midshipman say i do not hear assembly blow lately remark dan dalzell close a new text-book and look up with a smile of welcome be we intrude -- so many of we inquire hepson halt not on I anyway answer dave pleasantly as for danny boy do not mind the little chap he really believe that study release sound before supper-call come right in all of you fellow dan bark but will not bite and take seat all of you do urge dan with unnecessary hospitality after the table and the chair be use up we 'll provide tack for the rest do this little boy ever have a serious streak ask one of the caller regard dan with feigned interest yes whenever he find himself mark down to 21 in more than three study laugh dave oh that be no laughing matter grimace another of the visit midshipman i do not suppose you can guess what we come to talk about go on midshipman hepson at a wild guess it might be football hazard darrin wonderful marvelous gasp another visitor darry we have come in to tell you that we believe that you and you erratic roommate be go to save a desperate situation for we resume the captain of the navy team not that we be destitute of good player before but we lack enough of different kind to make a strong all-around eleven now we have a team that we be not afraid after more work to put up against anything that the army can show we now i would not be too sure urge dave confidence be all right but do not let it rob we of a jot of practice and work be you afraid of the army darry demand hepson i be not go to be too cock-sure if the story be true that prescott and holme be out with the army team this year be they such great player demand hepson they be dave respond solemnly or be i know something about that pair since i have play on the same eleven with prescott and holme be they better than you two darry hepson demand yes answer dave unhesitatingly be that honesty or extreme modesty extreme mod -- break in dan dalzell but he close he mouth with a snap and duck as he see three of the visitor make for he it be hard to believe muttered hepson though he speak uneasily why do you rank prescott and holme so high darry well for one reason dick prescott teach dalzell and myself the game anything that we know about the game we learn in the team that prescott captain still it be hard to believe speak up midshipman joyce darrin we look upon you as the best thing that ever happen to the navy end of the gridiron i do not know that i care about be ` kid ' respond dave seriously but we honestly do contend the same speaker and we do not like to have you tell we that prescott be a better man but i believe he be be you afraid of he i be not afraid of any one on the gridiron darrin retort bluntly i 'll work hard to beat any man that i have to go up against and if work this season will do it i 'll beat dick prescott out good that be the way we like to hear you talk glow hepson and i 'll bottle up holme and put the stopper in promise dan with solemn modesty again two of the man make a rush for he to quiet he it may be only a rumor that prescott and holme be on the army eleven speak up another midshipman no object still another i have a letter this afternoon from a cousin who have be up to west point and have see the army crowd at work the army be rejoice over prescott and holme as a pair of precious find and they be both nail to the color for this season then we be go to have a tough time in we game with the army darrin declare thoughtfully and the army will beat more college team this year than usual we will not die until the army shoot anyway promise hepson and now darry there be another question we want to put to you and we want a out-and-out answer do you believe that jetson really mean to trip you this afternoon you hear he denial dave rejoin yes well jetson be a midshipman and a gentleman there have never be any question here about he honor darrin reply i accept he denial of intention at the time and i still accept it it be queer then how jetson come to give you such a nasty trip observe another caller i 'll tell you what i think really must have happen dave continue frankly i think jet be crazy to stop I it be on he mind and he be determine to do it he trip I of course but i think he really act on a unconscious impulse and without intention so at that rate the trip be not really intend since he have not deliberately plan it would you be willing to play on the same team with he darry pursued midshipman hepson yes or with any other man in the brigade i do not suspect any man here at the naval academy of anything intentionally and deliberately dishonorable good darry cry several midshipman for a few minute the talk grow fast and furious then some one look at he watch and there be a prompt flight of visitor ten minute later tap sound and a master switch turn off the light in midshipman 's quarter with nearly eight hundred young man in they bed and already drop asleep at eight the next morning the many section march off to recitation and for hour the grind of the day be on at the naval academy as at west point not even football be allow to interfere in the least with study or recitation no football player be permit to go into section room after extra practice in the field and announce himself unprepared to recite only midshipman of a good grade of scholarship be permit to join or remain in the football squad late in the afternoon when recreation time come all be speedily change every member of the squad hastily report in tog score of midshipman not of the squad hasten over to see the practice work the score be presently increase to hundred fifty or more naval officer detail at the yard be scatter along the side line many of the wife and daughter of officer station at annapoli turn out to view the work other young lady come from annapoli there be also a big delegation of st johnny as the gray-clad young man from st john 's college be call the news have evidently travel far that the navy have two new man on the team who be expect to prove wonder a big part of this crowd be out to see you and danny boy hepson remark to darrin have not they anything better to do with they time then laugh dave great scott man every one of the spectator want to see the navy beat the army this year but these spectator be a heap cheer up by what they have hear about you and dalzell dave however go about he work all but unconsciously never much of a egotist he decline to believe himself the star man of the navy eleven when coach haven call off the two team that be to play that day jetson observe that he be not call for either it look as though darrin have queer I mutter that midshipman gloomily to himself i do not think darrin be quite as bad as that after the practice game have start and dave have put through the most brilliant play that he have yet exhibit the air ring with he name from hundred of throat that be the way grumble jetson it be all darrin now these idiot will forget that i be ever at annapoli jetson sulk about after the rebuke he have receive the day before from the head coach he do not dare to carry he sulk so far as to go and un-tog without leave towards the end of the first half of the practice game a man on the second team be hurt enough to be retire and joyce be call they might have give I a chance quiver jetson sulkily i be a lot better player than the fool coach imagine but anyway i suppose darrin have turn the coach and hepson against I i owe darrin for that one five minute later another player of the second eleven be retire with a injured wrist howard call the coach briskly excuse for to-day sir report another player any one but I growl jetson jetson sound the head coach 's heavy voice midshipman jetson start he face flush then for a instant a sulky impulse seize he to reply that he do not feel up to form to-day but the midshipman smother that desire and start forward here sir he report take right guard on second direct coach haven very good sir the game be resume jetson however have a face full of sulkiness as he join the line-up he eye rest on dave darrin i wonder if jetson mean I any harm flash through dave 's mind in a instant however he dismiss the suspicion jetson be a midshipman a gentleman and a man of honor think darrin generously the whistle sound the ball be snap back and pass darrin receive it and dash forward to carry it past the opponent in a twinkling there be a staggering crash dave be down with the ball with man of two team pile above he at the sound of the referee 's whistle the mass disentangle itself dave and jetson be at the bottom of the heap jetson be the last man up but dave still lay there surgeon here call the coach 's steady voice devoid of excitement but there be anxiety enough when it be see that midshipman darrin still lay face downward have darrin be hurt -- we darrin -- the great darrin fly from tongue to tongue do jetson do it be another question that be instantly ask chapter viii dan try hard to keep cool a surgeon and a hospital man be quickly on the spot the other anxious as they be draw back considerately to give the man of medicine room in which to work as dave darrin be gently turn over on he back it be see that damn 's face be a mass of blood jetson 's work grunt two or three of the player he do it on purpose if he do not then the fellow be too clumsy to be trust on the gridiron anyway we must chase jetson away from the squad silence remark head coach haven very simply though in a tone which mean that obedience must follow jetson however be not ignorant of the comment that be pass he dark face flush hotly with anger they 'll blame anything on I if i be within a mile of the field he tell himself sullenly be mr darrin badly injured doctor inquire lieutenant-commander haven of the naval surgeon i think not sir beyond a possibly nasty mark on the face reply the surgeon as he examine and direct the hospital man mr darrin be merely stun from too hard a impact of some sort he 'll soon have he eye open -- there they come now as if to back up the surgeon dave open he eye stare curiously at the face within he range of vision what be all this fuss about dave ask quietly there be not any fuss mr darrin reply the surgeon you be stun by the force of that scrimmage and there be some blood on you face let I wipe it off then please sir dave beg i want to get back in the game you will not play again mr darrin reply the surgeon not play this season demand dave in anguished amazement please do not joke with I sir oh you 'll play after a few day reply the surgeon wet a piece of gauze from the contents of a bottle that he have take from he bag with the gauze he wipe the blood away from darrin 's cheek reveal a surface cut of more width than depth then a light bandage be put on over the cut now i guess you can rise all right mr darrin this hospital man will go over to hospital with you i be not order to stay there i hope sir murmur dave anxiously for two or three day at any rate -- yes reply the naval surgeon not because you be go to be weak but because we have get to have you under we eye all the time if you face be to heal without a bad scar midshipman darrin bring he hand up in salute to the surgeon and again to lieutenant-commander haven darrin lay up for a few day growl captain hepson of the navy team just after dave have start now when every day 's work count then wheeling suddenly : how do darrin come to get cut in that fashion anyway mr jetson do you know anything about it what do you mean sir demand jetson bridle do you insinuate that i try to put a scar on mr darrin 's face i ask you what you know about the accident -- if it be a accident hepson pursue coldly you ` if ' sir be insulting then there come to the spot a presence that could not be treat with anger lieutenant-commander haven be determine to know the truth mr jetson have you anything in you possession or do you wear anything that could cut mr damn 's face like that demand the head coach nothing sir unless the sole of one of my shoe be responsible return jetson barely conceal he anger under a mask of respect to a officer of the navy let I see you shoe sit down on the ground first mr jetson the midshipman obey though with no very good grace and hold up he right shoe for the inspection of the head coach now the other shoe mr jetson hm yes along the inner sole of this shoe there be sign of what look very much like blood see here mr hepson yes sir most certainly this be a streak of blood rub into the leather along this rather sharp edge of the sole may i suggest mr haven hint jetson that something else may have scratch mr darrin 's face and that the blood trickle to my shoe i be under mr darrin somewhat sir in the scrimmage when the bunch go down there be really nothing that could be prove in any case so the head coach could only say very quietly : let the practice go on mr hepson put mr wardell temporarily in mr darrin 's place on the line there be one in the group who have not say a word so far but he have be look on he keen eye study jetson 's face that looker-on be midshipman dan dalzell who as the reader know sometimes display a good deal of temper jetson mutter dan as the other midshipman come over by he i shall need a little talk with you at the early convenience of we both whenever you like retort midshipman jetson flash back a look of defiance then the game go on by supper time the man of the brigade know that darrin be get along comfortably that he be in no pain and that he be in hospital only in the hope that he might be save the annoyance of wear a disfiguring scar on he face throughout all he life i be afraid that some of the fellow think i purposely cut darrin up in that fashion remark jetson to he tablemate during the evening meal do not you know that you do not inquire one of the midshipmen laconically none of the other man at table take heed of jetson 's word at some of the other table equal silence do not prevail midshipman who do not accuse or suspect jetson of intentional wickedness express the opinion that he be at all event careless and not a valuable member of the football squad jetson himself be wholly aware that he be more or less suspect in the mind of many and the knowledge make he savage during the few minute recreation that follow the evening meal dan dalzell approach the sullen one who be now stand quite alone mr jetson i shall be glad to have a talk with you announce dan will you come to my room or shall i go to yours lead the way to you room sir reply jetson stiffly dan do so and behind the door the two midshipman face each other well sir demand the visitor mr jetson both time that you have play against darrin something have happen to he do not insinuate mr dalzell if you anything to say speak out plainly sir i hardly know what to say midshipman dan confess as a midshipman you honor should be above question do you wish to remark that it be not why i do not know dan answer frankly it seem a fearful thing to say or even to think about a midshipman mr dalzell either i do or i do not intentionally injure mr darrin yon must think one thing or the other if you suspect that i do the thing intentionally then why beat about the bush i do not want to beat about the bush and on the other hand i do not want to do you any injustice mr jetson i think perhaps you would be willing to help I out by proffer you midshipman 's word of honor -- and i rejoin jetson in cold anger consider it insulting sir that i should be ask to pledge my word of honor that be a extreme position to take protest dan no good man when appearance be against he should be afraid to offer he word of honor suppose sneer jetson in suppress fury i should go to the other extreme and say that i do it on purpose then i would knock you down like a dog dan answer directly and simply and next call on the man here to drive you forth from the brigade if you think you could knock I down quiver midshipman jetson you would better go ahead and find out whether you guess be correct dalzell you have be highly insulting and i do not mind declare that a fight with you would suit I at present better than anything that i can think of then you have you recourse in a challenge dan hint promptly what be the need of a challenge seconds -- or of anything but fist i do not need they the brigade claim some supervision over fight between the man here dan reply i intend to demand that the class take up as a class matter the mishap to darrin this afternoon you -- you hound pant jetson in a sudden flare-up of anger careful warn dalzell clench he fist and face he man squarely with a snort of rage jetson launch himself forward aim two blow at dan dan parry the blow coolly but he eye flash he have not lose control of himself but he be warm up to the instinct of fight when no other course seem open chapter ix a narrow squeak with the oc jetson 's next blow graze midshipman dalzell 's chin the follow-up blow land on dan 's left ear now dalzell sail in in earnest he attack forcefully and swiftly jetson be force to give ground dan pursue he around the room be no coward jetson stand well up to the work drive in for himself at least two out of every five blow that be land rap-tap-tap sound on the door but neither combatant hear smash dan 's forceful right land on jetson 's neck send that midshipman to the floor whereupon dalzell spring back three pace take you time get on to you foot call dan in a low voice i do not want any time snap jetson leap to he foot the word of both speaker be hear at the door and the visitor who have knock now promptly enter fortunate it be for the combatant face each other that the intruder be not one of the discipline officer have it be both midshipman would have be report at once under charge that would have bear serious result instead it be farley who enter follow by page hepson and joyce wow utter midshipman farley in a low voice then : stop this fellow at the order which dan know to be intend for he own good the latter turn away let he hand fall jetson on the point of a rush realize that he have better desist joyce you stand outside order farley in a low voice stand right at the door if you see the oc -lrb- officer in charge -rrb- turn into this corridor you rap as hard as you can on the door and we 'll understand midshipman joyce want most badly to be a spectator to what be likely to happen on the inner side of the door but he have the good sense to realize that some one must do guard duty so he step outside close the door after he now gentleman what be this all about demand hepson in a low smooth voice it mean cry jetson passionately that i be not go to stand any more of this petty persecution everyone have be try to pretend that he believe i have be try to do darrin up so that he can not play on the navy football team it be all just a mean scheme to keep I from make the navy eleven there be no such scheme afloat or i would know about it return hepson coolly fact be there be not any intention whatever of playing you on the navy team ah you admit it snap midshipman jetson first turn white after which he face show a deep crimson of humiliation you have already do the dirty work fellow stop this talk command hepson almost at a white heat of resentment among midshipman and gentleman there can be no thought of what you term ` dirty work ' the fact that you will not play with we be due to you uncontrollable temper a fellow who can not control he nerve and temper be not fit to play football -- a game that require cool judgment at every moment of the game then while you be tell I what to stop you just stop address I as ` fellow ' cry jetson he lip quiver with rage i 'll admit that be hasty on my part agree midshipman hepson but it seem necessary to use some word to bring you to you sens and now this fight which would get you both into serious trouble if a discipline officer come upon the scene must cease i be afraid it can not break in midshipman dalzell with quiet dignity at least i will not agree to stop until mr jetson admit himself satisfied it be he who start the fight and only he word can close it but we do not want you other fellow pull into this trouble as spectator so we 'll wait until you all withdraw if you be determine to fight rejoin hepson who be the only first classman present then we do not want to stop the fight we 'll stay and see it pull off fairly but dalzell do you really want to fight i do not want to dan answer but now that mr jetson have start it it must go on until he be satisfy up with you hand sir and when you start in i 'll answer you the visitor skip back in order to leave the combatant plenty of room for footwork since jetson have hear definite announcement of the fact that he could not hope to be call to the navy eleven he inward flame of passion have burn up high he be now ready to fight with all the force that there be in he in the first few seconds he assault be so resolute that dalzell be force to give ground as he slowly retreat and shift jetson drive in more impetuously than ever midshipman dan find himself at last in a position of advantage now hammer he danny boy advise farley breathing deeply silence among the spectator warn hepson in a low stern voice absolutely fair play gentleman to both contestant again the shower exchange of blow jetson after he late rapid expenditure of force and nerve-energy be now just the least bit confused dan land on one ear and then against he enemy 's chin both be hard dazing blow though neither leave a mark then a uppercut and dalzell land on jetson 's jugular with a gasp the fellow go down to the floor one two three four -- hepson begin count do not bother with the count beg dalzell i 'll give he all the time he want to get to he foot rap-tap-tap-tap come a banging summons on the door follow by midshipman joyce 's voice demand : be you in danny boy swift as a flash hepson and farley leap forward fairly snatch jetson who be still half daze to he foot in the same instant page call out cheerily : come in under full steam whatever craft be outside brace up jetson do not look silly or dazed warn hepson in a stern whisper that rap be the signal of the approach of the oc farley be industriously brushing the sign of dust from jetson 's uniform i tell you fellow boom hepson 's tranquil earnest voice we have get to hustle every minute of practice time nothing else will give we a chance to win we have not even a chance if darry be not soon back on the gridiron argue farley oh he 'll be all right soon break in dan dalzell eagerly joyce have already step into the room leave the door open now as though by instinct the midshipman seem aware that the oc who to-day happen to be lieutenant cotton usn be stand in front of the doorway gaze in instantly the middy come to the position of attention look straight ahead of they good evening gentleman greet the oc be anything unusual go on we have be discuss the football situation sir announce midshipman hepson quite truthfully have hepson be ask if there have recently be a fight in progress he would have answer truthfully but he do not feel call upon to volunteer damaging information i think i hear sound as of some disturbance remark the oc look at the young man rather sharply that be to say i be under the impression that there have be some unusual agility in operation i hear something that sound like scuffle yes sir reply mr hepson i think it very likely the man on this deck sir can not think of anything in these day but line-up and scrimmage tactic it occur to I go on the oc that there be some sound of scuffle in this room there be sir admit midshipman hepson candidly there be a species of scrimmage be it in connection with football inquire lieutenant cotton yes sir -- which answer again be wholly truthful ah i think i hear something like a scrimmage in the room assent lieutenant cotton yet remember gentleman that quarter be not the place for football practice very good sir thank you sir reply the unmovable hepson and remember that it be now very close to the time for study call continue the oc yes sir thank you sir we be just parting to we various quarter sir good evening gentleman good evening sir lieutenant cotton pass on down the corridor and the midshipman ease themselves from the rigid position of attention that be a narrow squeak grunt hepson now jetson get out ahead i 'll renew this argument at another time retort jetson slowly as he cross the floor you do not need to sir midshipman hepson advise he every gentleman here will agree with I that mr dalzell have the best of the affair right up to the end nor be mr dalzell under any obligation whatever to afford you another meeting on the score of to-night 's disagreement we 'll see about that snapped jetson as he pass through the doorway at that instant the study call sound the other hasten away to they quarter dan dalzell step over to the handbowl wash he hand after which he go to he study-table and begin to arrange he book it be kind of lonely to sit here without old darry sigh dan dismally i hope he 'll be here with I to-morrow evening no i do not either though i want he to stay over in hospital until there be no chance whatever that he 'll have to wear a ugly scar through life it be three evening later when midshipman david darrin return to he own quarter in bancroft hall by this time the surface wound on he face be healing nicely and with ordinary care he would soon be without sign of scar pill -lrb- the surgeon -rrb- tell I that i 'll have to be careful and not let anything bump this face for day to come remark dave point to the strip of adhesive plaster that neatly cover he injury well you do not need to bump anything reply dan quietly hepson want you on the gridiron the worst way but he have tell I that he will not even allow you to get into tog until pill have certify that you be fit to play it be tough sigh dave then quietly begin he study it be a rare proceeding to send a midshipman to coventry a step that be never take save for the gravest reason dan have fight do not feel it necessary to bring jetson 's case before a class meeting and jetson escape coventry he be not cut yet he soon discover that the average classmate pay no more heed to he than appear to be necessary for courtesy 's sake after another week pill consent to dave darrin 's go out for regular gridiron practice dave need the work badly for the navy team be now on the eve of the first game of the season jetson with no hope now of make the eleven this year avoid the field for a few day the first game of the season take place on a Saturday afternoon the opponent be hanniston college ordinarily in the past hanniston have be a easy enough opponent though there have be year in which hanniston have carry the score away from the field how many of the regular team do you want to throw into the game against hanniston mr hepson inquire lieutenant-commander haven the night before the game every one of they sir hepson answer the head coach until we get into a real game we can not be sure that we have the strongest eleven to-morrow 's game will show we if we have make any mistake in we selection even though hanniston be consider one of the lesser opponent every man in the brigade speculate with great interest that night on the probable outcome of the morrow darrin will have a good chance to prove himself a dub to-morrow think midshipman jetson darkly i hate to wish against the navy but i 'll cheer if darrin individually tie himself up in foozle knot chapter x the gridiron start on the day of the game the midshipman talk eagerly and mostly of football through dinner in the great messhall of the brigade do any one see the hanniston infant arrive demand page infant eh call joyce from the next table that show you do not see the visit eleven why be they of fair size ask farley it take two ` bus to bring the regular eleven besides the sub and all the howler retort joyce and the regular eleven i be reliably inform tip the scale at four ton oh come now joyce shave off a ton or two protest farley i will not take off more than fifty pound sir retort joyce with mock stubbornness say the hanniston fellow be enormous then they have run all to bone and have not any brain grin dan after all we do not mind mere bulk for intelligence win most of the game on the gridiron as to they intelligence i can not say admit joyce at any rate from the glimpse that i get of the han i should say that they average two year older than we man let 's throw up the sponge then propose dalzell demurely if we can not beat the visitor what be the use of play they it be not even necessary to get into tog we can send a note to the referee and he can award the game to hanniston fine break in hepson scornfully however i guess we be not go to have any cinch to-day join in midshipman waite from another table i have word from outside by the way what word well the hanniston fellow have bring over some money with which to back up the howl they be make for they team they be offer odds of ten to six that hanniston win they stand to lose a lot of money grin hepson but here be the funny part of it continue waite you know when the townspeople in annapoli think they have a really good thing on we they cover the money of visitor in any wager on the game then here 's hope that the annapoli townspeople win a lot to-day laugh midshipman hepson yes but return waite what i hear from town be that the annapoli townspeople have be drive to cover that they be not take up the offer of the visit hanniston boy too bad sigh dave darrin and annapoli need the money so badly too be we go to win asked waite bluntly too early to tell you reply hepson coolly ask I at supper to-night but the towny will not wager any money on we this year eh the annapoli people have put up some but not much reply waite we be go to win just the same announce dan dalzell sure question several voice oh yes it be all settle now laugh midshipman waite i have be wait for danny boy to tell we now we know -- we have hear from the hot-air meter there be a laugh in which dan do not join readily though he face redden considerably midshipman dalzell be one of those who always believe that the navy must win just because it be the navy some of the other midshipman do not go quite as far as that in they confidence better not call danny boy name advise dave darrin gravely he might be sulk at just the time when we need he this afternoon that would be unmilitary retort mr waite oh no say dave lightly even as good a soldier as achille sulk in he tent you know achille what class be he in then demand waite i do not remember the name he be in a class of he own at the siege of troy volunteer farley troy ny inquire waite if you keep on waite mutter farley someone will have to give you a ancient history book at christmas you do not seem well post on greek tale do not have to be thank goodness return waite help himself to another piece of beef greek be not on the list here there be abundant time for rest before the game the player and sub for the navy team however be early at dress quarter jetson have not be call as one of the sub so he walk sulkily and alone through the grounds while most of the midshipman stroll about in group half a hour before the time for the game the spectator ' seat hold fair-sized crowd at that time the naval academy band begin to play just to keep the wait one more patient ten minute later the hanniston player come on to the field at a slow trot instantly the hanniston howler in the audience begin to whoop up the noise the midshipmen join in cheer and then the band take up the music again at first sight of the visitor some of the navy people begin to have they doubt about victory the hanniston surely be bulky in size and age the visitor be as formidable as any of the college eleven many of the midshipman too recall what they have hear waite say at table it seem little wonder that the popular odds be against the middy but the band have play its welcome to the hanniston who be now chase a ball over the field in practice almost immediately switch off into the strain of see the conquer hero come all doubt be dispel for the moment at least as all the navy people present let loose a tremendous cheer in which the midshipman spectator lead for now captain hepson be lead he own man on to the field the hope of the navy that day hepson hepson go up rousingly from the brigade darrin darrin howl other dalzell darrin darrin hepson must enjoy hear more noise for darrin than for himself reflect jetson moodily but hepson big in body heart and mind be intent only on victory it do not even occur to the captain of the navy eleven that darrin be get more of a reception than himself hepson be simply and heartily glad to find himself support by two such promising gridiron man as darrin and dalzell remember darry how much we be back on you to-day muttered hepson after another round of yell for dave have be give i can not do everything and perhaps not much smile dave but i 'll do my level best to do all that you call upon I for at my own little spot in the line a din of hanniston yell be now smite the air uncle sam 's midshipman wait with patience and courtesy but when they turn come they volley forth four time as much as the visit howler could supply i hope darry be in great form to-day murmur the midshipman seat next to jetson he look to be in as good shape as ever do not he ask jetson sullenly oh i forget exclaim the other you do not like darry any too well i have nothing against he that would make I want to see he in bad form grumble jetson i be a navy man and i do not want to see any but navy victory the toss have just be make the visitor win the kick-off at a sign from a navy officer in the field the leader silence he band and a hush fall over the gridiron and the seat of the onlooker chapter xi the band could not make itself hear within five minute the hanniston player have establish the fact that they be not only bulky but quick and brainy in fact though the navy promptly block the ball and get it the middy be unable to make headway against the college man then hanniston take the ball fight slowly but steadily toward the navy goal line i do not see darrin make any wonderful play think jetson to himself he be gloomy over see the navy outplay but secretly glad that the spectator have as yet find no occasion to shout themselves hoarse over midshipman dave 's work outside of the brigade the other spectator in the navy seat feel themselves tinder a cloud of increase gloom from all the talk i have expect more of mr darrin remark a officer 's wife-to she husband darrin have a fearful hanniston line against he reply the officer captain hepson realize that too and he be not push darrin as hard as you might wish to see we be go to be beat be not we ask another navy onlooker it be as yet too early to predict safely though all the appearance be that the visitor would do whatever score be to be do to-day yet even when they feel themselves outclass the middy hang to they opponent with dogged perseverance it take nearly all of the first half for the hanniston to place the navy goal in final desperate danger then of a sudden while the hanniston work within a dozen yard of the navy goal line the college boy make a new attack the strongest they have yet show there be a bump crash as the line come together at the navy 's right farley and page be sweep clear off they foot and the assailant sweep onward another clever attack back by a ruse and one of the college boy start on a dead run with the ball in vain the navy 's back try to stop he the hanniston boy successfully interfere for they runner and the ball be touch down behind the goal line go be the cheer that have be ascend from the brigade all the navy crowd gasp in dismay the ball be carry back kick and hanniston have score six point ha ha ha ha ha ha ha -- hanniston wow go up derisively from the visit howler hepson hepson pull we out come the appeal darry darry rush it as the two eleven be line up for another start the time-keeper 's whistle sound the end of the first half of the game gloomy indeed be those who have hope to see the navy win there be no cheer save from the visitor-howler the best that the leader of the band could do be to swing he baton and start in the strain of 'twa never thus in olden time what do you make of the enemy hepson inquire joyce as the middy rest at the side line we have not make anything of they yet but we have get to make wreck of 'em before the last half be over grunt the captain of the navy how be we go to do it ask another player by just hang at they with sheer grit reply the captain gravely fellow they have beat we so far but they have not wear we out any big fellow as the hanniston be they may not have the endurance to hang to we through all of the come half that make I remember a song i hear when on leave this year grin page a part of it run : ` say the ant to the elephant who be ye shove there be one wide river to cross ' and we be the elephant inquire farley in mock innocence do we look it demand page in disgust remember fellow warn hepson as the signal summon both team back to the field many a hopeless game have be win in the last five minute but do not wait hammer the college boy from the start dalzell and i can stand hard work and pound whenever you get ready to put it on we dave announce to hepson do not try to spare we any both of we would sooner be carry away on stretcher than see the navy lose its first game to a minor college the game be resume for ten minute the navy play mainly on the defensive indeed to the spectator it seem all that the middy could do against such big fellow as the visitor just after that however hepson pass the silent signal and then the midshipmen hurl themselves into the fray to test out all the endurance that the hanniston player might possess many a college boy on the oppose line wonder where these smaller man in the navy tog have obtain all the fight that they now show the big fellow do not seem able to stand it long the navy have the ball and now slowly fight down toward the college goal onlooker in the navy seat begin to stand up to watch breathlessly and be ever ready to cheer hurl little darry in yell someone hoarsely in a momentary lull in the noise but hepson watch every chance with tigerish eye be yet cool-headed as a football general should be twice he use darrin to advance the ball and each time dave gain a few yard the third time wearied by pound he head against a human stone wall dave fail to gain more than half a yard watchful hepson send the ball after the next snap-back over to the navy 's right the time of the second half be slip away and it now look as though the middy might gradually have win by the steady bull-dog quality of they tactic nearer and nearer to the college goal line the team of smaller man fight the pigskin until at last they have it within six yard of the hanniston fortress but at this point the visitor stay further progress long enough to have the pigskin ovoid come to they by a block the situation be desperate hanniston could not get the ball away from its present locality and in dread the college captain send the ball back of he own line to a safety this count two for annapoli but it also set the ball back twenty-five yard from the college line block block block -- if you can not fight the ball back to the navy goal be the word that captain hart of the college team send along he own line do not be too reckless just fight to keep the navy from score hepson hepson come appealingly from the seat as the two eleven line up at the twenty-five-yard line darry o darry grim determination write on they face eleven middy await the signal then hurl themselves forward like tiger the ball come to dave who start with it dan dalzell watch he chum with cat-like eye follow and make the best interference that he have offer that day five and a half yard win as center bent for the snap back a fake signal be call by the navy quarter-back just as the ball start the navy player back of the line start toward the right the hanniston man tire now but full of grit as ever move to block the navy gain a second or two for the pass be really to the left and again darrin have the pigskin clutch tightly as he start to run and deceive again dan and the other of the interference sustain they idol and champion dave go soon to earth but he have force the ball another six yard darry -- oh darry one more play and over the line you have get the elephant go at last rush 'em a touchdown save we dan 's face be flush dave 's white and set as the line again form for the next play quarter-back joyce hold up he head watch the field like a mouse seek escape then come the emergency signal : nine -- fourteen -- twenty-two -- three back come the pigskin while the middy seem to throw they body toward the right it look as though they be try to mask this feint the ball be in motion but dave have it instead of farley instantly the navy swing its entire line toward the leave for this be the grand rush the die on which everything be cast dave be dart forward and never have he interference back he better before midshipman darrin stand one of the big college man who look fully equal to stop the midshipman anywhere and at any time nor do darrin try to dodge this bulky player instead dave as he hurl himself at the opponent spring high into the air as though he have some desperate plan of leap over the barrier brace on he leg he two foot solidly plant this hanniston man feel ready for any shock that dave darrin could bring against he but darrin do not touch he on the contrary the navy 's hope fall to the ground just short of the block opponent like a flash dave go between that pair of solidly brace wide-spread leg in a wriggle that look flash-like to the breathless beholder darrin be through he have take desperate chance when he go down of be beset end force to hold the pigskin where he have fall but now dave be up and run and the player who have seek to block he be far in the rear the whole navy force hurl itself around this point batter down the startle opposition with fast-coming breath dave 's comrade push he along break down all opposition -- until dave with a sudden wild dash be over the line for a touchdown darry do it darry do it for fifteen seconds the uproar be deafen the college player look stunned while they howler over on the visitor ' seat seem to shrink within they coat seven to six make it eight dave darrin have bear the brunt of battle now he eye be flash with excitement i would like you to try the kick for goal darry but i do not know call hepson in he ear you may be about use up let I have the kick i be not afraid dave half boast for now he could think of nothing but victory all right take it agree hepson dave darrin do take the kick never have he make a better one the ball go straight and true between the goal-post the band-leader hold he baton poise but the navy spectator break into such a riot of joy that he let the baton fall inertly what be the use he ask the musician again the player line up with the navy score eight to six ten seconds later the whistle blow announce the end of the game chapter xii joyce be bite by the trouble bug the game be over the giant visitor have depart and the naval academy atmosphere appear to be rarefy most of the member of the brigade be back in bancroft hall and this be late Saturday afternoon study be over save for those who feel the need of devote extra time to they book farley page and joyce have drop into the room occupy by dave and dan hepson be nearly crazy this afternoon remark joyce laughing then he have a easy way of conceal the fact dave reply i call he a cool football captain with plenty of judgment and patience yes but i happen to know that he be badly upset return joyce twice he send I the wrong signal about the number to call and he admit it afterward he be afraid before the game be twenty minute ' old that we be up against a big walloping oh well darrin reply with a shrug of he shoulder the navy be just as use as the army be to be wallop in athletics the trouble with the army and navy team in athletics be that we be always pit against college man who be bigger and older than we be it be just about as unfair to we as it would be unfair to high school team if we play against high school instead of college we could wallop high school outfit at either baseball or football and the only wonder be that the army and navy win as many game as they do against the college college team have more time for training than the army or navy team do what be you go to do to-night darry joyce ask presently the hop no dave answer almost shortly the truth be that he be no hop-fiend or fusser except when belle meade be at annapoli to go to a hop with he darrin have little liking for the ball i do not intend to hop either joyce continue now be you well enough up in grease to get town leave for the evening grease mean good standing on the conduct report yes nod dave danny and i could easily get town leave if we have a good excuse but of course it be out of the question to get leave merely to roam the street we would have to explain where we be go and then go there there be a show on at the theater break in dalzell yes nod dave but do you know what kind of show it be no it be a burlesque show bring here to win away the half dollar of the sailor on the ship here we would stand very little chance of get leave to go to that kind of show but i want to go somewhere away from the academy grounds just for a couple of hour sigh joyce i would like to go also agree dave but where could we go that be to what place or for what purpose could we go that would be approve by the oc this prove to be a poser indeed fact be joyce go on i be so desperate for a little change that i do not believe i would funk at take french over the academy wall what do you two say that dog will not bark dave retort oh you greaser joyce shy at he well i be grease to the extent that i will not imperil my chance of keep in the service by take any french leave darrin reply steadily so joyce i be afraid a trip to town to-night be out of the question unless you can think up some plan to get by the oc how be you on french the wall danny boy query joyce just about as big a muff as darry dan return dryly joyce remain for some moment in deep meditation he want to go into annapoli and he do not care about go on a lonesome expedition the more he think the better joyce realize how hard it be to frame a request that would get past the oc i have it speak up dalzell at last we 'll ask leave to run up to baltimore to consult a oculist you idiot cry joyce impatiently none of we need spectacles besides there be no train run to baltimore as late as this add dave no good then sigh dalzell and my inventiveness be go i be afraid we 'll have to french it over the wall insist joyce you 'll french it alone then dave declare i draw the line at leave the grounds without official permission prig grunt joyce under he breath then he start up he eye shine with the light of a new resolve get a idea ask dan yes say joyce and you 'll call I a fool if i let you in on it now wait until i see how it work with that he hasten from the room darrin draw down a book from the bookshelf and from between its page extract a letter from belle which he begin to read for the dozenth time a few minute pass then joyce knock next enter the room with jubilation apparent in he face i have fix it he cry all you fellow have to do be to go to the oc and make you request in person request for what dave ask look up as he fold the letter i tell the oc plumply that we be so tired of be on this side of the wall that we feel desperate for a change i remind he that we be all three in the top grease grade and tell he that we want permission to take a short stroll through annapoli to-night oc hem and haw and say it be a most unusual request for the evening though proper enough for Saturday afternoon at last he call up the commandant of midshipman state the case and ask if he might grant the permission the com be game and say all right so all that remain be for you two to go to the oc and make you request in person scat get in motion start i 'll wait here until i hear that you have put it through of course joyce you be not put up a joke on we demand darrin look keenly at the navy quarter-back on my word i be not come on danny boy call dave start and dalzell follow readily enough they enter the office of the o c salute and state they case it be of course a somewhat unusual request to grant for the evening reply lieutenant-commander denham however i can grant it if you will both assure I that you will take extreme pain to keep out of trouble of any kind and that you will not enter the theater or any other resort that would be bad judgment for a midshipman to enter as to that sir darrin reply i long ago resolve not to take any chance whatever of break any disciplinary requirement that would bring I demerit i be work hard to get through the academic requirement sir and i do not intend to pass the mental ordeal here and then find that i can not keep on as a midshipman just because i have too many demerit against I i think sir you may feel assure i shall not allow myself to do anything that would bring I under discipline you resolution be and be a most excellent one mr darrin reply the oc mr dalzell do you share mr darrin 's determination as to keep out of trouble in annapoli this evening emphatically sir then the desire permission be grant you will enter proper report as to the time of leave and return thank the oc and salute dave and dan hasten back to joyce not so difficult be it demand the navy quarter-back it be a whole lot better than plan to french the trip retort darrin now we shall leave here to-night feeling perfectly safe as to we place on the pap pap be the sheet on which the day 's report of midshipmen conduct be keep i 'll admit that caution be sometimes worth while laugh joyce soon after the call for supper formation sound the meal hour be a merry one that evening the afternoon 's game be naturally the main subject for conversation dave naturally come in for much praise for the way he have save the navy game but this flattery bore he darrin do not in the least imagine that he be a wonder on the gridiron in fact the game be past and win he do not take any further interest in it such think as he now give to football concern the game still to come immediately after the meal the three midshipman report they departure into annapoli then they go to the main gate pass through and stroll on up maryland avenue into state circle i be sorry we promise not to go to the theater murmur midshipman joyce i be not retort dave without that promise we would not have secure the leave but what be we go to do demand the dissatisfied one now that we be outside the grounds we can not do much except what we come out to do dave remind joyce we can just walk about and stretch we leg look in at a few store window and make a few trifling purchase that will not exhaust we small store of pocket money exciting prospect remark joyce well what ail you demand dalzell with unusual quietness what do you want to do something that will get we into big trouble with the oc and the com joyce can not tell you what he long for for he do not know himself explain dave but i know he want to do something irregular anything that be slightly in breach of the regulation -- something that will get he haul up before the oc and the pap you be a wonderful guesser laugh joyce well i 'll admit that i be simply restless and that anything that will stir my blood and my liver will fill the bill i be afraid i be so depraved to-night that even a street-fight would not go against the grain you would better forget it advise darrin quietly it be a dangerous frame of mind for a future officer and gentleman who must acquire control over himself before he can be fit to command man you talk like a padre -lrb- chaplain -rrb- utter joyce in disgust can not you forget for one evening that you be a midshipman no i do not want to dave return quietly prig utter joyce again and this time he do not take the pain to speak under he breath but darrin only smile indulgently by way of simple dissipation the three midshipman go to a drug store enjoy themselves with ice cream soda soon after they find themselves in a main street bookstore look over post card they could however find no new one and so left without buy and there be the theater right over there sigh joyce it would be against we word as midshipman and gentleman to visit it dave urge come on joyce we 'll turn into one of the very quiet side street and stroll along then we 'll be out of temptation accordingly they go to one of the all but desert side street of the better sort there be a comrade ahead of we say dave in a undertone presently as he make out the uniform half a block away hardly have he speak when a door open and a young man in evening clothes come lightly down the step at once the unknown midshipman wheel and spring at the young civilian there be a swift interchange of blow over almost as soon as it start for the unknown midshipman speedily knock down the man he have assault nor do the civilian get up at once instead he bawl lustily for help joyce make a move to spring forward but dave catch he by the arm do not get forward joyce if you do you 'll probably recognize the midshipman then you 'll have to report he name answer the call for help five other young man run out of the same house the midshipman disdain to flee and stand he ground we 'll teach you snarl one of the newly arrive civilian raise he cane as though to bring it down on the midshipman 's shoulder the midshipman like a flash wrench the cane from the other 's hand and begin to lay it lustily about he the whole crowd therefore include the young man who have first be knock down join in the attack that be too much like cowardice and we be bind to go to the rescue of a comrade mutter dave darrin he eye blaze come on fellow -- and be sure not to recognize that comrade in a moment the fight be somewhat more equal darrin dalzell and joyce be all accomplish and discipline boxer they close with the crowd around the midshipman crack thump bump midshipman blow land heavily and rapidly the civilian be soon worsted and scattered whoever you be comrade mutter dave in a low tone wheeling the unknown midshipman around do not look we way and do not give we any chance to recognize you scoot po-o-o-lice lustily yell one of the crowd of defeat civilian chapter xiii hepson be some wild police bawl other of the civilian take up the hue and cry that spell serious trouble if dave and he friend should tarry there midshipman be in no sense free from arrest by the civil authority and it be likely to fare hard with uncle sam 's young sailor if they be take in by the civil authority come along muttered darrin lead the way he do not run but he certainly walk fast and in a direction away from main street he two companion follow he the unknown midshipman take darrin 's shrewd hint have already make himself invisible after the prompt drubbing they have receive not one of the young civilian feel any desire to follow these husky midshipman the police in annapoli be few in number and so do not always hear a street summons in this instance dave and he friend turn a corner and be soon away from the scene of the late affair now i hope you have have all the excitement you want joyce dave remark dryly like most good thing it do not last long complain joyce oh it be not over yet by any means we have the oc and the com to face grumbled darrin but we could not stand by and see one of we own punch by a whole gang of course we could not but why fuss about the com and he satellite the oc they 'll never hear of this i think there be a big chance that we shall hear of it retort dave that be why i advise you not to look at the unknown midshipman closely enough to be able to recognize he in the dark i do not know who he be admit dan candidly nor do i supplement joyce then whoever he be the chap stand little chance of be catch unless he voluntarily announce himself presumably the police do not answer the hail of the young civilian at any rate darrin and he friend hear nothing more of the matter while in town but when they return to bancroft hall the trio be meet by this announcement : the officer in charge wish to see you in he office it be come warn dave as he and he companion turn and go in to report themselves there have be a disturbance in annapoli state lieutenant-commander denham mr darrin be you in it i be in one kind of disturbance sir darrin answer at once of what kind several civilian attack a man in a midshipman 's uniform i go to he aid and attack some civilian yes sir mr dalzell mr joyce do you also take part in that affair inquire the oc yes sir answer both midshipman for what reason because sir answer joyce several civilian pounce upon one man who wear a midshipman 's uniform and you three rush in and pound some civilian ask the oc coolly i be afraid we do sir answer dave who find the lieutenant-commander 's gaze turn on he who be that other midshipman mr darrin i do not know sir do not you recognize he when you go to he aid i do not sir do either of you gentleman recognize the midshipman to whose rescue you rush dan and joyce reply in the negative tell I the circumstance of the attack mr darrin take pain to make you statement so exact that you will not have to amend the statement afterwards darrin tell the affair as it have happen hm and none of you recognize the fourth midshipman pursue the oc that in itself be strange mr darrin be there any agreement among you three that you would not recognize you comrade not exactly a agreement sir dave confess candidly at the distance that we be from the scene before we rush in the darkness prevent we see the face of the unknown midshipman as we start forward i will admit that i warn mr dalzell and mr joyce not to look at the other midshipman 's face so that you might answer truthfully if ask that you do not know the man yes sir that be my reason for so advise mr dalzell and mr joyce that be what might be term extraordinary foresight mr darrin remark lieutenant-commander denham ironically thank you sir answer dave as innocently as though he do not understand that he have just be rebuke the oc frown mr darrin since i assume you to have be the ringleader of you trio do you give that wonderful advice to you companion just so that you might be able to refuse any aid to the naval academy authority in run this matter to the ground yes sir dave answer very frankly you wish then demand the oc sternly to hinder the course of justice at the naval academy it at least sir do not strike I at the time quite in that light yet something be happen on the street of annapoli that you know would be very thoroughly investigate if it be report here and so you take precaution against be able to aid the authority in the investigation i admit the truth of that sir mr darrin why do you feel call upon to try to defeat the investigation that you foresee and which be now under way because sir it be contrary to the spirit of the brigade of midshipman to carry tale against each other i do not care to act contrary to that spirit perhaps it would be more accurate to say that you do not dare observe the oc half sneeringly that way of state it would be true sir i do not care to turn informer against my comrade yet you think you possess the courage to become one of we fight officer in the future if the need arise of my courage as a fight man sir i be unable to form any opinion until that courage have be properly test but you be afraid to inform the authority of the identity of comrade who commit serious offens as it be contrary to the spirit of the brigade sir i would be more afraid of my own contempt than of any other punishment lieutenant-commander denham appear to lose some of he patience presently i wonder he remark brusquely why you midshipman can not learn to accept some of you sense of honor from the officer who have see so much more service than you i wonder why you will go on formulate you own canon of honor even when such belief sometimes result in the dismissal of midshipman from the service the three midshipman not be question remain silent and so not one of you have the slightest idea of the original nature of the quarrel in which you so readily take part and none of you have any idea of the identity of the fourth midshipman concern in this evening 's work i have not sir reply midshipmen darrin dalzell and joyce in one breath very good gentleman the matter will be investigate further you will go to you quarter and remain there you will take part in the meal formation but in no drill or recitation until you be further advise and you will not leave bancroft hall without direct order from competent authority the three midshipman salute turn and leave the office go to they own room wow muttered dan as soon as the chum have close they door on themselves we shall surely have enough to think of smile dave wearily oh aye agree dalzell oh well if we be go to skip some recitation we 'll need all the more study sigh dave seat himself at he study table and draw he book toward he but he be not permit to study long in peace word of the affair have spread and hepson present himself at darrin 's quarter in great consternation great mocked hepson just when we have discover that the navy have a dub team without you two or next door to one then you two go and get order to quarter you 'll not turn out with we Monday you may not practice with we through the week or play in we next game fine perhaps grin dan if we two be so important to navy prestige as you appear to imagine we shall not be keep long from the gridiron dalzell retort hepson impatiently you be a second classman and you have be here long enough to know that no consideration of discipline will be make to stand aside in order that the navy may have a better athletic team of any kind nothing here be sacrifice to athletics and you surely must know it then i guess we be dish confess dalzell mournfully a fine way for you two to go and use the football squad great insist hepson bitterly have you be with we hepson you would have do just as we do i know that dave reply well you be call I a bit agree hepson after all i do not know just what it be that get you both into this scrape some kind of fight or row in town be all i hear then i 'll tell you about it darrin go on quietly well i really do not see how you could have help it agree midshipman hepson after he have listen but that do not save we any we be out we two best line player and we quarter-back oh we 'll be restore to the squad as soon as the sentence have be pronounced predict dan dalzell even if you be bounce out of the naval academy demand hepson savagely it -- it will not be as bad as that falter dan perhaps not agree hepson though you must understand that the charge of assault civilian be not a light matter you can be dismiss for it you know yes nodded dave darrin and then danny boy go several shades less ruddy here 's hope for the best grumble hepson hold out he hand to each in turn and for the love of mike keep out of all further trouble do not look cross-eyed -- once -- until after November chapter xiv two side of a story one circumstance puzzle all of the midshipman who first hear of the affair the fourth and unknown midshipman who have wait outside of the house and assault the first civilian must have know the latter or it be not likely that he would have commit the assault that be the case it be just likely that the civilian know and have recognize the unknown midshipman who have knock he down such a attack must have follow some prior dispute then since the civilian have undoubtedly make complaint to the naval academy authority how have they be able to get out of supply the name of the midshipman unknown to dave and he friend right after breakfast the next morning dave darrin and he friend of the evening before be summon before the commandant of midshipman by that officer they be question very rigidly but they have nothing to add to they statement of the night before they be therefore order back to they quarter with permission only to attend chapel that forenoon just after chapel however the fourth midshipman discover himself to the officer in charge he be midshipman totten of fourth class totten admit that it be he who have wait outside of the house in question and who have knock down the civilian he further give the name of that civilian who be the son of one of the prominent official of the state government why do you strike he mr totten demand the officer in charge because sir the fellow have grossly insult a young lady whom i feel bind to avenge who be the young lady be i oblige sir to give she name in the matter it will be better mr totten you may be sure that you statement will be treat with all the consideration and confidence possible totten thereupon explain that the young woman in question be he cousin totten who be a orphan have be bring up by a aunt who have but one child of she own the young woman in question when totten have win a appointment to the naval academy the aunt and cousin have decide to move to annapoli sooner than have they little family break up how do you come to be outside the academy grounds last evening mr totten you be not on leave to go outside i take the chance and french it sir confess totten candidly i know that i could not get leave and so do not ask it but i feel that the fellow have to be punish no matter at what hazard to myself then you consider the avenging of the insult to you cousin as be a matter of greater importance than you future career in the navy midshipman totten pale but he answer bravely : yes sir and at the same time a naval career mean nearly everything in the world to I lieutenant-commander morrill the new officer in charge feel that it be difficult to rebuke a future naval officer for defend from insult a woman dear to he i shall have to pass this matter on to the commandant of midshipman decide the oc mr totten you will go to you quarter and remain there until further order save only for meal formation very good sir reply the fourth classman salute that be all mr totten very good sir within half a hour dave dan and joyce know that the unknown midshipman have come forward and announce himself but they do not hear the story of the reason back of totten 's attack they hear however that totten have not hear of they predicament until just after chapel call the commandant of midshipman send for mr totten that official however after hear the story feel that the matter be one for the superintendent the superintendent do not send for totten and question he but send instead for the civilian who have lodge the complaint the evening before he send also for young crane the man totten have name and who have not be among the complainant of the evening before mr crane announce the superintendent you know of course the name of the midshipman who assault and knock you down before the other three midshipman interfere in the matter er -- er -- possibly i do confess crane redden mr crane if you wish we to deal frankly with you you must accord the same treatment to the official of the naval academy reply the superintendent coldly i -- i -- personally do not desire to press any complaint continue young crane i be sorry that my friend take such a step then you consider mr crane press the superintendent that the knock-down blow you receive from a midshipman be in the nature of a merited punishment i -- i will not say that cry crane quickly no sir i will not admit it then as we know that midshipman totten be you assailant continue the superintendent we shall have to place that young man on trial we shall be oblige to summon you as a witness at that trial mr crane but i have no intention sir of appear as a witness bluster that young man mr crane you can have no choice in the matter if we summon you you can be bring here from any part of the united state i -- i -- can not the matter be drop sir urge the young man anxiously not unless you confess yourself in the wrong and exonerate mr totten in any other event the case will have to come to trial before a court-martial and you mr crane since we be certain that you possess material evidence will be force to appear as a witness mr crane look almost as uncomfortable as he feel mr totten continue the superintendent state that you grossly insult he cousin a young woman and that he meet you on purpose to avenge that insult there -- there -- be some trouble about a young woman admit crane but i be a gentleman sir i be not expect to decide the last question that you have raise reply the superintendent dryly all that concern I in the matter be whether you exonerate mr totten or whether you do not if you do not the midshipman must state he case fully before a court-martial at which you will be one of the important witness i exonerate mr totten reply crane in a very low tone do you exonerate he completely ye-e sir then mr totten 's offense will be reduce to one or two-simple breach of discipline go on the superintendent but see here sir interpose one of the other young man be you midshipman to be allow to go about pound whom they like be they to be swashbuckler and bully very decidedly not sir reply the superintendent in a voice almost thunderous the midshipman of the united state naval academy must conduct themselves as gentleman at all time do they do that urge the last speaker when they sail into we as they do why do you friend go to the assistance of mr crane ask the superintendent be -- because stammer the spokesman you midshipman have knock crane down and be misuse he do you the friend of mr crane consider it the act of gentleman for several to rush in and attack one man that leave the caller rather breathless now as to we other three midshipman pursue the superintendent at most they only rush in to see fair play they do not make a hostile move until they see a whole crowd of you attack one midshipman gentleman i be quite ready to leave it to a jury of any intelligent citizen as to whether the offend midshipman or yourselve display the more gallantry and honor for you have all admit do something that be not consistent with the highest standard of a gentleman while we accuse midshipman have no such reproach against they then you midshipman be to get off and to be encourage to repeat such conduct demand the spokesman of the crane party no on the contrary they will be punish for whatever breach of naval discipline they have commit consider what you gentleman have admit however i do not believe you would have any standing as witness before a court-martial i therefore advise you all to drop you complaint yet if you insist on a complaint then i will see to it that midshipman totten be bring to trial crane and he associate feel very quickly and keenly that they would cut but sorry figure in such a trial they therefore beg to withdraw they former complaint when they have depart the superintendent smile at he reflection in the glass opposite before supper all of the midshipman involve know they fate they be restore to full liberty darrin dalzell and joyce be again rebuke for have take such elaborate pain to escape recognize totten at the time of the encounter beyond the lecture by the commandant of midshipman each of the trio be further punish by the imposition of ten demerit in frenching and in take justice into he own hand midshipman totten be hold to have err however the nature of he grievance and the fact that he be only a new fourth classman be take into consideration for french he be punish with twenty-five demerit for the assault on a civilian consider all the circumstance he be let off with ten additional demerit yet somehow all of the midshipman involve feel they punishment very lightly they could not escape the conviction that the naval academy authority do not regard they as especially guilty offender we have get you back on the gridiron at any rate exclaim hepson exultantly we of the football squad wish that we might be permit to divide you demerit up among ourselves you might suggest that little point to the commandant of midshipman grin dan and get jolly well trounce for we impudence grimace midshipman hepson no thank you though you criminal have we utmost sympathy we will let matter rest where they be at present only a fool try to change well enough into worse chapter xv the navy goat weep do you hear that ellum have a bad tumble down three story ask midshipman dan ellum who question dave look up elevator grin dalzell ugh grunt dave disgustedly say do you know how that would strike the com no reply dan innocently look away how would it strike he hard dave respond slam the somewhat heavy book that darrin aim go straight to the mark landing against dan 's nearer ear with all the force of a sound boxing i see you appreciate a good joke mutter dalzell grimly yes dave admit do you when i tell you another growl dan i 'll be hold a axe hide behind my back say do i show you that letter of dick 's dave ask look up presently appendix inquire dan suspiciously oh stow all that little boy retort dave no do i tell you that i have a letter from dick prescott i think you mention something of the sort last winter dalzell admit still suspicious no i get one this morning from good old dick darrin go on all right dan agree what be the answer i have not have time to read it yet darrin respond but here be the letter maybe you would like to look it over across the study table dan dalzell receive the envelope and its enclosure rather gingerly dan do not like to be catch bite at a sell and he still expect some trick from he roommate it be however a letter write in dick prescott 's well-remembered handwriting i understand that you be both on the navy team and that you make good in the first game write the west point cadet i hope you 'll both stay in to the finish and improve with every game greg and i be plug hard at the game in the little time that the west point routine allow we for practice from what i have hear of you game i think it likely that you and good but impish old dan be play against the very position that greg and i hope to hold in the annual army-navy game will not it be great yes it will be great all right if the navy contrive to win dan mutter look up at he chum either the army or navy must lose reply dave quietly and just think cadet dick prescott 's letter run on when we meet line up for battle on franklin field philadelphium it will be the first time we four have meet since we wind up the good old high school day at gridley it seem a age to greg and I i wonder if the time seem as long to you two it seem to I remark dan glancing across at he chum that you and i david little giant have be here at annapoli almost ever since we first don trousers to please the family it be a long time back to gridley day assent darrin then dan go on reading of course you and dan be bind that the navy shall win this year dick have write as for greg and I we be equally determine that the army shall win as if the resolution on either side have much of anything to do with it it will seem strange for we four divide between the two side to be fight frantically for the victory however if greg and i go up against you two on the gridiron we will not show you any mercy and we know that we shall receive none from you each man must do all that be possibly in he for the glory of he own side of the united service here be to the better eleven -- army or navy i 'll bet dick and greg will give we all the tussle they know how if they get near we in the fight nod dan pass the letter back well they be bind to be not they demand darrin and now danny boy we simply must stow all gab and get busy with we lesson we have a recitation between now and the afternoon practice and the game to-morrow breathe midshipman dalzell fervently the morrow 's game be to be against the university of pennsylvanium eleven the opposition team be a unusually good one that year the navy 's gridiron pet be prepare to strain every nerve in the hope of victory in that afternoon 's practice dave and dan show up better than ever farley and page too be come along splendidly while midshipman joyce be prove himself all but a joy to exact hepson but when the morrow come up carry away the game to the tune of five to nothing and the navy goat weep dave and dan make several brilliant play but the navy average both of size and skill be somewhat below that of the older bigger college man other game follow fast now and the navy eleven and its sub have plenty of work cut out for they up to the time of the army-navy game the middy have a bright slate of eighty per cent of victory dave and dan have the pleasure of reading in the army and navy journal that they be consider the strongest man on the left flank that the navy have be able to show in ten year when we go up against the army hepson inform dave and dan i do not know whether you 'll play at left or right it will all depend on where the army put prescott and holme friend of ours who have watch the play at west point tell I that prescott and holme be armored terror on the gridiron they be if they have go forward in the game instead of backward darrin reply honestly but you and dalzell can hold 'em can not you demand hepson anxiously i do not dare brag dave answer the truth if anything be that danny boy and i can hardly hope to hold the army pair back you see hep i know prescott and holme pretty well from the fact that we play together on the same high school eleven for two year prescott in fact be the boy who train we all well do not let the navy fellow get the idea that you be afraid of that army pair beg hepson it might get we man discourage darry we simply must wipe up the field with the army there be not -- there can not be any such word as ` defeat ' for we as the time draw near for the greatest of all annual game the instructor at the naval academy begin to record lower mark for nearly all of the man in the daily recitation the midshipmen simply could not keep they mind from wander to the gridiron it mean so much -- to beat the army then quickly enough the feverish day come early in the forenoon the entire brigade of midshipman in uniform be march into town behind the naval academy band score of navy officer with they lady go along a lot of the townspeople follow in the big rush to odenton and baltimore from there two section of a special train convey the annapoli host to philadelphium franklin field be reach and one of the most brilliant athletic and social event of the year be on we shall not attempt to follow the course of the game here the navy eleven hurl itself into the fray with undying heroism but the army win the great game it be all tell in the third volume of the west point series entitle dick presscott 's third year at west point in that volume too be describe the meeting of the old-time high school chum they first meeting since the old-time day back in the tome town of gridley the game be over at last the navy be crestfallen though not a sign of sorrow or humiliation show in the jaunty step of the man of the brigade as they march back to the railway station and take the train for the first stage of the journey home -- the run between philadelphium and baltimore on the train hepson hunt up dave and dan you do you best fellow i know that murmur the defeat football captain and you give I in advance a fair estimate of that army pair prescott and holme say but they be a pair of terror if we have that pair on the navy eleven along with you two no team that the army ever yet send out could beat we but we make a strong fight at any rate all of we friend say that i be glad i do not do any bragging in advance darrin smile wistfully we be fairly eat up hep oh well we 'll hope for better luck next year with the navy under some other captain maybe you 'll be captain next year darry i do not want to be dave answer with a shake of he head if you could not carry we team to victory i do not dare try then i 'll be captain -- if i be asked promise dan with the grin that always lurk close to the surface of he face while hundred of midshipman feel desperately blue on the homeward journey dalzell have already nearly forget he disappointment you 'll never be ask predict hepson good-humoredly danny boy the trouble with you would be that the fellow would never know when you be in earnest as captain of the eleven you might start to give a order and then nothing but a pun would come forth you be too full of mischief to win victory i hope that will not be true if i ever have the luck to command a battleship in war time sigh dalzell become serious for four or five seconds then he bent forward and drop a cold nickel inside of joyce 's collar the cold coin course down joyce 's spine cause that tired and discourage midshipman to jump up with a yell why do the com ever allow that five-year-old imp to travel with man grunt joyce disgustedly as he sit down again and now realize that the nickel be under he next to the skin danny boy groan dave will you ever grow up why do you go on make a pest of yourself why the fellow need some cheer up do not they dan inquire if you do not look out danny boy you 'll rouse they to such a pitch of cheerfulness that they 'll raise one of the car window and drop you outside for sheer joy the joy that have be manifest in annapoli that morning be utterly still when the brigade reach the home town once more true the band play as a matter of duty but as the midshipman march down maryland avenue in brigade formation they pass many a heap of faggot and many a tar-barrel that have be place there by the boy of the town to kindle into bonfire with which to welcome the return victor but to-night the faggot-pile and the tar-barrel lay unlighted in the dark this material for bonfire that never be light look like so many spectral reminder of they recent defeat it hurt it always hurt -- either the cadet or the midshipman -- to lose the army-navy game once back at quarter in bancroft hall it seem to many of the midshipman as though it would have be a relief to have to go to study table to work yet since no work be actually require on this night none be do midshipman wander about in they own room and visit the more they realize the defeat the bluer they become from some room come sound of laughter but it be hollow farley get out a banjo break into a lively darky reel yet somehow the sound be mournful please stop that dirge and play something cheerful beg the voice of a pass midshipman put the lyre away farl advise page nothing sound happy to-night we love to sing and dance we be happy all the day -- ha ha wail dan dalzell he be not so very blue himself but he be try to keep in sympathy with the general tone of feeling well hep you make as good a show after all as could be expect with a dub team speak joyce consolingly when they meet in a corridor it be not a dub team retort hepson dismally the eleven be all right the only trouble lay in have a dub for a captain it be a relief to hundred that night when tap sound at last and the master switch turn off the light in midshipmen quarter at least the young man be healthy and do not waste hour in woo sleep and forgetfulness then Sunday morning come and the football season be over until the next year from now on it be go to be like start life all over again after a fire be the way dan put it that Sunday morning in a effort to make some of he comrade feel that all be not lose have dan be able to foresee event which he and dave must soon encounter even that grin midshipman would not have be happy chapter xvi the man with a scowl on tap i wish we live in annapoli that we might be here at every hop sigh belle meade as the waltz finish and she and dave flush and happy seek seat at the side of the ballroom they have hardly seat themselves when they be join by dan and laura bentley i be just say laura belle go on that it would be splendid if we live here all through the winter then we would have a chance to come to every hop would not we want to put in a part of the winter near west point ask miss bentley smile though with a wistful look in she eye perhaps that would be fairer to you belle agree you would soon get tire of the hop ventured dave can one ever weary of dance belle demand well perhaps one might though never on the small amount that have come to I so far in life and this navy orchestra play so divinely we number 's next i believe lady call midshipman farley as he and page come up eager for they chance with these two very charming belle of the hop hang you farl muttered dave that be just like darrin miss meade laugh farley he be always a monopolist at heart though in this instance i be far from wonder at he desire to be it be the first hop after the semi-annual exam a host of fourth classman and some from the upper class have be drop immediately after the examination but dave and dan and all they more intimate friend in the brigade have pull through darrin and dalzell have come out of the ordeal with the highest marking they have yet achieve at the naval academy mr meade have come down to annapoli to chaperon belle and laura but this evening mr meade be chat with a middle-aged naval officer and so do not see much of the young people as the music strike up farley and page claim consideration dave and dan be leave without partner nothing more do for two dance david little giant murmured midshipman dalzell suppose we slip into we overcoat and walk around outside i would rather assent darrin it be dull in here when a fellow be not dance it be a night of unusually light attendance on the part of the fair sex with a rather larger attendance than usual of midshipman for which reason dave find many other midshipman outside stroll up and down what we need fellow call joyce come up to the chum be a new regulation that no midshipman may attend a hop unless he drag a femme that would have shut you out of every hop so far this year laugh dave i know it joyce admit but i be go to cut all hop after this unless some real queen will favor I as she escort and agree to dance at least half the number with I i have have only two dance this evening it be too tame i be go back to bancroft hall and stand ready to turn in at the first signal what be the use of hang around at a hop when there be only one girl to every five fellow you have suffer the just fate of the free lance remark dan dalzell virtuously as for I i never think of attend a hop unless i squire some femme thither there use to be girl enough last year complain joyce well i be off for home and bed we 'll stroll along up with you propose darrin no girl for you either not for two number then we return to the young lady that we escort here just to think grunted joyce sniff in the salt air that reach they from the waterfront a good deal more than a year more here before we get regularly at sea it seem as though we would be here a long time sigh dave but i do not suppose there be ever a midshipman yet who do not long to get away from annapoli and into the real permanent life on the wave a west point man must feel some of the same longing but he be on the land at west point object joyce and he be still on land after he graduate and go to some post the army cadet have no such glorious future to look forward to as have a midshipman hello here 's jet call dave as a midshipman envelop in he overcoat approach they go to the hop jet will you do I a great favor ask midshipman jetson certainly if possible agree dave cordially then mind you own business snap the other midshipman darrin who have make it a point to forget the brief unpleasantness of the football season receive this rebuke with about the same feeling that a slap in the face would have give he the sulky midshipman have step past the trio but dave after swallow hard wheel about and hail : hold on there mr jetson well demand jetson halt and look back i do not like you tone sir and i do not like you face sir retort jetson nor you cheek either for that matter i try to treat you pleasantly dave go on hurt and offend oh it require a effort do it sneer jetson something may have happen that i do not know anything about darrin continue it may be that you have some real reason for treat I as you have just do if you have any good reason i wish you would tell I for in that case i must have do something that put I in wrong if that be the case i want to make amends oh -- bosh grumble the other midshipman come on now urge dave be a man then you imply that i be not demand jetson aggressively not necessarily dave contend i just want to make sure in my own mind and i should think you would be similarly interested if you want to insult I mr darrin flare back jetson i 'll remain here long enough to hear you and to arrange for resent the insult otherwise -- well insist dave quietly though he anger be rise otherwise otherwise retort midshipman jetson i 'll pursue my way and seek company that please I better look out jet old hot-plate laugh joyce you 'll soon be insulting all three of we i do not intend to jetson rejoin quickly my quarrel concern only mr darrin oho murmur dave there be a quarrel then if you choose to pick one but i do not mr jetson quarrel be out of my line if i have do you any harm or any injustice i be ready to make good by apology and otherwise and if i have not wrong you in any way you should be equally manly and apologize for you treatment of I just now oh bosh snap mr jetson once more this be none of my quarrel interpose midshipman joyce and i be not intentionally a promoter of hard feeling but it seem to I jet that darry have speak as fairly as any fellow could now it seem to I that it be up to you to be equally manly so you too be assert that i be not manly bristle mr jetson haughtily you all seem bind to force trouble on I to-night not i then retort joyce he spirit rise i be find myself force to the belief that you be hardly worth have trouble with jetson clench he fist take a step forward he dark eye flash then he halt as though imply that he be not thus easily to be drive into forget himself come along fellow urge dan dalzell in a low voice mr jetson seem to have no intention either of explain or of afford other satisfaction hold on mr jetson you need not answer he interpose darrin quickly as jetson open he mouth first of all this affair seem to concern I you have intimate that i be no friend of yours and not worthy to be rank as such now i ask you fairly and flatly what have bring you mind to this pitch what have i do or what have not i do search you conscience jeer jetson i have be do so ever since this foolish conversation start and i have not find the answer yet all i recall jetson be that at the outset of my football practice there be some little unpleasantness between we you injure I twice in practice play and i admit that i be somewhat angry about it at the time but you give you word that you have not intend any trick against I i believe you to be a man of honor and i accept you word that you be innocent of evil intention against I have accept you word i hold no further grudge in the matter and i have as nearly forget the whole business as a man with a memory can then tell I why i do not play on the football eleven flame up midshipman jetson principally i imagine because captain hepson after consultation with the coach do not call you to the navy eleven and why do not hepson call I follow up jetson all he pent-up sulkiness boil over now i do not know particularly probably i imagine for the same reason that he do not call a lot of other man to the eleven -- because he believe he could make a better choice darrin you know well enough that you so influence hepson to keep I off the team jetson be you mad no but i be naturally angry i give you my word that i do not do anything to prevent you make the team and you expect I mr darrin to believe that if you decline to do so it amount to pass the lie but i 'll overlook that for a moment joyce i think hepson be not dance at present will you return to the hop and if he be not dance will you bring he out here i do not want to see hepson cry midshipman jetson you be the only one i be interested in in this matter mr darrin you have virtually refuse to accept my word i do so refuse then you call I -- a liar if you like snap back midshipman jetson sir do you realize -- i realize that you be still talk sneer jetson then i will not talk any longer reply dave darrin in a quiet but dangerous voice since you refuse to listen even to hepson -- who be take my name in vain demand a laughing voice as a burly figure move in between dave and he enemy the new comer be hepson who have come upon the group unnoticed perhaps you be just in time hep murmur dave fight to cool down he temper i want you to prove -- stop ejaculate jetson angrily in he extreme passion he throw all restraint and courtesy to the wind i would not take the word of hepson or of any man in the entire brigade in this matter darrin have lie and -- step aside hep please urge dave give the late football captain a gentle shove this matter can not go any further in word mr jetson you have insult I and grossly be you capable of cool down do you wish to retract -- to apologize apologize to you -- you -- whatever the word be it do not get out for in the same instant darrin cry warningly : guard yourself midshipman jetson throw up he hand but darrin 's right fist land across he offend mouth with such force as to fall the sulky midshipman flat to the earth chapter xvii a affair of sulk have strike the blow midshipman darrin step back to give he opponent a unobstructed chance to rise to he foot what be this all about demand midshipman hepson wonderingly it be go too far for talk now reply dan dalzell wait until darry have put a new head on this idiot jetson take he time about get to he foot when he do rise he do not assume he guard at once well ask darrin coolly but mockingly have you have all you can stand or be you go to back up you wild crazy statement suddenly jetson raise one of he foot quickly as though to kick dave in the belt line here stop that cry hepson and joyce in the same breath as they spring forward darrin see other interfere do not attempt to strike back but merely step aside that be the chance for which jetson have be watch he kick do not land he have not intend that it should but dave 's surprised recoil give the other the chance that he really want both of jetson 's fist strike on dave 's nose draw a flood of the crimson you coward you cur gasp amaze dalzell silence all order hepson speaking by virtue of be a first classman jet be crazy but he can not be expect to take up more than one affair at a time darry take you time to stop the flow of blood then you can demand a accounting of jetson i have nothing more to say remark jetson i be strike and i have return the blow with interest that end my concern in the affair good night all hold on order hepson bound forward and lay a strong detain hand on jetson 's shoulder you can not slip away like that matter have go so far that they 'll simply have to go further you would put yourself wholly in the wrong by withdraw now -- especially after the slimy trick that you have play a fair opponent slimy eh cry jetson angrily mr hepson you and i will have to have a accounting too oh just as you like respond the first classman shrug he shoulder you 'll find it a better rule however to stick to one affair at a time darry be you in shape now to attend to this matter from you point of view quite nod dave who have about succeed in stanch the flow of blood from he injured nose do mr jetson desire to take he coat off or not yes cry jetson tempestuously unbutton he own overcoat and toss it to the ground now take yours off mr darrin it be off respond dave toss the garment aside now look to yourself sir the two second classman close in furiously it be give and take for a few moment in the clinch however jetson succeed in tear darrin 's dress coat and also in start the blood again so that the crimson drip down on dave 's white shirt front at the end of a full minute however darrin have send he enemy to the ground stop in a knock-out both of jetson 's eye be also close and badly swollen joyce ask hepson will you kindly remain with jetson and see that he be assist to the hospital if he need it it will not do for too many of we especially darry to be find here by any officer who may be pass i 'll attend to it nod midshipman joyce though i would rather perform the service for any other fellow in the brigade now that the affair be over and dave after inspect the damage to he dress coat be pull on he overcoat he be suddenly recall to other responsibility danny boy he say ruefully as hepson walk away with they i can not very well get back to the hop soon -- perhaps not at all tonight i can not go back in this tear coat and i may not be able to borrow another that will fit I well will you be good enough to hurry back and explain to belle why i be delay -- perhaps prevent from see she again tonight certainly nod dalzell turn and hasten back now what be it all about darry ask hepson as he walk along with dave midshipman darrin explain the trouble as well as he could so the idiot accuse you of keep he off the football eleven demand hepson in astonishment yes and i offer to prove by you that i have nothing to do with he exclusion from the team why the sole and whole reason why jetson be not call to the navy team declare hepson be because he be believe to be too awkward and too dangerous to other player whew but i be certainly sorry this thing have happen so be i dave confess candidly and jet make the further fool mistake of declare that he would not accept the word of any midshipman in the brigade something of the sort why that be a wholesale blanket insult to the whole brigade darry you class will have to take action over such a remark as that oh jetson utter the remark in the heat of a exceptional temper that will not save he predict hepson sagely the insult be there and it will stick you class darry would lose caste with the fellow here if it allow such a insult to go well if it get around i suppose some sort of action will have to be take the second class under the circumstance can not do much less than send jetson to coventry oh that would be too much dave protest generously jetson have always be a honorable square fellow in the past he have always be infernally sulky and high-handed growled midshipman hepson a bad temper be not such a uncommon fail smile dave no but there be limit to the amount of temper that a gentleman may display and still be worthy to associate with gentleman contend hepson stubbornly it be the insult to the whole brigade that i be think of darry i 'll wager that you class will not and can not do less than give jetson a trip to coventry -lrb- illustration : take off you overcoat mr darrin -rrb- oh that would be too much -- unjust protest dave the class will do it just the same if the class mix up in my affair and carry it so far as to send jetson to coventry i 'll be hang if i do not go there with he cry darrin impulsively the word be out a man of darrin 's honest nature would feel bind to stand by even that heated utterance oh come now darry do not be so foolish over a fellow who have treat you in such fashion i have say it have not i ask dave grimly it would be a utter injustice and i be not go to see something that be my own affair distort into a injustice that would be altogether out of proportion to jetson 's offense by this time the stroll pair of midshipman have reach the entrance to bancroft hall what be you go to try to do about you dress coat darry ask hepson in a undertone borrow one if i can find one that fit take my advice then do not just borrow and thereby run a chance of get both yourself and the lender in trouble for of course you know that one can never tell when a inspection may be make and the man whose dress coat be go would have to account for it so go to the o c state that you coat be accidentally tear and ask permission to borrow one in order that you may return and escort you lady back to the hotel you o c will not raise any objection to that but he might want to see the coat that i have on grimace dave then the o c would be sure to see the blood-drip on my shirt front or the collar at least then talk of a mere accident might lead to question as to the nature of the accident true nod hepson then get back to you room get out clean linen and get into it while you be do that i 'll negotiate the loan of a dress coat that will fit then you can go to the o c after you have change the telltale linen this course accordingly be follow dave change he linen as quickly as he could while hepson appear with three borrow dress coat for a try-on one be find to fill the bill rest it over a chair darrin slip on he service blouse and report to the oc permission be grant to borrow a dress coat if the officer in charge feel any suspicion or curiosity as to the nature of the accident he cleverly conceal the fact a good deal of time however have be consume by the time that midshipman dave darrin return to the hop the orchestra be just break into the strain of home sweet home dave 's quick glance rove the floor and the seat he behold belle meade seat at the side while farley bent over she in a invite attitude darrin quickly reach the scene belle see he come just in time to refrain from take farley 's arm you will not mind this time will you farl dave ask smile i have give you up say belle as they move away together in the dance of course dan tell you what have delay I he tell I you would return as soon as you could reply miss meade but he be provokingly mysterious as to the cause of you absence there be a little trouble dave whisper be you in trouble ask belle quickly she cheek pale no i think not by trouble i mean that i just take part in a fight so you take the time when i be here as the most suitable occasion for a fight ask belle she color come back and heighten it be not wise for I to explain it now belle dave tell she quickly you will not blame I when you know but i would rather save it for tell when we be out of the academy grounds oh just as you like dave we must not let anything spoil what be left of this last short dance of the night thank you belle these dance together do not happen any too frequently it be when the young people be walk back to the maryland hotel and mr meade have join dan and laura that belle again ask the nature of the trouble that have deprive darrin of three of he dance with she dave tell the story briefly add : under the midshipman 's code the blow have to be strike when the lie be pass i do not blame you for knock the fellow down belle agree indignantly what a worthless fellow that mr jetson must be do you know belle i can not quite bring myself to believe that he be worthless he conduct show it argue the girl at first think it would appear so but jetson i believe be only the victim of a unhappy temper that make he suspicious and resentful he be brave enough and he be never be catch in a dishonorable trick except the trick he play on you at the football practice he pass he word that he intend no trick and i have be wholly incline to take he word in the matter dave you must look out for this man jetson he be go to get you into some trouble before you be through with he exclaim belle earnestly all she instinct be arouse in the matter for dave darrin 's success be dearer to belle meade than be anything else in the world there be two thing that i regret very much to-night dave go on one be that jetson should provoke such a senseless dispute and the other that i should be oblige to miss so much of you company here at annapoli i would not mind anything belle answer if i could feel sure that no more trouble would come out of this affair with jetson i do not believe there will be any disturbing outcome dave assure she unless possibly another fight a fight be nothing declare belle with spirit you be in training to become a fight man and a bout or two at fistcuff be nothing more or less than so much valuable experience dave promise I something of course if it be anything promisable you 'll write I -- can you doubt that belle and let I know exactly and truthfully if anything further come of this she finish i 'll write and tell you anything that a midshipman be at liberty to make known concern the conduct of the brigade just what do that cover ask belle i can not easily answer until the something or other happen to turn up at any rate dave if i get a suspicion that you be withhold from I anything that i ought to know i shall be dreadfully worry you can not have any idea how worried i have be about you sometimes in the past not much time be there for the two midshipman to remain at the foot of the step of the hotel then after hearty good night dave and dan leave the lady whom they would not see again until the next visit from one or two thing that i could not help overhear i judge that belle be greatly worry over the possibility of trouble arise from the jetson affair remark dan on the way back to the naval academy and quarter yes dave admit pooh how can any trouble come to you out of the matter with jetson it be different he declare that he would not take the word of any midshipman in the brigade that be speak in the heat of temper jetson do not mean it just the same some of the fellow have hear of it already and i sha not be surprise if we class hold a meeting and send jetson to coventry -- where the fellow belong if they send jetson to coventry speak dave quietly though bluntly i shall go along to coventry with he dalzell halt stare at he chum in open-mouthed wonder you idiot blaze dan in wrathful disgust chapter xviii the class meeting sit as jury three day later the class meeting be hold jetson be especially impressed with the notion that he must attend since he must appear as the accuse with one of he disposition it be quite natural that the young man should go before the class in a highly resentful mood after a few introductory remark jetson be summon by the class president to rise mr jetson ask the class president do you intend to deny have make the remark imputed to you -- that you would not take the word of any midshipman in the brigade i make the remark after a measure sir jetson reply what i say be that in a certain matter i would not take the word of any midshipman in the brigade if it go counter to my fixed belief mr jetson do not you consider that under the circumstance that amount to a statement of you unwillingness to accept the word of member of the brigade i should be sorry to have that construction place on my remark mr president for i know that nearly all the man of the brigade be man with a fine sense of honor then how do you reconcile this statement with you other one mr president i mean and i still mean that i be so certain of the truth of the charge that i make to one darrin that if member of the brigade speak differently i would then know that they be not tell the truth a storm of protest go up while one hoarse voice bellow : throw he out and another call : coventry order command the class president rap hard with he gavel mr jetson it be a most serious matter to impugn the good faith and honor of the brigade it be hardly mitigate by the fact that the word be utter in the heat of passion especially when in you cooler moment you be not incline to retract you statement or to render it harmless i believe therefore that i be in accord with the sense of this meeting of the class when i ask you if you have any retraction or apology to offer for the statement in the form in which i offer it mr president i have no retraction or apology to offer and only such explanation as i have lately give coventry coventry come the insistent call well then you can send I to coventry you friend of darrin if you feel yourselve justified in do it quiver midshipman jetson toss he head and glaring defiantly around the room mr president mr wentworth in view of the charge and the subsequent statement of mr jetson i feel that we have a unpleasant duty to perform the brigade be found and base on honor we the member can not allow that honor to be impugn by one who would otherwise be fit to be a member of the brigade as mr jetson refuse to retract he word and as some one must take the initiative it be my disagreeable duty to move you sir that the second class decide that mr jetson be no longer worthy to be of we number and that he accordingly be send to coventry mr president mr page mr president i desire to second the motion and this i do as regretfully as it be move oh go ahead and send I to coventry then jetson blaze forth angrily this class appear to have be hypnotize by darrin but even if you do send I to coventry we shall see whether you action will be potent enough to drive I from the naval academy wave he arm wildly in the heat of he anger midshipman jetson hurry from the room midshipman move aside to favor he swift exit hardly have the door bang when from all part of the room the cry go up : question question put the motion mr president mr darrin i arise sir to discuss the motion i ask the gentleman of the class to bear with I patiently while i set forth some of the aspect of this matter as i see they at the very outset sir i wish to make it as plain as possible that i do not seek to stand here as the apologist for mr jetson i feel very certain that he would not authorize I to take that position what i state i be state on my own authority purely and therein i be only exercise my right as a member of the second class i would remind you sir that you all know as well as i do that mr jetson have always bear a honorable reputation in this class and in the brigade you all know he lead trait as well as i do mr jetson be a man of quick temper and rather lasting resentment there be a good deal of sullenness in he nature -- and they be not the best quality in a man who be be train to command break in a midshipman at the rear of the room as to whether mr jetson will be by graduation time well fit to command man dave answer be not a question that this class be call upon to pass on that question rest with the faculty of the naval academy i be try to get you to look at this matter only from the personal and the class point of view doubtless you all feel that mr jetson be the victim of a unhappy temper you would punish this frame of mind yet i ask you bluntly who among you have ever try to aid mr jetson in overcome he own peculiar style of temper if there be one among you who have make such attempt at aid i ask that gentleman to stand until he can be recognize dave make a pause glance around he but no midshipman rise now sir continue dave darrin if we as a class take hasty and unwise action it be quite possible that we may be deprive the united state navy of a future officer who would be most valuable to he country in time of need have we the right to punish when we be force to admit that none of we have ever attempt to help mr jetson to escape from the fruit of he temperament mr president how would you attempt to extinguish a fire by fan it yet when a member of this class be smoulder in he own wrath it be propose to meet he sullenness by cast he out of we friendship do we not owe some duty to we country in this matter mr jetson be one of we capable student in this brigade and if he be give a fair chance to graduate he be likely to become a naval officer of merit do we desire to take upon ourselves the probable smother of such a naval career mr president and you gentleman of the second class i trust sincerely that the motion of coventry in this case will not prevail i feel as i believe many of you now present feel that we should be take too much upon ourselves and that we should be make a grave mistake if the motion now before the class should be defeat i shall then be delighted to second any other motion that have for its object the finding of some way to make mr jetson feel more fully that he be one of we that he have we full sympathy and that we hope to see he mould he character into a form that will enable he to become a credit to the united state navy as darrin sit down there be a ripple of applause there be many present however who take a sterner view of the affair these want to see jetson and all other who might similarly offend the brigade force to quit the naval service question question call a score of voice at once any further remark inquire the class president glance about mr president mr jerould mr president say midshipman jerould i be certain that we all appreciate the remark of mr darrin the remark be prompt by a generous heart and we respect mr darrin and he motive alike but i be certain sir that the majority of we feel that this be a ugly business and that only stern treatment can meet the situation i therefore trust that the motion will be at once put and pass -lrb- loud cry of hear hear -rrb- any further -- mr president mr darrin mr president i wish i could throw my whole be and soul into this problem in order to make it clearer as i see it i would even appeal as a favor to the class to quash this coventry resolution and perhaps i might be consider to have some right to ask the favor since the whole trouble grow out of a affair between mr jetson and myself i beg of you all classmate to quash the motion now before the class no no no come the hearty response then mr president and gentleman go on dave darrin in a voice slow and grave speaking for myself as a individual member i beg to state that i can not respect a coventry order under such circumstance in this matter i would find myself unable to respect the mandate of the class therefore i beg you to send I to coventry with mr jetson blank astonishment fall over the second class utter indignation seize some of the midshipman in another moment the feeling boil up so that a few hiss rise dave darrin be pallid but he have no desire to recede he have act accord to the dictate of he conscience and he have keep he word in that pained instant midshipman farley seek to save the situation he leap to he foot shout : mr president i move that this meeting adjourn second the motion call page promptly and now there be uproar on all side chapter xix dave stand on principle a motion to adjourn be always in order the class president put it aye come a thundering response contrary mind no the aye appear to have it but the chair call for a showing of hand then the chair declare the class meeting adjourn hustle along with we darry i want to talk with you sputter farley he thrust a arm inside of dave 's and carry he along dalzell and page follow straight to darrin 's quarter they go now then demand farley almost savagely what be the meaning of the very remarkable exhibition that you give the class how be it remarkable question dave in you ask the class to send you to coventry along with jetson it be not just to jetson just because he make a slip that he should be shun by the whole class could not the class decide that better than one man insist farley he eye gleam without a doubt dave admit i do not attempt to do the decide for the class all i do be to try to throw my personal weight against it and you compel the class to adjourn without attend to jetson 's case you be wrong there farl do not you i certainly do not darry you know the class would not vote to send you to coventry just because you have venture to give you opinion now the only way the class could escape from the consequence of you action be to adjourn without action on jetson it be you farl who move to adjourn just to save a lot of hot-blood from jump on you darry they would have do it in another minute the motion to adjourn be the only thing we could do that be just it nod midshipman page but there 'll have to be another meeting call right away farley go on the brigade will expect it -- will have a right to demand it a member of we class have insult the whole brigade and under we old tradition only the second class can administer discipline well then pursue darrin calmly when the new meeting be hold jetson and myself can be punish if that be the wish of the entire class darry storm farley you have simply get to withdraw you fool remark when the class come together again do you expect that i 'll do that dave inquire if you do not retort farley warmly you will not be worth the further concern of you friend what do you say danny boy from what i know of dave darrin reply dalzell the class will be waste its time if it expect darry to retract but what do you want to be send to coventry for demand farley i do not dave answer i know how it hurt i would not see any midshipman here send to coventry for anything except positive and undeniable dishonor jetson have not be guilty of anything worse than a mean quick temper and a fit of sulk afterwards that be why with my experience here at annapoli if jetson be to be send to coventry i decline to be bind by the class action but you can not refuse to be bind by class action retort farley aghast try I and see smile dave stubbornly do not be a idiot darry it would be a contemptible thing dave go on as calmly as before coventry would mean the chasing of jetson out of the brigade you would ruin a man for a defect of temper that some of you other do not possess in quite the same degree be it fair to ruin any man because he have the misfortune to have a fit of sulk that be why i will not heed the class action if it cut jetson i 'll bow to he whenever i meet he i 'll talk to he if he 'll let I but he will not insist farley triumphantly no such sulky fellow as jetson will let you make up to he if he refuse dave contend then i can not help it but i will not be a party to ruin the man it would be far more to the purpose if the fellow would help the fellow to see that he sulkiness be he worst barrier here then a good student and naturally honorable fellow would develop into a capable naval officer that be the kind of talk for the padre -lrb- chaplain -rrb- sniff farley glad you mention the padre dave retort he be just the man to settle the case farley i 'll go with you to the padre at any time you state one side of the case and i 'll state the other if the padre do not back I then i 'll retract all i have say in open class meeting and abide by whatever action the class may take oh bother the padre snort farley angrily all right then answer dave good-humoredly if the class have a matter of ethic and moral that it do not dare submit to a expert in moral then the class action be weak and wrong there be no use talk to you i be afraid sigh farley ruefully but if you -- here the call to study interrupted further discussion farley shake he head gravely leave the room follow by page who be shake he head with equal force if you think you be all right david little giant go ahead remark dalzell as he pass to he study desk i think i be right dave answer if not i can be make to see the light i do not claim to know everything but what i have do i do in a effort to see and do the right thing when release from study come dalzell expect to see several member of the class drop in to he astonishment the minute speed by without any knock at the door you have get yourself in badly dave dan remark at last the fellow do not even think it worth while to come here and remonstrate with you for which i be thankful darrin smile danny boy i be go to bed without wait for tap by morning the news of dave 's action at the class meeting be know throughout the brigade as he stroll about for a few minute after breakfast while dan go back to he room to do some hurry study darrin note that many once friendly face be turn away from he good morning hepson be dave 's greet as he friend go by good morning mutter hepson and be go good morning watson say dave to one of he own classmate ` morning ' reply that midshipman briefly and turn away joyce page and several other second classman be stand in a group when dave stroll in they direction good morning fellow from dave joyce and page answer some of the other merely nod coldly presently all have stroll away except joyce and page you see how it be darry murmured joyce you have hurt the fellow be they go to cut I after this dave ask he smile be friendly though the look in he eye be cool no-o-o hesitate midshipman joyce i do not believe the fellow will exactly cut you at least not unless the situation grow more acute but many of the fellow be sore on you for you word last night my word be only my word my opinion do not have to govern anyone else joyce but hang it darry the class do not want to cut you out can not you get that through you head the class do not have to cut I but it will if it put jetson in coventry and you break the coventry that be what the fellow hate to do to you and that be why they be all so sore at you i see nodded dave come now darry you be go to be reasonable be not you beg joyce do not break you friend all up with you stubbornness i note that two of the fellow be talk with jetson continue dave let he glance wander to another group they have a right to contend joyce the class have not yet commit itself as to jetson darry if you do not look out warn page you 'll precipitate matter you may bring the storm down on jetson if you test the temper and stubbornness of a offended class i see that i be wrong in at least one particular nod dave thoughtfully i should not have make any remark about my intention i should have confine myself to a plea for jetson then if the class have go against my view i could have ignore the class action and have take the consequence just the same oh hang you cry page impulsively barry begged midshipman joyce rest a hand on he friend 's arm do not do any more talk about this just let thing quiet down i be perfectly willing to stop talk about it agree dave in fact since the class adjourn its meeting i have not say a word on the subject except in answer to some other fellow 's remark page and joyce stroll away leave dave by himself to think matter over as it happen the two second classman with whom jetson have be talk have now leave the sulky midshipman who at this moment be come down the walk in dave 's direction good morning jetson nod dave pleasantly though not too cordially midshipman jetson pause a moment look darrin full in the eye and then pass on not promising material to work with at first dave tell himself laughingly there be no time for further thought for it be within two or three minute for the first formation for morning recitation dave run back to he room pick up a book and a write pad how have the fellow be treat you chum ask dalzell look up anxiously to a most liberal dose of advice laugh darrin dan sigh do you wish i would take some of the advice old fellow i do not know that i do dan answer slowly and with unwonted gravity for he i be not one of the padre 's star young man and i do not often discourse on morality yet i be inclined to believe that when a fellow go contrary to the spirit of the crowd and be satisfy that he be do so from generous and manly motive he be pretty likely to be pursue the right course after a fellow have make a real effort to listen to he conscience i do not believe he be ever wrong in follow it thank you danny boy that be always be the way it have strike I i do not want to do any injustice to jetson -- or to the class either if you have to go to coventry announce dalzell give a final brushing to he hair and fitting on he cap i be go with you but you do not have to dan a fellow 's roommate do not have to observe a coventry if it come to coventry muttered dalzell i shall invite it by speak to jetson too dave darrin be aghast he have not contemplate drag dan into such a scrape there be formation now announce dan out in front of the entrance and along the terrace the many section be fall in dan have occasion to pass the now very unpopular jetson good morning jetson be dan 's greet jetson start slightly then reply with a sulky frown : good morning dalzell glad he 'll speak to I think dan with a inward grimace for i be afraid that before long i 'll be in the way of feeling mighty lonely a good deal of the time in another moment or two the section be march away with the steady rhythmic tread peculiar to body of military in motion i wonder how it be all go to come out sigh dan as he seat himself at he desk in the section room in the academic building i wonder what sort of crazy or calculate grandstand play darrin be try to make just now ponder midshipman jetson when inform of dave 's action at the meeting chapter xx do not be a fool darry a week go by without another class meeting for that reason midshipman jetson be still nominally in good fellowship the delay in action be by no means due to lack of class interest the class seethe with interest in the affair but with many of the midshipman there be a belief that here be a case where slow and thoughtful consideration would be best for all concerned darry be too good a fellow and far too popular to be force out of fellowship if it do not have to be do to preserve the present feeling of ruffle class dignity know that the matter have not be drop the first and third class wait -- in curiosity the fourth class really have no standing in such weighty matter of the internal discipline of the brigade every time that dave darrin pass jetson he speak pleasantly to the latter the sulky one however do not respond some day darry you 'll tumble that you have be play for a fool grumble farley then i 'll have the satisfaction will not i of know that it be all my own fault smile dave darrin yes but i hate to see you go to piece for a fellow like jetson the follow Saturday afternoon darrin come in from a brisk walk to find dan poring over he book at the study desk letter there for you say dan without look up as dave after glance into the room have turn with the intention of call on farley and page thank you darrin cross the room pick up the letter from belle he remark the second from she this week and i have not write she answering letter should be part of a man 's honor so instead of cruise about on the deck i reckon i would better sit down and write belle what be you go to tell she asked dan quietly without look up hang it all grumble dave this be where the situation begin to be tough of course you understand how thing be danny boy and you be aware that i have ask belle to take upon herself the right to be equally interested with I in my career it be tough assent dan with ready sympathy and lay aside he book for the moment if my memory serve belle ask particularly when she be here that you let she know how the jetson row turn out yes she do and now you have get to tell she -- what have i get to tell she wonder darrin aloud yes any other course would be unfair but another question be have i a right to tell she just what take place in a class meeting i think so speak up dalzell of course you need not attempt to report the speech or anything like that but it be rather clear to I that you have a right to tell belle the exact news so far as it affect you -- and therefore she thank you dave draw out stationery pick up a pen and begin to write dalzell return to he text-book when dave have write the letter he read to dan the portion that related to a description of the jetson matter before the class i think it be all right to send that much of a statement nod dan then i be go to mail the letter at once and it will go out to-night belle tell I that she be extremely anxious to know the outcome of the matter poor girl i be afraid my letter may be even worse than no news belle do not betroth herself to the uniform or the navy if i know she return dan quietly dave go out and mail the letter it would not reach belle until Monday morning Wednesday afternoon on return from the last recitation dave find she answer on he study table want to hear a part of it dan question midshipman darrin of course i do admit that young man listen then and dave read from belle 's letter as follow : ' i will not attempt to say that i be not in the least worried or bother over the turn the jetson matter have take ' run belle 's letter ' i can not help feeling vitally interested in anything that concern you but you tell I that you have follow you own sense of honor and you own conscience in the matter the best man that ever live could not do better than that i hope -- oh i _ do _ hope -- that the whole affair will turn out in some way that will not be disagreeable to you but remember dave that the lighthead little high school girl who plight she faith to you be interested in you -- not particularly in a future naval officer necessarily if the affair should go to the worst ending and you find it advisable to resign from the naval academy on account of any class feeling there be plenty of bright prospects in life for a honorable and capable man do not ever imagine that i shall be disappoint over anything that you do as long as you remain true to yourself and you manhood and i will add if you care to know it that i approve of what you have do and be proud of you for you grit to do the right thing ' a great girl cry dan admiringly just the kind of girl too that i be sure she be just the same comment dave musingly i know quite well that belle have set she heart on see I serve in the navy with credit she want that because she know you want it dan assure he darrin be in the middle of he week 's study where every minute 's work count but he take the time to write a intense if short answer to belle 's letter that finish and drop in the mail-box he go back to he room and begin to study rap-tap farley slip into the room think i would better come right away darry explain the caller the news will not keep a class meeting be call for Friday night right after supper you know what that mean do not you yes dave answer steadily old fellow we all hope to see you come back to yourself at the meeting go on farley earnestly rest a hand on dave 's blue sleeve meaning that i should desert my conviction and bow to the class yes if you put it that way darry old friend do not feel that you know more than the entire brigade i do not dave answer then you 'll drop the line of talk you start the other night no darry old friend i have not change my mind then if i change my attitude would not i be act a false part do not be a prig darry be a knave instead eh darry you ought to have be bear a puritan i be glad i be not dave smile and be you enjoy yourself no dave answer seriously i be not neither be jetson it be likely that the class may do a great injustice to we both why be you so strike on a fellow like jetson pursue the other midshipman i be not dave rejoin but i think if he could be awaken he have quality that would make we all like he and you be go to throw yourself away on such thankless missionary work darry not at all i be act on my best light as i see they for myself i be sorry sigh farley honestly and so be i do not believe that i enjoy the situation that have be create that you have create for yourself you mean i see that you can not or you will not understand it farley i wish i could understand it quiver farley who feel far more unhappy than he be willing that dave should see in the end farley return to he own room ponder deeply and try to think out some plan of speech or of action that would save midshipman dave darrin from the class anger that seem certain to come after supper and just before study time be due dave go to jetson 's door and knock as he enter he find warner the other midshipman quarter there as well as jetson good evening gentleman begin dave after he have step into the room and close the door good evening darrin respond warner while jetson merely scowl and pick up a book warner go on dave i come here to have a brief talk with mr jetson would it be ask too much to ask you to step outside -- unless mr jetson feel that he would prefer that you remain mr jetson prefer that mr warner remain and that mr darrin take himself away with great expedition break in jetson decisively but warner think differently and with a murmured certainly darrin he leave the room i will not ask you to take a seat mr darrin say jetson because i 'll be candid enough to say that i hope you will not remain long i do not need a seat laugh dave easily for i have hear that the best american transact they business on they foot mr jetson i have come on a somewhat embarrassing mission yes -- sneeringly you know quite well the snarl that be to be untied before the class meeting Friday evening quite well reply jetson sulkily it be a situation that i owe to the fact of have be acquaint with yourself mr darrin jetson resume dave drop the formal mr the situation be one that menace you and you standing here it menace I equally i could get myself out of the scrape quite easily by withdraw from the stand that i take the other night i either fail or refuse to understand why you go to the risk that you do the other night mr darrin if i be to retract what i say darrin add it would cause I to violate whatever respect i may have for right and justice on the other hand jetson surely you do not consider yourself right in refuse a apology for a remark in which you thoughtlessly cast a unjust reflection upon the whole body of midshipman to what be this lead mr darrin jetson you own sense of honor and justice surely tell you that you owe it to yourself to go before the meeting Friday evening -- i shall not attend mr darrin the class may take whatever action it choose in my absence jetson you owe it to yourself as well as to the class to offer you apology for a remark that reflect upon the whole brigade you can violate no feeling of honor or proper pride by such a apology in fact i do not see how you can justify yourself in withhold such apology for have express a sentiment which you know you do not mean in the way that the brigade have take it my feeling on question of honor can not possibly concern you mr darrin on the contrary you conduct do vitally concern I jetson if you do not make you apology the class will -- well you know what will happen yes i know jetson assent he brow darken and possibly you know what it mean to I by my own statement -- and i can not in honor retract it i shall be compel to share coventry with you no you will not sir retorted jetson rise he face ablaze with sulky anger you may go to coventry mr darrin and welcome but you shall not share mine with I you shall not share anything whatever with I -- not even the air of this room if i can prevail upon you to take yourself out of a room where you be not wanted mr darrin i indulge myself in the honor of wish you -- good evening jetson cross the room throw open the door and bow low flushing breathing quickly dave darrin step out into the corridor and the door close smartly behind he chapter xxi midshipman jetson have the floor it be Friday afternoon and the last section have be dismiss in front of bancroft hall the balance of the afternoon belong to the midshipman though most of they find it necessary to give the time to study jetson be not one of the latter always well up in he study he have no occasion to worry about daily marking or semi-annual examination he have not grow less sulky but he find himself a victim of unusual restlessness so he decide upon remain out in the open air for the present though actuate by a very different class of feeling darrin also feel disincline for book he try to study for a few minute but give it up and catch up he cap the winter day be mild he do not trouble himself to don he uniform overcoat go to slip you cable inquire dan who be moor fast to a text-book yes i feel the need of fresh air shove off then dave go out quietly dan gaze curiously after he friend until the door have close behind he poor chap mutter dan i reckon he have need enough of something to stop that restless feeling the class meet to-night jetson after some fifteen minute of aimless wander feel himself attract to the gymnasium go inside he go to he locker where with feverish energy he change to gym costume for a few minute the sulky one perform on the fly ring he be a adept at this work and something in the rapid motion soothe he troubled mind tiring of the ring at last jetson stand with fold arm look about he until he eye light with interest on the trapeze one be up higher than the rest draw toward this one jetson take hold of the climb rope and draw himself up hand over hand seat himself on the bar he sit look about at the few other midshipman who be exercise at that hour there come that darrin fellow think jetson with a sudden burst of rage wonder if he be go to work this afternoon if he do i 'll put it all over he even if i break my neck in the try back and forth swing jetson get up speed on the trapeze then suddenly he throw he head downward hang on by he knee a intentional slip and he hang fully downward he ankle hold at the end of the crossbar folding he arm jetson again begin to swing as he hang head downward among the midshipman there be not so very many who be skillful at this form of exercise jetson be and he be secretly proud of it this will put the fellow darrin to the bad if he come in with any notion of show off think the sulky one exultantly now the other midshipman turn to leave the gym in a moment more the only two leave be darrin and the man on the trapeze in addition to the midshipman there be two gym attendant at some little distance who be do that fine work wonder dave step closer why it be jetson well he have one accomplishment that i really envy he midshipman jetson be now go through some rapid evolution first hang head downward and then after develop speed raise himself and turn over the crossbar it be really work of which any athlete might have be proud say jim mutter one attendant to the other that middie have I nervous for fair forget it advise the other attendant it be the middie 's neck not yours but we take the net down that go with that bar suppose the young man should fall he would break he neck and what could we say with the net go he be no business up there at this late hour in the afternoon grumble the other man that talk will not save we either if anything happen jetson fill with the desire to show off before the comrade he hate have increase the speed of he brilliant fly movement but suddenly he slip there be no regain he grip with a howl of fright he feel himself plunge head downward more than thirty foot to the hard floor of the gym he be in a fair way of landing on he head crack he skull and break he neck worse in he sudden dread he seem to have lose control of he muscle turn land on you foot call dave it all happen in a second dave brief as the instant be realize that the other midshipman be not go to land on he foot in the same fleeting moment that darrin call he hurl himself into position straight down shoot jetson dave wait with outstretch arm ready to risk he own neck in the effort to save he sulky comrade from they end of the gym the two startled attendant have watch the impending disaster but there be no time for they to do anything from the way that jetson fall it look as though he have make a straight dive for dave darrin 's head at all event they head meet in sharp collision down go dave as though shot and jetson

that i be a constitutional ass with perhaps some slight chance of be reborn to make it short darrin persuade I to come before the class eat humble pie and set myself right with myself even if i could not with the class it be beautifully do jet murmured page who be tremendously grateful at see dave darrin rescue from sacrifice himself to a principle if any of you fellow catch I in the sulk

man without give that man a chance to get up on he foot it be a good deal like darrin remark jetson he eye a trifle misty though it take I a thunder long time to realize that darrin be really of that kind how do it happen any way insist farley you have hear nothing about it not a word -- not a hint protest page eagerly there be less than twenty of the midshipman now remain in the room so jetson do not feel as embarrassed as he might have do have he be call upon to give the recital before a class meeting he tell he listener the story of dave 's splendid conduct in the gym that afternoon and of the talk that have follow the reconciliation of the enemy that be like good old darry again remark farley proudly no fellow have a warmer temper than darry when he be arouse to righteous anger but no

one thing this business have do remark midshipman farley look up from he book i 'll be the goat murmur page darry have always be somewhat the leader of the class ever since the fellow begin to find he out back in the first year here but this last business have boost dave darrin unmistakably and solidly now into the post of leader of the class we be safe then retort page darry will not lead we into any trouble the realization that midshipman dave darrin be assure leader of the second class be not long in come to most of the other man of the class yet dave do not seek the post nor do he attempt to do any actual lead he still consider himself as possess one voice and one only in the class council if dave be leader dan dalzell both by reflect glory and by virtue of he own sterling merit as well share the leadership with dave to a great extent dan 's power might have go further than it do have it not be for the fact that he be so full of mischief as to leave he comrade often in doubt as to whether he be really serious in what he say and do chapter xxiii bag and no mistake plebe flint and austin be have a good many caller remark dave darrin halt by the door of quarter before he and dan enter sure be not you wise inquire dan with a wink i think so murmured dave the caller all seem to be third classman of course they be put the rookie through they pace surest thing murmur dalzell without excitement but this be march be not it a rather late time in the year to be still hound the poor new man i do not know mused dalzell it may be that mr flint and mr austin be unusually touge touge be annapolis slang for fresh it correspond closely to the b j of west point a sound as of protest come from behind a closed door at the further end of the deck i hope we youngster be not go too far dave remark youngster be the accept term for the third classman and the same as yearling at west point well it be none of we business reply dan with a shrug of he shoulder study call will be along in fifteen minute go to get a early start with the book to-night i guess that will be wise darrin nod it surely will the rest of the winter have go along rather uneventfully save for the inevitable overpowering amount of grind through which a midshipman must pass it be now spring and midshipmen thought be divide between two topic -- annual exam and summer cruise dan have start into the room and dave be about to follow when he hear a unusually loud thud at the further end of the deck danny boy the plebe must be get it hard to-night i would like to see the fun mutter dalzell he eye snap with mischief but it do not seem to be any of we business hazing work be leave in charge of the youngster crowd yes a second classman should not interfere assented dave well study for ours i be afraid i be not as studious as i be a minute ago contend dan with a grin dave look almost startle as he seize he chum by the arm inside with you danny boy not under compulsion laugh midshipman dalzell i 'll condescend to coax then but do not anger the youngster by but in and why not a upper classman have a right to step in if he wish it be at least against the rule of good taste to interfere argue darrin well hang you i do not want to interfere all i want to do be to look on can not a upper classman do that i will not return dave yet almost immediately he change he mind for two hard bump and a gust of laughter sweep up the deck they be make so much racket murmur dave linger by he own door that the first thing we know a duty officer will swoop down and rag the bunch let 's go in then as grave and dignified second classman and warn the youngster like daddy propose dan but he eye be twinkle with the spirit of mischief a good deal against he own inclination darrin allow himself to be coax into the thing nine youngster be find in midshipmen flint and austin 's room when dave and dan enter after rap we be not intrude i hope inquire dalzell with he most invite grin not at all gentleman respond midshipman eaton of the third class these fourth classman seem unwontedly popular to-night insinuate dan they have be most uncommonly touge all through the year sir reply eaton tack on the sir in order to impress midshipman flint and austin with the tremendous dignity or all upper classman what form do they tougeness take dan want to know they have not yet learn the respect that be due to upper classman sir and especially to third classman inquire dan now without the flicker of a smile they be especially touge sir with third classman and you be show they the error of they way we be try to do so sir i think so from the noise we hear pursued dalzell if you have any better way mr dalzell we shall be glad to profit from you riper experience sir suggest midshipman eaton no i have forget almost everything that i ever know in that line remark dan mr darrin sir suggest eaton turn to the other second classman present i have nothing to suggest reply dave slowly unless -- then he pause unless -- sir follow up midshipman eaton no i will not say it it might give offense darrin respond have no fear of that mr darrin urge eaton all i be go to suggest eaton be that this be the month of march yes sir inquire eaton wonderingly when dalzell and i be fourth classman we be not trouble at all by the youngster after christmas last year eaton we class do not bother yours at any later date either some of the youngster present begin to look embarrassed though dave 's tone have be quiet and free from rebuke but sir do not imagine that we be do anything to the plebe for we own amusement protest eaton this be the only pair of the fourth class leave that need any attention from we class these two young mister be the tougest lot we have have to deal with in fact sir they be ratey still rejoin dan dalzell i think you be keep it up pretty late in the year even if they be ratey a midshipman who be ratey as have be explain in a earlier volume be a much greater offender than a midshipman who be merely touge for a ratey fourth classman make the foolish blunder of consider himself as good as a upper classman of course suggest dan make haste to smooth over any astonishment that he own and he chum 's remark might have cause we do not propose to instruct the member of the third class in the way they shall perform they duty toward the member of the fourth do not let we interfere with you mr eaton by no means murmur dave darrin smile we do not wish to intrude but wait just one moment gentleman beg eaton we want you to see for yourselve how effectively we be smooth the touge crease out of these baby midshipman during the discussion flint and austin have be stand at one side of the room look decidedly sheepish both have they blouse off though neither have be require to take off he collar the trousers of the two fourth classman be rather liberally overlay with dust show that they must have be perform some rough stunt on the floor step over to that basin mister order youngster eaton eye flint who promptly obey now mister stand on you head in that bowl command midshipman eaton look doubly red and uncomfortable with these two grave-looking second classman present flint bent down attempt to stand on he head in the bowl of water while he try at the same time to push he foot up the wall thus stand on he head twice flint essay the feat and fail splash a good deal of water over the floor then for the third time flint try the performance this time he succeed but he two previous failure have provoke such a storm of laughter that no man present hear a cautious rap on the door the next instant that door be fling open and lieutenant preston step into the room with the entrance of that discipline officer half of the midshipman present wheel about then startle as they be do not forget to come to attention hm say lieutenant preston at which the other half hear and come to attention flint whether too scared or perhaps enjoy the discomfiture of he tormentor make no effort to return to normal position what be you name sir thunder the discipline officer glare fiercely at midshipman flint flint sir reply the fourth classman in a gasp bring you foot down and come to attention sir flint obey during this time lieutenant preston have stand so that no midshipman in the room could slip by he into the corridor i will now take the name of the gentleman present go on the discipline officer draw a notebook and pencil from a inner pocket and commence to write all except the fourth classman present will at once fall in by two outside command lieutenant preston close the notebook and slip it away midshipmen flint and austin will mend they appearance as speedily as possible and then form the last file outside wow whisper dan in he chum 's ear outside talk about the fifty-seven variety we be in all the pickle yes murmur dave what be you go to do about it davy take my medicine dave reply but we be not really in the thing danny boy never get out of a thing or try to by play cry baby no danger retort dalzell david little giant we 'll just console ourselves with the realization that we be in the worst scrape we ever strike yet yes nod dave fourth classman flint and austin be not long in make themselves presentable then they fall in at the rear of the line squad forward march command the discipline officer dryly through the corridor and off that deck the little squad of thirteen midshipman march never have thirteen be more unlucky for the present superintendent be know to be a man determine to stamp out hazing nor do the affair remain a secret for more than a moment midshipman return to they own deck step to the wall to let the squad pass nor be more than a look at the two rear fourth classman need to enable any wonder midshipman to guess the nature of the offense with which the remain eleven upper classman be to be charge we darry in that gasp farley as the squad go by do you see he yes page mournfully admit then my eye do not play I any trick as i have hope darry and dalzell what evil spirit tempt they to be in that scrape in the meantime lieutenant preston be arraign the capture delinquent before the officer in charge and the commandant of midshipman have already be telephone for and be on the way study call cut short a good deal of excited discussion on the different deck the commandant of midshipman arrive hear the evidence of the discipline officer look over the offender enter they name on he own record and then speak briefly but in the voice of fate itself : the accuse midshipman will go to they room they will until further order remain in they quarter except for recitation and meal formation they will forego all privilege until the superintendent or higher authority have act finally in this matter that be all young gentleman go to you room except midshipmen flint and austin who will remain as soon as the upper classman have depart the commandant take flint and austin in hand question they keenly and make note of the more important answer back in they own room midshipman dan dalzell be at first overwhelm with horror we be dish davy we walk the plank the super will not forgive a single man who be

ever do before you know all about that old-time navy man who say ` do not give up the ship ' they study or manfully pretend to until release sound how much they learn from they book that night may have be a different matter chapter xxiv conclusion by the next day it be generally concede among the midshipman that the rank of the brigade be about to be thin as a result of the last hazing episode nor do the third class generally uphold eaton and he youngster associate in the affair of the night before they be out for trouble and they get it declare one third classman the rest of we let up on

however still maintain that he be not go to play baby in dismay some forty member of the second class hold a unofficial outdoor meeting at which way and means be suggest in the end joyce farley and page be appoint a committee of three to think the matter over solemnly and then to go to the commandant of midshipman with whatever statement they feel justified in make at the earliest possible moment the three wait outside the door of the commandant 's office after have send in they card and a message as to why they desire to see the commandant well gentleman begin the commandant briskly i understand that you want to see I in reference to the last hazing outrage what have you to say we come in behalf of two member of we own class sir speak up farley hm what do you expect to be able to say for midshipman darrin and dalzell they do not attempt to deny the fact that they be present at the hazing and that they be at least look on when lieutenant preston enter the room may i inquire sir reply farley very respectfully whether either mr darrin or mr dalzell have state that mr darrin have just enter a protest against the hazing and that they have make the protest just before lieutenant preston go into the room no such a statement have not be make by either mr darrin or mr dalzell admit the commandant be you sure that mr darrin do protest i can only say sir reply farley that i have be so informed i also know from mr darrin 's own lip that he have refuse to inform you that he make such a protest why shoot out the commandant eye mr farley keenly because sir mr darrin feel that he would be do the baby act to enter such a defense and so have commission you to appear for he no sir return farley almost hotly in fact sir i believe mr darrin would be very angry if he know what i be do and say at this moment this committee sir be appoint by some forty member of the second class sir who be familiar with the fact we have be send to you sir by we classmate who be frantic at the thought of lose the finest fellow in the class i thank you gentleman say the commandant in a tone which signify the polite dismissal of the committee i will keep in mind what you have tell I the investigation be be carry on daily all of the third class offender be put on carpet more than once at the next session with the youngster the commandant question they as to the truth of the statement that darrin have try to protest against the hazing why yes sir eaton admit mr darrin do say something against what we be do as a upper classman do mr darrin order you to stop no sir eaton admit he do not command we to stop what do mr darrin say i can not state with accuracy now sir just what mr darrin do say to we do he disapprove of you act yes sir i be very certain that he make every third classman present feel uncomfortable then whatever mr darrin 's word be they have the effect if not the exact form of a rebuke against you conduct press the commandant yes sir reply midshipman eaton with great positiveness eaton 's companion in the haze all bear he out in the statement the commandant of midshipman then take up the matter of they testimony with the superintendent of the naval

manliness and attention to duty in enter a protest against the hazing i thank you very much sir dave darrin answer however much as i long to remain in the navy i do not want to hide behind a misunderstanding while i speak against the hazing candor compel I to admit that i do not protest so vigorously but that more hazing go on immediately that i can quite understand nod the superintendent i be aware of the disinclination of the member of one upper class to interfere with the member of another upper class the fact that you make a protest at all be what have convince I that yourself and mr dalzell be in the room at the time with a worthy instead of a unworthy motive worthy motive be not punish at the naval academy mr darrin for that reason yourself and mr dalzell be restore to full duty and privilege that be all gentleman thus dismiss dave and dan could not without impertinence remain longer in the room there be wild joy in the second class when it be find that the class leader darrin and dalzell have escape from the worst scrape they have be in at annapoli eaton hough and paulson of the third class prove to have be the ringleader in the hazing they be summarily dismiss from
