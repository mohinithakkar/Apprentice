master hardy generosity be seldom a attribute of youth while egotism on the other hand be seldom absent so far from realize that the captain would have scorn such lowly game master hardy believe that he live for little else and he jack-in-the-box ubiquity be a constant marvel and discomfort to that irritable mariner do he approach a seat on the beach it be master hardy who rise -lrb- at the last moment -rrb- to make room for he do he stroll down to the harbor it be in the wake of a small boy look coyly at he over he shoulder every small alley as he pass seem to contain a jem hardy who whiz

all the seat at the parish church be free but captain nugent whose admirable practice it be to take he entire family to church never thoroughly realize how free they be until master hardy squeeze he way in and take a seat next to he pray with unwonted fervor into the interior of a new hat and then sit back watch with polite composure the effort of miss nugent 's family to re-strain she grow excitement charm with the experiment he repeat it the follow Sunday this time he board the seat from the other end and see no place by the captain take one or more correctly speak make one between miss nugent and jack and despite the former 's elbow begin to feel almost like one of the family hostile feeling vanish and with a amiable smile at the half-frantic miss nugent he place a bull 's -

and for the first time in she life doubt as to she father 's capacity stir within she she attempt the poor consolation of a acid tablet and it be at once impound by the watchful mr kingdom mean-time the reek of bull 's - eye be insufferable the service seem interminable and all that time the indignant damsel wedge in between she aunt and the openly exultant enemy of she house be compel to endure in silence she do indeed attempt one remark and master hardy with a horrified expression of outraged piety say h ` sh and shake he head at she it be almost more than flesh and blood could bear and when the unobservant mr kingdom ask she for the text on the way home she reply nearly cost she the loss of she dinner the _ conqueror _ under its new commander sail on the day follow mr wilk watch it from the quay and the new steward observe he come to the side and hold aloft a old pantry-cloth between he finger and thumb until he have attract he attention drop it overboard with every circumstance of exaggerated horror by the time a suitable retort have occur to the ex-steward the steamer be half a mile distant and the extraordinary and unnatural pantomime in which he indulge on the edge of the quay be grievously misinterpret by a nervous man in a sailing boat -lrb- illustration : mr wilk watch it from the quay -rrb- master hardy have also see the ship out and perch on the extreme end of the breakwater he remain watch until she be hull down on the horizon then he make he way back to the town and the nearest confectioner and start for home just as miss nugent who be about to pay a call with she aunt wait beautifully dress in the front garden while that lady complete she preparation feel very spic and span and still a trifle uncomfortable from the vigorous attention of ann who cleanse she as though she have be a doorstep she pace slowly up and down the path upon these occasion of high dress a spirit of sabbath calm be wont to descend upon she and save she from escapade to which in a less severe garb she be somewhat prone she stop at the gate and look up the road then she face flush and she cast she eye behind she to make sure that the hall-door stand open the hate scion of the house of hardy be come down the road and in view of that fact she forget all else -- even she manners the boy still fresh from the loss of he natural protector keep a wary eye on the house as he approach then all expression die out of he face and he pass the gate blankly ignore the small girl who be lean over it and apparently suffer from elephantiasis of the tongue he go by quietly and miss nugent rage inwardly that she have misbehave to no purpose withdraw she tongue for more legitimate use boo she cry who have he hair pull master hardy pursue the even tenor of he way who be afraid to answer I for fear my father will thrash he cry the disappointed lady raise she voice this be too much the enemy retrace he step and come up to the gate you be a rude little girl he say with a insufferably grown-up air who have he hair pull demand miss nugent caper wildly who have he hair pull do not be silly say master hardy here he put he hand in he pocket and produce some nut offer they over the gate at this miss nugent cease she capering and wrath possess she that the enemy should thus misunderstand the gravity of the situation well give 'em to jack then pursue the boy he will not say no this be a distinct reflection on jack 's loyalty and she indignation be not lessen by the fact that she know it be true go away from we gate she storm if my father catch you you 'll suffer pooh say the dare-devil he look up at the house and then open the gate stride boldly into the front garden before this intrusion miss nugent retreat in alarm and gain the door-step gaze at he in dismay then she face clear suddenly and master hardy look over he shoulder see that he retreat be cut off by mr wilk do not let he hurt I sam entreated miss nugent piteously mr wilk come into the garden and close the gate behind he i be not go to hurt she cried master hardy anxiously as if i should hurt a girl wot be you do in we front garden then demand mr wilk he spring forward suddenly and catch the boy by the collar with one huge hand drag he struggle violently down the side-entrance into the back garden miss nugent follow close behind seek to improve the occasion see what you get by

satisfied at last the ex-steward raise he weapon and for some seconds ply it briskly miss nugent tremble but sternly repress sympathy for the sufferer be pleased that the long arm of justice have at last over-taken he let he go now sam she say he be cry i be not yell master hardy frantically i can see the tear declare miss nugent bend mr wilk ply the rod again until he victim with a sudden turn fetch he a violent kick on the shin and break loose the ex-steward set off in pursuit somewhat handicapped by the fact that he dare not go over flower-bed whilst master hardy be singularly free from such prejudice miss nugent run to the side-entrance to cut off he retreat she be willing for he to be release but not to escape and so it fall out that the boy dodge beneath mr wilk 's outspread arm charge blindly up the side-entrance and bowl the young lady over there be a shrill squeal a flutter of white and a neat pair of button boot wave in the air then miss nugent sob piteously rise from the puddle into which she have fall and survey she garment mr wilk survey they too and a very cursory glance be sufficient to show he that the case be beyond he power he take the outraged damsel by the hand and lead she howling lustily in to the horrify ann my word say she gasp look at you glove look at you frock but miss nugent be look at she knee there be only a slight redness about the left but from the right a piece of skin be indubitably miss this knee she give ann instruction to foment with fair water of a comfortable temperature indulge in satisfied prognostication as to the fate of

time he audience receive the explanation in chilly silence and he say it be a accident he knock you down he conclude he say he hope you be not hurt and he give I some toffee for you what do you do with it demand miss nugent i know you would not have it reply she brother inconsequently and there be not much of it he sister regard he sharply you do not mean to say you eat it she scream why not
