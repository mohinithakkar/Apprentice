robert cobb -lrb- cobb 's kentucky battery c s a -rrb- note what be enclose between these cover be write as a series of first-hand impression during the fall and early winter of 1914 while the writer be on staff service for the Saturday evening post in the western theater of the european war i try to write of war as i see it at the time that i see it or immediately afterward when the memory of what i have see be fresh and vivid in my mind in this volume as here present no attempt have be make to follow either logically or chronologically the progress of event in the campaigning operation of which i be a witness the chapter be interrelate insofar as they purport to be a sequence of picture describe some of my experience and set forth a few of my observation in belgium in germany in france and in england during the first three month of hostility at the outset i have no intention of undertake to write a book on the war if in the kindly judgment of the reader what i have write constitute

in the afternoon -- this little belgian town call montigny st christophe -- just twenty-four hour behind a dust - color german column i be go to try now to tell how it look to we i be incline to think i pass this way a year before or a little less though i can not be quite certain as to that travel ` cross country the country be likely to look different from the way it look when you view it from the window of a railroad carriage of this much though i be sure : if i do not pass through this little town of montigny st christophe then at least i pass through fifty like it -- each a single line of gray house string like bead on a cord along a white straight road with field behind and elm in front each with its small ugly church its wine shop its drinking trough its priest in black and its one lone gendarme in he preposterous housing of saber and belt and shoulder strap i rather imagine i try to think up something funny to say about the shabby grandeur of the gendarme or the acid flavor of the cooking vinegar sell at the drinking place under the name of wine for that time i be suppose to be write humorous article on european travel but now something have happen to montigny st christophe to lift it out of the dun dull sameness that make it as one with so many other unimportant village in this upper left-hand corner of the map of europe the war have come this way and come so have deal it a side-slap we come to it just before dusk all day we have be hurry along try to catch up with the german rear guard but the german move faster than we do even though they fight as they go they have go round the southern part of belgium like cooper round a cask hoop it in with tight band of steel belgium -- or this part of it -- be all barrel up now : chine stave and bung and the german be already across the line beat down the sod of france with they pelting foot besides we have stop often for there be so much to see and to hear there be the hour we spend at merbes-le-chateau where the english have be and the hour we spend at la buissière on the river sambre where a fight have be fight two day earlier but merbes-le-chateau be another story and so be la buissière just after la buissière we come to a tiny village name neuville and halted while the local jack-of-all - trade mend for we a invalide tire on a bicycle as we group in the narrow street before he shop with a hive swarm of curious villager buzz about we a improvise ambulance with a red cross paint on its side over the letter of a baker 's sign go up the steep hill at the head of the cobble street at that the woman in the doorway of the small cottage twist they gnarled red hand in they apron and whisper fearsomely among themselves so that the sibilant sound of they voice run up and down the line of house in a long quaver hiss the wagon it seem be bring in a wounded french soldier who have be find in the wood beyond the river he be one of the last to be find alive which be another way of say that for two day and two night he have be lie helpless in the thicket he stomach empty and he wound raw on each of those two night it have rain and rain hard just as we start on we way the big gun begin boom somewhere ahead of we toward the southwest so we turn in that direction we have hear the gun distinctly in the early forenoon and again less distinctly about noontime thereafter for a while there have be a lull in the firing but now it be constant -- a steady sustained boom - boom-boom so far away that it fall on the eardrum as a gentle concussion as a throb of air rather than as a real sound for three day now we have be follow that distant voice of the cannon try to catch up with it as it advance always southward toward the french frontier therefore we flog the belly of we tired horse with the lash of a long whip and hurry along there be five of we all american the two who ride on bicycle pedal ahead as outrider and the remain three follow on behind with the horse and the dogcart we have buy the outfit that morning and we be to lose it that night the horse be a aged mare with high withers and gall on she shoulder and fetlock unshorn after the fashion of belgian horse and the dogcart be a venerable ruin which creak a great protest at every turn of the warped wheel on the axle we have be able to buy the two -- the mare and the cart -- only because the german soldier have not think they worth the take in this order then we proceed pretty soon the mare grow so weary she could hardly lift she shaggy old leg so footsore as we be we who ride dismount and trudge on take turn at drag she forward by the bit i presume we go ahead thus for a hour or more along a interminable straight road and past mile of the checkered light and dark green field which in harvest time make a great backgammon board of this whole country of belgium the road be empty of native -- empty too of german wagon train and these seem to we curious thing because there have until then be hardly a minute of the day when we be not pass soldier or meeting refugee almost without warn we come on this little village call montigny st christophe a six-armed signboard at a crossroads tell we its name -- a rather impressive name ordinarily for a place of perhaps twenty house all tell but now tragedy have give it distinction have paint that straggle frontier hamlet over with such color that the picture of it be go to live in my memory as long as i do live at the upper end of the single street like a outpost stand a old chateau the seat no doubt of the local gentry with a small park of beech and elm round it and here right at the park entrance we have we first intimation that there have be a fight the gate stand ajar between its chip stone pillar and just inside the blue coat of a french cavalry officer jaunty and new and much braid with gold lace on the collar and cuff hang from the limb of a small tree beneath the tree be a sheaf of straw in the shape of a bed and the ash of a dead camp fire and on the grass plain to the eye a plump well-picked pullet all ready for the pot or the pan look on past these thing we see much scatter dunnage : frenchman 's knapsack flannel shirt play card fagot of firewood mix together like jackstraw canteen cover with slate-blue cloth and have queer little hornlike protuberance on they top -- which prove they to be french canteen -- tumble straw odd shoe with they lacing undo a toptilted service shelter of canvas all the riffle of a camp that have be suddenly and violently disturb as i think back it seem to I that not until that moment have it occur to we to regard closely the cottage and shop beyond the clumped tree of the chateau grounds we be desperately weary to begin with and we eye those past three day have grow use to the sign of misery and waste and ruin abundant and multiply in the wake of the hard-pounding hoof of the conqueror now all of a sudden i become aware that this town have be literally shoot to bit from we side -- that be to say from the north and likewise from the west -- the german have shell it from the south plainly the french have answer the village in between have catch the full force and fury of the contend fire probably the inhabitant have warn probably they flee when the german skirmisher surprise that outpost of frenchman camp in the park one imagine they scurry like rabbit across the field and through the cabbage patch but they have leave they belongings behind all they small petty gearing and garnishing to be wreck in the wrenching and rack apart of they home a railroad track emerge from the field and run along the one street shell have fall on it and explode rip the steel rail from the cross-tie so that they stand up all along in a jagged formation like row of snaggled tooth other shell drop in the road have so work with the stone block that they be pile here in heap and there be depress into cavern and crevasse four or five or six foot deep every house in sight have be hit again and again and again one house would have its whole front blow in so that we could look right back to the rear wall and see the pan on the kitchen shelf another house would lack a roof to it and the tidy tile that have make the roof be now red and yellow rubbish pile like broken shard outside a potter 's door the door stand open and the window with the windowpane all go and in some instance the sash as well leer emptily like eye-socket without eye so it go two of the house have catch fire and the interior be quite burn away a sodden smell of burn thing come from the still smoking ruin but the wall be of thick stone stand we poor tired old nag halted and sniff and snort if she have have energy enough i reckon she would have shy about and run back the way she have come for now just ahead lay two dead horse -- a big gray and a roan -- with they stark leg stick out across the road the gray be shoot through and through in three place the right fore hoof of the roan have be cut smack off as smoothly as though do with a ax and the stiffened leg have a curiously unfinished look about it suggest a natural malformation dead only a few hour they carcass already have begin to swell the skin on they belly be as tight as a drumhead we force the quiver mare past the two dead horse beyond they the road be a litter knapsack coat canteen handkerchief pot pan household utensil bottle jug and cap be everywhere the deep ditch on either side of the road be clog with such thing the drop cap and the abandon knapsack be always french cap and french knapsack cast aside no doubt for a quick flight after the melee the german have charge after shell the town and then the french have fall back -- or at least so we deduce from the look of thing in the debris be no object that bespeak german workmanship or german ownership this rather puzzle we until we learn that the german as tidy in this game of war as in the game of life make it a hard-and-fast rule to gather up they own belongings after every engagement great or small leave behind nothing that might serve to give the enemy a idea of they loss we go by the church its spire be go but strange to say a small flag -- the tricolor of france -- still flutter from a window where some one have stick it we go by the taverne or wine shop which have a sign over its door -- a creature remotely resemble a blue lynx and through the door we see half a loaf of bread and several bottle on a table we go by a rather pretentious house with pear tree in front of it and a big barn alongside it and right under the eaves of the barn i pick up the short jacket of a french trooper so new and fresh from the workshop that the white cambric lining be hardly soil the figure 18 be on the collar we decide that its wearer must have belong to the eighteenth cavalry regiment behind the barn we find a whole pile of new knapsack -- the flimsy play-soldier knapsack of the french infantryman not half so heavy or a third so substantial as the heavy sack of the german which be all bind with strap and cover on the back side with undressed red bullock 's hide until now we have see in all the silent ruin village no human be the place fairly ache with emptiness cat sit on the doorstep or in the window and presently from a barn we hear imprison beast low dismally cow be there with agonize udder and pen away from they famish calf but there be no dog we already have remark this fact -- that in every desolate village cat be thick enough but invariably the sharp-nosed wolfish - look belgian dog have disappear along with they master and it be so in montigny st christophe on a roadside barricade of stone chink with sod of turf -- a breastwork the french probably have erect before the fight and which the german have kick half down -- i count three cat seat side by side wash they face sedately and soberly it be just after we have go by the barricade that in a shed behind the riddled shell of a house which be almost the last house of the town one of we party see a old a very old woman who peer out at we through a break in the wall he call out to she in french but she never answer -- only continue to watch he from behind she shelter he start toward she and she disappear noiselessly without have speak a word she be the only live person we see in that town just beyond the town though we meet a wagon -- a furniture dealer 's wagon -- from some larger community which have be impress by the belgian authority military or civil for ambulance service a jaded team of horse draw it and white flag with red cross in they center droop over the wheel fore and aft one man lead the near horse by the bit and two other man walk behind the wagon all three of they have red cross brassard on the sleeve of they coat the wagon have a hood on it but be open at both end overhaul it we see that it contain two dead soldier -- french foot-soldier the body rest side by side on the wagon bed they foot somehow be catch up on the wagon seat so that they stiff leg in the baggy red pants slant upward and the two dead man have the look of be about to glide backward and out of the wagon the blue-clad arm of one of they be twist upward in a half-arc encircle nothing and as the wheel jolt over the rutted cobble these two bent arm joggle and sway drunkenly the other 's head be cant back so that as we pass we look right into he face it be a young face -- we could tell that much even through the mask of cake mud on the drab-white skin -- and it might once have be a comely face it be not comely now peer into the wagon we see that the dead man 's face have be partly shoot or shear away -- the lower jaw be go so that it have become a abominable thing to look on these two have be man the day before now they be carrion and would be treat as such for as we look back we see the wagon turn off the high road into a field where the wild red poppy like blob of red blood grow thick between row of neglect sugar beet we stop and watch the wagon bump through the beet patch to where at the edge of a thicket a trench have be dig the digger be two peasant in blouse who stand alongside the ridge of raw upturned earth at the edge of the hole in the attitude of figure in a painting by millet they spade be spear upright into the mound of fresh earth behind they a stenciling of poplar rise against the sky line we see the body lift out of the wagon we see they slide into the shallow grave and see the two digger start at they task of fill in the hole not until then do it occur to any one of we that we have not speak to the man in charge of the wagon or they to we there be one detach house not badly battered alongside the road at the lower edge of the field where the burial take place it have a shield on its front wall bear the belgian arm and word to denote that it be a custom house a glance at we map show we that at this point the french boundary come up in a v-shaped point almost to the road have the gravedigger pick a spot fifty yard farther on for digging they trench those two dead frenchman would have rest in the soil of they own country the sun be almost down by now and its slanting ray slide lengthwise through the elm-tree aisle along we route just as it disappear we meet a string of refugee -- man woman and child -- all afoot all bear pitiably small bundle they limp along silently in a straggle procession none of they be weep none of they apparently have be weep during the past ten day i have see thousand of such refugee and i have yet to hear one of they cry out or complain or protest these who pass we now be like that they heavy peasant face express dumb bewilderment -- nothing else they go on up the road into the gathering dusk as we go down and almost at once the sound of they clunking tread die out behind we without know certainly we nevertheless imagine they be the dweller of montigny st christophe go back to the sorry shell that have be they home a hour later we pass through the back line of the german camp and enter the town of beaumont to find that the general staff of a german army corps be quarter there for the night and that the main force of the column after sharp fighting have already advance well beyond the frontier france be invade chapter 2 to war in a taxicab in a taxicab we go to look for this war there be four of we not count the chauffeur who do not count it be a regular taxicab with a meter on it and a little red metal flag which might be turn up or turn down depend on whether the cab be engage or at liberty and he be a regular chauffeur we the passenger wear straw hat and light suit and carry no baggage no one would ever have take we for war correspondent out look for war so we go and just when we be least expect it we find that war perhaps it would be more exact to say it find we we be four day get back to brussels still wear we straw hat but without any taxicab the fate of that taxicab be go to be one of the unsolved mystery of the german invasion of belgium from the hour when the steamer st paul leave new york carry probably the most mixed assortment of passenger that travel on a single ship since noah sail the ark we on board expect hourly to sight something that would make we spectator of actual hostility the papers that morning be full of rumor of a engagement between english ship and german ship somewhere off the new england coast daily we search the empty sea until we eye hurt we but except that we have one ship 's concert and one brisk gale and that just before dusk on the fifth day out the weather be then gray and misty we see wallow along hull down on the starboard bow a english cruiser with two funnel nothing happen at all even when we land at liverpool nothing happen to suggest that we have reach a country actively engage in war unless you would list the presence of a few khaki-clad soldier on the landing stage and the painful absence of porter to handle we baggage as evidence of the same i remember see she grace the duchess of marlborough sit hour after hour on a baggage truck wait for she heavy luggage to come off the tardy tender and up the languid chute into the big dusty dockhouse i remember also see woman with they hat flop down in they face and they hair all streaming drag huge trunk across the floor and if all of we have not be in the same distressful fix we could have appreciate the humor of the spectacle of a portly high dignitary of the united state medical corps shove a truck pile high with he belongings and shortly afterward with the help of he own wife load they on the roof of a infirm and wheezy taxicab from liverpool across to london we travel through a drowsy land burden with bumper crop of grain and watch the big brown hare skip among the oat stack and late at night we come to london in london next day there be more troops about than common and recruit be drill on the gravel walk back of somerset house and the people generally move with a certain sober restraint as people do who feel the weight of a heavy and a urgent responsibility otherwise the london of wartime seem the london of peacetime so within a day we small party still seek to slip into the wing of the actual theater of event rather than to stay so far back behind the scene be aboard a channel ferryboat bind for ostend and have for fellow traveler a few englishman a tall blond princess of some royal house of northern europe and any number of belgian go home to enlist in the strait of dover a hour or so out from folkestone we run through a fleet of british warship guard the narrow roadstead between france and england and a torpedo-boat destroyer sidle up and take a look at we just off dunkirk a french scout ship talk with we by the language of the whipping signal flag but the ordinary channel craft come and go without hindrance or seeming fear and again it be hard for we to make ourselves believe that we have reach a zone where the physical tangible business of war go forward and ostend and after ostend the belgian interior -- those be disappointment too for at ostend bather disport on the long shine beach and child play about the sanded stretch and though there be soldier in sight one always expect soldier in european country no one ask to see the passport we have bring with we and the custom officer give we hand baggage the most perfunctory of examination hardly five minute have elapse after we landing before we be steam away on we train through a landscape which to judge by its appearance might have know only peace and naught but peace for a thousand placid year it be true we see during that ride few able-bodied male adult either in the town through which we rush or in the country there be priest occasionally and old infirm man or half-grown boy but of man in they prime the land have be drain to fill up the army of defense then on the other side of belgium -- toward germany -- strive to hold the invader in check until the french and english might come up the yellow-ripe grain stand in the field heavy-headed and droop with seed the russet pear and red apple bent the limb of the fruit tree almost to earth every visible inch of soil be under cultivation of the painfully intensive european sort and there remain behind to garner the crop only the peasant woman and a few cripple aged grand - sire it be hard for we to convince ourselves that any event out of the ordinary beset this country no column of troops pass along the road no camp of tent lift they peaked top above the hedge in seventy-odd mile we encounter one small detachment of soldier -- they be at a railroad station -- and one red cross flag as for brussels -- why brussels at first glance be more like a city make a fete than the capital of a nation make war the flag which be display everywhere the crowd in the square before the railroad station the multitude of boy scout run about the uniform of belgian volunteer and regular the garde civique in they queer - look costume with funny little derby hat all braid-trimmed -- give to the place a holiday air after nightfall when the people of brussels flock to the sidewalk cafe and sit at little round table under awning drink light drink a la parisienne this impression be heighten we dine in the open air ourselves find the price for food and drink to be both moderate and modest and able to see nothing on the surface which suggest that the life of these people have be seriously disturbed two significant fact however do obtrude themselves on we : every minute or two as we dine a young girl or a old gentleman would come to we rattle a tin receptacle with a slot in the top through which coin for the aid of the widow and orphan of dead soldier might be drop and when a little later we ride past the royal palace we see that it have be convert into a big hospital for the wound that night also the government run away to antwerp but of this we know nothing until the follow morning next day we hear tale : uhlan have be see almost in the suburb three german spy disguise as nun have be capture try convict and be no longer with we sentry on duty outside the residence of the american minister have fire at a german aeroplane dart overhead french troops be draw in to the northward and english soldier be hurry up from the south trainload of wound have be bring in under cover of the night and distribute among the improvise hospital but concede these thing to be true we know of they only at second hand by the evidence of what we ourselves see we be able to note few shift in the superficial aspect of the city the garde civique seem a trifle more numerous than it have be the evening before citizen volunteer still in civilian garb appear on the street in awkward squad carry they gun and side arm clumsily and when in minister brand whitlock 's car we drive out the beautiful avenue louise we find soldier build a breast-high barricade across the head of the roadway where it enter the boi also they be weave barbed-wire entanglement among the shade tree that be all and then as though to offset these add suggestion of danger we see child play about quietly behind the pile sand-bag guard by plump flemish nursemaid and smart dogcart constantly pass and repass we fill with well-dressed woman and with flower stick in the whip-socket the nearer we get to this war the farther away from we it seem to be we begin to regard it as a elusive silent secretive hide-and-go-seek war which would evade we always we resolve to pursue it into the country to the northward from whence the german be report to be advance crush back the outnumber belgian as they come onward but when we try to secure a laissez passer at the gendarmerie where until then a accredit correspondent might get himself a laissez passer we bump into obstacle in a inclosed courtyard behind a big gray building among loaded wagon of supplies and munch cart horse a kitchen table teeter unsteadily on its leg on the rough cobble on the table be pen and inkpot and coffee cup and beer bottle and beer glass and about it sit certain unkempt man in resplendent but unbrushed costume joseph himself -- the joseph of the coat of many color no less -- might have devise the uniform they wear with that set the picture they make there in the courtyard be suggestive of stage scene in play of the french revolution they be polite enough these piebald gentleman and they consider we credentials with a air of mildly courteous interest but they would give we no pass there have be a order who have issue it or why be not for we to know go away from there all downcast and disappointed we meet a french cavalryman he limp along in he high dragoon boot walk with the wide-legged gait of one who have bestraddle leather for many hour and be sore from it he horse which he lead by the bridle stumble with weariness a proud boy scout be serve as he guide he be the only soldier of any army except the belgian we have see so far and we halt we car and watch he until he disappear however see one tired french dragoon be not see the war and we chafe that night at the delay which keep we pen as prisoner in this handsome outwardly quiet city as we figure it we might be house up here for day or week and miss all the operation in the field when morning come though we discover that the bar be down again and that certificate sign by the american consul would be sufficient to carry we as far as the outlying suburb at least secure these precious papers then without delay we charter a rickety red taxicab for the day and pile in we tell the driver to take we eastward as far as he could go before the outpost turn we back he take we therefore at a buzz clip through the boi along one flank of the magnificent forest of soigne with its mile of green - trunk beech tree and by way of the royal park of tervueren from the edge of the thickly settle district onward we pass barricade after barricade -- some build of newly fell tree some of street car draw across the road in double row some of street cobble chink with turf and some of barb wire -- all of they even to we inexperienced eye seem but flimsy defens to interpose against a force of any size or determination but the belgian appear to set great store by these plaything behind each of they be a mixed group of soldier -- garde civique gendarme and burgher volunteer these latter mainly carry shotgun and wear floppy blue cap and long blue blouse which button down they back with big horn button like little girl ' pinafore there be we learn a touch of sentiment about the sudden appearance of those most unsoldierly look vestment in the revolution of 1830 when the man of brussels fight the hollander all morning stop for dinner at midday and then fight again all afternoon and by alternately fight and eat wear out the enemy and win they national independence they wear such cap and such back-buttoning blouse and so all night long woman in the hospital have sit up cut out and baste together the garment of glory for they menfolk no one offer to turn we back and only once or twice do a sentry insist on look at we pass in the light of fuller experience i know now that when a city be about to fall into a enemy 's hand the authority relax they vigilance and freely permit noncombatant to depart therefrom presumably on the assumption that the fewer individual there be in the place when the conqueror do come the fewer the problem of care for the resident population will be but we do not know this mighty significant fact and suspect nothing the four innocent drive blithely on until the city lay behind we and the country lay before we brood in the bright sunlight and all empty and peaceful except for thin scattering detachment of gaily clad belgian infantryman through which we pass once or twice tired dirty straggler lie at the roadside raise a cheer as they recognize the small american flag that flutter from we taxi 's door and once we give a lift to a belgian bicycle courier who have grow too leg-weary to pedal he machine another inch he be the color of the dust through which he have ride and he face under its dirt mask be thin and draw with fatigue but he racial enthusiasm endure and when we drop he he insist on shake hand with all of we and offer we a drink out of a very warm and very grimy bottle of something or other all of a sudden round a bend we come on a little valley with one of the infrequent belgian brook bisect it and this whole valley be full of soldier there must have be ten thousand of they -- cavalry foot artillery baggage train and all quite near we be range a battery of small rapid-fire gun and the big rawboned dog that have haul they there be lie under the wicked-looking little piece we have hear a lot about the dog-drawn gun of the belgian but these be the first of they we have see line of cavalryman be skirt crosswise over the low hill at the other side of the valley and against the sky line the figure of horse and man stand out clear and fine it all seem a splendid martial sight but afterward compare this force with the army into whose front we be to blunder unwittingly we think of it as a little handful of toy soldier play at war we never hear what become of those belgian presumably at the advance of the german come down on they countlessly like a old testament locust plague they fall back and go round brussels go northward toward antwerp to join the main body of they own troops or they may have reach the line of the ally to the south and westward toward the french frontier one guess would be as good as the other one of the puzzling thing about the early mid-august stage of the war be the almost instantaneous rapidity with which the belgian army as a army disintegrate and vanish to-day it be here give a good account of itself against tremendous odds spend itself in driblet to give the ally a chance to get up to-morrow it be utterly go still without be halt or delay we go briskly on we have top the next rise command the next valley and -- except for a few straggler and some skirmisher -- the belgian be quite out of sight when we driver stop with a abruptness which pile he four passenger in a heap and point off to the northwest a queer startle frightened look on he broad flemish face there be smoke there along the horizon -- much smoke both white and dark and even as the throb of the motor die away to a purr the sound of big gun come to we in a faint rumble bear from a long way off by the breeze it be the first time any one of we except mccutcheon have ever hear a gun fire in battle and it be the first intimation to any of we that the german be so near bar only venturesome mount scout we have suppose the german column be many kilometer away a brush between skirmisher be the best we have count on see right here we part from we taxi driver he make it plain to we partly by word and partly by sign that he personally be not look for any war plainly he be one who specialize in peace and the pursuit of peace not even the proffer bribe of a double or a triple fare avail to move he one rod toward those smoke cloud he turn he car round so that it face toward brussels and there he agree to stay care for we light overcoat until we should return to he i wonder how long he really do stay and i have wonder in idle moment since what he do with we overcoat maybe he flee with the automobile contain two english moving-picture operator which pass we at that moment and from which float back a shout warn that the german be come maybe he stay too long and be gobble up -- but i doubt it he have a instinct for safety as we go forward afoot the sound of the firing grow clearer and more distinct we could now hear quite plainly the grunt belch of the big piece and in between the chatter voice of rapid-fire gun long - extended stammering staccato sound which we take to mean rifle firing come to we ear also among ourselves we decide that the white smoke come from the gun and the black from burn building or hay rick also we agree that the fighting be go on beyond the spire and chimney of a village on the crest of the hill immediately ahead of we we could make out a white church and on past it line of gray stone cottage in these deduction we be partly right and partly wrong we have hit on the approximate direction of the fighting but it be not a village that lay before we what we see be a outlying section of the city of louvain a place of fifty thousand inhabitant destine within ten day to be turn into a waste of sack ruin there be field of tall rank winter cabbage on each side of the road and among the big green leaf we see bright red dot we have to look a second time before we realize that these dot be not the bloom of the wild red poppy that be so abundant in belgium but the red-tipped cap of belgian soldier squat in the cover of the plant none of they look toward we all of they look toward those mount wall of smoke now too we become aware of something else -- aware of a procession that advance toward we it be the head of a two-mile long line of refugee flee from destroy or threaten district on beyond at first in scatter straggle group and then in solid column they pass we unendingly we go one way they go the other mainly they be afoot though now and then a farm wagon would bulk above the weave rank and it would be load with bedding and furniture and pack to overflow with old woman and baby one wagon lack horse to draw it and six man pull in front while two man push at the back to propel it some of the flee multitude look like townspeople but the majority plainly be peasant and of these latter at least half wear wooden shoe so that the sound of they foot on the cobble roadbed make a clatter chorus that at time almost drown out the hiccup voice of the gun behind they occasionally there would be a man shove a barrow with a baby and possibly a muddle of bedclothing in the barrow together every woman carry a burden of some sort which might be a pack tie in a cloth or a cheap valise stuff to burst or a baby -- though generally it be a baby and nearly every man in addition to he load of belongings have a umbrella under he arm in this rainy land the carrying of umbrella be a habit not easily shake off and besides most of these people have sleep out at least one night and would probably sleep out another and a umbrella make a sort of shelter if you have no better i figure i see a thousand umbrella if i see one and the sight of they give a strangely incongruous touch to the thing yes it give a grotesque touch to it the spectacle inclined one to laugh almost make one forget for a moment that here in this spectacle one behold the misery of war make concrete that in the lorn state of these poor folk its effect be focus and make vivid that while in some way it touch every living creature on the globe here it touch they directly all the child except the sick one and the very young one walk and most of they carry small bundle too i see one little girl who be perhaps six year old with a heavy wooden clock in she arm the leg of the child waver under they sometimes from weakness or maybe weariness but i do not hear a single child whimper or see a single woman who weep or hear a single man speak above a half whisper they drift on by we silent all except for the sound of foot and wheel and as i read the look on they face those face express no emotion except a certain numbed resign bovine bewilderment far back in the line we meet two cripple hobble along side by side as though for company and still farther back a belgian soldier come like a rear guard with he gun swing over he back and he sweaty black hair hang down in he eye in a undertone he be apparently explain something to a little bow-legged man in black with spectacles who trudge along in he company he be the lone soldier we see among the refugee -- all the other be civilian only one man in all the line hail we speak so low that we could scarcely catch he word he say in broken english : m ` sieur the french be in brussels be they not no we tell he the british then -- they must be there by now no the british be not there either he shake he head as though puzzle and start on how far away be the german we ask he he shake he head again i can not say he answer but i think they must be close behind we i have a brother in the army at liege he add apparently apropo of nothing and then he go on still shake he head and with both arm tightly clasp round a big bundle do up in cloth which he hold against he breast very suddenly the procession break off as though it have be chop in two and almost immediately after that the road turn into a street and we be between solid line of small cottage surround on all side by people who flutter about with the distract aimlessness of agitate barnyard fowl they babble among themselves pay small heed to we a automobile tear through the street with its horn blare and race by we go toward brussels at forty mile a hour a well-dressed man in the front seat yell out something to we as he whiz past but the word be swallow up in the roaring of he engine of we party only one speak french and he speak it indifferently we seek therefore to find some one who understand english in a minute we see the black robe of a priest and here through the crowd calm and dignified where all other be fairly befuddle with excitement he come -- a short man with a fuzzy red beard and a bright blue eye we hail he and the man who speak a little french explain we case at once he turn about and take we into a side street and even in they present state the man and woman who meet we remember they manners and pull off they hat and bow before he at a door let into a high stone wall he stop and ring a bell a brother in a brown robe come and unbar the gate for we and we guide lead we under a arched alley and out again into the open and behold we be in another world from the little world of panic that we have just leave there be a high-walled inclosure with a neglect tennis court in the middle and pear and plum tree burden with fruit and at the far end beneath a little arbor of vine four priest be sit together at sight of we they rise and come to we and shake hand all round almost before we know it we be in a bare little room behind the ancient church of saint jacque and one of the father be show we a map in order that we might better understand the lay of the land and another be uncork a bottle of good red wine which he bring up from the cellar with a halo of mold on the cork and a mantle of cobweb on its sloping shoulder it seem that the rev dom marie-joseph montaigne -- i give the name that be on he card -- could speak a little english he tell we haltingly that the smoke we have see come from a scene of fight somewhere to the eastward of louvain he understand that the prussian be quite near but he have see none himself and do not expect they would enter the town before nightfall as for the firing that appear to have cease and sure enough when we listen we could no longer catch the sound of the big gun nor do we hear they again during that day over he glass the priest speak in he faulty english stop often to feel for a word and when he have finish he face work and quiver with the emotion he feel this war -- it be a most terrible thing that it should come on belgium eh we little country have no quarrel with any great country we desire only that we should be leave alone we people here -- they be not bad people i tell you they be very good people all the week they work and work and on Sunday they go to church and then maybe they take a little walk you american now -- you come from a very great country surely if the worst should come america will not let we country perish from off the earth eh be not that so fifteen minute later we be out again face the dusty little square of saint jacque and now of a sudden peace seem to have fall on the place the wagon of a little travel circus be range in the middle of the square with no one about to guard they and across the way be a small tavern all together we discover we be hungry we have have bread and cheese and coffee and be light some very bad native cigar when the landlord burst in on we say in a quavering voice that some one passing have tell he a squad of seven german trooper have be see in the next street but one he make a gesture as though to invoke the mercy of heaven on we all and run out again cast a carpet slipper in he flight and leave it behind he on the floor so we follow not in the least believe that any german have really be sight but in the street we see a group of perhaps fifty belgian soldier run up a narrow sideway trail they gun butt behind they on the stone we figure they be hurry forward to the other side of town to help hold back the enemy a minute later seven or eight more soldier cross the road ahead of we and dart up a alley with the air and haste of man desirous of be speedily out of sight we have go perhaps fifty foot beyond the mouth of this alley when two man one on horseback and one on a bicycle ride slowly and sedately out of another alley parallel to the first one and swing about with they back to we i imagine we have watch the newcomer for probably fifty seconds before it dawn on any of we that they wear gray helmet and gray coat and carry arm -- and be german precisely at that moment they both turn so that they face we and the man on horseback lift a carbine from a holster and half swing it in we direction realization come to we that here we be pocket there be arm belgian in a alley behind we and armed german in the street before we and we be nicely in between if shooting start the enemy might miss each other but they could not very well miss we two of we party find a courtyard and run through it the third press close up against a house front and i make for the half-open door of a shop just as i reach it a woman on the inside slam it in my face and lock it i never expect to see she again but that do not mean that i ever expect to forgive she the next door stand open and from within its shelter i face about to watch for what might befall nothing befall except that the german ride slowly past I both vigilantly keen in poise and look both with weapon unshipped i get a especially good view of the cavalry he be a tall lean blond young man man with a little yellow mustache and high cheekbone like a indian 's and he be sunburned until he be almost as red as a indian the sight of that limp french dragoon the day before have make I think of a picture by meissonier or détaille but this german put I in mind of one of frederic remington 's painting change he costume a bit and substitute a slouch hat for he flat-topped lancer 's cap and he might have canter bodily out of one of remington 's canvas he ride past I -- he and he comrade on the wheel -- and in a instant they be go into another street and the people who have scurry to cover at they come be out again behind they with crane neck and startle face we group reassemble itself somehow and follow after those two german who could jog along so serenely through a hostile town we do not crowd they -- we health forbid that -- but we now desire above all thing to get back to we taxicab two mile or more away before we line of retreat should be cut off but we have tarry too long at we bread and cheese when we come to where the street lead to the square of saint jacque join the street that lead in turn to the brussels road all the people there be crouch in they doorway as quiet as so many mouse all look in the direction in which we hope to go all point with they hand no one speak but the scuffle of wooden-shod foot on the flag make a slide slither sound which someway carry a message of warn more forcible than any shout word or sudden shriek we look where they finger aim and as we look a hundred foot away through a cloud of dust a company of german foot soldier swing across a open grassplot where a little triangular park be and straighten out down the road to brussels singing snatch of a german march song as they go and behind they come trim officer on handsome high-headed horse and more infantry then a bicycle squad then cavalry and then a light battery bump along over the rutted stone with white dust blow back from under its wheel in scroll and pennon then a troop of uhlan come with nod lance follow close behind the gun and at sight of they a few man and woman cluster at the door of a little wine shop call itself the belgian lion begin to hiss and mutter for among these people as we know already the uhlan have a hard name at that a noncommissioned officer -- a big man with a neck on he like a bison and a red broad menacing face -- turn in he saddle and drop the muzzle of he black automatic on they they suck they hiss back down they frightened gullet so swiftly that the exertion well-nigh choke they and shrink flat against the wall and for all the sound that come from they until he have holster he hardware and trot on they might have be dead man and woman just then from perhaps half a mile on ahead a sharp clatter of rifle fire sound -- pop pop pop -- and then a rattle volley we see the uhlan snatch out they carbine and gallop forward past the battery into the dust curtain and as it swallow they up we who have come in a taxicab look for the war know that we have find it and know too that we chance of ever see that taxicab again be most exceed small we have one hope -- that this might merely be a reconnaissance in force and that when it turn back or turn aside we might yet slip through and make for brussels afoot but it be no reconnaissance -- it be germany up and move we stay in louvain three day and for three day we watch the streaming past of the biggest army we have ever see and the biggest army beleaguer belgium have ever see and one of the biggest most perfect army the world have ever see we watch the gray-clad column pass until the mind grow numb at the prospect of compute they number to think of try to count they be like try to count the leaf on a tree or the pebble on a path they come and come and keep on come and they iron-shod foot flail the earth to powder and there be no end to they chapter 3 sherman say it undoubtedly sherman say it this be my text and as illustration for my text i take the case of the town of la buissière the german take the town of la buissière after stiff fighting on August twenty-fourth i imagine that possibly there be a line in the dispatch tell of the fight there but at that i doubt it because on that same date a few mile away a real battle be rage between the english rear guard under sir john french of the retreat army of the ally fall back into france and the german besides in the sum total of this war the fall of la buissière hardly count you might say it represent a semicolon in the story of the campaign probably no future historian will give it so much as a paragraph in we own civil war it would have be worth a page in the record anyway here upward of three hundred man on both side be kill and wound and as many more frenchman be capture and the town when take give the winner the control of the river sambre for many mile east and west here also be a german charge with bayonet up a steep and well-defended height and after that a hand-to-hand melee with the french defender on the poll of the hill but this war be so big a thing as war go that a engagement of this size be likely to be forget in a day or a week yet i warrant you the people of la buissière will not forget it nor shall we forget it who come that way in the early afternoon of a flawless summer day let I try to recreate la buissière for you reader here the sambre a small orderly stream no larger or broader or wider than a good-sized creek would be in america flow for a mile or two almost due east and west the northern bank be almost flat with low hill rise on beyond like the rim of a saucer the town -- most of it -- be on this side on the south the land lift in a moderately stiff bluff perhaps seventy foot high with wooded edge and extend off and away in a plateau where tree stand in well-thinned grove and sunken road meander between field of hop and grain and patch of cabbage and sugar beet as for the town it have perhaps twenty-five hundred people -- walloon and flemish folk -- living in tall bleak stone house build flush with the little crooked street invariably these house be of a whitish gray color almost invariably they be narrow and cramped - look with very peaky gable somehow suggest flat-chested old man stand in close row with they hand in they pocket and they shoulder shrug up a canal bisect one corner of the place and span the river there be -- or be -- three bridge one for the railroad and two for foot and vehicular travel there be a mill which overhang the river -- the biggest building in the town -- and a ancient gray convent not quite so large as the mill and of course a church in most of the house there be tiny shop on the lower floor and upstairs be the home of the people on the northern side of the stream every tillable foot of soil be under cultivation there be flower bed and plum and pear tree in the tiny grass plot alongside the more pretentious house and the farm land extend to where the town begin this briefly be la buissière as it look before the war begin -- a little drowsy settlement of dull frugal hard-working kindly belgian mind they own affair prosper in they own small way and have no quarrel with the outside world they live in the only corner of europe that i know of where serve people decline to accept tip for render small service and in a simple homely fashion be i think the politest the most courteous the most accommodate human being on the face of the earth even they misery do not make they forget they manners as we find when we come that way close behind the conqueror it be only the refugee flee from they home or go back to they again who be too far spend to lift they cap in answer to we hail and too miserably concern with they own ruin affair or else too afraid of inquisitive stranger to answer the question we sometimes put to they we be three day get from brussels to la buissière -- a distance i suppose of about forty-five english mile there be no railroad and no tram for we the line be hold by the german or have be destroy by the ally as they fall back nor be there automobile to be have such automobile as be not hide have be confiscate by one side or the other moreover we journey be a constant succession of stop and start now we would be delay for half a hour while some german officer examine the pass we carry he meantime eye we with he suspicious squint eye now again we would halt to listen to some native 's story of battle or reprisal on ahead and always there be the everlasting dim reverberation of the distant gun to draw we forward and always too there be the difficulty of secure means of transportation it be on Sunday afternoon August twenty-third when we leave brussels intend to ride to waterloo there be six of we in two ancient open carriage design like gravy boat and haul by gaunt livery horse though the german have hold brussels for four day now life in the suburb go on exactly as it go on in the suburb of a belgian city in ordinary time there be nothing to suggest war or a capture city in the family party sit at small table before the outlying cafe or stroll decorously under the tree that shaded every road even the red cross flag hang from the window of many of the larger house seem for once in keep with the peaceful picture of german during the afternoon we see almost none thick enough in the center of the town the gray back show themselves hardly at all in the environs at the city line a small guard lounge on bench before a wine shop they stand up as we draw near but change they mind and squat down without challenge we to produce the safe-conduct papers that herr general major thaddeus von jarotzky sit in due state in the ancient hotel de ville have bestow on we a hour before just before we reach waterloo we see in a field on the right near the road a small camp of german cavalry the big round-topped yellow tent shelter twenty man each and look like huge tortoise stand in a line from the cook-wagon model on the design of those carry by a american circus come the heavy meaty smell of stew boil in enormous caldron the man be lie or sit on straw pile sing german march song as they wait for they supper it be always so -- whenever and wherever we find german troops at rest they be sing eating or drinking -- or do all three at once a german say to I afterwards : why do we win three thing be win for we -- good march good shooting and good cooking but most of all the cooking when we troops stop there be always plenty of hot food for they we never have to fight on a empty stomach -- we german these husky singer be the last german we be to see for many hour for between the garrison force leave behind in brussels and the fast - move column hurry to meet the english and the french and a few belgian -- on the morrow -- a matter of many league now intervene evidence of the pass through of the troops be plentiful enough though we see it in the trample hedge in the empty beer bottle that dot the roadside ditch -- empty bottle as we have come to know mean german on ahead in the subdue furtive attitude of the country folk and most of all in the chalk legend in stubby german script -- gute leute -- on nearly every wine-shop shutter or cottage door soldier quarter in such a house overnight have on leave write this line -- good people -- to indicate the peaceful character of the dweller therein and to commend they to the kindness of those who might follow after the lion of waterloo standing on its lofty green pyramid be mile behind we before realization come that fight have start that day to the southward of we we halt at a taverne to water the horse and out come its flemish proprietor all gesticulation and exclamation to tell we that since morning he have hear firing on ahead ah sir he say it be inconceivable -- that sound of the gun it go on for hour the whole world must be at war down the road the day before he have see flit across the cabbage patch and dodge among the elm tree a skirmish party mount which he take to be english and for two day so he say the german have be pass the tavern in number uncountable we hurry on then but as we meet many peasant all come the other way afoot and all with excited story of a supposed battle ahead and as we ourselves now begin to catch the faint reverberation of cannon fire we driver manifest a strange reluctance about proceed farther and when just at dusk we clatter into the curious little convent-church town of nivelle and find the tiny square before the black eagle inn full of refugee who have trudge in from town beyond the liveryman after take off they varnish high hat to scratch they preplexed head announce that brussels be where they belong and to brussels they would return that night though they spend horse drop in the trace on the way we sup that night at the black eagle -- sleep there too -- and it be at supper we have as guest raymond putzey aged twelve and alfr he father except crumb of chocolate and piece of dry bread neither of they have eat for two day the boy who be a round-faced handsome dirty polite little chap say not a word except mercus he be too busy clear he plate clean as fast as we load it with ham and egg and plum jam and when he have eat enough for three and could hold no more he go to sleep with he tousled head among the dish the father between bite tell we he tale -- such a tale as we have hear dozen of time already and be to hear again a hundred time before that crowded week end -- he tell it with roll eye and lift brow and graphic and abundant gesture behind he and we pen we table about with a living hedge stand the lead burgher of nivelle now listen to he now watch we with curious eye and as he talk on the landlord dim the oil lamp and make fast the door for this town be in german hand be under martial law and must lock and bar itself in at eight o'clock each night so we sit in a half light and listen they live the two putzey at a hamlet name marchienne-au-pont to the southward the german have come into it the day before at sunup and find the french there have open fire from the house the french have reply until drive out by heavy odds and then they run across the field leave many dead and wound behind they as for the inhabitant they have during the fight hide in they cellar when the french be go the german drive we out go on the narrator and of the man they make several of we march ahead of they down the road into the next village we hold up we hand and loudly beg those within the house not to fire for fear of kill we who be they friend and neighbor when this town surrender the german let we go but first one of they give I a cake of chocolate yet when i try to go to aid a wounded frenchman who lay in the field another german i think fire at I i hear the bullet -- it buzz like a hornet so then i run away and find my son here and we come across the country follow the canal and avoid the road which be fill with german troops when we have go a mile we look back and there be much thick smoke behind we -- we house be burn i suppose so last night we sleep in the wood and all day we walk and to-night reach here bring with we nothing except the clothes on we back i have no wife -- she have be dead for two year -- but in brussels i have two daughter at school do you think i shall be permit to enter brussels and seek for my two daughter this morning they tell I brussels be burn but that i do not believe then also he tell we in quick eager sentence lower he voice while he speak that a priest with he hand tie behind he back have be drive through a certain village ahead of the german as a human shield for they and that in still another village two aged woman have be violate and murder have he behold these thing with he own eye no he have be tell of they here i might add that this be we commonest experience in question the refugee every one of they have a tale to tell of german atrocity on noncombatant but not once do we find a avowed eye-witness to such thing always we informant have hear of the torturing or the maiming or the murder but never have he personally see it it have always happen in another town -- never in he own town we hope to hire fresh vehicle of some sort in nivelle indeed a half-drunken burgher who speak fair english and who because he have once live in america insist on take personal charge of we affair be constantly bustling in to say he have arrange for carriage and horse but when the start hour come -- at five o'clock on Monday morning -- there be no sign either of we fuddled guardian or of the rig he have promise so we set out afoot follow the everlasting sound of the gun after have many small adventure on the way we come at nightfall to binche a town give over to dullness and lacemaking and once a year to a mask carnival but which now be jam with german supply train and by token of this latter circumstance fill with apprehensive townspeople but there have be no show of resistance here and no house have be burn and the german be pay freely for what they take and treat the townspeople civilly indeed all that day we have travel through a district as yet unharried and unmolested though sundry hundred of thousand of german have go that way no burnt house or squander field mark they wake and the few peasant who have not run away at the approach of the dreaded allemand be back at work try to gather they crop in barrow or on they back since they have no work-cattle leave for these the german have take from they to the last fit horse and the last colt at binche we lay up two night and a day for the curing of we blistered foot also here we buy we two flimsy bicycle and we decrepit dogcart and we still more decrepit mare to haul it and with this equipment on Wednesday morning bright and early we make a fresh start head now toward maubeuge across the french boundary current rumor among the soldier at binche -- for the native seemingly through fear for they own skin would tell we nothing -- be that at maubeuge the onward-pressing german have catch up with the withdraw column of the ally and be try to bottle the stubborn english rear guard for once the gossip of the private and the noncommissioned officer prove to be true there be fight that day near maubeuge -- hard fighting and plenty of it but though we get within five mile of it and hear the gun and see the smoke from they we be destine not to get there string out with the bicycle in front we go down the straight white road that run toward the frontier after a hour or two of steady go we begin to notice sign of the retreat that have trail through this section forty-eight hour before we pick up a tear shoulder strap evidently of french workmanship which have 13 embroider on it in fade red tape and we find behind the trunk of a tree a knapsack new but empty which be too light to have be part of a german soldier 's equipment we think it be french but now i think it must have be belgian because as we subsequently discover a few scattering detachment of the belgian foot soldier who flee from brussels on the eve of the occupation -- disappear so completely and so magically -- make they way westward and southward to the french line toward mon and enrol with the ally in the last desperate effort to dam off and stem back the german torrent also in a hedge be a pair of new shoe with they mouth gaping open and they latchet hang down like tongue as though hunger for foot to go into they but not a shred or scrap of german belongings -- bar only the empty bottle -- do we see the marvelous german system which be make up of a million small thing to form one great complete thing ordain that never either when march or after camping or even after fight should any object however worthless be discard lest it give to hostile eye some hint as to the name of the command or the extent of its size these german we be trail clean up behind themselves as carefully as new england housewife it may have be the german love of order and regularity that induce they even to avoid trample the ripe grain in the field wherever possible certainly except when deal out punishment they do remarkably little damage consider they number along they line of march through this lowermost strip of belgium at merbes-ste-marie a matter of six kilometer from binche we come on the first proof of seeming wantonness we encounter that day a old woman sit in a doorway of what have be a wayside wine shop guard the pitiable ruin of she stock and fixture all about she on the floor be a litter of foul straw muddy by many foot and stain with spill drink the stench from a bloated dead cavalry horse across the road poison the air the woman say a party of private soldier stray back from the main column have despoil she take what they please of she goods and in pure vandalism destroy what they could not use she shop be ruin she say with a gesture of both arm as though cast something from she she express how utter and complete be she ruin also she be hungry -- she and she child -- for the german have eat all the food in the house and all the food in the house of she neighbor we could not feed she for we have no stock of provision with we but we give she a five-franc piece and leave she call down the blessing of the saint on we in french-flemish the sister village of merbes-le-chateau another kilometer farther on reveal to we all its door and many of its window cave in by blow of gun butt and at the nearer end of the principal street five house in smoking ruin a group of man and woman be paw about in the wreckage seek salvage they have save a half-charred washstand a scorched mattress a clock and a few article of woman 's wear and these they have pile in a mound on the edge of the road at first not know who we be they stand mute reply to question only with shrug shoulder and lift eyebrow but when we make they realize that we be american they change all be ready enough to talk then they crowd about we gesticulate and interrupt one another from the babble we gather that the german skirmisher come in the strength of one company have find a english cavalry squad in the town the english have swap a few volley with they then have fall back toward the river in good order and without loss the german push in have burn certain outlying house from which shot have come and burst open the rest also they have repeat the trick of capture sundry luckless native and in they rush through the town drive these prisoner ahead of they as live buckler to minimize the danger of be shoot at from the window one youth show we a raw wound in he ear a piece of tile splintered by a errant bullet have pierce it he say as the german drive he before they another man tell we he father -- and the father must have be a old man for the speaker himself be in he fifty -- have be shoot through the thigh but have anybody be kill that be what we want to know ah but yes a dozen eager finger point to the house immediately behind we there a man have be kill come back to try to save some of they belongings after the german have go through these other have find he at the head of the cellar step in he blaze house he throat have be cut and he blood be on the floor and he be dead they lead we into the shell of the place the stone wall be still staunchly erect but the roof be go and in the cinder and dust on the plank of a inner room they show we a big dull-brown smear this they tell we point be the place where he lay one man in pantomime act out the drama of the discovery of the body he be a bear actor that belgian villager and a orator -- with he hand somehow watch he i visualize the victim as a little man old and stoop-shouldered and feeble in he movement i look about the room the corner toward the road be a black ruin but the back wall be hardly touch by the mark of the fire on a mantel small bit of pottery stand intact and a holy picture on the wall -- a cheap print of a saint -- be not even singe at the foot of the cellar step curdle milk stand in pan and beside the milk on a table be a half-moon of cheese and a long knife we want to know why the man who live here have be kill they profess ignorance then -- none of they know or at least none of they would say a little later a woman tell we she have hear the german catch he watch from a window with a pair of opera glass and on this evidence take he for a spy but we could secure no direct evidence either to confirm the tale or to disprove it we get to the center of the town leave the venerable nag behind to be bait at a big gray barn by a big shapeless kindly woman hostler whose wooden shoe clatter on the round cobble of she stable yard like drum tap in the square after many citizen have inform we there be nothing to eat a little frenchwoman take pity on we emptiness and lead we to a parlor behind a shop where she sell among other thing post card cheese and underwear she make we a huge omelet and give we also good butter and fresh milk and a pot of she homemade marmalade she two little daughter who look as though they have escape from a fran hal canvas wait on we while we wolf the food down quite casually we hostess show we a round hole in the window behind we a big white scar in the wooden inner shutter and a flatten chunk of lead the night before it seem some one for purpose unknown have fire a bullet through the window of she house it be proof of the rapidity with which the actual presence of war work indifference to sudden shock among a people that this woman could discuss the incident quietly hostile gun butt have splintered she front door why not a stray bullet or two through she back window so we interpret she attitude it be she who advise we not to try to ford the sambre at merbes-le - chateau but to go off at a angle to la buissière where she have hear one bridge still stand she say nothing of a fight at that place it be possible that she know nothing of it though the two town almost touch indeed in all these belgian town we find the people so concerned with they own small upheaval and terror that they seem not to care or even to know how they neighbor a mile or two mile away have fare follow this advice we swing about and drive to la buissière to find the bridge that might still be intact and find it we find also and quite by chance the scene of the first extended engagement on which we stumble we first intimation of it be the presence in a cabbage field beyond the town of three strangely subdue peasant soften the hard earth with water so that they might dig a grave for a dead horse which after lie two day in the hot sun have already become a nuisance and might become a pestilence when we tell they we mean to enter la buissière they hold up they soil hand in protest there have be much fighting there one say and many be dead and more be die also the shooting still go on but what it mean we do not know because we dare not venture into the street which be full of german hark m ` sieur even as he speak we hear a rifle crack and then after a pause a second report we go forward cautiously across a bridge that span a arm of the canal and past a double line of house with broken window from which no sign or sound of life come suddenly at a turn three german private of a lancer regiment face we they be burden with bottle of beer and one carry he lance which he fling playfully in we path he have be drink and be jovially exhilarate as soon as he see the small silk american flag that flutter from the rail of we dogcart he and he friend become enthusiastic in they greeting offer we beer and want to know whether the american mean to declare for germany now that the japanese have side with england leave they cheer for the american we negotiate another elbow in the twist street -- and there all about we be the aftermath and wreckage of a spirited fight earlier in this chapter i tell -- or try to tell -- how la buissière must have look in peaceful time i shall try now to tell how it actually look that afternoon we ride into it in the center of the town the main street open out to form a irregular circle and the house front it make a compact ring through a gap one get a glimpse of the little river which one have just cross and on the river bank stand the mill or what be leave of it and that be little enough its roof be go shot clear away in a shower of shatter tiling and its wall be breach in a hundred place it be pretty certain that mill will never grind grist again on its upper floor which be now a sieve the german -- so they themselves tell we -- find after the fight the seventy-year-old miller dead with a gun in he hand and a hole in he head he have elect to help the french defend the place and it be as well for he that he fall fight because have he be take alive the prussian follow they grim rule for all civilian catch with weapon would have stand he up against a wall with a firing squad before he the house round about have fare better in the main than the mill though none of they have come scatheless out of the fight hardly a windowpane be whole hardly a wall but be pock by bullet or rent by larger missile some house have lose roof some have lose side wall so that one can gaze straight into they and see the cluttered furnishings half bury in shatter masonry and crumble plaster one small cottage have be blow clear away in a blast of artillery fire only the chimney remain point upward like a stubby finger a fireplace with a fire in it be the glowing heart of a house and a chimney complete it and reveal that it be a home fit for human creature to live in but we see here -- and the truth of it strike we as it never do before -- that a chimney standing alone typify desolation and ruin more fitly more brutally than any write word could typify it everywhere there be soldier -- german soldier -- in they soil dusty gray service uniform always in heavy boot always with they tunic button to the throat some off duty be lounge at ease in the door of the house more on duty be move about briskly in squad with fix bayonet one be learn to ride a bicycle and when he fall off as he do repeatedly he comrade laugh at he and shout derisive advice at he there be not many of the townsfolk in sight experience have teach we that in any town not occupy by the enemy we appearance will be the signal for a immediate gathering of the citizen all flock about we fill with a naive respectful inquisitiveness and want to know where we have come from and to what place we be go here in this stricken town not a single villager come near we a priest pass we bow deeply to we and in a instant be go round a jog in the street the skirt of he black robe flicking behind he from upper window face peer out at we -- face of woman and child mostly in nearly every one of these face a sort of cow-like bewilderment express itself -- not grief not even resentment but merely a stupefied wonderment at the astounding fact that they town rather than some other town should be the town where the soldier of other nation come to fight out they feud we have come to know well that look these last few day so far as we have see there have be no mistreatment of civilian by the soldier yet we note that the villager stay inside the shelter of they damaged home as though they feel safer there a young officer bustle up spick and span in he tan boot and tan glove and find we to be american and correspondent become instantly effusive he have just come through he first fight seemingly with some credit to himself and he be proud of the part he have play and be pleased to talk about it of he own accord he volunteer to lead we to the height back of the town where the french defens be and where the hand-to-hand fighting take place as we trail along behind he in single file we pass a small paved court before a stable and see a squad of french prisoner later we be to see several thousand french prisoner but now the sight be at once a sensation and a novelty to we these be all french prisoner there be no belgian or englishman among they in they long cumbersome blue coat and baggy red pants they be huddle down against a wall in a heap of straw they lie there silently chew straw and look very forlorn four german soldier with fix bayonet be guard they the young lieutenant lead we along a steeply ascend road over a ridge and then stop and as we look about we the consciousness strike home to we with almost the jar of a physical blow that we be stand where man have lately strive together and have fall and die in front of we and below we be the town with the river wind into it at the east and out of it at the west and beyond the town to the north be the cup-shaped valley of fair fat farm land all heavy and pregnant with un-garnered ungathered crop behind we on the front of the hill be a hedge and beyond the hedge -- just a foot or so back of it in fact -- be a deep trench plainly dig out by hand and so lately do that the cut clod be still moist and fresh-looking at the first instant of look it seem to we that this intrenchment be full of dead man but when we look closer we see that what we take for corpse be the scatter garment and equipment of french infantryman -- long blue coat peak red-topped cap spare shirt rifle knapsack water - bottle break gun side arm bayonet belt and blanket roll there be perhaps twenty gun in sight each one have be render useless by be strike against the earth with sufficient force to snap the stock at the grip almost at my foot be a knapsack rip open and reveal a card of small china button a new red handkerchief a gray-striped flannel shirt a pencil and a sheaf of write paper rummage in the main compartment i find fold at the back a book record the name and record of military service of one gaston michel miseroux whose home be at amien and who be -- or be -- a private in the tenth battalion of the -- regiment of chasseur a pied whether this gaston michel miseroux get away alive without he knapsack or whether he be capture or be kill there be none to say he service record be here in the trampled dust and he be go before go farther the young lieutenant speaking in he broken english tell we the story of the fight which have be fight he say just forty-eight hour before the french he say must have be here for several day they have fortify this hill as you see digging intrenchment in front for they rifleman and put they artillery behind at a place i shall presently show you also they have place many of they sharpshooter in the house it be a strong position command the passage of the river and they should have be able to hold it against twice they number we man come as you do along that road off yonder and then we infantry advance across the field under cover of we artillery fire we be in the open and the french be above we here and behind shelter and so we lose many man they have mine the bridge over the canal and also the last remain bridge across the river but we come so fast that we take both bridge before they could set off the mine in twenty minute we hold the town and the last of they sharpshooter in the house have be dislodge or kill then while we gun move over there to the left and shell they on the flank two company of german -- five hundred man -- charge up the steep road over which you have just climb and take this trench here in five minute of close fight the enemy lose many man here before they run so do we lose many on that spot there -- he point to a little gap in the hedge not twenty foot away where the grass be press flat -- i see three dead man lie in a heap we push the french back take a few prisoner as we go until on the other side of this hill we artillery begin to rake they and then they give way altogether and retreat to the south take they gun remember they outnumber we and they have the advantage of position but we whip they -- we german -- as we always do whip we enemy he voice change from boast to pity : ach but it be shameful that they should have be send against we wear those long blue coat those red trousers those shiny black belt and bright brass button at a mile or even half a mile the german in they dark-gray uniform with dull facing fade into the background but a frenchman in he foolish monkey clothes be a target for as far as you can see he and they equipment -- see how flimsy it be when compare with ours and they gun -- so inferior so old-fashioned alongside the german gun i tell you this : forty-four year they have be wish to fight we for what we do in 1870 and when the time come they be not ready and we be ready while they have be sing they marseillaise hymn we have be think while they have be talk we have be work next he escort we back along the small plateau that extend south from the face of the bluff we make we way through a constantly grow confusion of abandoned equipment and garment -- all the flotsam and jetsam of a rout i suppose we see as many as fifty smash french rifle as many as a hundred and fifty canteen and knapsack cross a sunken road where trench for rifleman to kneel in and fire from have be dig in the side of the bank -- a road we guide say be full of dead man after the fight -- we come very soon to the site of the french camp here from the medley and mixture of a indescribable jumble of wreckage certain object stand out as i write this detach and plain in my mind such thing for example as a straw basket of twelve champagne bottle with two bottle full and ten empty a box of lump sugar break open with a stain of spill red wine on some of the white cube a roll of new mattress jam into a natural receptacle at the root of a oak tree a saber hilt of shine brass with the blade miss a whole set of pewter knife and fork sown broadcast on the bruise and trample grass but there be no german relic in the lot -- you may be sure of that farther down where the sunken road again wind across we path we pass a old-fashioned family carriage jam against the bank with one shaft snap off short lie on the dusty seat-cushion be a single silver teaspoon almost opposite the carriage against the other bank be a cavalryman 's boot it have be cut from a wounded limb the leather have be split all the way down the leg from the top to the ankle and the inside of the boot be full of clotted dry blood and just as we turn back to return to the town i see a child 's stuff cloth doll -- rag doll i think they call they in the state -- lie flat in the road and a wagon wheel or a camion wheel have pass over the head squash it flat i be not strive for effect when i tell of this trifle when you write of such thing as a battlefield you do not need to strive for effect the effect be all there ready-made wait to be set down nor do i know how a child 's doll come to be in that harry uptorn place i only know it be there and be there it seem to I to sum up the fate of little belgium in this great war if i have be seek a visible symbol of belgium 's case i do not believe i could have find a more fitting one anywhere go down the hill to the town we meet skirt across we path a party of native wear red cross distinguishment the lieutenant say these man have undoubtedly be beat the wood and grain field for the scatter wound or dead he add without emotion that from time to time they find one such in fact the volunteer searcher have bring in two frenchman just before we arrive -- one to be care for at the hospital the other to be bury we have thank the young lieutenant and have bid he good-by and be start off again hope to make maubeuge before night when suddenly it strike I that the one thing about la buissière i should recall most vividly be not the sight of it all stricken and stunned and forlorn as it be but the stench of it before this my eye have be so busy record impression that my nose have neglect its duty now for the first time i sense the vile reek that arise from all about I the place be one big horrid stink it smell of ether and iodoform and carbolic acid -- there be any number of improvise hospital full of wound in sight it smell of sour beef bone and stale bread and moldy hay and fresh horse dung it smell of the sweaty body of the soldier it smell of everything that be fetid and rancid and unsavory and unwholesome and yet forty-eight hour before this town if it be like every other belgian town must have be as clean as clean could be when the belgian peasant housewife have clean the inside of she house she issue forth with bucket and scrub brush and wash the outside of it -- and even the pavement in front and the cobble of the road but the war have come to la buissière and turn it upside down a war waste town it seem even more visibly than it waste nation already the street be ankle-deep in filth there be break lamp and broken bottle and broken windowpane everywhere and one could not step without a accompaniment of crunch glass from underfoot sack of provender which the french have abandon be split open and they contents waste in the mire while the inhabitant go hungry the lower floor of the house be bed in straw where the soldier have sleep and the straw be thickly cover with dry mud and already give off a sour-sickish odor over everything be the lime dust from the powdered wall and plaster we drive away then over the hill toward the south from the crest of the bluff we could look down on ruin la buissière with its garrison of victorious invader its frightened townspeople and its house full of maim and cripple soldier of both side beyond we could see the field where the crop already overripe must surely waste for lack of man and team to harvest they and on the edge of one field we mark where the three peasant dig the grave for the rot horse strive to get it underground before it set up a plague except for they busy with pick and spade no living creature in sight be at work sherman say it chapter 4 marsch marsch marsch so geh 'n wir weiter have you ever see three hundred thousand man and one hundred thousand horse move in one compact marvelous unit of organization discipline and system if you have not see it you can not imagine what it be like if you have see it you can not tell what it be like in one case the conceptive faculty fail you in the other the descriptive i who have see this sight be not foolish enough to undertake to put it down with pencil on paper i think i know something of the limitation of the write english language what i do mean to try to do in this chapter be to record some of my impression as i watch it in begin this job i find myself cast about for comparison to set up against the vision of a full german army of seven army corps on the march i think of the tale i have read and the story i have hear of other great army : alaric 's war band and attilum 's the first crusade hannibal 's cohort and alexander 's host and caesar 's legion the goth and the vandal the million of xerx -- if it be a million -- and napoleon start for moscow it be of no use this germanic horde which i see pour down across belgium bind for france do not in retrospect seem to I a man-made man-managed thing it seem more like a great orderly function of nature as ordain and cosmic as the tide of the sea or the sweep of a mighty wind it be hard to believe that it be ever fashion of thousand of separate atom so perfectly be it weld into a whole it be harder still to accept it as a mutable and a mortal organism subject to the shift of chance and mischance and then on top of this when one stop to remember that this army of three hundred thousand man and a hundred thousand horse be merely one single cog of the german military machine that if all the german war strength be assemble together you might add this army to the greater army and hardly know it be there -- why then the brain refuse to wrestle with a computation so gigantic the imagination just naturally bog down and quit i have already set forth in some detail how it come to pass that we go forth from brussels in a taxicab look for the war and how in the outskirts of louvain we find it and very shortly thereafter also find that we be cut off from we return and incidentally have lose not only we chauffeur and we taxi-cab but we overcoat as well there be nothing else to do we make ourselves comfortable along side the belgian lion cafe in the southern edge of louvain and for hour we watch the advance guard slide down the road through a fog of white dust each time a break come in the weave gray line we fancy this surely be all all what we see there be a puny dribbling stream compare with the torrent that be come the crest of that live tidal wave be still two day and many mile to the rearward we have see the head and a little of the neck the swollen body of the myriad-legged gray centipede be as yet far behind as we sit in chair tilted against the wall and watch we witness a interesting little side play at the first come of the german skirmisher the people of this quarter of the town have seem stupefy with amazement and astonishment most of they it subsequently develop have believe right up to the last minute that the fort of liege still hold out and that the german have not yet pass the gateway of they country many kilometer to the eastward when the scout of the enemy appear in they street they fall for the moment into a stunned state a little later the appearance of a troop of uhlan have revive they resentment we have hear that quick hiss and snarl of hatred which spring from they as the lancer trot into view on they superb mount out of the mouth of a neighbor lane and have see how instantaneously the dull malignant gleam of gun metal as a sergeant pull he pistol on they have bring the silence of frightened respect again it now appear that realization of the number of the invader be breed in the belgian a placating spirit if a soldier fall out of line at the door of a house to ask for water all within that house strive to bring the water to he if a officer return from a small sortie into other street check up to ask the way to rejoin he command a dozen eager arm wave in chorus to point out the proper direction and a babble of solicitous voice arise from the group about he halted horse young belgian girl begin smile at soldier swing by and the soldier grin back and wave they arm you might almost have think the troops be ally pass through a friendly community this phase of the plastic flemish temperament make we marvel when i be tell a fortnight afterward how these same people rise in the night to strike at these they enemy and how so do they bring about the ruination of they city and the summary execution of some hundred of themselves i marvel all the more presently as we sit there we hear -- above the rumble of cannon wheel the nimble clunking of hurry hoof and the heavy thudding of boot foot fall and rise all in unison -- a new note from overhead a combination of whir and flutter and whine we look aloft directly above the troops fly as straight for brussels as a homing bee for the hive go a military monoplane serve as courier and spy for the crawl column below it directly have go far ahead it come speed back along a lower air lane and perform a series of circle and dart gyration which doubtlessly have a signal-code meaning for the troops twice or three time it swing directly above we head and at the height at which it now evolute we could plainly distinguish the downward curve of its wing-plane and the peculiar droop of the rudder -- both thing that mark it for a army model we could also make out the black cross paint on its belly as a further distinguishing mark to I a monoplane always suggest a bird when it do not suggest a insect or a winged reptile and this monoplane particularly suggest the bird type the simile which occur to I be that of the bird which guard the african rhinoceros after that it be doubly easy to conceive of this army as a rhinoceros have all the brute strength and brute force which be a part of that creature and its well-armored side and massive leg and deadly horned head and finally its peculiar fancy for charge straight at its objective target trample down all obstacle in the way the german also fancy they monoplane as a bird but they call it taube -- a dive to think of call this sinister adjunct of warfare a dive which among modern people have always symbolize peace seem a most terrible bit of sarcasm as a exquisite essence of irony i saw but one thing during we week-end in louvain to match it and that be a big van requisition from a cologne florist 's shop to use in a baggage train it bear on its side advertisement of potted plant and floral piece -- and it be load to its top with spare ammunition yet on second thought i do not believe the prussian call they war monoplane a dive by way of satire the prussian be a serious-minded race and never more serious than when they make war as all the world now know three monoplane buzz over we make sawmill sound during the next hour or two thereafter whenever we see german troops on the march through a country new to they we look aloft for the thing with the droopy wing and the black cross on its yellow abdomen sooner or later it appear come always out of nowhere and vanish always into space we be never disappoint it be only the man who expect the german army to forget something needful or necessary who be disappointed it be late in the afternoon when we bid farewell to the three-hundred - pound proprietress of the belgian lion and seek to reach the center of the town through byway not yet block off by the march regiment when we be perhaps halfway to we destination we meet a town bellman and a town crier the latter be in the uniform of a garde civique the bellringer would ply he clapper until he draw a crowd and then the garde civique would halt in a open space at the junction of two or more street and read a proclamation from the burgomaster call on all the inhabitant to preserve they tranquillity and refrain from overt act against the german under promise of safety if they obey and threat of death at the hand of the german if they disregard the warning this word-of-mouth method of spread a order apply only to the outlying section in the more thickly settle district where presumably the populace could read and write proclamation post on wall and window take its place during the three day we stay in louvain one proclamation succeed another with almost the frequency of special extra of evening newspaper when a big news story break in a american city : the citizen be to surrender all firearm in they possession it would be immediately fatal to he if a man be catch with a lethal weapon on he person or in he house tradespeople might charge this or that price for the necessity of life and no more all person except physician and nurse in the discharge of they professional duty and gendarme -- the latter be now disarm and entirely subservient to the military authority -- must be off the street and public square at a give time -- to wit nine p m cafés must close at the same hour any soldier who refuse to pay for any private purchase should be immediately report at headquarters for punishment upper front window of all house on certain specify street must be close and lock after nightfall remain so until daylight of the follow morning this notice be follow and overlap very shortly by one more amplify which prescribe that not only must front window be make fast but all must have light behind they and the street door must be leave unlock the portent of this be simple enough : if any man seek to fire on the soldier below he must first unfasten a window and expose himself in the light and after he fire admittance would be make easy for those who come search for he to kill he at first these placard be sign by the burgomaster with the military commandant 's indorsement and sometimes by both those functionary but on the second day there appear one sign by the commandant only and this one for special emphasis be bound by wide border print in bright red it state with cruel brevity that the burgomaster the senator for the district and the lead magistrate have be take into custody as hostage for the good conduct of they constituent and that if a civilian make any attack against the german he would forfeit he own life and endanger the life of the three prisoner thus inch by inch the conqueror sense a grow spirit of revolt among the conquer -- a spirit as yet nowise visible on the surface -- take typically german step to hold the rebellious people of louvain in hobble it be when we reach the y-shaped square in the middle of thing with the splendid old gothic town hall rise on one side of it and the famous church of saint pierre at the bottom of the gore that we first behold at close hand the army of the war lord alongside the belgian lion we have think it best to keep we distance from the troops as they pass obliquely across we line of vision here we might press as closely as we please to the column the magnificent precision with which the whole machinery move be astounding -- i start to say appalling three street converge into the place be glut with man extend from curb to curb and for a outlet there be but one somewhat wider street which twist its course under the gray wall of the church yet somehow the various line melt together and go thump off out of sight like stream run down a funnel and out at the spout never so far as we could tell be there any congestion any hitch any suggestion of confusion frequently there would come from a sideway a group of officer on horseback or a whole string of commandeered touring car bear monocled haughty staff officer in the tonneaus with guard ride beside the chauffeur and small slick trunk strap on behind a whistle would sound shrilly then and magically a gap would appear in the formation into this gap the horseman or the imperious automobile would slip and away the column would go again without have be disturb or impede noticeably no stage manager ever handle he super better and here be it remember there be uncountable thousand of super and for a stage the twist medieval convolution of a strange city now for a space of minute it would be infantry that pass at the swing lunge of german foot soldier on a forced march now it would be cavalry with accouterment jingle and horse scrouge in the close-packed rank else a battery of the viperish look little rapid-fire gun or a battery of heavier cannon with cloth fitting over they ugly snout like muzzled dog whose bark be bad and whose bite be worse then always in due order would succeed the field telegraph corps the field post-office corps the red cross corps the brass band of say forty piece and all the rest of it to the extent of a thousand and one circus parade roll together there be boat for make pontoon bridge mount side by side on wagon with the dry mud of the river meuse still on they flat bottom there be baggage train mile in length wherein the supply of regular army wagon be eke out with nondescript vehicle -- even family carriage and delivery van gather up hastily as the sign on they side betray from the tradespeople of a dozen northern german city and town and now bear chalk mark on they to show in what division they belong and inevitably at the tail of each regiment come its cook wagon with fire kindle and food cooking for supper in the big portable range so that when these pass the air would be charge with that pungent reek of burn wood which make a american think of a fire engine on its way to answer a alarm once as a cook perch on a step at the back of he wagon bent forward to stir the stew with a spoon almost big enough for a spade i saw under he hiked-up coat-tail that at the back of he gray trousers there be four suspender button in a row instead of two the purpose of this be plain : when he suspenders chafe he he might by shift the strap to different button shift the strain on he shoulder all german soldier ' trousers have this extra garnishment of button aft somebody thought of that somebody thought of everything we in america be accustom to think of the german as a obese race swing big paunch in front of they but in that army the only fat man we see be officer and not so many of they on occasion some colonel beefy as a brisket and with roll of fat on the back of he close-shaved neck would be see bounce by balance he tired stomach on he saddle pommel but without exception the man in the rank be train down and fine draw they bent forward under the weight of they knapsack and blanket roll and they middle be bulky with cartridge belt and bulge pocket cover they flank inside the shapeless uniform however they limb swing with athletic freedom and even at the fag-end of a hard day 's march with perhaps several hour of march yet ahead of they they carry they heavy gun as though those gun be toy they fair sunburned face be line with sweat mark and mask under dust and doubtless some be desperately weary but i do not see a straggler to date i presume i have see upward of a million of these german soldier on the march and i have yet to see a straggler for the most part the rank and file be stamp by they face and they limb as be of peasant blood or of the petty artisan type but here and there along with the butcher and the baker and the candlestick maker pass one of a slenderer build usually spectacled and wear even in this employment the unmistakable look of the culture scholarly man and every other man regardless of he breed hold a cheap cigar between he front tooth but the wagon driver and many of the cavalryman smoke pipe -- the long-stemmed china-bowled pipe which the german love the column move beneath a smoke-wreath of its own make the thing however which strike one most forcibly be the absolute completeness the perfect uniformity of the whole scheme any man 's equipment be identically like any other man 's equipment every drinking cup dangle behind its owner 's spine-tip at precisely the same angle every strap and every buckle match these german have be run through a mold and they have all come out soldier and bar a few general officer they be all young man -- man yet on the sunny side of thirty later we be to see plenty of older man -- reserve and landwehr -- but this be the pick of the western line that pass through louvain the choose product of the active wing of the service out of the narrow street the marcher issue and as they reach the broader space before the town hall each company would raise a song beating with its heavy boot on the paving stone to mark the time presently we detect a mutter of resentment rise from the troops and seek the cause of this we discern that some of they have catch sight of a big belgian flag which whip in the breeze from the top of the church of saint pierre however the flag stay where it have be put during the three day we remain in louvain seemingly the german commander do not greatly care whose flag fly on the church tower overhead so long as he hold dominion of the earth below and the dweller thereof well we watch the gray ear-wig wriggle away to the westward until we be surfeit and then we set about find a place where we might rest we dizzy head we could not get near the principal hotel these already be fill with high officer and ringed about with sentry but half a mile away on the plaza front the main railroad station we finally secure accommodation -- such as they be -- at a small fourth - rate hotel it call itself by a gorgeous title -- it be the house of the thousand column which be as true a say as though it have be name the house of the one column for it have neither one column nor a thousand but only a small dingy beer bar below and some ten dismal living room above establish here we set about get in touch with the german higher-up since we be likely to be mistake for englishman which would be embarrassing certainly and might even be painful at the hotel next door -- for all the building flank this square be hotel of a sort -- we find a group of officer one of they a tall handsome magnetic chap with a big deep laugh and a most beautiful command of we own tongue turn out to be a captain on the general staff it seem to he the greatest joke in the world that four american correspondent should come look for war in a taxicab and should find it too he beat himself on he flank in the excess of he joy and call up half a dozen friend to hear the amazing tale and they enjoy it too he say he feel sure he adjutant would appreciate the joke and as incidentally he adjutant be the person in all the world we want most just then to see we go with he to headquarters which be a mile away in the local palais de justice -- or as we should say in america the courthouse by now it be good and dark and as no street lamp burn we walk through a street that be like a tunnel for blackness the roadway be full of infantry still press forward to a camping place somewhere beyond the town we could just make out the shadowy shape of the man but they foot make a noise like thunderclap and they sing a german march song with a splendid lilt and swing to it just listen say the captain proudly they be always like that -- they march all day and half the night and never do they grow weary they be in fine spirit -- we man and we can hardly hold they back they will go forward -- always forward in this war we have no such command as retreat that word we have blot out either we shall go forward or we shall die we do not expect to fall back ever the man know this and if we general would but let they they would run to pari instead of walk there i think it be not altogether through vainglory he speak he be not a bombastic sort i think he voice the intent of the army to which he belong at the palais de justice the adjutant be not to be see so we guide volunteer to write a note of introduction for we stand in a doorway of the building where a light burn he open a small flat leather pack that swing from he belt along with the excellent map of belgium inclose in a leather frame which every german officer carry we marvel that the pack contain pencil pen inkpot seal officially stamp envelope and note paper and blank form of various device verily these german have remember all thing and forget nothing i say that to myself mentally at the moment nor have i have reason since to withdraw or qualify the remark the next morning i see the adjutant whose name be renner and whose title be that of major but first i as spokesman undergo a search for hidden weapon at the hand of a secret service man major renner be most courteous also he be amuse to hear the detail of we taxicabb expedition into he line but of the desire which lay nearest we heart -- to get back to brussels in time haply to witness its occupation by the german -- he would not hear for you own sake thus he explain it i dare not let you gentleman go terrible thing have happen last night a colonel of infantry be murder while he be asleep and i have just hear that fifteen of we soldier have they throat cut also as they sleep from house we troops have be fire on and between here and brussels there have be much of this guerrilla warfare on we to those who do such thing and to those who protect they we show no mercy we shoot they on the spot and burn they house to the ground i can well understand that the belgian resent we come into they country we ourselves regret it but it be a military necessity we could do nothing else if the belgian put on uniform and enroll as soldier and fight we openly we shall capture they if we can we shall kill they if we must but in all case we shall treat they as honorable enemy fight under the rule of civilized warfare but this shooting from ambush by civilian this murder of we people in the night -- that we can not endure we have make a rule that if shot be fire by a civilian from a house then we shall burn that house and we shall kill that man and all the other man in that house whom we suspect of harbor he or aid he we make no attempt to disguise we method of reprisal we be willing for the world to know it and it be not because i wish to cover up or hide any of we action from you eye and from the eye of the american people that i be refuse you pass for you return to brussels to-day but you see we man have be terribly excite by these crime of the belgian populace and in they excitement they might make serious mistake we troops be under splendid discipline as you may have see already for yourselve and i assure you the german be not a bloodthirsty or a drunken or a barbarous people but in every army there be fool and what be worse in every army there be brute you be stranger and if you pass along the road to-day some of we more ignorant man see that you be not native and suspect you motive might harm you there might be some stupid angry common soldier some over - zealous under officer -- you understand I do you not gentleman so you will please remain here quietly have nothing to do with any of we man who may seek to talk with you that last be important for i may tell you that we secret-service people have already report you presence and they naturally be anxious to make a show at the end of one day -- perhaps two -- we shall be able i think to give you safe conduct back to brussels and then i hope you will be able to speak a good word to the american public for we army after this fashion of speak i hear now from the lip of major renner what i subsequently hear fifty time from other army man and likewise from high german civilian of the common german attitude toward belgium often these other have use almost the same word he use invariably they have seek to convey the same meaning for those three day we stay on unwillingly in louvain we be not once out of sight of german soldier nor by day or night out of sound of they threshing foot and they rumble wheel we never look this way or that but we see they gray mass block up the distance we never enter shop or house but we find german already there we never seek to turn off the main-traveled street into a byway but we path be bar by a guard seek to know we business and always as we note for this duty those in command have choose soldier who know a smattering of french in order that the sentry might be able to speak with the citizen if we pass along a sidewalk the chance be that it would be line thick with soldier lie against the wall rest or sit on the curb with they shoe off ease they foot if we look into the sky we prospects for see a monoplane fly about be most excellent if we enter a square it be bind to be jam with horse and packed baggage train and supply wagon the atmosphere be laden with the ropy scent of the boiling stew and with the heavier smell of the soldier ' unwashed body and they sweating horse finally to they credit be it say we personally do not see one german whether officer or private who mistreat any citizen or be offensively rude to any citizen or who refuse to pay a fair reckoning for what he buy or who be conspicuously drunk the postcard vender of louvain must have grow fat with wealth for next to bottled beer and butter and cheap cigar every common soldier crave postcard above all other commodity we grow tire after a while of see german it seem to we that every vista always have be choke with unshaved blond blocky short - hair man in rawhide boot and ill-fitting gray tunic and that every vista always would be it take a new kind of gun or a automobile with a steel prow for charge through barbed-wire entanglement or a group of bedraggled belgian prisoner slouch by under convoy to make we give the spectacle more than a pass glance there be something hypnotic something tremendously wearisome to the mind in those thick line flow sluggishly along in stream like molten lead in the hedge of gun barrel all slant at the same angle in the same type of face repeat and repeat countlessly in the leg which scissor by in such faultless unison and at each clip of each pair of live shears cut off just so much of the road -- never any more and never any less but always just exactly so much we jaded and satiated fancy have be feed on soldier and all the cumbersome pageantry of war until they refuse to be quicken by what half a week before would have set every nerve tingle almost the only thing that stand out distinct in my memory from the confused recollection of the last morning spend in louvain be a huge sight - see car -- of the sort know at home as a rubberneck wagon -- which lumber by we with red cross man perch like roost gray bird on all its seat we estimate we see two hundred thousand man in motion through the ancient town we learn afterward we have under-figured the total by at least a third during these day the life of louvain go on so far as we alien eye could judge pretty much as it probably do in the peace time precede at night obey a order the people stay within they door in the daylight hour they pursue they customary business not greatly incommode apparently by the presence of the conqueror if there be simmer hate in the heart of the man and woman of louvain it do not betray itself in they sober face i see a soldier somewhat fuddled seize a serve maid about the waist and kiss she he receive a slap in the face and fall back in bad order while he mate cheer the spunky girl a minute later she emerge from the house to which she have retreat seemingly ready to swap slap for kiss some more however from time to time sinister suggestion do obtrude themselves on we for example on the second morning of we enforced stay at the house of the thousand column we watch a double file of soldier go through a street toward the palais de justice two roughly clad native walk between the line of bared bayonet one be a old man who walk proudly with he head erect he be like a man go to a feast the other be bent almost double and he hand be tie behind he back a few minute afterward a bar yellow van under escort come through the square front the railroad station and disappear behind a mass of low building from that direction we presently hear shot soon the van come back unescorted this time and behind it come belgian with red cross arm badge bear on they shoulder two litter on which be still figure cover with blanket so that only the stockinged foot show twice thereafter this play be repeat with slight variation and each time we american look on from we front window draw we own conclusion also from the same vantage point we see a automobile pass bear a couple of german officer and a little scared-looking man in a frock coat and a high hat whose black mustache stand out like a charcoal mark against the very white background of he face this little man we learn be the burgomaster and this day he be be hold a prisoner and responsible for the good conduct of some fifty-odd thousand of he fellow citizen that night we host a gross silent man in carpet slipper tell we the burgomaster be ill in bed at home he suffer explain we landlord in french from a crisis of the nerve the french language be a expressive language then come a pace nearer we landlord add a question in a cautious whisper monsieur he ask do you think it can be true as my neighbor tell I that the united state president have order the german to get out of we country we shake we head and he go silently away in he carpet slipper and he broad flemish face give no hint of what corrosive thought he may have have in he heart it be Wednesday morning when we enter louvain it be Saturday morning when we leave it this last undertaking be precede by difficulty as a preliminary to it we visit in turn all the stable in louvain where ordinarily horse and wheel vehicle could be have for hire perhaps there be no horse leave in the stall -- thanks to either belgian forager or to german -- or if there be horse no driver would risk he hide on the open road among the german pack train and rear guard at length we do find a tall red-haired walloon who say he would go anywhere on earth and provide a team for the go if we pay the price he ask we pay it in advance in case anything should happen on the way and he take we in a venerable open carriage behind two crow-bait skeleton that have once in a happier day when hay be cheaper be horse we drive slowly take the middle of the wide brussels road on we right travel in the same direction crawl a unending line of german baggage wagon and pontoon truck on we left go the opposite way be another line also unending make up of refugee villager return afoot to the town beyond louvain from which they have flee four day earlier they be footsore and they limp they be of all age and most miserable-looking and one and all they be as tongueless as so many ghost thus we travel and at the end of the first hour come to the tiny town of leefdael at leefdael there must have be fight for some of the house be gut by shell at least two have be burn and a big tin sign at a railroad cross have become a tin colander where fly lead have sieve it in a beet patch beside one of the house be a mound of fresh earth the length of a long man with a cross of stick at the head of it a belgian soldier 's cap be perch on the upright and a scrap of paper be make fast to the cross arm and two peasant stand there apparently read what be write on the paper later such sight as these be to become almost the commonest incident of we countryside campaigning but now we look with all we eye except that the roadside ditch be litter with beer bottle and scrap of paper and the road itself rut by cannon wheel we see little enough after leave leefdael to suggest that a army have come this way until we be in the outskirts of brussels in a tree-edged grass-plotted boulevard at the edge of the boi toward tervueren cavalry have halt the turf be scar with hoofprint and strew with hay and there be a row of small trench in which the german have build they fire to do they cooking the sod which have be remove to make these trench be pile in neat little terrace ready to be put back and care plainly have be take by the trooper to avoid damage the bark on the trunk of the ash and elm tree there it be -- the german system of warfare these german might carry on they war after the most scientifically deadly plan the world have ever know they might deal out they peculiarly fatal brand of drumhead justice to all civilian who cross they path bear arm they might burn and waste for punishment they might lay on a capture city and a whip province a tribute of foodstuff and a indemnity of money heavier than any civilized race have ever demand of the cow and conquer -- might do all these thing and more besides -- but they common trooper save the sod of the greensward for replant and spare the bole of the young shade tree next day we again leave brussels the submissive and make a much longer excursion under german auspices and at length after much travail we land in the german frontier city of aix-la-chapelle where i write these line there it be two day after we arrival that we hear of the fate of louvain and of that pale little man the burgomaster who have survive he crisis of the nerve to die of a german bullet we wonder what become of the proprietor of the house of the thousand column and of the young dutch tutor in the berlitz school of language who have serve we as a guide and interpreter and of the pretty gentle little flemish woman who bring we we meal in she clean small restaurant round the corner from the hotel de ville and of the kindly red-bearded priest at the church of saint jacque who give we ripe pear and old wine i reckon we shall always wonder what become of they and that we shall never know i hope mightily that the american wing of the big catholic seminary have be spare it have a stone figure of a american indian -- look something like sit bull we think -- over its door and that be the only typically american thing we see in all louvain when next i see louvain the university be go and the stone indian be go too chapter 5 be a guest of the kaiser you know how four of we blunder into the german line in a taxicab and how get out of german hand after three day and back to brussels we undertake in less than twenty-four hour thereafter to trail the main force then shove steadily southward with no other goal before they but paris first by hire hack as we use to say when write account of funeral down in paducah then afoot through the dust and finally with a equipment consist of that butcher 's superannuated dogcart that elderly mare emeritus and those two bicycle we make we zigzag way downward through belgium we know that we credentials be for german purpose of most dubious and uncertain value we know that the german be permit no correspondent -- not even german correspondent -- to accompany they we know that any alien catch in the german front be liable to death on the spot without investigation of he motive we know all these thing and the knowledge of they give a fellow tingling sensation in the tip of he toe when he permit himself to think about he situation but after the first few hour we take heart unto ourselves for everywhere we meet only kindness and courtesy at the hand of the kaiser 's soldier man and officer alike there be it be true the single small instance of the excited noncom who poke a large unwholesome-looking automatic pistol into my shrink diaphragm when he want I to get off the run board of a military automobile into which i have climb half a minute before by invitation of the private who steer it i gather he meaning right away even though he utter only guttural german and that at the top of he voice a pointed revolver speak with a tongue which be understand by all people besides he have the distinct advantage in repartee and so with no extended argument i get down from there and he pouch he ironmongery i regard the incident as be close and be perfectly willing that it should remain closed that however though of consuming interest to I at the moment be but a detail -- a exception to prove the standing rule one place we dine with a rittmeister 's mess and while we sit eating of they midday ration of thick pea soup with sliced sausage in it some of the younger officer stand also they let we stretch we wearied leg on they mattress which be range seven in a row on the parlor floor of a belgian house where from a corner a plaster statue of joan of arc gaze at we with she plaster eye common soldier offer repeatedly to share they rye-bread sandwich and bottled beer with we not once but a dozen time officer of various rank let we look at they map and use they field glass and they give we advice for reach the zone of actual fighting and swap gossip with we and frequently regret that they have no spare mount or spare automobile to loan we we attribute a good deal of this to the inherent kindliness of the german gentleman 's nature but more of it we attribute to a newborn desire on the part of these man to have disinterested journalist see with they own eye the scope and result of the german operation in the hope that the truth regard allege german atrocity might reach the outside world and particularly might reach america of the waste and wreckage of war of desolated home and shatter village of the ruthless relentless punitive exactness with which the german punish not only those civilian they accuse of firing on they but those they suspect of give harbor or aid to the offender of widow and orphan of family of innocent sufferer without a roof to shelter they or a bite to stay they of fair land plow by cannon ball and harrow with rifle bullet and sow with dead man 's bone of man horribly maim and mangled by lead and steel of long mud trench where the kill lay thick under the fresh clod -- of all this and more i see enough to cure any man of the delusion that war be a beautiful glorious inspiring thing and to make he know it for what it be -- altogether hideous and unutterably awful as for uhlan spear baby on they lance and officer saber they own man and soldier murder and mutilate and torture at will -- i see nothing i know of these tale only from have read they in the dispatch send from the continent to england and from there cable to american papers even so i hold no brief for the german or for the reason that inspire they in wage this war or for the fashion after which they have wage it i be only try to tell what i see with my own eye and hear with my own ear be all that as it may we straggle into beaumont -- five of we -- on the evening of the third day out from brussels without baggage or equipment bar only what we wear on we several tired and drooping back as in the case of we other trip a simple sight-seeing ride have resolve itself into a expeditionary campaign and so there we be bear as proof of we good faith and professional intention only we american passport we pass issue by general von jarotzky at brussels and -- most potent of all for win confidence from the casual eye -- a little fray silk american flag with a hole burn in it by a careless cigar butt which be knot to the front rail of we creak dogcart immediately after pass the ruin and desert village of montigny st christophe we come at dusk to a place where a company of german infantryman be in camp about a big graystone farmhouse they be cooking supper over big trench fire and as usual they be sing the light shone up into the face of the cook bring out in ruddy relief they florid skin and yellow beard a yearling bull calf be tie to a supply-wagon wheel bellow he indignation i imagine he quit bellow shortly thereafter a officer come to the edge of the road and peer sharply at we over a broken hedge make as if to stop we then change he mind and permit we to go unchallenged enter the town we proceed wind we way among pack train and stall motor truck to the town square we little cavalcade halt to the accompaniment of good - natured tittering from many officer in front of the town house of the prince de caraman-chimay by a few american the prince be remember as have be the cousin of one of the husband of the much-married clara ward of detroit but at this moment though absent he have particularly endear himself to the german through the circumstance of he have leave behind in he wine cellar twenty thousand bottle of rare vintage wine i believe be contraband of war certainly in this instance it be as we speedily discover it be a very unlucky common soldier who do not have a swig of rare burgundy or ancient claret to wash down he black bread and sausage that night at supper unwittingly we have bump into the headquarters of the whole army -- not of a single corps but of a army in the thicken twilight on the little square gorgeous staff officer come and go afoot on horseback and in automobile and through a open window we catch a glimpse of a splendid-looking general sit boot and sword-belt at a table in the prince de caraman-chimay 's library with hunting trophy -- skin and horn and claw -- look down at he from the high-paneled oak wainscoting and spick-and-span aide wait to take he order and discharge he commission it dawn on we that have accidentally slip through a hole in the german rear guard we have reach a point close to the front of operation we feel uncomfortable it be not at all likely that a herr over-commander would expedite we with the graciousness that have mark he underling back along the line of communication we remark as much to one another and it be a true prophecy a staff officer -- a colonel who speak good english -- receive we at the door of the villa and examine we papers in the light which stream over he shoulder from a fine big hallway behind he in everything both then and thereafter he be most polite i do not understand how you come here you gentleman he say at length we have no correspondent with we army you have now say one of we seek to brighten the grow embarrassment of the situation with a small jape perhaps he do not understand perhaps it be against the regulation for a colonel in full caparison of sword and shoulder strap to laugh at a joke from a dusty wayworn shabby stranger in a dented straw hat and a wrinkled yankee-made coat at any rate this colonel do not laugh you do quite right to report yourselve here and explain you purpose he continue gravely but it be impossible that you may proceed to-morrow morning we shall give you escort and transportation back to brussels i anticipate -- here he glance quizzically at we aged mare droop knee-sprung between the shaft of the lopsided dogcart -- i anticipate that you will return more speedily than you arrive you will kindly report to I here in the morning at eleven meantime remember gentleman that you be not prisoner -- by no mean not you may consider yourselve for the time be as -- shall we say -- guest of the german army temporarily detain you be at perfect liberty to come and go -- only i should advise you not to go too far because if you should try to leave town tonight we soldier would certainly shoot you quite dead it be not agreeable to be shoot and besides you great government might object so then i shall have the pleasure of see you in the morning shall i not yes good night gentleman he click he neat heel so that he spur jangled and bow we out into the dark the question of secure lodgings loom large and imminent before we officer fill the few small inn and hotel soldier as we could see be quarter thickly in all the house in sight and already the inhabitant be lock they door and douse they light in accordance with a order from a source that be not to be disobey nine out of ten house about the square be now but black oblong rise against the gray sky we have nowhere to go and yet if we do not go somewhere and that pretty soon the patrol would undoubtedly take unpleasant cognizance of we presence besides the search chill of a belgian night be make we stiff scout up a narrow wind alley one of the party who speak german find a courtyard behind a schoolhouse call imposingly l'ecole moyenne de beaumont where he obtain permission from a german sergeant to stable we mare for the night in the aristocratic companionship of a troop of officer ' horse through another streak of luck we preempt a room in the schoolhouse and hold it against all comer by right of squatter sovereignty there my friend and i sleep on the stone floor with a scanty amount of hay under we for a bed and we coat for coverlet but before we sleep we dine we dine on hard-boiled egg and stale cheese -- which we have save from midday -- in a big bare study hall half full of lancer they give we rye bread and some of the prince de caraman-chimay 's wine to go with the provender we have bring and they make room for we at the long bench that run lengthwise of the room afterward one of they -- a master musician for all he soil gray uniform and grimed finger -- play a piano that be in the corner while all the rest sing it be a strange picture they make there on the wall on a row of hook still hang the small umbrella and book-satchel of the pupil presumably at the come of the german they have run home in such a panic that they leave they school-trap behind there be sum in chalk half erase on the blackboard and one of the trooper take a scrap of chalk and write on to pari in big letter here and there a sleepy parrot look like a bundle of rumpled green feather squat on its perch in a cage behind the master 's desk occasionally emit a loud squawk as though protest against this intrusion on its privacy when they wine have warm they we soldier-host sing and sing unendingly they have be on the march all day and next day would probably march half the day and fight the other half for the french and english be just ahead but now they sprawl over the school bench and drum on the board with they fist and foot and sing at the top of they voice they sing they favorite march song -- die wacht be rhein of course and deutschland deutschland uber alle which have a fine sonorous cathedral swing to it and god save the king -- with different word to the air be it say and haltet aus also for variety they sing tannenbaum -- with the same tune as maryland my maryland -- and heil dir im sieges-kranz and snatch from various opera when one of we ask for heine 's loreleus they sing not one verse of it or two but twenty or more and then by way of compliment to the guest of the evening they rear upon they foot and give we the star spangled banner to german word suddenly two of they begin dance in they big rawhide boot with hobbed sole and steel-shod heel they pound back and forth while the other whoop they on one of the dancer give out presently but the other seem still unimpaired in wind and limb he dart into a adjoining room and come back in a minute drag a half-frightened half-pleased little belgian scullery maid and whirl she about to waltz music until she drop for want of breath to carry she another turn after which he do a solo -- teutonic version -- of a darky breakdown stop only to join in the next song it be eleven o'clock and they be still singing when we leave they and go grope through dark hallway to where we simple hay mattress await we i might add that we be indebted to a corporal of lancer for the hay which he pilfer from the feed rack outside after somebody have steal the two bundle of straw one of we have previously purchase except for he charity of heart we should have lie on the cold flagging the next morning be Thursday morning and by Thursday night at the very latest we count on be back in brussels but we be not destine to see brussels again for nearly six week we breakfast frugally on good bread and execrable coffee at a half-wrecked little café where soldier have sleep and at eleven o'clock when we have bestow bulotte the ancient nag and the dogcart on a accommodate youth -- give they to he as a gracious gift since neither he nor anyone else would buy the outfit at any price -- we repair to the villa to report ourselves and start on we return to the place whence we have come so laboriously the commander and he staff be just leave and they be in a big hurry we know the reason for they hurry for since daylight the sound of heavy firing to the south and southwest across the border in the neighborhood of maubeuge have be plainly audible officer in long gray overcoat with facing of blue green black yellow and four shades of red -- depend on the branch of the service to which they belong -- be pile into automobile and scoot away as we sit on a wooden bench before the prince 's villa wait for further instruction from we friend of the night before -- meaning by that the colonel who could not take a joke but could make one of he own -- a tall slender young man of about twenty-four with a little silky mustache and a long vulpine nose come stride across the square with long step as nearly as we could tell he wear a colonel 's shoulder strap and aside from the fact that he seem exceedingly youthful to be a colonel we be astonish at the deference that be pay he by those of higher rank who stand about wait for they car general and the like even grizzled old general with breast full of decoration bow and click before he and when he smile broadly insist on shake hand with all of they some of the group seem overcome with gratification presently a sort of family resemblance in he face to some one whose picture we have see often somewhere begin to impress itself on we and we wonder who he be but be rather out of the setting ourselves none of we care to ask two week later in aix-la-chapelle i be pass a shop and see he likeness in full uniform on a souvenir postcard in the window it be prince August wilhelm fourth son of the kaiser and we have see he as he be about get he first taste of be under fire by the enemy pretty soon he be go and we colonel be go and nearly everybody else be go too company of infantry and cavalry fall in and move off and a belated battery of field artillery rumble out of sight up the twist main street the field postoffice staff the field telegraph staff the red cross corps and the wagon train follow in due turn leave behind only a small squad to hold the town -- and we a tall young lieutenant be in charge of the handful who remain and by the same token as be to transpire he be also in charge of we he be build for a football player and he have shoulder like a cyclops and he family name be mittendorfer he never speak to he man except to roar at they like a rage lion and he never address we except to coo as softly as the mourning dive it be interesting to listen as he voice change from a bellow to a croon and back again a moment later to a bellow with training he might have make a opera singer -- he have such a vocal range and such perfect control over it this lieutenant mittendorfer introduce himself to we attention by come smartly up and say there have be a delay about requisition a automobile for we use but he think the car would be along very shortly -- and would the american gentleman be so good as to wait there be nothing else to do we decide to do as he suggest we choose for we place of wait a row of seat before a taverne and there we sit side by side keep count of the gun boom in the distance until it begin to rain a sergeant come up then and invite we to go with he in order that we might escape a wet he wave we into the doorway of a house two door from where we have be sit at the same time suggest to we that we throw away we cigar and cigarette when we cross the threshold we realize the good intention behind this advice see that the room we enter which have be a shop of sort be now a improvise powder magazine from the floor to the height of a man it be pile with explosive shell for field gun case in straw cover like wine bottle and stack in neat row with they nose all point one way we guide lead we along a aisle of these deadly thing beckon we through another doorway at the side where a sentry stand with a bayonet fix on he gun and with a wave of he hand invite we to partake of the hospitality of the place we look about we and lo we be hard - and-fast in jail i have be in pleasanter indoor retreat in my time even on rainy afternoon the room be bed down ankle-deep in straw and the straw which have probably be fresh the day before already give off a strong musky odor -- the smell of a animal cage in a zoo for furnishings the place contain a bench and a large iron pot contain a meat stew which have now go cold so that a rime of gray suet coat the upper half of the pot but of human occupant there be a ample sufficiency consider the cubic space available for breathe purpose sit in melancholy array against the wall with they leg half bury in the straw and they back against the baseboard be eighteen prisoner -- two belgian cavalryman and sixteen frenchman -- mostly zouave and chasseurs-a-pied also there be three turco from northern africa almost as dark as negro wear red fez and soil white baggy skirtlike arrangement instead of trousers they all look very dirty very unhappy and very sleepy at the far side of the room on a bench be another group of four prisoner and of these we know two personally -- gerbeaux a frenchman who live in brussels and serve as the resident brussels correspondent of a chicago paper and steven a american artist originally from michigan but who for several year have divide he time between paris and brussels with they be a belgian photographer scare now into a quiver heap from which two wall-eye peer out wildly and a negro chauffeur a soot-black congo boy who have be bring away from africa on a training ship as a child he apparently be the least-concerned person in that hole the night before by chance we have hear that gerbeaux and steven be under detention but until this moment of meeting we do not know they exact whereabouts they -- the frenchman the american and the belgian -- have start out from brussels in a auto drive by the african on Monday just a day behind we because they car carry a red cross flag without authority to do so and because they have a camera with they they very soon find themselves under arrest and what be worse under suspicion except that for two day they have be march afoot a average of twenty-five mile a day they have fare pretty well bar steven he be separate from the other have fall into the hand of a officer who treat he with such severity that the account of he experience make a tale worth recount separately and at length we stay in that place half a hour -- one of the longest half hour i remember there be a soldier with a fix bayonet at the door and another soldier with a saw-edged bayonet at the window which be break party of soldier keep come to this window to peer at the exhibit within and as they invariably take the civilian for englishman who have be catch as spy we attract almost as much attention as the turco in they funny ballet skirt in fact i may say we fairly divide the center of the stage with the turco at the end of half a hour the lieutenant bustle in all apology to say there have be a mistake and that we should never have be put in with the prisoner at all the rain be over he invite we to come outside and get a change of air when we get outside we find that we two bicycle which we have leave lean against the curb be go to date they be still go again we sit wait finally it occur to we to go inside the little taverne where perhaps we should be less conspicuous we go in and presently we be follow by lieutenant mittendorfer he bring with he a tall young top-sergeant of infantry who carry he left arm in a sling and have a three week ' growth of fuzzy red beard on he chop it be explain that this top-sergeant rosenthal by name have be especially assign to be we companion -- we playfellow as it be -- until such time as the long-delayed automobile should appear sergeant rosenthal who be very proud of he punctured wrist and very hopeful of get a promotion go out soon but it speedily become evident that he have not forget we for one soldier with he gun appear in the front room of the place and another materialize just outside the door likewise with he gun and by certain other unmistakable sign it become plain to we perception that as between be a prisoner of the german army and be a guest there be really no great amount of difference it would have take a mathematician to draw the distinction so fine it be we stay in that taverne and in the small living room behind it and in the small high-walled courtyard behind the living room all that afternoon and that evening and that night be visit at interval by either the lieutenant or the sergeant or both of they at once we dine lightly on soldier ' bread and some of the prince 's wine -- furnish by rosenthal -- and for dessert we have some shell almond and half a cake of chocolate -- furnish by ourselves also drink of pale native brandy from the bar during the evening we receive several bulletin regard the mythical automobile invariably mittendorfer be desolate to be compel to report that there have be another slight delay we know he be desolate because he say he be during the evening also we meet all the regular member of the household living under that much-disturbed roof there be the husband a big lubberly fleming who apparently do not count for much in the economic and domestic scheme of the establishment he wife a large commanding woman who run the business and the house as well he wife 's mother a old sickly woman in she seventy and he wife 's sister a poor palsied half-wit when the sister be a child so we hear she have be terribly frighten so that to this day still frightened she creep about a pale shadow quiver all over pitiably at every sound she would stand behind a door for minute shake so that you could hear she knuckle knock against the wall she seem particularly to dread the sight of the german private who come and go and they see this be kind to she in a clumsy awkward way hourly like a ghost she drift in and out for a while it look as though we should spend the night sit up in chair but about ten o'clock three soldier lead by rosenthal and accompany by the landlady go out and when they come back they bring some thick feather mattress which have be commandeer from neighbor house we judge also through the goodness of he heart mittendorfer who impress we more and more as a strange compound of severity and softness take pity on gerbeaux and steven and bring they forth from that pestilential hole next door he convoy they in to stay overnight with we they tell we that by now the air in the improvise prison be absolutely suffocating what with the closeness the foul straw the stale food and the proximity of so many dirty human body all pack into the kennel together ten of we sleep on the floor of that little grogshop -- the five of we party lie spoon-fashion on two mattress gerbeaux and steven make seven and three soldier the soldier relieved each other in two-hour spell so that while two of they snore by the door the third sit in a chair in the middle of the room with he rifle between he knee and a shaded lamp and a clock on a table at he elbow just before we turn in rosenthal who have adopt a paternal tone to the three guard each of whom be many year older than he address they softly say : now my child make yourselve comfortable drink what you please but if any one of you get drunk i shall take pleasure in see that he get from seven to nine year in prison at hard labor for which they thank he gratefully in chorus i be not addict to the diary-keeping habit but during the next day which be Friday i make fragmentary record of thing in a journal from which i now quote verbatim : seven-thirty a m -- about after make a brief toilet by souse we several face in a pail of water we have just breakfast -- sketchily -- on wine and almond it would seem that the german army feed its prisoner but make no such provision for its guest on the whole i think i should prefer be a prisoner we have offer we landlady any amount within reason for a pot of coffee and some toast bread but she protest call on heaven to witness the truth of she word that there be nothing to eat in the house -- that the german have eat up all she store of food and that she old mother be already begin to starve yet certain appetizing smell which come down the staircase from upstairs when the door be open lead I to believe she be deceive we i do not blame she for treasure what she have for she own flesh and blood but i certainly could enjoy a couple of fried egg nine a m mittendorfer have be in with vague remark concern we automobile something warn I this young man be trifle with we he appear to be a practitioner of the japanese school of diplomacy -- that be he believe it be better to pile one gentle transparent fiction on another until the pyramid of romance fall of its own weight rather than to break the cruel news at a single blow eleven-twenty one of the soldier have bring we half a dozen bottle of good wine -- three bottle of red and three of white -- but the larder remain empty i do not know exactly what a larder be but if it be as empty as i be at the present moment it must remind itself of a haunt house eleven-forty a big van full of wounded german have arrive from the window we can see it distinctly the more seriously hurt lie on the bed of the wagon under the hood the man who drive have one leg in splint and of the two who sit at the tail gate hold rifle upright one have a bandaged head and the other have a arm in a sling unless a german be so seriously cripple as to be entirely unfitted for service he manage to do something useful there be no loose end and no waste to the german military system i can see that the soldier in the street cheer the wound as they pass and the wounded answer by singing die wacht be rhein feebly one poor chap raise he head and look out he appear to be almost spend but i see he lip move as he try to sing you may not care for the german cause but you be bind to admire the german spirit -- the german oneness of purpose noon as the texa darky say : dinnertime fur some folk but just twelve o'clock fur I again i smell something cooking upstairs on the mantel of the shabby little interior sit room where we spend most of we time sit about in a sad circle be a little black-and - tan terrier pup stuff and mount with shiny glass eye -- a family pet i take it which die and be immortalize by the local taxidermist if i only know what that dog be stuff with i would take a chance and eat he i have a fellow feeling for arctic explorer who go north and keep on go until they run out of thing to eat i admire they heroism and sympathize with they suffering but i deplore they bad judgment there be grape grow on trellis in the little courtyard at the back but they be too green for human consumption i speak authoritatively on this subject have just sample one two pm try to take a nap but fail hansen find a soil deck of card behind a pile of book on the mantelpiece and we all cheer up thinking of poker but it be a belgian deck of thirty-two card all the pip below the seven-spot be eliminate poker with that deck would be a hazardous pursuit mccutcheon remark casually that he wonder what would happen if somebody accidentally touch off those field-gun shell in the house two door away we suddenly remember that they be all point we way the conversation seem to lull and mac for the time be lose popularity two-thirty pm look out on the dreary little square of this town of beaumont i note that the native who have be scarce enough all day have now vanish almost entirely whereas soldier be noticeably more numerous than they be this morning three-fifteen pm hear a big noise in the street and run to the window in time to see about forty english prisoner pass under guard -- the first english soldier i have see in this campaign either as prisoner or otherwise they tan khaki uniform and flat cap give they a soldierly look very unlike the slovenly sloppy-appearing french prisoner in the guardhouse but they appear to be tremendously downcast the german soldier crowd up to stare at they but there be no jeering or taunt from the german these prisoner be all infantryman judge by they uniform they disappear through the gateway of the prince 's park three-forty i have just have some exercise walk from the front door to the courtyard and back there be two guard outside the door now instead of one the german army certainly take mighty good care of its guest this day have be as long as gibbon 's decline and fall and much more tiresome no i 'll take that back it be not strong enough this day have be as long as the entire christian era four pm gerbeaux who be allow to go out forage under escort of a guard have return with a rope of dry onion a can of alphabet noodle half a pound of stale crumbly macaroon a few fresh string bean a pot of strained honey and several clean collar of assorted size the woman of the-house be now make soup for we out of the bean the onion and the noodle she have also produce a little grated parmesan cheese from somewhere four-twenty pm that be the best soup i ever taste even if it be full of typographical error from the jumble together of the little alphabet noodle still nobody but a proofreader could have find fault with that there be only one trouble with that soup : there be not enough of it -- just one bowl apiece i would have trade the finest case of vintage wine in the chimay vault for another bowl just as the woman bring in the soup mittendorfer appear escort a french lieutenant who be take prisoner this morning the prisoner be a little handsome dapper chap not over twenty-two year old wear he trim blue-and-red uniform with a air even though he himself look thoroughly miserable we be warn not to speak with he or he with we but gerbeaux after listen to he exchange a few word with the lieutenant say he judge from he accent that the little officer be from the south of france we silently offer he a bowl of the soup as he sit in a corner fence off from the rest of we by a small table but he barely taste it and after a bit he lay down in he corner with he arm for a pillow and almost instantly be asleep breathing heavily like a man on the verge of exhaustion a few minute later we hear from sergeant rosenthal that the prisoner 's brother-in-law have be kill the day before and that he -- the little officer -- have see the brother-in-law fall five pm we have have good news -- two chunk of good news in fact we be to dine and we be to travel the sergeant have acquire from unknown source a brace of small skinny fresh-killed pullet eight fresh egg a big loaf of the soggy rye bread of the field mess and wine unlimited also we be tell that at nine o'clock we be to start for brussels -- not by automobile but aboard a train carry wound and prisoner northward everybody cheer up especially after ma-dame promise to have the fowl and the egg ready in less than a hour the belgian photographer who it develop be to go with we troop have be bring in from the guardhouse and place with we with the pass hour he fright have increase gerbeaux say the poor devil be one of the lead photographer of brussels -- that by royal appointment he take picture of the queen and she child but the queen would have trouble in recognize she photographer if she could see he now -- with straw in he tousled hair and he jaw loll under the weight of he terror and he big wild eye stare this way and that nothing that gerbeaux can say to he will dissuade he from the belief that the german mean to shoot he i almost forget to detail a thing that occur a few minute ago just before the belgian join we mittendorfer bring a message for the little french lieutenant the frenchman rouse up and after they have salute each other ceremoniously mittendorfer tell he he have come to invite he to dine with a mess of german officer across the way in the town hall on the way out he stop to speak with sergeant rosenthal who have furnish the provender for the forthcoming feast be now wait to share in it use german the lieutenant say : i be be keep pretty busy two citizen of this town have just be sentence to be shoot and i have order to go and attend to the shooting before it get too dark for the firing squad to see to aim rosenthal do not ask of what crime the condemn two have be convict you have charge of another execution this morning do not you he say yes answer the lieutenant a couple -- man and wife the man be seventy-four year old and the woman be seventy-two it be prove against they that they put poison sugar in the coffee for some of we soldier you hear about the case do not you i hear something about it say rosenthal that be all they say after three week of war a tragedy like this have become commonplace not only to these soldier but to we already all of we combatant and onlooker alike have see so many horror that one more produce no shock in we mind it will take a wholesale killing to excite we these minor incident no longer count with we if i write all day i do not believe i could make the meaning of war in its effect on the mind of those who view it at close hand any clearer i shall not try six-fifteen pm we have dine the omelet be a very small omelet and two skinny pullet do not go far among nine hungry man still we have dine my journal break off with this entry it break off because immediately after dinner word come that we train be ready a few minute before we leave the taverne for the station to start on a trip that be to last two day instead of three hour and land we not in brussels but on german soil in aix-la-chapelle two incident happen which afterward in look back on the experience i have find most firmly clinch in my memory : a german captain come into the place to get a drink he recognize I as a american and hail I and want to know my business and whether i could give he any news from the outside world i remark on the perfection of he english i suppose i come by it naturally he say i call myself a german but i be bear in nashville tennessee and partly rear in new jersey and educate at princeton and at this moment i be a member of the new york cotton exchange right after this three belgian peasant all half-grown boy be bring in they have run away from they home at the come of the german and for three day have be hide in thicket without food until finally hunger and cold have drive they in all of they be in sorry case and one be in collapse he tremble so he whole body shake like jelly the landlady give he some brandy but the burning stuff choke he throat until it close and the brandy run out of he quiver blue lip and spill on he chin see this a husky german private who look as though in private life he might be a piano mover bring out of he blanket roll a bottle of white wine and hold the scared exhaust lad against he chest minister to he with all gentleness and give he sip of the wine in the line of duty i suppose he would have shoot that boy with the same cheerful readiness just as we be file out into the dark sergeant rosenthal who be also go along halt we and remind we all and severally that we be not prisoner but still guest and that though we be to march with the prisoner to the station we be to go in line with the guard and if any prisoner seek to escape it be hope that we would aid in recapture the runaway so we promise he each on he word of honor that we would do this and he insist that we should shake hand with he as a pledge and as a token of mutual confidence which we accordingly do altogether it be quite a impressive little ceremonial -- and rather dramatic i imagine as he leave we however he be hear speak in german to say sotto voce to one of the guard : if one of those journalist try to slip away do not take any chance -- shoot he at once it be so easy to keep one 's honor intact when you have moral support in the shape of a earnest-minded german soldier with a gun step along six foot behind you my honor be never safer chapter 6 with the german wreck crew when we come out of the little taverne at beaumont to start -- as we fondly suppose -- for brussels it be pitch dark in the square of the forlorn little town with we the polite and pleasant fiction that we be guest of the german authority have already worn seedy not to say threadbare but lieutenant mittendorfer persist in keep the little romance alive for as you remember we have be request -- request mind you and not order -- to march to the station with the armed escort that would be in charge of the prisoner of war and it have be impress upon we that we be to assist in guard the convoy although no one of we have any more deadly weapon in he possession than a fountain pen and finally accord to we instruction if any prisoner attempt to escape in the dark we be to lay detain hand upon he and hold he fast this be all very flattering and very indicative of the esteem in which the military authority of beaumont seem to hold we but we be not puff up with a sense of we new responsibility also we be as a unit in agree that under no provocation would we yield to temptation to embark on any side-excursion upon the way to the railroad personally i know that i be particularly firm upon this point i would defy that column to move so fast that i could not keep up with it in the black gloom we could make out a longish clump of man who stand four abreast scuffle they foot upon the miry wet stone of the square these be the prisoner -- one hundred and fifty frenchman and turco eighty englishman and eight belgian from they as we draw near a odor of wet unwashed animal arise it be as rank and raw as fume from crude ammonia then in the town house of the prince de caraman-chimay just alongside the double door open and the light streaming out fall upon the naked bayonet over the shoulder of the sentry and make they look like slanting line of rain there be eight of we by now in the party of guest we original group of five have be swollen by the addition of three other -- the frenchman gerbeaux the american artist steven and the belgian court - photographer hennebert who have be under arrest for five day we eight obey instruction -- no request -- find place for ourselves in the double file of guard four go one side of the column and four the other i slip into a gap on the left flank alongside four of the english soldier the guard immediately behind I be a man i know he have be on duty the afternoon previous in the place where we be be keep and he have be oblige enough to let I exercise my few word of german upon he he grin now in recognition and humorously pat the stock of he rifle -- this last i take it be he effort to convey to my understanding that he be under order to shoot I in the event of my seek to play truant during the next hour or so he do not know I -- wild horse could not have drag we apart a considerable wait ensue officer come back from the day 's battle line in automobile jump out of they car and press up bedraggled and wet through from the rain which have be fall to have a look at the prisoner common soldier appear also of these latter many i judge have newly arrive at the front and have never see any capture enemy before they be particularly interested in the englishman who as nearly as i could tell endure the scrutinize pretty well whereas the frenchman grow uneasy and self-conscious under it we who be in civilian dress -- and pretty shabby civilian dress at that -- come in for we share of examination too the sentry be keep busy explain to newcomer that we be not spy go north for trial there be little or no jeering at the prisoner lieutenant mittendorfer appear to feel the burden of he authority mightily he importance express itself in many bellow command to he man as he pass the door of headquarters boom like a prussian night-bittern one of the officer there check he with a gesture why all the noise herr lieutenant he say pleasantly in german can not this thing be do more quietly the young man take the hint and when he climb upon a bench outside the wine-shop door he voice be much milder as he admonish the prisoner that they would be treat with due honor of war if they obey they warder promptly during the come journey but that the least sign of rebellion among they would mean but one thing -- immediate death since he speak in german a young french lieutenant translate the warning for the benefit of the frenchman and the belgian and a british noncom do the same for he fellow countryman speak with a strong scottish burr he wind up with a improvisation of he own which i thought be typically british now then boy he sing out buck up all of you it might be worse you know and some of these german chap do not seem a bad lot at all so with that lieutenant mittendorfer blow out he big chest and bark a order into the night and away we all swing off at a double quick with we foot slip and slide upon the travel-worn granite boulder underfoot in addition to be round and unevenly lay the stone be now coat with a layer of slimy mud it be a hard job to stay upright on they i do not think i shall ever forget that march i know i shall never forget that smell or the sound of all we foot clump over those slick cobble nor shall i forget either the appealing call of gerbeaux ' black chauffeur who be be leave behind in the now empty guardhouse and who to judge from he tone do not expect ever to see any of we again as a matter of fact i run across he two week later in liege he have just be release and be try to make he way back to brussels the way ahead of we be inky black the outline of the tall belgian house on either side of the narrow street be barely visible for there be no light in the window at all and only dim candle or oil lamp in the lower floor no native show themselves i do not recollect that in all that mile-long tramp i see a single belgian civilian -- only soldier shove forward curiously as we pass and press the file closer in together through one street we go and into another which if anything be even narrower and blacker than the first and presently we could tell by the feel of thing under we foot that we have quit the paved road and be traverse soft earth we enter railway siding stumble over the track and at the far end of the yard emerge into a sudden glare of brightness and draw up alongside a string of car after the darkness the flare brilliancy make we blink and then it make we wonder there should be any light at all see that the french troops in retire from beaumont four day before have do they hurry best to cripple the transportation facility and have certainly put the local gas plant out of commission yet here be illumination in plenty and to spare at once the phenomenon stand explain two day after secure this end of the line the german engineer have repair the torn-up right-of-way and install a complete acetylene outfit and already they be dispatch train of troops and munitions clear across southeastern belgium to and from the german frontier when we hear this we quit marvel we have by now cease to wonder at the lightning rapidity and un-human efficiency of the german military system in the field under the sizzle acetylene torch we have we first good look at these prospective fellow-traveler of ours who be avowedly prisoner consider in the aggregate they be not a inspiring spectacle a soldier strip of he arm and hold by he foe become of a sudden a pitiable almost a contemptible object you think instinctively of a adder that have lose its fang or of a wild cat that be shear of tooth to bite with and claw to tear with be now a more helpless more impotent thing than if it have be create without tooth and claw in the first place these simile be poor one i be afraid but i find it difficult to put my thought exactly into word these particular soldier be most unhappy look all except the half dozen turco among the frenchman they spraddle they baggy white leg and grin comfortably bare fine double row of ivory in they brown face the other mainly be droopy figure of misery and shame by reason of they hair which they wear long and which now hang down in they eye and by reason also of they ridiculous loose red trousers and they long-tailed awkward blue coat the frenchman show themselves especially unkempt and frowzy-looking almost to a man they be dark lean slouchy fellow they be from the south of france we judge certainly with a week 's growth of black whisker upon they jaw they be fit now to play stage brigand without further make-up wot a bloomin ' stinkin ' rotten country come two row back from where i stand a cockney voice uplift to the leaky sky there be not nothin ' to eat in it and there be not nothin ' to drink in it too a little whiny man alongside of I whose chin be on he breast bone spake downward along he gray flannel shirt bosom : just wyte he say just wyte till england ` ear wot they do to we ` erdin ' we about like cattle blighter he spit he disgust upon the ground we speak to none of they directly nor they to we -- that also be a condition impose by mittendorfer the train be compose of several small box car and one second-class passenger coach of german manufacture with a dumpy little locomotive at either end one to pull and one to push in profile it would have remind you somewhat of the wreck train that go to disaster in america the prisoner be load aboard the box car like so many sheep with alert gray shepherd behind they carry gun in lieu of crook and be entrain they be bed down for the night upon straw the civilian compose we party be bid to climb aboard the passenger coach where the eight of we two of the number being of augmented super-adult size take possession of a compartment mean to hold six the other compartment be occupy by wound german except one compartment which be set aside for the captive french lieutenant and two british subaltern top-sergeant rosenthal be in charge of the train with headquarters aboard we coach with he as aide he have three red cross man the lighting apparatus of the car do not operate on the ledge of we window sit a small oil lamp send out a rich smell and a pale puny illumination just before we pull out rosenthal come and blow out the lamp leave the wick to smoke abominably he explain that he do this for we own well-being belgian sniper just outside the town have be firing into the pass train he say and a light in a car window be but a add temptation he advise we that if shooting start we should drop upon the floor we assure he in chorus that we would and then after add that we must not be surprise if the belgian derail the train during the night he go away leave we pack snugly in together in the dark this incident have a tendency to discourage light conversation among we for some minute possibly it be because daylight travel would be safer travel or it may have be for some other good and sufficient reason that after travel some six or eight mile joltingly we stop in the edge of a small village and stay there until after sun-up that be a hard night for sleep purpose one of we party who be a small man climb up into the baggage net above one row of seat and stretch himself stiffly in the narrow hammock-like arrangement fear to move lest he tumble down on the head of he fellow-sufferer another lay he down in the little aisle flank the compartment where at least he might spraddle he limb and where also person pass the length of the car step upon he face and figure from time to time this interfere with he rest the remain six of we mortise ourselves into the seat in neck-cricking attitude with we leg so intertwine and mingle that when one man get up to stretch himself he have to use great care in pick out he own leg sometimes he could only tell that it be he leg by pinch it this be especially so after inaction have put he extremity to sleep while the rest of he remain wide awake after dawn we run slowly to charleroi the center of the belgian iron industry in a sterile land of mine and smelter and slag-heap and bleak bare ore-stained hillside the german have fight here first with organize troops of the ally and later by they own tell with bushwhack civilian whole row of house upon either side of the track have be ventilate by shell or burn out with fire and they gable end lack roof now stand up nakedly fret the skyline like gigantic saw tooth as we be draw out from between these twin row of ruin we see a german sergeant in a flower plot alongside a wreck cottage bend over apparently smell at a clump of tall red geranium that he could find time in the midst of that hideous desolation to sniff at the posy strike we as a typically german bit of sentimentalism just then though he stand erect and we be better inform he have be talk over a military telephone the wire of which be bury underground with a conceal transmitter snuggle beneath the geranium the flower even be be make to contribute they help in forwarding the mechanism of war i think though that it take a composite german mind to evolve that expedient a prussian would bring along the telephone a saxon would bed it among the blossom we progress onward by a process of alternate stop and start through a land bearing remarkably few trace to show for its recent chasten with sword and torch until in the middle of the blaze hot forenoon we come to gembloux which i think must be the place where all the fly in belgium be spawn here on a siding we lay all day grilled in the heat and pester by swarm of the buzz scavenger vermin while troop train without number pass we hurry along the sentry-guarded railway to the lower frontier of belgium every box-car door make a frame for a group-picture of broad german face and bulky german body upon nearly every car the sportive passenger have lash limb of tree and big clump of field flower also with color chalk they have extensively fresco the wooden wall as high up as they could reach the commonest legend be on to pari or for variety to pari direct but occasionally a lighter touch show itself for example one wag have inscribe on a car door : declaration of war receive here and another have draw a highly impressionistic likeness of he kaiser and under it have inscribe wilhelm ii emperor of europe presently as train after train loaded sometimes with gun or supplies but usually with man clank by it begin to dawn upon we that these soldier be of a different physical type from the soldier we have see heretofore they be all german to be sure but the man along the front be younger man hard-bitten and train down with the face which we have begin to call the teutonic fighting face whereas these man be older and of a heavier port and fuller fashion of countenance also some of they wear blue coat red-trimmed instead of the dull gray service garb of the troops in the first invade column indeed some of they even wear a nondescript mixture of uniform and civilian garb they be landwehr and landsturm troops of the third and fourth line go now to police the road and garrison the capture town and hold the line of communication open while the first line who be pick troops and the second line who be reservist press ahead into france they show a childlike curiosity to see the prisoner in the box car behind we they grin triumphantly at the frenchman and the britisher but the sight of a turco in he short jacket and he dirty white skirt invariably set they off in derisive cat-calling and whoop one beefy cavalryman in he forty who look the bavarian peasant all over board we car to see what might be see he have be drink he come nearer be drunk outright than any german soldier i have see to date because he hear we talk english he insist on regard we as english spy hark they betray themselves we hear he mutter thickly to one of he wounded countryman in the next compartment they be damned englishers nein nein all american we hear the other say well if they be american why do not they talk the american language then he demand hear this i be sorry i have neglect in my youth to learn choctaw still dubious of we he come now and stand in the aisle rock slightly on he bolster leg and eye we glassily eventually a think pierce the fog of he understanding he haul he saber out of its scabbard and invite we to run we finger along the edge and see how keen and sharp it be he add with appropriate gesture that he have hone it with the particular intent of slice off a few english head for one and speak for one only i may say i be on the whole rather glad when he depart from among we when we grow tired of watch the troop train streaming south we fight the fly and listen for perhaps the tenth time to the story of steven ' experience when he first fall into german hand six day before steven be the young american who accompany gerbeaux the frenchman and hennebert the belgian on they ill-timed expedition from brussels in a automobile bearing without authority a red cross flag gerbeaux be out to get a story for the chicago paper which he serve as brussels correspondent and the belgian hope to take some photograph but a pure love of excitement bring steven along he have he passport to prove he citizenship and a pass from general von jarotzky military commandant of brussels authorize he to pass through the line he think he be perfectly safe when they machine be halt by the german a short distance south and west of waterloo steven for some reason which he could never understand be separate from he two companion and the south-african negro chauffeur a sergeant take he in charge and all the rest of the day he ride on the tail of a baggage wagon with a guard upon either side of he first though he be search and all he papers be take from he late in the afternoon the pack-train halted and as steven be stretch he leg in a field a first lieutenant whom he describe as be tall and nervous and highly excitable run up and after berate the two guard for not have they rifle ready to fire he poke a gun under steven ' nose and go through the process of load it meanwhile tell he that if he move a inch he brain would be blow out a sergeant gently edge steven back out of the danger belt and from behind the officer 's back another man so steven say tap himself gently upon the forehead to indicate that the herr lieutenant be crack in the brain after this steven be take into a improvise barracks in a desert belgian gendarmerie and lock in a room at nine o'clock the lieutenant come to he and tell he in a mixture of french and german that he have by a court-martial be find guilty of be a english spy and that at six o'clock the follow morning he would be shoot when you hear a bugle sound you may know that be the signal for you execution the officer add while poor steven be still beg for a opportunity to be hear in he own defense the lieutenant deal he a blow in the side which leave he temporarily breathless in a moment two soldier have cross he wrist behind he back and be lash they tightly together with a rope thus bind he be take back indoors and make to sit on a bench eight soldier stretch themselves upon the floor of the room and sleep there a sergeant sleep with he body across the door a guard sit on the bench beside steven he give I two big slug of brandy to drink say steven continue he tale and it affect I no more than so much water after a couple of hour i manage to work the cord loose and i get one hand free move cautiously i lift my foot and by stretch my arm cautiously down still hold they behind my back i untied one shoe i mean at the last to kick off my shoe and run for it i be feel for the lace on my other shoe when another guard come to re-enforce the first and he watch I so closely that i know that chance be go after a while strange as it seem all the fear and all the horror of death leave I my chief regret now be not that i have to die but that my people at home would never know how i die or where i put my head down on the table and actually doze off but there be a clock in the room and whenever it strike i would rouse up and say to myself almost impersonally that i now have four hour to live or three or two as the case might be then i would go to sleep again once or twice a queer sink sensation in my stomach such as i never feel before would come to I but toward daylight this cease to occur at half-past five two soldier one carry a spade and the other a lantern come in they light the lantern at a lamp that burn on a table in front of I and go out presently i could hear they digging in the yard outside the door i believe it be my grave they be digging i can not recall that this make any particular impression upon I i consider it in a most casual sort of fashion i remember wonder whether it be a deep grave at five minute before six a bugle sound the eight man on the floor get up buckle on they cartridge belt shoulder they rifle and leave they knapsack behind tramp out i follow with my guard upon either side of I my one fear now be that i should tremble at the end i feel no fear but i be afraid my knee would shake i remember how relieved i be when i take the first step to find my leg do not tremble under I i be resolve too that i would not be shoot down with my hand tie behind I when i face the squad i mean to shake off the rope on my wrist and take the volley with my arm at my side steven be march to the center of the courtyard then without a word of explanation to he he bond be remove and he be put in a automobile and carry off to rejoin the other member of the unlucky sightseeing party he never do find out whether he have be make the butt of a hideous practical joke by a half-mad brute or whether he tormentor really mean to send he to death and be deter at the last moment by fear of the consequence one thing he do learn -- there have be no court-martial thereafter during he captivity steven be treat with the utmost kindness by all the officer with whom he come in contact he be the only instance that i have knowledge of where a prisoner have be tortured physically or mentally by a german it be curious that in this one case the victim should have be a american citizen whose intention be perfectly innocent and whose papers be orthodox and unquestionable glancing back over what i have here write down i find i have fail altogether to mention the food which we eat on that trip of ours with the german wreck crew it be hardly worth mention it be so scanty we have to eat during that day while we lay at gembloux a loaf of the sourish soldier ' black bread with green mold upon the crust and a pot of rancid honey which one of the party have bethought he to bring from beaumont in he pocket to wash this mixture down we have a few swig of miserably bad lukewarm ration-coffee from a private 's canteen a bottle of confiscate belgian mineral water which a private at charlerous give we from he store and a precious quart of the prince de caraman - chimay 's commandeer wine -- also a souvenir of we captivity late in the afternoon a sergeant sell we for a five-mark piece a big skin-casing fill with half-raw pork sausage i have never taste anything better even so we fare better than the prisoner in the box car behind and the dozen wound man in the coach with we they have only coffee and dry bread and at the latter end of the long day a few chunk of the sausage some of the wound man be pretty badly hurt too there be one whose left forearm have be half shot away he stiff finger protrude beyond he soil bandage and they be still crust with dry blood and grain with dirt another have be pierce through the jaw with a bullet that part of he face which show through the swathing about he head be terribly swollen and purple with congest blood the other have flesh wound mainly in they side or they leg some of they be feverish all of they sorely need clean garment for they body and fresh dressing for they hurt and proper food for they stomach yet i do not hear one of they complain or groan with that oxlike patience of the north-european peasant breed which seem accentuate in these german in time of war they quietly endure what be acute discomfort for any sound man to have to endure in some dim dumb fashion of they own they seem each one of they to comprehend that in the vast organism of a army at war the individual unit do not count to himself he may be of prime importance and first consideration but in the general carry out of the scheme he be a mote a molecule a spore a protoplasm -- a infinitesimal utterly inconsequential thing to be sacrifice without think thus we diagnose they mental pose along toward five o'clock a goodish string of car be add to we train and into these additional car seven hundred french soldier who have be collect at gembloux be load with the frenchman as they march under we window go perhaps twenty civilian prisoner include two priest and three or four subdue little man who look as though they might be civic dignitary of some small belgian town in the squad be one big broad-shouldered peasant in a blouse whose arm be rope back at the elbow with a thick cord do you see that man say one of we guard excitedly and he point at the pinion man he be a grave robber he have be digging up dead german to rob the body they tell I that when they catch he he have in he pocket ten dead man 's finger which he have cut off with a knife because the flesh be so swollen he could not slip the ring off he will be shoot that fellow we look with a deeper interest then at the man whose arm be bind but privately we permit ourselves to be skeptical regard the detail of he alleged ghoulishness we have begin to discount german story of belgian atrocity and belgian story of german atrocity i might add that i be still discount both variety to help along we train two more little engine be add but even with four of they to draw and to shove they load be now so heavy that we be jerk along with sensation as though we be have a jaw tooth pull every few seconds after such a fashion we progress very slowly already we know that we be not go to brussels as we have be promise in beaumont that we should go we only hope we be not bind for a german military fortress in some interior city it fall to my lot that second night to sleep in the aisle in spite of be walk on at interval i sleep pretty well when i wake it be three o'clock in the morning just and we be stand in the train shed at liege and hospital corps man be come aboard with hot coffee and more raw sausage for the wound among the german sausage be use medicinally i think they must keep supplies of sausage in they home for use in case of accident and sickness i get up and look from the window the station be full of soldier move about on various errand overhead big arc light sputter spitefully so that the place be almost as bright as day almost directly below I be a big table which stand on the platform and be cover over with papers and map at the table sit two officer -- high officer i judge -- write busily they stiff white cuff-end show below they coat-sleeve they slim black boot be highly polished and altogether they have the look of have just escape from the hand of a valet between they and the frowsy private be a gulf a thousand mile wide and a thousand mile deep when i wake again it be broad daylight and we have cross the border and be in germany at small way station woman and girl wear long white apron and hospital badge come under the car window with hot drink and bacon sandwich for the wound they give we some too and i think bestow what be leave upon the prisoner at the rear we run now through a land untouched by war where prim farmhouse stand in prim garden it be Sunday morning and the people be go to church dress in they Sunday best consider that germany be suppose to have be drain of its able-bodied male adult for war-making purpose we see among the group a astonishingly large number of man of military age by contrast with the harry country from which we have just emerge this seem a small paradise of peace over there in belgium all the condition of life have be disorganize and undo where they have not be wreck outright over here in germany the calm be entirely unruffled it shame we to come as we be into such surroundings for we car be litter with sausage skin and bread crust and filth less pleasant to look at and stench of many sort abound indeed i shall go further and say that it stink most fearsomely as for we we feel ourselves to be infamous offens against the bright clean day we have not sleep in a bed for five night or have we clothes off for that time for three day none of we have eat a real meal at a regular table for two day we have not wash we face and hand the prisoner of war go on to cologne to be put in a laager but we be bid to detrain at aix-la-chapelle we climb off a dirty wrinkled unshaven troop of vagabond to find ourselves free to go where we please that be we think so at first but by evening the frenchman and the belgian have be take away to be hold in prison until the end of the war and for two day the highly efficient local secret-service staff keep the rest of we under its watchful care after that though the american consul robert j thompson succeed in convince the military authority that we be not dangerous i still think that take copious bath and get ourselves shave help to clear we of suspicion chapter 7 the grape of wrath there be a corner of rhenish prussium that shoulder up against holland and drive a nudge elbow deep into the rib of belgium and right here at the place where the three country meet stand charlemagne 's ancient city of aix-la-chapelle call aachen by the german to go from the middle of aix-la-chapelle to the dutch boundary take twenty minute on a tram-car and to go to the belgian line require a even hour in a horse-drawn vehicle and considerably less than that presume you go by automobile so you see the toe of the town touch two foreign frontier and of all german city it be the most westerly and therefore closest of all to the zone of action in the west of europe you would never guess it however when we land in aix-la-chapelle come out of the heart of the late August hostility in belgium we marvel for behold here be a clean white city that so far as the look of it and the feel of it go might have be a thousand mile from the sound of gunfire on that sabbath morning of we arrival a air of everlasting peace abode with it that same air of peace continue to abide with it during all the day we spend here yet if you take a step to the southwest -- a figurative step in seven-league boot -- you be where all hell break loose war be a most tremendous emphasizer of contrast these line be write late in September in a hotel room at aix-la - chapelle the writing of they follow close on a automobile trip to liege through a district blast by war and corrugated with long trench where those who die with they boot on still lie with they boot on let I if i can draw two picture -- one of this german outpost town and the other of the thing that might be see four or five mile distant over the border i have be tell that in the first flurry of the break out of the world-war aix be not placid it go spy-mad just as all europe go spy-mad -- a mania from which this continent have not entirely recover by any means there be a great round up of suspect alien every loyal citizen resolve himself or herself into a self-appointed policeman to watch the movement of those suspect of be disloyal also they tell I when the magic mobilization begin and troops pour through without cease for four day and four night and fight break out just the other side of the belgian customhouse on the main high road to liege there be excitement but all that be over long before we come the war have go onward down into france and all the people know be what the official bulletin tell they in fact i think they must know less about operation and result than we own people in america i know not what the opportunity of the spectator may have be with regard to other war but certainly in this war it be true that the nearer you get to it the less you understand of its scope all about you on every side be a screen of secrecy once in a while it part for a moment and through the rift you catch a glimpse of the movement of army and the swing and sweep of campaign then the curtain close and again you be shut in let I put the case in another way : it be as though we who be at the front or close to it stand before a mighty painting but with we nose almost touch the canvas you who be farther away see the whole picture we for the moment see only so much of it as you might cover with you two hand but this advantage we do have -- that we see the brush stroke the color shading the infinite small detail whereas you view its wider effect and then have see it when we try to put we story into word -- when we try to set down on paper the unspeakable horror of it -- we realize what a futile incomplete thing the english language be this present day in aix-la-chapelle will be i assume much like all the other day i have spend here a hour ago small official bulletin sanction by the berlin war office be post in the window of the shop and on the front of the public building and small group gather before they to read the news if it be good news they take it calmly if it be not so good still they take it calmly if it be outright bad news i think they would still take it calmly for come good or evil they be all possess now with the belief that in the long run germany must win they confidence be supreme it be characteristic of they though that until word come of the first german success there be no general flying of flag in the town now flag be up everywhere -- the color of the empire and of prussium and often enough just a huge yellow square bear the spraddled black spidery design of the imperial eagle but there be never any hysteria i do not believe these prussian know the meaning of the word it be safe to assume that out of every three grow man in front of a bulletin one will be a soldier yet consider that germany be suppose at this moment to have upward of five million man in the field or under arm and that approximately two million more who be exempt from call by reason of age or other disability be say to have volunteer you would be astonish to see how many man in civilian dress be on the street whether in uniform or not though these man be at work after some fashion or other for they country practically all the physician in aix be serve in the hospital the rich man -- the man of affair -- be act as military clerk at headquarters or drive red cross car the local censor of the telegraph be over eighty year old -- a splendid - look old white giant who win the iron cross in the franco-prussian war and retire with the rank of general year and year ago now in full uniform he work twelve hard hour a day the head waiter at this hotel tell I yesterday that he expect to be summon to the color in a day or two he have have he notice and be ready to go he be more than forty year old i know my room waiter keep watch on I until he satisfy himself i be what i claim to be -- a american -- and not a english spy pose as a american so at first do the cheery little girl cashier in the arcade barber shop downstairs for all i know she may still have I under suspicion and be make daily report on I to the secret-service people the woman help too -- and the child the wife and daughter of the wealthiest man in the town be mind the sick and the wound the mother and the younger girl meet daily to make hospital supplies woman come to you in the cafe at night wear red cross badge on they left arm and shake sealed tin canister into which you be expect to drop contribution for invalided soldier since so many of they teacher be carry rifle or wear sword the pupil of the grammar school and the high school be be organize into squad of crop-gatherer begin next week so i hear they will go out into the field and the orchard to assist in the harvesting of the grain and the fruit for lack of hand to get it under cover the wheat have already begin to suffer but the boy and girl will bring it in it be now half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon at noon sharp a excellent orchestra will begin to play in the big white casino maintain by the city just opposite my hotel it will play for a hour then and again this afternoon and again weather permit to-night the townspeople will sit about at small white table and listen to the music while they sip they beer or drink they coffee they will be soberer and less vivacious than i imagine they be two month ago but then these north german be a sober-minded race anyhow and they take they amusement quietly also they have take the bad tiding of the last few day from france very quietly during the afternoon crowd will gather on the viaduct just above the principal railroad station where they will stand for hour look down over the parapet into the yard below there will be smaller crowd on the height of ronheide on the edge of the town where the track enter the long tunnel under one of the hill that etch the boundary between germany and belgium rain or shine these two place be sure to be black with people for here they may see the train shuttle by like long bobbin in a loom that never cease from its weave -- train go west load with soldier and naval reservist bind for the front and train head east bearing prisoner and wound the raw material pass one way -- that be the new troops the finish product pass the other -- the wound and the sick when wound man go by there will be cheer and some of the woman be sure to raise the song of die wacht be rhein and within the car the cripple soldier will take up the chorus feebly god know how many able-bodied soldier already have go west how many maim and cripple one have go east in the first instance the number must run up into the second million of the latter there must have be well above two hundred thousand no dead come back from the front -- at least not this way the german bury they fall soldier where they fall regardless of he rank the dead man go into a trench if so be he die in battle he be bury boot and dress just as he die and the dead of each day must be get underground before midnight of that same day -- that be the hard-and - fast rule wherever the german be hold they ground or press forward there they will lie until the judgment day unless they kinsfolk be of sufficient wealth and influence to find they burial place and dig they up and bring they home privily for interment even so it may be day or even week after a man be dead and bury before he people hear of it it may be they will not hear of it until a letter write to he in the care of he regiment and he company come back unopened with one word in sinister red letter on it -- gefallen at this hotel yesterday i see a lady dress in heavy black she have the saddest bravest face i ever look into i think she sit in the restaurant with two other lady who be also in black the octogenarian censor of telegram pass they on the way out to she two companion he bow deeply but at she side he halt and bend very low he kiss she hand and then go away without a word the head waiter who know all the gossip of the house and of half the town besides tell we about she she only son a lieutenant of artillery be kill at the taking of liege it be three day before she learn of he death though she be here in aachen only a few mile away for so slowly as this do even bad news travel in war time when it pertain to the individual another week elapse before she husband who be a lieutenant-colonel could secure leave of absence and return from the french border to seek for he son 's body and there be still another week of search before they find it it be at the bottom of a trench under the body of a score or more of he man and it be in such a state that the mother have not be permit to look on she dead boy 's face such thing as this must be common enough hereabouts but one hear very little of they and see even less aix-la-chapelle have suffer most heavily the aix regiment be shoot to piece in the first day 's fighting at liege nearly half its member be kill or wound but astonishingly few woman in mourning be to be see on the street and none of the man wear those crape arm band that be so common in europe ordinarily nor except about the railroad station be very many wound to be see there be any number of wounded private in the local hospital but there must be a rule against they appearance in public place for it be only occasionally that i meet one abroad slightly wound officer be more plentiful i judge from this that no such restriction apply to they as apply to the common soldier this hotel be full of they -- young officer mostly with they head tie up or they arm in black silk sling or limp about on cane or crutch until a few day ago the column of the back page of the aix and cologne papers be black-edged with card insert by relative in memory of officer who have fall -- for king and fatherland the card always say i count thirteen of these death notice in one issue of a cologne paper now they have almost disappear i imagine that because of the depressing effect of such a mass of these publication on the public mind the family of kill officer have be ask to refrain from recite they loss in print yet there be not want sign that the grim total pile up by the hour and the day late this afternoon when i walk around to the american consulate i shall pass the office of the chief local paper and there i be sure to find anywhere from seventy-five to a hundred man and woman wait for the appearance on a bulletin board of the latest list of dead wound and miss man who be credit to aix-la-chapelle and its vicinity a new list go up each afternoon replace the list of the day before sometimes it contain but a few name sometimes a good many then there will be piteous scene for a little while but presently the mourner will go away struggle to compose themselves as they go for they kaiser have ask they to make no show of they loss among they neighbor have make the supremest sacrifice they can make short of offer up they own life they now make another and hide they grief away from sight surely this war spare none at all -- neither those who fight nor those who stay behind toward dusk the street will fill up with promenader perhaps a regiment or so of troops temporarily quarter here on the way to the front will clank by bind for they barracks in diver big music hall the square may be quite crowd with uniform or there may be only one gray coat in proportion to three or four black one -- this last be the commoner ratio it all depend on the movement of the force to-night the cafe will be open and the moving-picture place will run full blast and the free concert will go on and there will be service in the cathedral of charlemagne the cafe that have english name when the war begin have german one now thus the bristol have become the crown prince café and the piccadilly be the germanium but otherwise they be just as they be before the war start and the business in they be quite as good the resident say as it ever be price be no higher than they use to be -- at least i have not find they high after the german fashion the diner will eat slowly and heavily and afterward they will sit in cluster of three or four drinking mug of munich or pilsner and talk deliberately at the crown prince there will be dance and at two or three other place there will be music and maybe singing but at the kaiserhof where i shall dine there be nothing more exciting than beer and conversation it be there two night ago i meet at the same time three german represent three dominant class in the life of they country and have from each of they the viewpoint of he class toward the war they be respectively a business man a scientist and a soldier the business man belong to a firm of brother which rank almost with the krupp in commercial importance it have branch in many city and agency and plant in half a dozen country he say : we have not we daily victory to-day eh well so it go we must not expect to win always we must have reverse and heavy one too but in the end we must win to lose now would mean national extinction to win means germany 's commercial and military preeminence in this hemisphere there can be but one outcome of this war -- either germany as a empire will cease to exist or she will emerge the greatest power except the united state on the face of the earth and so sure be we of the result that to-day my brother and i buy ground for double the size and capacity of we largest plant in six week from now we shall have beat france in six month we shall have drive russium to cover for england it will take a year -- perhaps longer and then as in all game big and little the loser will pay france will be make to pay a indemnity from which she will never recover of belgium i think we shall take a slice of seacoast germany need port on the english channel russium will be so humble that no longer will the muscovite peril threaten europe great britain we shall crush utterly she shall be shear of she navy and she shall lose she colony -- certainly she shall lose indium and egypt she will become a third-class power and she will stay a third-class power forget japan -- germany will punish japan in due season within five year from now i predict there will be a offensive and defensive alliance of all the teutonic and all the scandinavian race of europe with bulgarium include hold absolute dominion over this continent and stretch in a unbroken line from the north sea to the adriatic and the black sea europe be to have a new map my friend and germany will be in the middle of that map when this have be accomplish we shall talk about disarmament -- not before and first we shall disarm we enemy who force this war on we the scientist speak next he be a tall spectacled earnest westphalian who have invent and patent over a hundred separate device use in electric-lighting property and in between have find time to travel round the world several time and write a book or two i do not believe in war he say war have no place in the civilization of the world to-day but this war be inevitable germany have to expand or be suffocate and out of this war good will come for all the world especially for europe we german be the most industrious the most earnest and the best-educated race on this side of the ocean to-day one-fourth of the population of belgium can not read and write under german influence illiteracy will disappear from among they russia stand for reaction england for selfishness and perfidy france for decadence germany stand for progress do not believe the claim of we foe that we kaiser wish to be another napoleon and hold europe under he thumb what he want for germany and what he mean to have be first breathing room for he people and after that a fair share of the commercial opportunity of the world german enlightenment and german institution will do the rest and after this war -- if we german win it -- there will never be another universal war the soldier speak last he be a captain of field artillery a member of a distinguished prussian family and one of the most note big-game hunter in europe three week ago in front of charlerous a french sharpshooter put a bullet in he it pass through he left forearm pierce one lung and lodge in the muscle of he breast where it lie imbed in a week from now he expect to rejoin he command to look at he you would never guess that he have so recently be wound he color be high and he move with the stiff precise alertness of the german army man he be still wear the coat he wear in the fight there be two ragged little hole in the left sleeve and a puncture in the side of it and it be spot with stiff dry brown stain i do not presume to know anything about the political or commercial aspect of this war he say over he beer mug but i do know this : war be force on we by these other power they be jealous of we and they make the austrian-servian quarrel they quarrel but when war come we be ready and they be not not until the mobilization be order do the people of germany know the color of the field uniform of they soldier yet four million of these service uniform be make and finish and wait in we military storehouse not until after the first shot be fire do we who be in the army know how many army corps we have or the name of they commander or even the name of the officer compose the general staff a week after we take the field we infantry in heavy march order be cover fifty kilometer a day -- thirty of you american mile -- and do it day after day without straggle and without any footsore man drop behind do these thing count in the sum total i say they do we army will win because it deserve to win through be ready and be complete and be efficient do not discount the efficiency of we navy either remember we german have the name of be thorough when we fleet meet the british fleet i think you will find that we have a few krupp surprise for they i may meet these confident gentleman tonight if not it be highly probable i shall meet other who be equally confident and who will express the same view which they hold because they be the view of the german people at eleven o'clock when i start back to the hotel the street will be almost empty aix will have go to bed and in bed it will peacefully stay unless a military zeppelin sail over its rooftree make a noise like ten million locust all buzz at once there be two zeppelin aloft last night and from my window i see one of they quite plainly it be hang almost stationary in the northern sky like a huge yellow gourd after a while it make off toward the west one day last week three of they pass all bind presumably for pari or antwerp or even london that time the people grow a bit excited but now they take a zeppelin much as a matter of course and only wonder mildly where it come from and whither it be go as for to-morrow i imagine to-morrow will be another to-day but yesterday be different i have a streak of luck it be forbid to civilian and more particularly to correspondent to go prowl about eastern belgium just now but i find a friend in a naturalized german - american formerly of chicago but live now in germany though he still retain he citizenship in the united state like every one else in aachen he be do something for the government though i can only guess at the precise nature of he service at any rate he have a automobile a scarce thing to find in private hand in these time and what be more he have a military pass authorize he to go to liege and to take two passenger along he invite I to go with he for a day 's ride through the country where the very first blow be swap in the western theater of hostility we start off in the middle of a fickle-minded shower which first blow puff of wetness in we face like spray on a flawy day at sea and then break off to let the sun shine through for a minute or two for two or three kilometer after clear the town we run through a district that smile with peace and groan with plenty on the veranda of funny little gray roadhouse with drip red roof officer sit over they breakfast coffee a string of wagon pass we bind inward full of big white clean-looking german pig a road builder repair the rut make by the gun and baggage train stand aside for we to pass and pull off he hat to we this be europe as it use to be -- europe as most american tourist know it we come to a tall barber pole which a careless painter have strip with black on white instead of with red on white and we know by that we have arrive at the frontier also there stand alongside the pole a royal forest ranger in green with a queer cockade hat on he head do sentry duty as we stop to show he we permit and to give he a ripe pear and a cologne paper half a dozen soldier come tumble out of the guardroom in the little customhouse and run up to beg from we not pear but papers clear to liege we be to be importune every few rod by soldier beg for papers some have small wooden sign-board bear the word zeitung which they would lift and swing across the path of a approach automobile i begin to believe after a while that if a man have enough newspaper in stock he could bribe he way through the german troops clear into france these fellow who gather about we now be of the landsturm man in they late thirty and early forty with long shaggy mustach they kind form the handle of the mighty hammer whose steel nose be batter at france every third one of they wear spectacles show that the back line of the army be extensively addict to the favorite teutonic sport of be nearsighted also they coat sleeve invariably be too long for they and hide they big hand almost to the knuckle this be a characteristic i have everywhere note among the german private if the french soldier 's coat be over-lengthy in the skirt the german 's be ultra-generous with cloth in the sleeve i see that they hair be begin to get shaggy show that they have be in the field some week since every german soldier -- officer and private alike -- leave the barracks so close-cropped that he skin show pinky through the bristle among they be one chap in blue sailor 's garb leave behind doubtless when forty-five hundred naval reserve pass through three day before to work the big gun in front of antwerp we go on at first there be nothing to show we have enter belgium except that the prussian flag do not hang from a pole in front of every farmhouse but only in front of every fourth house say or every fifth one then come stretch of drench field vacant except for big black raven and nimble piebald magpie which bicker among themselves in the neglect and mat grain and then we swing round a curve in the rutted roadway and be in the town of battice no we be not in the town of battice we be where the town of battice have be -- where it stand six week ago it be famous then for its fat rich cheese and its green damson plum now and no doubt for year to come it will be chiefly notable as have be the town where it be say belgian civilian first fire on the german troops from roof and window and where the german first inaugurate they ruthless system of reprisal on house and people alike literally this town no longer exist it be a scrap-heap if you like but not a town here have be a great trample out of the grape of wrath and most sorrowful be the vintage that remain it be a hard thing to level these belgian house absolutely for they be mainly build of stone or of thick brick coat over with a hard cement so generally the wall stand even in battice but always the roof be go and the window opening be smudge cavity through which you look and see square patch of the sky if you eye inclined upward or else blacken mass of ruination if you gaze straight in at the interior once in a while one have be throw flat probably big gun operate here in such a case there be a avalanche of broken masonry cascade out into the roadway midway of the mile-long avenue of utter waste which we now traverse we come on a sort of small square here be the yellow village church it lack a spire and a cross and the front door be go so we could see the wreck altar and the splintered pew within flank the church there have be a communal hall which be now shapeless irredeemable wreckage a public well have stand in the open space between church and hall with a design of stone pillar about it the open mouth of the well we could see be choke with foul debris but a shell have strike squarely among the pillar and they fall inward like wigwam pole form a crazy apex i remember distinctly two other thing : a picture of a elderly man with whisker -- one of those smudge atrocity that be call in the state crayon portrait -- hang undamaged on the naked wall of what have be a upper bedroom and a wayside shrine of the sort so common in the catholic country of europe a shell have hit it a glance blow so that the little china figure of the bless virgin lay in bit behind the small bar opening of the shrine of live creature there be none heretofore in all the blast town i have visit there be some human life stir one could count on see one of the old woman who be so numerous in these belgian hamlet -- more numerous i think than anywhere else on earth in my mind i have learn to associate such a sight with at least one old woman -- a incredibly old woman with a back bent like a measure worm 's and a cap on she scanty hair and a face crosshatch with a million wrinkle -- who would be potter about at the back of some half - ruin house or maybe squat in a desolate doorway stare at we with she rheumy puckered eye or else there would be a hunchback -- crooked spine be almost as common in part of belgium as goiter be in part of switzerland but battice have become a empty tomb and be as lonely and as silent as a tomb its people -- those who survive -- have flee from it as from a abomination beyond battice stand another village call herve and herve be battice all over again with variation at this place during the first few hour of actual hostility between the little country and the big one the belgian have try to stem the inpouring german flood as be prove by wreck of barricade in the high street one barricade have be build of wagon body and the big iron hod of road-scraper the wreck of these be still pile at the road 's edge yet there remain tangible proof of the german claim that they do not harry and burn indiscriminately except in case where the attack on they be by general concert here and there on the principal street in a row of ruin stand a single house that be intact and undamaged it be plain enough to be see that pain have be take to spare it from the common fate of its neighbor also i glimpsed one short side street that have come out of the fiery visitation whole and unscathed prove if it prove anything that even in they red heat the german have pick and choose the fruit for the wine press of they vengeance after herve we encounter no more destruction by wholesale but only destruction by piecemeal until near liege we pass what remain of the most northerly of the ring of fortress that form the city 's defens the conqueror have dismantle it and throw down the gun so that of the fort proper there be nothing except a low earthen wall almost like a natural ridge in the earth all about it be a entanglement of barb wire the strand be weave and interwoven tangled and twine together until they suggest nothing so much as a great patch of blackberry brier after the leaf have drop from the vine in the fall of the year to take the work the german have to cut through these trocha it seem impossible to believe human being could penetrate they especially when one be tell that the belgian charge some of the wire with high electricity so that those of the advance party who touch they be frightfully burn and fall with they garment blaze into the jagged wire bramble and be hold there until they die before the charge and the final hand-to-hand fight however there be shell there be much shell shell from the german gun that fall short or overshoot the mark descend in the field and for a mile round these field be plow as though hundred of plowshare have shear the sod this way and that until hardly a blade of grass be leave to grow in its ordain place where shell have burst after they strike be hole in the earth five or six foot across and five or six foot deep shell from the german gun and from the belgian gun have make a most hideous hash of a cluster of small cottage flank a small smelting plant which stand directly in the line of fire some of these house -- workman 's home i suppose they have be -- be of frame sheathe over with square of tin put on in a diamond pattern and you could see place where a shell striking such a wall a glance blow have scale it as a fish be scale with a knife leave the bare wooden rib show below the next house and the next have be hit squarely and plumply amidship and they be gut as fish be gut one house in twenty perhaps would be quite whole except for broken window and fissure in the roof -- as though the whizzing shell have spare it deliberately i recall that of one house there be leave stand only a breadth of front wall between the place where window have be it rise in a ragged column to the line of the roof-rafter -- only of course there be neither roof nor rafter now on the face of the column as though do in a spirit of bitter irony be post a proclamation sign by the burgomaster and the military commandant call on the vanish dweller of this place to preserve they tranquillity on the side of the fort away from the city and in the direction whence we have come a corporal 's guard have establish itself in a rent-asunder house in order to be out of the wet on the front of the house they have hang a capture belgian bugler 's uniform and a french dragoon 's overcoat which latter garment be probably a trophy bring back from the lower line of fight it make you think of a old-clothes-man 's shop the corporal come forth to look at we pass before permit we to go on he be a dumpy good-natured-looking hanoverian with patchy saffron whisker sprout out on he ach yes he say in answer to my conductor 's question thing be quiet enough here now but on Monday -- that would be three day before -- we shoot sixteen man here -- rioter and civilian who fire on we troops and one grave-robber -- a dirty hound they be yonder he swing he arm and follow its swing we see a mound of fresh-turned clay perhaps twenty foot in length which make a yellow streak against the green of a small inclosed pasture about a hundred yard away we see many such mound that day and this one where the ignoble sixteen lay be the shortest of the lot some mound be fifty or sixty foot in length i presume there be distinguish mark on the filled-up trench where the german dead lay but from the automobile we could make out none as we start on again after give the little hanoverian the last treasured copy of a paper we have manage to keep that long against continual importunity a big belgian dog with a drag tail and a sharp jackal nose lope round from behind a undamaged cow barn which stand back of the riven shell of a house where the soldier be quarter he have the air about he of look for somebody or something he stop short sniff and whine at sight of the gray coat bunch in the doorway and then run back a few yard with he head all the time turn to watch the stranger he sit on he haunch stick he pointed muzzle upward toward the sky and fetch a long homesick howl from the bottom of he disconsolate canine soul when we turn a bend in the road to enter the first recognizable street of liege he be still hunker down there in the rain he finish the picture he keynote it the composition of it -- for I -- be perfect now i mean no levity when i say that liege be well shake before take but merely that the phrase be the apt one for use because it better express the truth than any other i can think of yet consider what it go through last month liege seem to have emerge in better shape than one would have expect drive into the town i see more house with white flag -- the emblem of complete surrender -- flutter from sill and coping than house bear mark of the siege in the bombardment the shell mostly appear to have pass above the town -- which be natural enough see that the principal belgian fort stand on the hilltop westward of and overlook the city and the principal german battery -- at least until the last day of fighting -- be post behind temporary defens hastily throw up well to the east and north liege squat in the natural amphitheater below practically escape the fire of the big gun the main concern of the noncombatant they tell I be to shelter themselves from the street fighting which by all account be both stubborn and sanguinary the doughty walloon who live in this corner of belgium have have the name of be sincere and willing worker with bare steel since the day when charle the bold of burgundy seek to curb they rebellious spirit by raze they city wall and massacre some ten thousand of they and quite a spell before that i believe julius caesar find they tough to bend and hard to break as for the german check as they have be in they rush on france by a foe whom they have regard as too puny to count as a factor in the war they sacrifice themselves by hundred and thousand to win breathing space behind stand wall until they great seventeen-inch siege gun could be bring from essen and mount by the force of engineer who come for that purpose direct from the krupp work in that portion of the town lie west of the meuse we count perhaps ten house that be level flat and perhaps twenty that be now but burnt-out riddled hull of house as empty and useless as so many shuck pea-pod of the bridge span the river the principal one a handsome four-span structure of stone ornament with stone figure of river god lay now in shatter fragment choke the current where the belgian themselves have blow it apart one more bridge or perhaps two -- i can not be sure -- be close to traffic because dynamite have make they unsafe but the remain bridge of which i think there be three show no sign of rough treatment opposite the great university there be a big black ragged scar to show where a block of dwelling have stand liege to judge from its surface aspect could not well have be quieter business go on buyer and seller fill the side street and dot the long stone quay old flemish man fish industriously below the wreck stone bridge where the debris make new eddy in the swift narrow stream and blue pigeon swarm in the plaza before the palais de justice give to the scene a suggestion of st mark 's square at venice the german landwehr who be everywhere about treat the inhabitant civilly enough and the inhabitant show no outward resentment against the german but beneath the lid a whole potful of potential trouble be brew if one might believe what the german tell we we talk with a young lieutenant of infantry who in more peaceful time have be a staff cartoonist for a berlin comic paper he receive we beneath the portico of the theater royale build after the model of the odeon in pari two waspish rapid-fire gun stand just within the shelter of the column with they black snout point this way and that to command the sweep of the three-cornered place du theater a company of soldier be quarter in the theater itself at night so the lieutenant say those man who be off duty rummage the costume out of the dress room put they on and give mock play with music a officer 's horse occupy what i think must have be the box office it put its head out of a little window just over we head and nickered when other horse pass against the side of the building be poster advertise a french company to play the gallicize version of a american farce -- baby mine -- by margaret mayo the border of the poster be ornament with print of american flag do in the proper color yes liege seem quiet enough say the lieutenant but we expect a revolt to break out at any time we expect it last night and the guard in the street be triple and double and these little dear -- pat the muzzle of one of the machine gun -- be put here and more like they be mount on the portico of the hotel de ville and the palais de justice so nothing happen in the city proper though in the outskirts three soldier disappear and be suppose to have be murder and a high officer -- he do not give the name or the rank -- be waylay and kill just beyond the environs now we fear that the uprising may come to-night for the last three day the resident in great number have be ask for permit to leave liege and go into neutral territory in holland or to other part of they own country to we this sudden exodus -- there seem to be no reason for it -- look significant these people be naturally turbulent always they have be so most of they be maker of part for firearm -- gunmake you know be the principal industry here -- and they be familiar with weapon and many of the man be excellent shot this increase the danger at first they be content to ambush single soldier who stray into obscure quarter after dark now it be forbid for less than three soldier in a party to go anywhere at night and they think from this that we be afraid and be grow more daring by day they smile at we and bow and be as polite as dance master but at night the same man who smile at we will cheerfully cut the throat of any german who be foolish enough to venture abroad alone besides this town and all the town between here and brussels be be secretly flood with papers print in french tell the people that we have be beat everywhere to the south and that the ally be but a few mile away and that if they will rise in number and destroy the garrison re-enforcement will arrive the next morning to hold the district against we if they do rise it will be louvain all over again we shall burn liege and kill all who be suspect of be in league against we troops assuredly many innocent one will suffer then with the guilty but what else can we do we be live above a seething volcano certainly though never do volcano seethe more quietly the garrison commander would not hear of we visit any of the wreck belgian fortress on the wooded height behind the city as a reason for he refusal he say that explosive in the bury magazine be begin to go off make it highly dangerous for spectator to venture near they however he have no objection to we go to a certain specified point within the zone of suppose safety with a noncommissioned officer to guide we we climb up a miry footpath to the crest of a low hill and from a distance of perhaps a hundred yard we look across at what be leave of fort loncin one of the principal defens i be wrong there we do not look at what be leave of fort loncin literally nothing be leave of it as a fort it be go obliterated wipe out vanish it have be of a triangular shape it be of no shape now we find it difficult to believe that the work of human hand have work destruction so utter and overwhelming where masonry wall have be be a vast junk heap where stout magazine have be bed down in hard concrete be a crater where strong barracks have stand be a jumbled shuffle nothingness standing there on the shell-torn hilltop look across to where the krupp surprise write its own testimonial at its first time of use in character so deadly and devastating i find myself somehow think of that foolish nursery tale wherein it be recite that a pig build himself a house of straw and the wolf come and he huff and he puff and he blow the house down the noncommissioned officer tell we a unknown number of the defender run probably into the hundred have be bury so deeply beneath the ruin of the fort in the last hour of the fight that the german have be unable to recover the body even as he speak a puff of wind bring to we nostril a smell which once a man get it into he nose he will never get the memory of it out again so long as he have a nose be sufficiently sick we depart thence as we ride back and have get as far as the two ruin village it begin to rain very hard the rain as it splash into the puddle stippled the farther reach of the road thickly with dot and its slanting line turn everything into one gray etching which you might have label desolation and you would make no mistake in you labeling then -- with one of those trick of deliberate drama by which nature sometimes shame stage manager -- the late afternoon sun come out just after we cross the frontier and shone on we and on the dapper young officer drive out in carriage and on the peaceful german country place with they formal garden and on a crate of fat white german pig ride to market to be make up into sausage for the placid burgher of aix-la-chapelle chapter 8 three general and a cook to get to the civic midriff of the ancient and honorable french city of laon you must ascend a road that wind in spiral about a high steep hill like thread cut in a screw do this you come at length to the flat top of the screw -- a most curiously flat top -- and find on this side of you the cathedral and the market-place and on that side of you the hotel de ville where a german flag hang among the iron lily in the grille-worked arm of the republic above the front door dead ahead of you be the prefecture which be a noble stone building face southward toward the river aisne and it have decoration of the twentieth century a gateway of the thirteenth century and plumbing of the third century when there be no plumbing to speak of we have make this journey and now the hour be seven in the evening and we be dine in the big hall of the prefecture as the guest of he excellency field marshal von heeringen command the seventh army of the german kaiser -- dining i might add from fine french plate with smart german orderly for waiter except we five and one other the twenty-odd who sit about the great oblong table be member of the over-general 's staff we five be robert j thompson american consul at aix-la-chapelle mccutcheon and bennett of the chicago tribune captain alfr mannesmann of the great german manufacturing firm of mannesmann mulag and myself the one other be a berlin artist by name follbehr who have the run of the army be go out daily to do quick study in water color in the trench and among the battery he do they remarkably well too see that any minute a shell might come and spatter he all over he own drawing board all the rest though be general and colonel and major and such -- youngish man mostly exclude we host i do not believe there be a man present who have pass fifty year of age but the general be nearer eighty than fifty be one of the veteran of the franco-prussian war whom they emperor have order out of desk job in the first day of August to shepherd he force in the field at he call they come -- von heeringen and von hindenberg and von zwehl to mention three name that speedily become catchword round the world -- with they gray head full of prussian war tactic and very soon they work have justify the act of they imperial master in choose they for leadership and now they have new medal at they throat and on they breast to overlay the old medal they win back in 1870-71 like many of the older officer of the german army i meet von heeringen speak no english in which regard he be excessively unlike ninety per cent of the younger officer among they it be a uncommon thing in my experience to find one who do not know at least a smattering of english and considerably more than a smattering of understandable french even that marvelous organism the german private soldier be apt to astonish you at unexpected moment by answer in fair-enough english the question you put to he in fractured and dislocated german not once or twice but a hundred time during my cruise about in belgium and germany and france i laboriously unloaded a string of cripple german noun and broken-legged adjective and unsocketed verb on a hickory-looking sentry only to have he reply to I in my own tongue it would come out then that he have be a waiter at a british seaside resort or a steward on a hamburg-american liner or oftener still that he have study english at the public school in he native town of kiel or coblenz or dresden or somewhere the officer ' english as i say before be nearly always ready and lubricant to one who speak no french and not enough german to hurt he this proficiency in language on the part of the german standing army be a precious boon the ordinary double-barreled dictionary of phrase have already disclose itself as a most unsatisfying volume in which to put one 's trust it be wear on the disposition to turn the leaf try to find out how to ask somebody to pass the butter and find instead whole page of parallel column of translate sentence give over to such question as where be the aunt of my stepfather 's second cousin as a rule a man do not go to europe in time of war to look up he relative by marriage he may even have go there to avoid they war be terrible enough without lug in all the remote kinsfolk a fellow have how much easier then to throw oneself on the superior educational qualification of the german military machine somebody be sure to have a linguistic life net there rig and ready for you to drop into it be so in this instance as it have be so in many instance before and since the courteous gentleman who sit at my right side and at my left speak in german or french or english as the occasion suit while old von heeringen boom away in rumble german phrase as i eat i study he three week later less a day i meet by appointment lord kitchener and spend forty minute or thereabout in he company at the war office in london in the midst of the interview as i sit face kitchener i begin wonder in the back part of my head who it be lord kitchener remind I of suddenly the answer come to I and it jolt I the answer be von heeringen physically the two man -- kitchener of khartoum and von heeringen the gray ghost of metz -- have nothing in common mentally i conceive they to be unlike except that both of they hold the rank of field marshal i could put my finger on no point of similarity either in personality or in record which these man share between they it be true they both serve in the war of 1870-71 but at the outset this parallel fall flat too because one have be a junior officer on the german side and the other a volunteer on the french side one be a prussian in every outward aspect the other be as british as it be possible for a briton to be one have be at the head of the general staff of he country and be now in the field in active service with a sword at he side the other have serve he country in the field for many year now sit intrench behind a roll-top desk direct the machinery of the war office with a pencil for a baton kitchener be in he robust sixty with a breast like a barrel von heeringen be in he shrink drying-up seventy and he broad shoulder have already begin to fold in on he rib and he big black eye to retreat deeper into he skull one be beaky-nosed hatchet-headed beard the other be broad-faced and shaggily mustached one have be fame for he accessibility the other for he inaccessibility so because of these acutely dissimilar thing i marvel to myself that day in london why when i look at kitchener i should think of von heeringen in another minute though i know why : both man radiate the same quality of masterfulness both of they physically typify competency both of they look on the world with the eye of man who be bear to have power and to hold dominion over lesser man put either of these two in the rag of a beggar or the motley of a pantaloon and at a glance you would know he for a leader consider that we be suppose to be at the front on this evening at laon the food be good there be a soup and the invariable veal on which a german buttress the solid foundation of he dinner a salad and fruit red wine and white wine and brandy also there be fly amount in number to a great multitude the talk like the fly go to and fro about the table and always it be worth hearing since it deal largely with first-hand experience in the very heart of the fighting yet i must add that not all the talk be talk of war in peaceful aix - la-chapelle whence we have come the people know but one topic here on the forward fray edge of the battle line the man who have that day play they part in battle occasionally speak of other thing i recall there be a discussion between captain von theobald of the artillery and major humplmayer of the automobile corps on the merit of a painting that fill one of the panel in the big handsome overdecorated hall the major won which be natural enough since in time of peace he be by way of be a collector of and dealer in art object at munich somebody else mention big-game shooting for five minute then or such a matter the way of big game and the way of shoot it hold the interest of half a dozen man at we curve of the table in such a interlude as this the listener might almost have lull himself into the fancy that after all there be no war that these courteous gray-coated shoulder-strapped gentleman be not at present engage in the business of kill they fellowman that this building wherein we sit with its florid velvet carpet underfoot and its too-heavy chandelier overhead be not the capture chateau of the governor of a french province and that the deep-eyed white-fleeced bull-voiced old man who sit just opposite be not the commander of sundry hundred of thousand of fight man with gun in they hand but surely be no more and no less than the elderly lord of the manor who have a fancy for regimental have put on he and have pin some glittering bauble on he coat and then have invite a few of he friend and neighbor in for a simple dinner on this fine evening of the young autumn yet we know that already the war have take toll of nearly every man in uniform who be present about this board general von heeringen 's two son both desperately wound be lie in field hospital -- one in east prussium the other in northern france not many mile from where we be he second in command have two son -- he only two son -- kill in the same battle three week before when a few minute earlier i have hear this i stare at he curious to see what mark so hard a stroke would leave on a man i see only a grave middle-aged gentleman very attentive to the consul who sit beside he and very polite to we all prince scharmberg-lippe whom we have pass drive away from the prefecture in he automobile as we drive to it in ours be the last of four brother the other three be kill in the first six week of fight we own companion captain mannesmann hear only the day before when we stop at hirson -- just over the border from belgium -- that he cousin have win the iron cross for conspicuous courage and within three day more be to hear that this same cousin have be snipe from ambush during a night raid down the left wing nor have death be overly stingy to the member of the staff itself we gather as much from chance remark and so as it come to be eight o'clock i catch myself watch certain vacant chair at we table and at the two smaller table in the next room with a strained curiosity one by one the vacant chair fill up at interval the door behind I would open and a officer would clank in dust over with the sift of the french road he would bow ceremoniously to he chief and then to the company generally slip into a unoccupied chair give a order over he shoulder to a soldier-waiter and at once begin to eat he dinner with the air of a man who have earn it after a while there be but one place vacant at we table it be next to I i could not keep my eye away from it it get on my nerve -- that little gap in the circle that little space of white linen bare of anything but two unfilled glass to I it become as portentous as a unscrewed coffin lid no one else seem to notice it cigar have be pass round and the talk eddy casually back and forth with the twisty smoke wreath a orderly draw the empty chair back with a thump i think i jump a slender man whose uniform fit he as though it have be he skin be sit down beside I unlike those who come before he he have enter so quietly that i have not sense he come i hear the soldier call he excellency and i hear he tell the soldier not to give he any soup we swap commonplace i tell he what my business there be and for a little while he ply he knife and fork busily make the heavy gold curb chain on he left wrist tinkle musically i be rather glad they do not get I this afternoon he say as though to make conversation with a stranger this be first-rate veal -- better than we usually have here get you i say who want to get you we friend the enemy he answer i be in one of we trench rather well toward the front and a shell or two strike just behind I i think from they sound they be french shell this debonair gentleman as presently transpire be colonel von scheller for four year consul to the german embassy at washington more lately minister for foreign affair of the kingdom of saxony and now do staff duty in the ordnance department here at the german center he have the sharp brown eye of a courageous fox terrier a mustache that turn up at the end and a most beautiful command of the english language and its american idiom he hurry along with he dinner and soon he have catch up with we i suggest he say that we go out on the terrace to drink we coffee it be about time for the french to start they evening benediction as we call it they usually quit firing they heavy gun just before dark and usually begin again at eight and keep it up for a hour or two so we two take we coffee cup and we cigar in we hand and go out through a side passage to the terrace and sit on a little iron bench where a shaft of light from a window of the room we have just quit show a narrow streak of flowering plant beyond the brick wall and a clump of red and yellow woodbine on a low wall the rest lay in blackness but i know from what i have see before dusk come that we must be somewhere near the middle of a broad terrace -- a hang garden rather -- full of sundial and statue and flower bed which overhang the southern face of the hill of laon and from which in daylight a splendid view might be have of wooded slope fall away into wide flat valley and wide flat valley rise again to form more wooded slope i know too from what i remember that the plateau immediately beneath we be flyspeck with the roof of small abandon village and that the road which run straight from the base of the height toward the remote river be a-crawl with supply wagon and ammunition wagon go forward to the german battery seven mile away and with scout and messenger in automobile and on motor cycle and the day 's toll of wound in ambulance come back from the front we could not see they when we go to the parapet and look downward into the black gulf below but the rumble of the wheel and the panting of the motor come up to we with these come also the remote music of those queer little trumpet carry by the soldier who ride beside the driver of german military automobile and this sound as thinly and plaintively to we ear as the cry of sandpiper hear a long way off across a windy beach we could hear something else too : the evening benediction have start now fast now slow like the beating of a feverish pulse the gun sound in faint throb and all along the horizon from southeast to southwest and back again run flare and wave of a sullen red radiance the light flame high at one instant -- like firework -- and at the next it die almost to a glow as though a great bed of peat coal or a vast limekiln lay on the farthermost crest of the next chain of hill it be the first time i have ever see artillery fire at night though i have hear it often enough by then in france and in belgium and even in germany for when the wind blow out of the west we could hear in aix-la-chapelle the faint booming of the great cannon before antwerp day and night on end i do not know how long i stand and look and listen eventually i be aware that the courteous von scheller standing at my elbow be repeat something he have already state at least once those brighter flash you see apparently come from below the other light be we gun he be say they seem to be below the other because they be nearer to we personally i do not think these evening volley do very much damage he go on as though vaguely regretful that the dole of death by night should be so scanty because it be impossible for the man in the outermost observation pit to see the effect of the shot but we answer as you notice just to show the french and english we be not asleep those iron vespers last i should say for the better part of a hour when they be end we go indoors everybody be assemble in the long hall of the prefecture and a young officer be smash out march song on the piano the berlin artist make a art gallery of the billiard table and be exhibit the water-color sketch he have do that day -- all very dashing and spirited in they treatment though a bit splashy and scrambled-eggish as to the use of the pigment a very young man with the marking of a captain on shoulder and collar come in and go up to general von heeringen and show he something -- something that look like a very large and rather ornamental steel coal scuttle which have suffer from a serious personal misunderstanding with a ax the elongate top of it which have a fluted rudder-like adornment make you think of siegfried 's helmet in the opera but the bottom which be squashed out of shape make you think of a total loss when the general have finish look at this object we all have a chance to finger it the young captain seem quite proud of it and bear it off with he to the dining room it be what remain of a bomb and have be load with slug of lead and those iron cherry that be call shrapnel a french flyer have drop it that afternoon with intent to destroy one of the german captive balloon and its operator the young officer be the operator of the balloon in question it be he daily duty to go aloft at the end of a steel tether and bob about for seven hour at a stretch study the effect of the shell fire and telephone down direction for the proper aim of the gun he have be up seven hundred foot in the air that afternoon with no place to go in case of accident when the frenchman come over and try to hit he it strike within a hundred meter of I call back the young captain as he disappear through the dining-room doorway make quite a noise and tear up the earth considerably he be lucky -- the young herr captain say von scheller -- luckier than he predecessor a fortnight ago one of the enemy 's flyer strike one of we balloon with a bomb and the gas envelope explode when the wreckage reach the earth there be nothing much left of the operator -- poor fellow -- except the melted button on he coat there be very few safe job in this army but be a captive-balloon observer be one of the least safe of they all i have note that the young captain wear in the second buttonhole of he tunic the black-and-white-striped ribbon and the black-and-white maltese cross and now when i look about I i see that at least every third man of the present company likewise bear such a decoration i know the iron cross be give to a man only for gallant conduct in time of war at the peril of he life a desire to know a few detail beset I humplmayer the scholarly art dealer be at my side he have it too -- the iron cross of the first class you win that lately i begin touch the ribbon yes he say only the other day i receive it and for what might i ask say i press my advantage oh he say i have be out quite a bit in the night air lately you know we german be desperately afraid of night air later i learn -- though not from humplmayer -- that he have for a period of week do scout work in a automobile in hostile territory which mean that he ride in the darkness over the strange road of a alien country expose every minute to the chance of ambuscade and barbed-wire mantrap and the like i judge he earn he bauble i try von theobald next -- a lynx-faced square-shouldered young man of the field gun to he i put the question : what have you do now to merit the bestowal of the cross well he say -- and he smile be bear of embarrassment i think -- there be shooting once or twice and i -- well i do not go away i remain so after that i quit ask but it be bear in upon I that if these gold-braceletted monocled wasp-waisted exquisite could go jauntily forth for flirtation with death as afore-time i have see they go then also they could be marvelously modest touch on they own performance in the event of they survive those most fatal blandishments pretty soon we tell the staff good night accord to the ritualistic teutonic fashion and take ourselves off to bed for the next day be expect to be a full day which it be indeed and verily in the hotel of the town such as they be officer be billet four to the room and two to the bed but the commandant enthrone at the hotel de ville look after we comfort he send a soldier to nail a notice on the gate of one of the handsomest house in laon -- a house whence the tenant have flee at the come of the german -- which notice give warn to all whom it might concern that captain mannesmann who carry the kaiser 's own pass and four american herren be until further order domicile there and the soldier tarry to clean we boot while we sleep and bring we warm shave water in the morning be thus provide for we tramp away through the empty wind street to number five rue st cyr which be a big fine three-story mansion with its own garden and courtyard arrive there we draw lot for bedroom it fall to I to occupy one that evidently belong to the master of the house he must have run away in a hurry he bathrobe still hang on a peg he other pair of suspenders dangle over the footboard and he shave brush with dry lather on it be on the floor i step on it as i get into bed and hurt my foot goodness know i be tire enough but i lay awake a while think what change in we journalistic fortune thirty day have bring we five week before bear dangerously dubious credentials we have trail afoot -- a suspicious squad -- at the tail of the german column liable to be halt and lock up any minute by any fingerling of a sublieutenant who might be so mind to so serve we in that stressful time a war correspondent be almost as popular with the officialdom of the german army as the asiatic cholera would have be the private be we best friend then just one month to the hour and the night after we sleep on straw as quasi-prisoner and under a armed guard in a schoolhouse belong to the prince de caraman-chimay at beaumont we dine with the commandant of a german garrison in the castle of another prince of the same name -- the prince de chimay -- at the town of chimay set among the timbered preserve of the ancient house of chimay in belgium at the end of August we fend and forage for ourselves aboard a train of wound and prisoner in northern france at the end of September prince reuss german minister to persium but serve temporarily in the red cross corps have bestir himself to find lodgings for we and now thanks to a newborn desire on the part of the berlin war office to let the press of america know something of the effect of they operation on the people of the invade state here we be make free with a strange french gentleman 's chateau and mess with a over-general 's staff lie there in another man 's bed i feel like a burglar and i sleep like a oyster -- the oyster be as naturalist know a most sound sleeper in the morning there be breakfast at the great table -- the fly of the night before be still present -- with general von heeringen inquire most earnestly as to how we have rest and then go out to see to the day 's killing before do so however he detail the competent captain von theobald and the efficient lieutenant giebel to serve for the day as we guide while we study briefly the workings of the german war machine in the actual theater of war it be under they conductorship that about noon we aim we automobile for the spot where in accordance with provision work out in advance but until that moment unknown to we we be to lunch with another general -- von zwehl of the reserve we leave the hill where the town be some four mile behind we and when we have pass through two wreck and silent village and through three of those strip of park timber which continental call forest we presently draw up and halt and dismount where a thick fringe of undergrowth follow the line of a old and straggly thorn hedge meet the road at right angle on the comb of a small ridge command a view of the tableland to the southward as we climb up the bank we be aware of certain shelter which be like overgrown rabbit hutch cunningly contrived of wattled faggot and straw sheave plait together they have tarpaulin interlining and dug-out earthen floor cover over thickly with straw these cozy small shack hide themselves behind a screen of haw among the scatter tree which flank a ancient fortification abandon many year before i judge by the grass-grown look of it out in front upon the open crest of the rise staff officer be group about two telescope mount on tripod a old man -- you could tell by the hunch of he shoulder he be old -- sit on a camp chair with he back to we and he face against the barrel of one of the telescope with he long dust-colored coat and the lacing of violent scarlet upon he cap and he upturned collar he make you think of one of those big gray african parrot that talk so fluently and bite so viciously but when get nimbly up he turn to greet we and be introduce the resemblance vanish there be nothing of the parrot about he now here be a man part watch dog and part hawk he cheek and the flange of he nostril be thickly hair-line with those little red-and-blue vein that be to be find in the texture of good american paper currency and in the face of elderly man who have live much out-of-door during they life he jowl be heavy and pendulous like a mastiff 's he frontal bone come down low and straight so that under the flat arch of the brow he small very bright agate-blue eye look out as from beneath half-closed shutter he hair be clip close to he scalp and the shape of he skull show round and bulgy not the skull of a thinker nor yet the skull of a creator just the skull of a natural-born fighting man the big ridgy vein in the back of he neck stand out like window-cord from a close smocking of fine wrinkle the neck itself be tan to a brickdust red a gnaw white mustache bristle on he upper lip he be tall without seem to be tall and broad without appear broad and he be old enough for a grandfather and spry enough for he own grandchild you know the type we civil war produce it in number at he throat be the blue star of the order of merit the very highest honor a german soldier can win and below it on he breast the inevitable black-and-white striped ribbon the one mean leadership and the other testify to individual valor in the tooth of danger it be excellency von zwehl commander of the seventh reserve corps of the western army the man who take maubeuge from the french and english and the man who in the same week hold the imperil german center against the french and english we lunch with the general and he staff on soup and sausage with a rare and precious belgian melon cut in thin salmon-tinted crescent to follow for dessert but before the lunch he take we and show we point this way and that with he little ride whip the theater wherein he have do a thing which he value more than the taking of a walled city indeed there be a certain elemental boy-like bearing of pride in he as he tell we the story if i be right in my date the defens of maubeuge cave in under the battering of the german jack johnson on September sixth and the citadel surrender September seventh on the follow day the eighth von zwehl get word that a sudden forward thrust of the ally threaten the german center at laon without wait for order he start to the relief he have available only nine thousand troops all reserve as many more shortly re-enforce he he march this small army -- small that be as army go these titan time -- for four day and three night in the last twenty-four hour of march the eighteen thousand cover more than forty english mile -- in the rain they come on this same plateau the one which we now face at six o'clock of the morning of September thirteenth and within a hour be engage against double or triple they number von zwehl hold off the enemy until a strengthen force reach he and then for three day with he face to the river and he back to the hill he fight out of a total force of forty thousand man he lose eight thousand and more in kill and wound but he save the german army from be split asunder between its shoulder-blade the enemy in proportion lose even more than he do he think the general have no english he tell we all this in german von theobald standing handily by to translate for he when we own scanty acquaintance with the language leave we puzzle we punish they well and they punish we well he add we capture a group of thirty-one scotchman -- all who be leave out of a battalion of six hundred and fifty and there be no commission officer left of that battalion a sergeant surrender they to my man they fight very well against we -- the scotch since then the groundswell of battle have sweep forward then backward until now as chance would have it general von zwehl once more have he headquarters on the identical spot where he have they four week before during he struggle to keep the german center from be pierce then it have be mainly infantry fighting at close range now it be the labored pound of heavy gun the push ahead of trench-work preparatory to another pitched battle consider what have take place here less than a month before the plain immediately before we seem peaceful enough nature certainly work mighty fast to cover up what man at war do true the yellow-green meadowland ahead of we be scuff and score minutely as though a myriad swine have root there for mast the gouge of wheel and foot be at the roadside under the broken hedge-row you see a littering of weather-beaten french knapsack and mire uniform coat but that be all new grass be spring up in the hoof track and in a pecking puny sort of way a effort be be make by certain french peasant within sight to get back to work in they waste truck patch near at hand i count three man and a old woman in the field bent over like worm on the crest above they stand this gray veteran of two invasion of they land aim with he ride whip the whip i believe signify dominion and sometimes brute force beyond the tableland and along the succession of gentle elevation which ringed it in to the south the pound of the field piece go steadily on while von zwehl lecture to we upon the congenial subject of what he here have do out yonder a matter of three or four english mile from we the big one be busy for a fact we could see the smoke cloud of each descend shell and the dust cloud of the explosion and of course we could hear it it never stop for a instant never abate for so much as a minute it have be go on this way for week it would surely go on this way for week yet to come but so far as we could discern the general pay it no heed -- he nor any of he staff it be he business but seemingly the business go well it be late that afternoon when we meet we third general and this meeting be quite by chance come back from a spin down the line we stop in a small village call amifontaine to let we chauffeur know affectionately as the human rabbit tinker with a leaky tire valve or something a young officer come up through the dusk to find out who we be and have find out he invite we into the chief house of the place and there in a stuffy little french parlor we be introduce in due form to general d'elsa the head of the twelfth reserve corps it turn out standing in a ceremonious ring with fill glass in we hand about a table which bear a flary lamp and a bottle of bad native wine we toast he and he toast we he be younger by ten year i should say than either von heeringen or von zwehl too young i judge to have get he training in the blood - and-iron school of bismarck and von moltke of which the other two must have be brag-scholar both of they i think be prussian but this general be a saxon from the south indeed as i now recall he say he home in peace time be in dresden he seem less simple of manner than they they in turn lack a certain flexibility and grace of bearing which be he but two thing in common they all three have and radiate from they -- a superb efficiency in the trade at which they work and a superb confidence in the tool with which they do the work this be rather a small man quick and supple in he movement he have a limited command of english and he appear deeply desirous that we american should have a good opinion of the behavior of he troops and that we should say as much in what we write for we fellow american to read come out of the house to reenter we automobile i see across the small square of the town which by now be quite in darkness the flare of a camp kitchen i want very much to examine one of these wheel cook wagon at close range a officer -- the same who have first approach we to examine we papers -- accompany I to explain its workings and to point out the various compartment where the coal be keep and the fuel and the two big sunken pot where the stew be cook and the coffee be brew the thing prove to be cumbersome which be german but it be most complete in detail and that take it be german too while the officer rattle the steel lid the cook himself stand rigidly alongside with he finger touch the seam of he trousers see by the glare of he own fire he seem a clod fit only to make soup and feed a fire box but by that same flickery light i see something on the breast of he grease-spattered blouse dangle a black-and-white ribbon with a black-and-white maltese cross fasten to it i marvel that a company cook should wear the iron cross of the second class and i ask the captain about it he laugh at the wonder that be evident in my tone if you will look more closely he say you will see that a good many of we cook already have win the iron cross since this war begin and a good many other will yet win it -- if they live we have no braver man in we army than these fellow they go into the trench at least twice a day under the hottest fire sometimes to carry hot coffee and hot food to the soldier who fight a good many of they have already be kill only the other day -- at la fere i think it be -- two of we cook at daybreak go so far forward with they wagon that they be almost inside the enemy 's line sixteen bewildered frenchman who have get separate from they company come straggle through a little forest and walk right into they the frenchman think the cook wagon with its short smoke funnel and its steel fire box be a new kind of machine gun and they throw down they gun and surrender the two cook bring they sixteen prisoner back to we line too but first one of they stand guard over the frenchman while the other carry the breakfast coffee to the man who have be all night in the trench they be good man those cook so at last i find out at second hand what one german soldier have do to merit the bestowal of the iron cross but as we come away i be in doubt on a certain point and for that matter be still in doubt on it : i be in doubt as to which of two man most fitly typify the spirit of the german army in this war -- the general feed he man by thousand into the maw of destruction because it be a order or the pot-wrestling private soldier the camp cook go to death with a coffee boiler in he hand -- because it be a order chapter 9 view a battle from a balloon she be anchor to earth in a good-sized field wood horizon the field on three of its edge and a sunken road bound it on the fourth she measure i should say at a offhand guess seventy-five foot from tip to tip lengthwise and she be perhaps twenty foot in diameter through she middle she be a bright yellow in color -- a varnished oily-looking yellow -- and in shape suggestive of a frankfurter at the end of she near the ground and on the side that be underneath -- for she swing you understand at a angle -- a swollen protuberance show as though a air bubble have get under the skin of the sausage during the packing and make a big blister she droop weakly amidship bend and sway this way and that and as we come under she and look up we see that the skin of the belly keep shrink in and wrinkle up in the unmistakable pang of acute cramp colic she have a sickly deplete aspect elsewhere and altogether be most flabby and unreliable look yet this as i learn subsequently be she normal appearance be in the business of spy she practice deceit with the deliberate intent of seem to be what emphatically she be not she counterfeit chronic invalidism and she perform competently she be a observation balloon of the pattern privily choose by the german general staff before the beginning of the war for the use of the german signal corps on this particular date and occasion she operate at a point of the highest strategic importance that point be the center of the german battle line along the river aisne she have be station here now for more than a week -- that be to say ever since she predecessor be destroy in a ball of flame fume as a result of have a bomb fling through the flimsy cloth envelope by a coursing and accurate aviator of the enemy no doubt she would continue to be station here until some such mischance befall she too on observation balloon in time of war no casualty insurance be available at any rate of premium i believe those who ride in they be also regard as unsuitable risk this be highly interesting to hear and for we journalistic purpose very valuable to know but speak personally i may say that the thing which most nearly concerned I for the moment be this : i have just be invite to take a trip aloft in this wabbly great wienerwurst with its paint silk cuticle and its gaseous vitals -- and have on impulse accept i be inform at the time and have since be reinform more than once that i be probably the only civilian spectator who have enjoy such a privilege during the present european war assuredly to date and to the best of my knowledge and belief i be the only civilian who have be so favor by the german well i trust i be not hoggish possess as it do this air of uniqueness the distinction be worth much to I personally i would not take anything for the experience but i do not think i shall take it again even if the chance should come my way which very probably it will not it be mid-afternoon and all day since early breakfast we have be work we way in automobile toward this destination already my brain chamber more impression all jumble together in a mass than i could possibly hope to get sort out and grade up and classify in a month of try yet in a way the day have be disappointing for as i may have set forth before the nearer we come to the actual fight the closer in touch we get with the battle itself the less we seem to see of it i take it this be true of nearly all battle fight under modern military principle ten mile in the rear or even twenty mile be really a better place to be if you be seek to fix in you mind a reasonably full picture of the scope and effect and consequence of the hideous thing call war back there you see the new troops go in gird themselves for the grapple as they go you see the re-enforcement come up you see the supplies hurry forward and the spare gun and the extra equipment and all the rest of it you see and can after a dim fashion grasp mentally the thrust onward movement of this highly scientific and most unromantic industry which half the world begin practice in the fall of 1914 finally you see the finish fabric of the trade come back and by that i mean the dribble stream of the wound and in the field and wood through which you pass the dead lie in windrow where they fall at the front you see only for the main part man engage in the most tedious the most exacting and seemingly the most futile form of day labor -- toiling in filth and foulness and a desperate driven haste on a job that many of they will never live to see finish -- if it be ever finish work under taskmaster who spare they not -- neither do they spare themselves put through a dreary contract whereof the chief reward be weariness and the common coinage of payment be death outright or death linger that be a battle in these day that be war so twistiwise be we route and so rapidly do we pursue it after we leave the place where we take lunch that i confess i lose all sense of direction it seem to I we general course be eastward i discover afterward it be southwesterly at any rate we eventually find ourselves in a road that wind between high grassy bank along a great natural terrace just below the level of the plateau in front of laon we see a few farmhouse all desolate by shellfire and all desert and a succession of empty field and patch of woodland none of the native be in sight through fear of prying hostile eye the german have see fit to clear they out of this immediate vicinity anyhow a majority of they doubtlessly run away when fight first start here three week earlier the german have get rid of those who remain likewise of troops there be very few to be see we do meet one squad of red cross man march afoot through the dust they be all fully arm as be the way with the german field-hospital helper and for all i know to the contrary that may be the way with the field-hospital helper of the ally too though i have often see it the cross on the sleeve-band of a man who bear a revolver in he belt or a rifle on he arm have always strike I as a most incongruous thing the noncommissioned officer in charge of the squad -- chief orderly i suppose you might call he -- hold by leash four red cross dog in belgium back in August i have see so-called dog battery go into louvain on the day the belgian army or what be leave of it fall back into brussels i pass a valley where many dog be hitch to small machine gun and i could not help wonder what would happen to the artillery formation and what to the discipline of the pack if a rabbit should choose that moment for dart across the battle front these however be the first dog i have find engage in hospital - corps employment they be big wolfish-looking hound shaggy and sharp-nosed and each of the four wear a collar of bell on he neck and a cloth harness on he shoulder with the red maltese cross display on its top and side they business be to go to the place where fighting have take place and search out the fall at this business they be repute to be highly efficient the german have find they especially useful for the german field uniform which have the merit of merge into the natural background at a short distance become through that very protective coloration a disadvantage when its wearer drop wound and unconscious on the open field in a poor light the litter bearer might search within a few rod of he and never see he but where the faulty eyesight fail the nose of the dog sniff the human taint in the air and the dog make the work of rescue thorough and complete at least we be tell so presently we automobile round a bend in the road and the observation balloon which until that moment we have be unable to glimpse by reason of a intervene formation of ridge reveal itself before we the suddenness of its appearance be startling we do not see it until we be within a hundred yard of it at once we realize how perfect a abide place this be for a thing which offer so fine and loom a target moreover the balloon be most effectively guard against attack at close range we become aware of that fact when we dismount from the automobile and be clamber up the steep bank alongside soldier materialize from everywhere like dusty specter but fall back salute when they see that officer accompany we on advice we have already throw away we light cigar but two noncommissioned officer feel it to be they bounden duty to warn we against striking match in that neighborhood you dare not take chance with a weave bag that be pack with many hundred cubic foot of gas at the moment of we arrival the balloon be draw down so near the earth that its distorted bottommost extremity dip and twist slackly within fifty or sixty foot of the grass the upper end reach much farther into the air undergo convulsive writhing and contortion as a intermittent breeze come over the shelter treetop and buffet it in puff almost beneath the balloon six big draft horse stand hitch in pair to a stout wagon frame on which a huge wooden drum be mount round this drum a wire cable be coil and a length of the cable stretch like a snake across the field to where it end in a swivel make fast to the bottom of the ride car it be not strictly speak a ride car it be a straight-up-and-down basket of tough light wicker no larger and very little deeper than a ordinarily fair - size hamper for soil linen indeed that be what it remind one of -- a clothesbasket group about the team and the wagon be soldier to the number of perhaps a third of a company half a dozen of they stand about the basket hold it steady -- or try to heavy sandbag hang pendent - wise about the upper rim of the basket look very much like so many canvased ham but even with these drag on it and in spite of the grip of the man on the guy rope of its rig it bump and bound uneasily to the continual rock of the gas bag above it every moment or two it would lift itself a foot or so and tilt and jerk and then come back again with a thump that make it shiver of furnishings the interior of the car contain nothing except a telephone fix against one side of it a pair of field glass swing in a sort of harness and a strip of tough canvas loop across halfway down in it the operator when weary by stand might sit astride this canvas saddle with he leg cramp under he while he spy out the land with he eye which would then be just above the top of he wicker nest and while he speak over the telephone the wire of the telephone escape through a hole under he foot and run to a conceal station at the far side of the field which in turn communicate with the main exchange at headquarters three mile away which in its turn radiate other wire to all quarter of the battle front now the wire be neatly coil on the ground beside the basket a sergeant stand over they to prevent any careless foot from step on the precious strand he guard they as jealously as a hen guard she brood the magazine contain retort of specially prepared gas for recharge the envelope when evaporation and leakage have reduce the volume below the lifting and float point be nowhere in sight it must have be somewhere near by but we see no sign of it nor do we guide for the day offer to show we its whereabouts however know what i do of the german system of do thing i will venture the assertion that it be snugly hide and stoutly protect these detail i have time to take in when there come across the field to join we a tall young officer with a three week ' growth of stubby black beard on he face a genial and captivating gentleman be lieutenant brinkner und meiningen and i enjoy my meeting with he and often since that day in my thought i have wish he well however i doubt whether he will be live by the time these line see publication it be a exciting life a balloon operator in the german army life but it be not as a rule a long one lieutenant meiningen be successor to a man who be burn to death in mid-air a week before and on the day before a french airman have drop a bomb from the cloud that miss this same balloon by a margin of less than a hundred yard -- close marksmanship consider that the airman in question be seven or eight thousand foot aloft and move at the rate of a mile or so a minute when he make he cast it be the lieutenant who say he have authority to take one of we number up with he and it be i who chance to be nearest to the balloon when he extend the invitation some one -- a friend -- remove from between my tooth the unlighted cigar i hold there for fear i might forget and try to light it and somebody else -- a stranger to I -- suggest that perhaps i be too heavy for a passenger by that time however a kindly corporal have boost I up over the rim of the basket and help I to squeeze through the thick net of guy line and there i be stand inside that overgrown clotheshamper which come up breast high on I -- and brinkner und meiningen be swing himself nimbly in beside I that basket be mean to hold but one man it make a wondrously snug fit for two the both of we be full-sized adult at that we stand back to back and to address the other each must need speak over he shoulder the canvas saddle be between we dangle against the calf of we leg and the telephone be in front of the lieutenant where he could reach the transmitter with he lip by stoop a little the soldier begin unhook the sandbag the sergeant who guard the telephone wire take up a strand of it and hold it loosely in he hand ready to pay it out under I i feel the basket heave gently look up i see that the balloon be no longer a crooked sausage she have become a big soft yellow summer squash with a attenuate neck the flaccid abdomen flinch in and puff out and the snout wabble to and fro the lieutenant begin tell I thing in badly broken but painstaking english -- such thing for example as that the baglike protuberance just above we head at the bottom end of the envelope contain air which be heavier than gas serve as a balance to hold she head up in the wind and keep she from folding in on herself also that it be he duty to remain aloft at the end of he tether as long as he could meantime study the effect of the german shell-fire on the enemy 's position and telephone down instruction for the better aim of the gun -- a job wherein the aeroplane scout ably reenforce he since they could range at will whereas he position be comparatively fix and stationary also i remember he say with a tinge of polite regret in he tone that he be sorry i have not put on a uniform overcoat with shoulder strap on it before board the car because as he take pain to explain in the event of we cable parting and of we drift over the ally ' line and then descend he might possibly escape but i should most likely be shoot on the spot as a spy before i have a chance to explain however he add consolingly those be possibility most remote the rope be not likely to break and if it do we both should probably be dead before we ever reach the earth that last statement sink deep into my consciousness but i fear i do not hearken so attentively as i ought to the continuation of the lieutenant 's conversation because right in the middle of he remark something have begin to happen a officer have step up alongside to tell I that very shortly i should undoubtedly be quite seasick -- or rather skysick -- because of the pitch about of the basket when the balloon reach the end of the cable and i be try to listen to he with one ear and to my prospective travel companion with the other when i suddenly realize that the officer 's face be no longer on a level with mine it be several foot below mine no it be not -- it be several yard below mine now he be look up toward we shout out he word with he hand funnel about he mouth for a speaking trumpet and at every word he utter he shrink into himself grow shorter and shorter it be not that we seem to be move we seem to be stand perfectly still without any motion of any sort except a tiny teeter motion of the hamper-basket while the earth and what be on it fall rapidly away from beneath we at once all sense of perspective become distorted when on the roof of a tall building this distortion have never seem to I so great i imagine this be because the building remain stationary and a balloon move almost directly below we be one of we party wear a soft hat with a flattish brim it appear to I that almost instantly he shoulder and body and leg vanish nothing remain of he but he hat which look exactly like a thumb tack drive into a slightly tilted draw board the tilted drawing board be the field the field seem sloped now instead of flat across the sunken road be another field its owner i presume have start to turn it up for fall planting when the army come along and chase he away so there remain a wide plow strip and on each side of it a narrower strip of unplowed earth even as i peered downward at it this field be transform into a width of brown corduroy trim with green velvet for a rudder we carry a long flap clothesline arrangement like the tail of a kite to the lower end of which be thread seven yellow-silk device suggest inverted sunshade without handle these thing must have be space on the tail at equal distance apart but as they rise from the earth and follow after we whipping in the wind the uppermost one become a big umbrella turn inside out the second be half of a pumpkin the third be a yellow soup plate the fourth be a poppy bloom and the remain three be just amber bead of diminish size probably it take longer but if you ask I i should say that not more than two or three minute have pass before the earth stop slip away and we fetch up with a profound and disconcerting jerk the balloon have reach the tip of she hitch line she rock and twist and bent half double in the pang of a fearful tummy-ache and at every paroxysm the car lurch in sympathy only to be bring up short by the pull of the taut cable so that we two wedge in together as we be nevertheless jostle each other violently i be a poor sailor both by instinct and training by rights and by precedent i should have be violently ill on the instant but i do not have time to be ill my fellow traveler all this while be point out this thing and that to I -- show how the telephone operate how he field glass poise just before he eye be swing and balance on a delicately adjust suspend pivot tell I how on a perfectly clear day -- this October day be slightly hazy -- we could see the eiffel tower in pari and the cathedral at rheim gyrate he hand to explain the manner in which the horse trot away from we as we climb upward have give to the drum on the wagon a reverse motion so that the cable be pay out evenly and regularly but i be afraid i do not listen closely my eye be so busy that my ear loaf on the job for once in my life -- and doubtlessly only once -- i saw now understandingly a battle front it be spread before I -- line and dot and dash on a big green and brown and yellow map why the whole thing be as plain as a chart i have a reserved seat for the biggest show on earth to be sure it be a gallery seat for the terrace from which we start stand fully five hundred foot above the bottom of the valley and we have ascend approximately seven hundred foot above that give we a altitude of say twelve hundred foot in all above the level of the river but a gallery seat suit I it suit I perfectly the great plateau stretch from the high hill behind we to the river in front of we portray itself when view from aloft as a shallow bowl alternately groove by small depression and corrugated by small ridge here and there be thin woodland look exactly like scrubby clothesbrush the field be checkered square and oblong and a ruin village in the distance seem a jumbled handful of child 's gray and red block the german battery appear now to be directly beneath we -- some of they though in reality i imagine the nearest one must have be nearly a mile away on a bee line they form a irregular horseshoe with the open end of it toward we there be a gap in the horseshoe where the calk should have be the german trench for the most part lay inside the encircle line of battery in shape they rather suggest a u turn upside down yet it be hard to ascribe to they any real shape since they zigzag so crazily i could tell though there be sanity in this seeming madness for nearly every trench be join at a acute angle with its neighbor so that a man or a body of man start at the rear out of danger might move to the very front of the fight zone and all the time be well sheltered so far as i could make out there be but few break in the sequence of communication one of these break be almost directly in front of I as i stand face the south the battery of the ally and they infantry trench be so much farther away be less plainly visible i could discern they location without be able to grasp they general arrangement between the nearer infantry trench of the two oppose force be tiny dot in the ground each define by a infinitesimal hillock of yellow earth heap before it -- observation pit these where certain pick man who do not expect to live very long anyway hide themselves away to keep tally on the effect of the shell which go singing past just over they head to fall among the enemy who may be only a few hundred foot or a few hundred yard away from the observer it be a excessively busy afternoon among the gun they speak continually -- now this battery go now that now two or three or a dozen together -- and the sound of they come up to we in clap and roar like summer thunder sometimes when a battery close by let go i could watch the thin shreddy trail of fine smoke that mark the arched flight of a shrapnel bomb almost from the very mouth of the gun clear to where it burst out into a fluffy white powder puff inside the enemy 's position contrariwise i could see how shell from the enemy cross those shell in the air and curved downward to scatter they iron spray among the german in the midst of all this would come a sharp spattering sound as though hail in the height of the thunder shower have fall on a tin roof and that i learn mean infantry firing in a trench somewhere for a while i watch some german soldier move forward through a criss-cross of trench i take they to be fresh man go in to relieve other man who have see a period of service under fire at first they suggest mole crawl through plow furrow then as they progress onward they shrink to the smallness of gray grub-worm advance one behind another my eye stray beyond they a fair distance and fall on a row of tiny scarlet dot like cochineal bug show minutely but clearly against the green-yellow face of a ridgy field well inside the forward battery of the french and english at that same instant the lieutenant must have see the crawl red line too he point to it frenchman he say french infantryman 's trousers one can not make out they coat but they red trousers show as they wriggle forward on they face better than ever before i realize the idiocy of send man to fight in garment that make vivid target of they my companion may have come up for pleasure but if business obtrude itself on he he do not neglect it he bent to he telephone and speak briskly into it he use german but after a fashion i make out what he say he be direct the attention of somebody to the activity of those red trousers i intend to see what would follow on this but at this precise moment a sufficiently interesting occurrence come to pass at a place within much clearer eye range the gray grub-worm have shove ahead until they be gray ant and now all the ant concentrate into a swarm and leave the trench begin to move in a slanting direction toward a patch of wood far over to we leave some of they i think get there some of they do not certain puff-ball of white smoke and one big smudge of black smoke which last signify a bomb of high explosive break over they and among they hide all from sight for a space of seconds dust cloud succeed the smoke then the dust lift slowly those ant be not to be see they have altogether vanish it be as though a anteater have come forth invisibly and eat they all up marvel at this phenomenon and unable to convince myself that i have see man destroy and not insect i turn my head south again to watch the red ladybug in the field lo they be go too either they have reach shelter or a painful thing have befall they the telephone speak a brisk warning i think it make a click sound i be sure it do not ring but in any event it call attention to itself the other man clap he ear to the receiver and take heed to the word that come up the dangling wire and snap back a answer i think we should return at once he say to I over he shoulder be you sufficiently weary i be not sufficiently wearied -- i be not weary at all -- but he be the captain of the ship and i be not even pay for my passage the car jerk beneath we unsteady foot and heel over and i have the sensation of be in a elevator that have start downward suddenly and at a angle to boot the balloon resist the pressure from below it curl up its tail like a fat bumblebee try to sting itself and the guy rope to which i hold with both hand snap in imitation of the rigging of a sailboat in a fair breeze plainly the balloon wish to remain where it be or go farther but the pull of the cable be steady and hard and the world begin to rise up to meet we near the earth it strike I that we be make a remarkably speedy return i craned my neck to get a view of what be directly beneath the six-horse team be advance toward we at a brisk canter and the drum turn fast take up the slack of the tether but as though not satisfy with this rate of progress several soldier be run back and jump up to haul in the rope the sergeant who take care of the telephone be hard put to it to coil down the twin wire he skitter about over the grass with the liveliness of a cricket many soil hand grasp the floor of we hamper and ease the jar of its contact with the earth those same hand have redrap the rim with sandbag and have help we to clamber out from between the stay rope when up come the young captain who spell the lieutenant as a aerial spy he come at a run between the two of they ensue a sharp interchange of short german sentence i gather the sense of what pass i do not see it now say in effect my late travel mate stare skyward and turn he head nor do i answer the captain i think it be yonder he flirt a thumb backward and upward over he shoulder be you sure you see it no not sure say the captain i call you down at the first alarm and right after that it disappear i think but i shall make sure he snap a order to the soldier and vault nimbly into the basket the horse turn about and move off and the balloon rise as for the lieutenant he spin round and run toward the edge of the field fumble at he belt for he private field glass as he run wonder what all this bother be about -- though i have a vague idea regard its meaning -- i watch the ascent i should say the bag have reach a height of five hundred foot when behind I a hundred yard or so away a soldier shriek out excitedly farther along another voice take up the outcry from every side of the field come shout the field be ringed with clamor it dawn on I that this spot be even more efficiently guard than i have conceive it to be the driver of the wagon swing he lumbering team about with all the strength of he arm and back again come the six horse gallop now so thickly mass be the man who snatch at the cable and so eagerly do they grab for it that the simile of a hot handball scrimmage flash into my thought i will venture that balloon never do a faster homing job than it do then fifty man be point aloft now all of they cry out as they point : flyer french flyer i see it it be a monoplane it have i judge just emerge from a cloudbank to the southward it be head directly toward we field it be high up -- so high up that i feel momentarily amaze that all those german could distinguish it as a french flyer rather than as a english flyer at that distance as i look and as all of we look the balloon basket hit the earth and be make fast and in that same instant a cannon boom somewhere well over to the right even as someone who know sing out to we that this be the balloon cannon in the german aviation field back of the town open up a tiny ball of smoke appear against the sky seemingly quite close to the dart flyer and blossom out with downy dainty white petal like a flower the monoplane veer wheel and begin to drive in a wriggle twist course the balloon cannon speak again four mile away to the eastward its fellow in another aviation camp let go and the sound of its discharge come to we faintly but distinctly another smoke flower unfold in the heaven somewhat below the dart airship both gun be in action now each fire at six-second interval all about the flit target the smokeball burst -- above it below it to this side of it and to that they polka-dot the heaven in the area through which the frenchman scud they look like a bed of white water lily and he like a black dragonfly skimming among the lily it be a pretty sight and as thrilling a one as i have ever see i can not analyze my emotion as i view the spectacle let alone try to set they down on paper alongside of this big-game hunting be a commonplace thing for this be big-game hunting of a magnificent kind new to the world -- revolving cannon with a range of from seven to eight thousand foot try to bring down a human be out of the very cloud he run for he life once i think they have he a shell burst seemingly quite close to he and he machine dip far to one side and drop through space at that angle for some hundred of foot apparently a yell of exultation rise from the watch german who know that a explosion close to a aeroplane be often sufficient through the force of air concussion alone to crumple the flimsy wing and bring it down even though none of the fly shrapnel from the burst bomb actually touch the operator or the machine however they whoop they joy too soon the flyer right rise dart confusingly to the right then to the left and then bore straight into a woolly white cloudrack and be go the moment it disappear the two balloon cannon cease firing and i take stock of my own sensation find myself quiver all over and quite hoarse i must have do some yell myself but whether i root for the flyer to get away safely or for the cannon to hit he i can not for the life of I say i can only trust that i preserved my neutrality and root for both subsequently i decide in my own mind that from within the ally ' line the frenchman see we -- mean the lieutenant and myself -- in the air and come forth with intent to bombard we from on high that see we descend he hide in a cloud ambush venture out once more with he purpose renew when the balloon reascend bear the captain i like to entertain that idea because it give I a feeling of have share to some degree in a big adventure as for the captain and the lieutenant they advance no theory whatever the thing be all in the day 's work to they it have happen before i have no doubt it have happen many time since chapter 10 in the trench before rheim after my balloon-riding experience what follow be in the nature of a anticlimax -- be bind to be anti-climactic yet the remainder of the afternoon be not without action not a hour later as we stand in a battery of small field gun -- gun i have watch in operation from my lofty gallery seat -- another flyer or possibly the same one we have already see appear in the sky come now in a long swinging sweep from the southwest and make apparently for the very spot where we party have station itself to watch the trim little battery perform it have already drop some form of deadly souvenir we judge for we see a jet of black smoke go geyser up from a woodland where a german corps commander have he field headquarters just after the airship pass over that particular patch of timber as it swirl down the wind in we direction the vigilant balloon gun again get its range and to the throbbing tune of they twin booming it duck and dodge away execute irregular and hurry upward spiral until the cloud-fleece swallow it up the driver of that monoplane be a persistent chap i be incline to believe he be the selfsame aviator who venture well inside the german line the following morning while at breakfast in the prefecture at laon we hear the cannoneer-sharpshooter when they open on he and as we run to the window -- we american i mean the german officer breakfast with we remain to finish they coffee -- we see a colonel whom we have meet the night before sit on a bench in the old prefecture flower garden and look up into the sky through the glass that every german officer of whatsoever degree carry with he at all time he look and look then he lower he glass and put they back into they case and take up the book he have be read he get away again say the colonel regretfully see we at the window plucky fellow that i hope we kill he soon the airman say he be a frenchman but my guess be that he be english and then he go on read get back to the afternoon before i must add that it be not a bomb which the fly man throw into the edge of the wood he have a surprise for he german adversary that day soon after we leave the stand of the field gun a civilian red cross man halt we machine to show we a new device for kill man it be a steel dart of the length and thickness of a fountain pen and of much the same aspect it be point like a needle at one end and at the other be fashion into a tiny rudder arrangement the purpose of this be to hold it upright -- point downward -- as it descend it be a innocent-looking device -- that dart but it be deadlier than it seem that flyer at whom we gun be firing a while ago drop this explain the civilian he pitch out a bomb that must have contain hundred of these dart and the bomb be time to explode a thousand or more foot above the earth and scatter the dart some of they fall into a cavalry troop on the road lead to la fere hurt anyone ach but yes hurt many and kill several -- both man and horse one dart hit a trooper on top of he head it go through he helmet through he skull he brain he neck he body he leg -- all the way through he lengthwise it go it come out of he leg split open he horse 's flank and stick in the hard road i myself see the man afterward he die so quickly that he hand still hold he bridle rein after he fall from the saddle and the horse drag he -- he corpse rather -- many foot before the finger relax the officer who be with we be tremendously interested -- not interested mind you in the death of that trooper spit from the heaven by a steel pencil but interested in the thing that have do the work it be the first dart they have see indeed i think until then this weapon have not be use against the german in this particular area of the western theater of war these officer pass it about finger it in turn and comment on the design of it and the possibility of its use typically french the senior of they say at length hand it back to its owner the red cross man -- a very clever idea too but it might be better i think he ponder a moment then add with the racial complacence that belong to a german military man when he consider military matter : no doubt we shall adopt the notion but we 'll improve on the pattern and the method of discharge it the french usually lead the way in aerial invention but the german invariably perfect they the day wind up and round out most fittingly with a trip eastward along the line to the german siege investment in front of rheim we run for a while through damage french hamlet each with its soldier garrison to make up for the inhabitant who have flee and then a little later through a less well-populated district in the field for long stretch nothing stir except pheasant feed on the neglect grain and big noisy magpie the road be empty too except that there be wreck shell of automobile and bloated carcass of dead troop horse when the german in they campaigning smash up a automobile -- and travel at the rate they do there must be many smash -- they capsize it at the roadside strip it of its tire draw off the precious gasoline pour oil over it and touch a match to it what remain offer no salvage to friend or enemy either the horse rot where they drop unless the country people choose to put the body underground we count the char cadaver of fifteen automobile and twice as many dead horse during that ride the smell of horseflesh spoil the good air when pass through a wood the smell be always heavier we hope it be only dead horse we smell there when there have be fight in france or belgium almost any thicket will give up hideous grisly secret to the man who go search there man sorely wound in the open share one trait at least with the lower animal the die creature -- whether man or beast -- dread to lie and die in the naked field it drag itself in among the tree if it have the strength i believe every woodland in northern france be a poison place and remain so until the freezing of winter seal up its abomination under ice and frost near rheim we turn into a splendid straight highway border by tree where the late afternoon sunlight filter through the dead leaf which still hang from the bough and dapple the yellow road with black splotch until it make you think of jaguar pelt midway of we course here we meet troops move toward we in force first as usual come scout on bicycle and motorcycle one young chap have weave sheaf of dahlia and red peony into the frame of he wheel and through the clump of quiver blossom the barrel of he rifle show like a black snake in a bouquet he tell we that troops be come behind go to the extreme right wing -- a good many thousand of troops he think ordinarily uhlan would have follow behind the bicycle man but this time a regiment of brunswick hussar form the advance guard ride four abreast and make a fine show what with they lace gray jacket and they lane of nod lance and they tall woolly busby each with its grinning brass death 's - head set into the front of it there be a blithe young officer who insist on wheeling out of the line and halt we and pass the time of day with we i imagine he want to exercise he small stock of english word well it need the exercise the skull-and-bones poison label on he cap make a wondrous contrast with the smile eye and the long humorous wrinkled-up nose below it a miserable country he say with a sweep of he arm which comprehend all northwestern europe from the german border to the sea -- so little there be to eat my belly -- she be mostly empty always but on the yesterday i have the much great fortune i buy I a swine -- what you call he -- a pork ah yes a pig i buy I a pig he be a living pig very noisy as you say -- very loud i bring he twenty kilometer in a automobile and all the time he struggle to be free and he cry out all the time it be very droll -- not -- I and the living pig which ride both together twenty kilometer we take some letter from he to he mother and sweetheart to be mail when we get back on german soil and he spur on beam back at we and wave he free hand over he head for half a hour or so we travel rapidly pass the column which be make up of cavalry artillery and baggage train i suppose the infantry be go by another road the dragoon sing german march song as they ride by but the artilleryman be dour and silent lot for the most part repeatedly i notice that the man who work the big german gun be rarely so cheerful as the man who belong to the other wing of the service certainly it be true in this instance we halt two mile north of rheim in the front line of the german work here be a little shattered village its name i believe be brimont and here also command the road stand a ruin fortress of a obsolete last-century pattern shellfire have batter it into a gruel of shattered red masonry but german officer be camp within its more habitable part and light gun be mount in the moat the tree thereabout have be mow down by the french artillery from within the city so that the highway be litter with they top also the explosive have dig big gouge in the earth wherever you look you see that the soil be full of small raggedy crater shrapnel be drop intermittently in the vicinity therefore we leave we car behind the shelter of the ancient fort and proceed cautiously afoot until we reach the frontmost trench evidently the german count on stay there a good while the man have dig out cave in the wall of the trench bedding they with straw and fitting they with door take from the wreckage of the house of the village we inspect one of these shelter it have earthen wall and a sod roof fairly water-tight and a green window shutter to rest against the entrance for a windbreak six man sleep here and the wag of the squad have take chalk and letter the word kaiserhof cafe on the shutter the trench be from seven to eight foot deep but by climb up into the little scarp of the sharpshooter and rest we elbow in niche in the earth meantime keep we head down to escape the attention of certain frenchman who be report to be in a wood half a mile away we could with the aid of we glass make out the building in rheim some of which be then on fire -- particularly the great cathedral view from that distance it do not appear to be badly damage one of the tower have apparently be shear away and the roof of the nave be burn -- we could tell that we be too far away of course to judge of the injury to the carving and to the great rise window already during that week from many source we have hear the german ' version of the shell of rheim cathedral they claim be that they purposely spare the pile from the bombardment until they find the defender have signal man in the tower that twice they send officer under flag of truce to urge the french to withdraw they signaler and only fire on the building when both these warning have be disregard cease to fire as soon as they have drive the enemy from the tower i do not vouch for this story but we hear it very frequently now from one of the young officer who have escort we into the trench we be hear it all over again with elaboration when a shrapnel shell from the town drop and burst not far behind we and rifle bullet begin to plump into the earthen bank a little to the right of we so we promptly go away from there we be noncombatant and nowise concern in the exist controversy but we remember the plaintive word of the chinese minister at brussels when he call on we minister -- brand whitlock -- to ascertain what whitlock would advise do in case the advance german fire on the city whitlock suggest to he oriental brother that he retire to he official residence and hoist the flag of he country over it thereby make it neutral and protected territory but mister whitlock murmur the puzzle chinaman the cannon -- he have no eye we ride back to laon through the fall dusk the western sky be all a deep saffron pink -- the color of a salmon 's belly -- and we could hear the constant blaspheming of the big siege gun take up the evening cannonade along the center pretty soon we catch up with the column that be head for the right wing at that hour it be still in motion which probably mean force march for a indefinite time view against the sunset yellow the figure of the dragoon stand up black and clean as conventionalized and regular as though they have all be stencil on that background see next the round spiked helmet of the cannoneer outline in that weird half-light i know of what those bob head remind I they be like picture of roman centurion within a few minute the afterglow lose its yellowish tone and burn as a deep red flare as we swing off into a side road the column be head right into that redness and turn to black cinder-shape as they ride it be as though they march into a fiery furnace tread the crimson path of glory -- which be not glorious and probably never be but which lead most unerringly to the grave a week later when we learn what have happen on the right wing and of how the german have fare there under the batter of the ally the thought of that open furnace door come back to I i think of it yet-often chapter 11 war de luxe i think say a colonel of the ordnance department as we come out into the open after a good but a hurry and fly-ridden breakfast -- i think he say in he excellent saxonize english that it would be as well to look at we telephone exchange first of all it perhaps might prove of some small interest to you with that he lead the way through a jumble of corridor to a far corner of the prefecture of laon perch high on the hill of laon and form for the moment the keystone of the arch of the german center so that be how the most crowded day in a reasonably well-crowded newspaperman 's life begin for I -- with a visit to a room which have in other day be somebody 's reception parlor we come upon twelve soldier-operator sit before portable switchboard with metal transmitter clamp upon they head give and take message to and from all the corner and cranny of the mid-battle-front this little room be the solar plexus of the army to it all the tingling nerve of the mighty organism run and in it all the ganglion center at two side of the room the wall be lace with silk-covered wire applique as thickly and as closely and as intricately as the thread in old point lace and over these wire the gray-coated operator could talk -- and do talk pretty constantly -- with all the trench and all the battery and all the supply camp and with the general of brigade and of division and of corps one wire run upstairs to the over-general 's sleep quarter and end so we be tell in a receiver that hang upon the headboard of he bed another stretch by relay point to berlin and still another run to the headquarters of the general staff where the kaiser be somewhere down the right wing and so on and so forth if war be a business these time instead of a chivalric call then surely this be the main office and clearing house of the business to we novice eye the wire seem snarl -- snarl inextricably hopelessly eternally -- and we say as much but the ordnance colonel say behind this apparent disorder a most careful and particular orderliness be hide away give a hour 's notice these busy man who wear those steel vise clamp upon they ear could disconnect the line pull down and reel in the wire pack the battery and the exchange and have the entire outfit load upon automobile for speedy transmission elsewhere have see what i have see of the german military system i could not find it in my heart to doubt this miracle have already become commonplace what might have be epic once be incidental now i hearken and believe at he command a sergeant plug in certain stop upon a keyboard and then when the colonel take a hand telephone up from a table have talk into it in german he pass it into my hand the captain at the other end of the line know english he say i have just tell he you wish to speak with he for a minute i press the rubber disk to my ear hello i say hello come back the thin-strained answer this be such and such a trench -- give the number -- in front of cerny what do you want to know what be the news there i stammer fatuously a pleasant little laugh tinkle through the strainer oh it be fairly quiet now say the voice yesterday afternoon shrapnel fire rather muss we up but to-day nothing have happen we be just lie quiet and enjoy the fine weather we have have much rain lately and my man be enjoy the change so that be all the talk i have with a man who have for week be live in a hole in the ground with a ditch for a exercise ground and the brilliant prospects of a violent death for he hourly and daily entertainment afterward when it be too late i thought of a number of lead question which i should have put to that captain undoubtedly there be a good story in he could you get it out we come through a courtyard at the north side of the building and the courtyard be crowd with automobile of all the known european size and pattern and shape -- automobile for scout duty with saw-edged steel prow curve up over the driver ' seat to catch and cut dangling wire automobile fit as travel pharmacy and need only red - and-green light to be regular prescription drug store automobile - ambulance rig with stretcher and first-aid kit automobile for carry ammunition and capable of move at tremendous speed for tremendous distance automobile machine gun or machine-gun automobile just as suit you automobile cannon and a automobile mail wagon all hole inside like honeycomb with two field-postmen stand up in it back to back sort out the contents of snugly packed pouch and every third letter be not a letter strictly speak at all but a small flat parcel contain chocolate or cigar or handkerchief or sock or even light sweater -- such gift as might be send to the soldier stamp-free from any part of the german empire i wonder how man manage to wage war in the day before the automobile two wait car receive we party and we guide and we driver and we go corkscrew down the hill traverse crooked way that be astonishingly full of german soldier and astonishingly free of french townspeople either the citizen keep to they closed-up house or have run away at the come of the enemy they have not yet dare to return although so far as i might tell there be no danger of they be mistreat by the gray-back reach the plain which be below the city we streak westward we destination be the field wireless station nothing happen on the way except that we overtake a file of slightly wound prisoner who have be treat at the front be now bind for a prison in a convent yard where they would stay until a train carry they off to munster or dusseldorf for confinement until the end of the war i count they -- two english tommy two french officer one lone belgian -- how he get that far down into france nobody could guess -- and twenty-eight french cannoneer and infantryman include some north african every man jack of they be bandage either about the head or about the arm or else he favor a injured leg as he hobble slowly on eight guard be nurse they along they bayonet be socket in they carbine barrel no doubt the magazine of the carbine be pack with those neat brass capsule which carry dose of potential death but the guard except for the moral effect of the thing might just as well have be bare-handed none of the prisoner could have run away even have he be so mind the poor devil be almost past walk let alone run they would not even look up as we go by they the day be do of the courier who ride horseback with order in he belt and be wing in mid-flight and the day of the secret messenger who try to creep through the hostile picket line with cipher dispatch in he shoe and be capture and order shot at sunrise be go too except in civil war melodrama modern military science have wipe they out along with most of the other picturesque fol-de-rol of the old game of war band no longer play the force into the fight -- indeed i have see no more band afield with the dun-colored file of the german than i might count on the finger of my two hand and flag except on rare show-off occasion do not float above the head of the column and officer dress as nearly as possible like common soldier and the courier 's work be do with much less glamour but with in - finitely greater dispatch and certainty by the telephone and by the aeroplane man and most of all by the air current of the wireless equipment we miss the gallant courier but then the wireless be worth see too it stand in a trample turnip field not very far beyond the ruin porte st martin at the end of the rue st martin and before we come to it we pass the monument des instituteurs erect in 1899 -- as the inscription upon it tell we -- by a grateful populace to the memory of three school teacher of laon who for have raise a revolt of student and civilian against the invader in the franco-prussian war be take and bind and shoot against a wall in accordance with the system of deal with ununiformed enemy which the german develop hereabouts in 1870 and perfect hereabouts in 1914 a fade wreath which evidently be week old lay at the bronze foot of the three figure but the institute behind the monument be a institute no longer it have become over night as it be a lazaret for the wound above its door the red cross flag and the german flag be cross -- emblem of present use and present proprietorship also many convalescent german soldier sun themselves upon the railing about the statue they seem entirely at home when the german take a town they mark it with they own mark as cattleman in texa use to mark a capture maverick after which to all intent it become german we halt a moment here that be french enough for you say the young officer who be ride with we turn in he seat to speak -- put up a monument to glorify three francs-tireur in germany the people would not be allow to do such a thing but it be not humanly conceivable that they would have such a wish we revere soldier who die for the fatherland not man who refuse to enlist when the call come and yet take up arm to make a guerrilla warfare which remark consider the circumstance and other thing be sufficiently typical for all purpose as i think at the time and still think you see i have come to the place where i could understand a german soldier 's national and racial point of view though i doubt he ability ever of understand mine to he now old john burn of gettysburg go out in he high high hat and he long long coat to fight with the boy would never could never be the heroic figure which he be in the american imagination he would have be a meddlesome malefactor deserving of immediate death for 1778 write it 1914 and molly pitcher serve at the gun would have be in no better case before a german court-martial i doubt whether a prussian stonewall jackson would give order to kill a french barbara frietchie but assuredly he would lock that venturesome old person up in a fortress where she could not hoist she country 's flag nor invite anybody to shoot she gray head for you must know that the german who ordinarily brim over with that emotion which lack a better name for it we call sentiment drain all the sentiment out of he soul when he take he gun in he hand and go to war among the frowzy turnip top two big dull gray automobile be strand like large hulk in a small green sea alongside they a devil 's darning-needle of a wireless mast stick up one hundred and odd foot toward the sky it be stay with many steel guy rope like the center pole of a circus top it be of the collapsible model and might therefore be telescope into itself and take down in twenty minute so we be inform pride-fully by the captain in charge and from its needle-pointed tip the message catch out of the ether come down by wire conductor to the interior of one of the stall automobile and there be note down and whenever possible translate by two soldier - operator who perch on wooden stool among battery and thing for which i know not the technical name the spitty snarl of the apparatus fill the air for rod roundabout it make you think of a million gritty slate pencil squeak over a million slate all together we be permit to take up the receiver and listen to a faint scratch sound which must have come from a long way off indeed the officer tell we that it be a message from the enemy that we hear we man just pick it up he explain we think it must come from a french wireless station across the river naturally we can not understand it any more than they can understand we message -- they be all in code you know every day or two we change we code and i presume they do too two of we party have unshipped they camera by now for the pass which we carry entitle we among other important thing to commandeer that precious fluid gasoline whenever need and to take photograph but we be ask to make no shapshot here we gather that there be certain reason not unconnected with secret military usage why we might not take away with we plate bear picture of the field wireless in the main though remarkably few restriction be lay upon we that day once or twice very casually somebody ask we to refrain from write about this thing or that thing which we have see but that be all in a corner of the turnip field close up to the road be mound of fresh-turned clay and so many of they be there and so closely be they space and for so considerable a distance do they stretch along they make two long yellow rib above the herbage at close interval small wooden cross be stick up in the round comb of earth so that the cross form a sort of irregular fence a squad of soldier be digging more hole in the tough earth they shovel blade flash in the sunlight and the clod fly up in shower we have many bury over there say a artillery captain see that i watch the grave digger a general among they and other officer it be there we bury those who die in the institute hospital every day more die and so each morning trench be make ready for those who will die during that day a good friend of mine be over there he be bury day before yesterday i sit up late last night write to he wife -- or perhaps i should say he widow they have be marry only a few week when the call come it will be very hard on she he do not name the general who lay over yonder nor do we ask he the name to ask would not have be etiquette and for he to answer would have be worse rarely in we wanderings do we find a german soldier of whatsoever rank who refer to he superior officer by name he merely say my captain or we colonel and this be of a piece with the plan -- not entirely confine to the german -- of make a secret of loss of commander and movement of command we go thence then the distance be perhaps three mile by road and not above eight minute by automobile at the rate we travel to a aviation camp at the back side of the town here be very much to see include many aeroplane of sort domicile under canvas hangar and a cheerful chatty hospitable group of the most famous aviator in the german army -- lean keen young man all of they -- and a sample specimen of the radish-shaped bomb which these gentleman carry aloft with the intent of drop it upon they enemy when occasion shall offer each of we in turn solemnly heft the bomb to feel its weight i should guess it weigh thirty pound -- say ten pound for the case and twenty pound for its load of fearsome ingredient finally yet foremost we be invite to inspect that thing which be the pride and the brag of this particular arm of the german army -- a balloon-cannon so call the balloon-gun of this size be -- or be at the date when i see it -- a exclusively german institution i believe the ally have balloon-gun too but theirs be smaller accord to what the german say this one be mount on a squatty half-turret at the tail end of a armored - steel truck it have a mechanism as daintily adjust as a lady 's watch and much more accurate and when be tow by its attendant automobile which have harness within it the power of a hundred and odd draft horse it have be know to cover sixty english mile in a hour for all that its weight be that of very many loaded van the person in authority here be a youthful and blithe lieutenant -- a iron cross man -- with pale shallow blue eye and a head of bright blond hair he spin one small wheel to show how he pet 's steel nose might be elevated almost straight upward then turn another to show how the gun might be swing as on a pivot this way and that to command the range of the entire horizon and he conclude the performance with the aid of several husky lad in begrimed gray by go through the pantomime of load with a long yellow five-inch shell from the magazine behind he and pretend to fire meanwhile explain that he could send one shot aloft every six seconds and with each shot reach a maximum altitude of between seven and eight thousand foot altogether it be a very pretty sight to see and most edifying likewise it take on a add interest when we learn that the blue-eyed youth and he brother of a twin balloon-cannon at the front of laon have during the precede three week bring down four of the enemy 's airman and be exceedingly hopeful of fattening they joint average before the present week have end after that we take photograph ad lib and mccutcheon have a trip with ingold a great aviator in a biplane which the german call a double - decker as distinguish from the taube or monoplane with its birdlike wing and curved tail rudder-piece just as they come down after a circular spin over the line a strange machine presumably hostile appear far up and far away but circle off to the south out of target reach before the balloon gunman could get the range of she and the aim on the heel of this a biplane from another aviation field somewhere down the left wing drop in quite informally bear two grease - stain man to pass the time of day and borrow some gasoline the occasion appear to demand a drink we all repair therefore to one of the great canvas house where the air bird nest night-time and where the airman sleep there we have noggin of white wine all round and a pointer dog which be chained to a officer 's trunk beg I in plain pointer language to cast off he leash so he might go and stalk the covey of pheasant that be take a dust-bath in the open road not fifty yard away the temptation be strong but we guide say if we mean to get to the battlefront before lunch it be time and past time we get start be thus warn we do get start of a battle there be this to be say -- that the closer you get to it the less do you see of it always in my experience in belgium and my more recent experience in france i find this to be true take for example the present instance i know that we be approximately in the middle sworl of the twist scroll form by the german center and that we be at this moment enter the very tip of the enormous inverted v make by the frontmost german defens i know that stretch away to the southeast of we and to the northwest be a line some two hundred mile long measure it from tip to tip where sundry million of man in english khaki and french fustian and german shoddy - wool be fight the biggest fight and the most prolonged fight and the most stubborn fight that historian probably will write down as have be fight in this war or any lesser war i know this fight have be go on for week now back and forth upon the river aisne and would certainly go on for week and perhaps month more to come i know these thing because i have be tell they but i should not have know if i have not be tell i should not even have guess it i recall that we travel at a cup-racing clip along a road that first wind like a coil snake and then straighten like a striking snake and that always we travel through dust so thick it make a fog in this chalky land of northern france the brittle soil dry out after a rain very quickly and turn into a white powder where there be wheel to churn it up and grit it fine here surely there be a abundance of wheel we pass many march man and many lumbering supply train which be go we way and we meet many motor ambulance and many ammunition truck which be come back always the ambulance be full and the ammunition wagon be empty i judge a expert in these thing might by the fullness of the one and the emptiness of the other gauge the emphasis with which the fight ahead go on the driver of the truck nearly all wear capture french cap and french uniform coat which adornment the march man invariably regard as a quaint jest to be laugh at and cheer for we stop at we appoint place which be on the top of a ridge where a general of a corps have he headquarters from here one have a view -- a fair view and roughly a fan-shaped view -- of certain highly important artillery operation likewise the eminence gentle and gradual as it be command a mile-long stretch of the road which form the main line of communication between the front and the base and these two fact in part explain why the general have make this he abide place even my layman 's mind could sense the reason for establish headquarters at such a spot as for the general he and he staff at the moment of we arrival in they midst be station at the edge of a scanty woodland where telescope stand and a table with map and chart on it quite with the manner of man who have nothing to do except to enjoy the sunshine and breathe the fresh air they stroll back and forth in pair and trio i think it must have be through force of habit that when they halt to turn about and retrace the route they stop always for a moment or two and face southward it be from the southward that there come roll up to we the sound of a bellow chorus of gunfire -- a wagnerian chorus truly that perhaps be as it should be wagner 's countryman be help to make it now the separate report string out until you could count perhaps three between report now they come so close together that the music they make be a constant roaring which would endure for a minute on a stretch or half a minute anyhow but for all the noticeable heed which any uniformed man in my vicinity pay to this it might as well have be blast in a distant stone quarry this attitude which they maintain couple with the fact that seemingly all the firing do no damage whatsoever only serve to strengthen the illusion that after all it be not the actual business of warfare which spread itself beneath we eye apparently most of the shell from the ally ' side -- which of course be the far side from we -- rise out of a dip in the contour of the land rise so they mainly fall among or near the shatter remnant of two hamlet upon the nearer front of a little hill perhaps three mile from we location a favorite object of they attack appear to be a wreck beet-sugar factory of which one side be blow away there would appear just above the horizon line a ball of smoke as black as you hat and the size of you hat which mean a grenade of high explosive then right behind it would blossom a dainty plumy little blob of innocent white fit to make a pompon for the hat and that they tell we would be shrapnel the german reply to the enemy 's gun issue from the timbered verge of slope at we right hand and we left and these german shell so far as we might judge pass entirely over and beyond the smash hamlet and the ruin sugar-beet factory and curve downward explode out of we sight the french persist in a belief that we have man in those village say one of the general 's aide to I they be waste they powder there be many man there and some among they be german but they be all dead man he offer to show I some live man and take I to one of the telescope and aim the barrel of it in the proper direction while i focus for distance suddenly out of the blur of the lens there spring up in front of I seemingly quite close a zigzag toy trench cut in the face of a little hillock this trench be full of gray figure of the size of very small doll they be move aimlessly back and forth it seem to I do nothing at all then i see another trench that run slantwise up the hillock and it contain more of the pygmy a number of these pygmy come out of they trench -- i could see they quite plainly clamber up the steep wall of it -- and they move very slowly it would seem toward the crosswise trench on ahead a bit to reach it they have to cross a sloping green patch of clear land so far as i might tell no explosive or shrapnel shower fall into they or near they but when they have go perhaps a third of the distance across the green patch there be a quick scatteration of they inch-high figure quite distinctly i count three manikin who instantly fall down flat and two other who go ahead a little way deliberately and then lay down the rest dart back to the cover which they have just quit and jump in briskly the five figure remain where they have drop and become quiet anyway i could detect no motion in they they be just little gray strip into my mind on the moment come incongruously a memory of what i have see a thousand time in the composing room of a country newspaper where the type be set by hand i thought of five pica plug lie on the printshop floor it be hard for I to make myself believe that i have see human being kill and wound i can hardly believe it yet -- that those insignificant toy-figure be really and truly man i watch through the glass after that for possibly twenty minute until the summons come for lunch but no more of the german doll venture out of they make - believe defens to be blow flat by a invisible blast it be a picnic lunch serve on board trestle under a tree behind the cover of a straw-roofed shelter tent and we eat it in quite a peaceful and cozy picnic fashion twice during the meal a orderly come with a message which he have take off a field telephone in a little pigsty of log and straw fifty foot away from we but the general each time merely cant he head to hear what the whisper word might be and go on eat there be no clattering in of courier no hurry dispatch of order this way and that only just before we finish with the meal he get up and walk away a few pace and there two of he aide join he and the three of they confab together earnestly for a couple of minute or so while so engage they have the air about they of surgeon prepare to undertake a operation and first consulting over the preliminary detail or perhaps it would be truer to say they look like civil engineer discuss the working-out of a undertaking regard which there be interest but no uneasiness assuredly they behave not in the least as a general and aide would behave in a story book or on the stage and when they be through they come back for they coffee and they cigar to the table where the rest of we sit we be go now to a battery of the twenty-one-centimeter gun and from there to the ten-centimeter call out lieutenant geibel as we climb aboard we car and when we pass that first group of house yonder we shall be under fire so if you have will to make you american gentleman you should be make they now before we start a gay young officer be lieutenant geibel and he just naturally would have he little joke whether or no immediately then and twice again that day we be technically presume to be under fire -- i use the word technically advisedly -- and again the next day and once again two day thereafter before antwerp but i be never able to convince myself that it be so certainly there be no sense of actual danger as we speed through the empty single street of a despoil and tenantless village all about we be the mark of what the shellfire have do some fresh and still smoke some old and dry - char but no shell drop near we as we circle in a long swing up to within half a mile of the first line of german trench and perhaps a mile to the left of they thereby we arrive safely and very speedily and without mishap at a battery of twenty-one-centimeter gun stand in a gnawed sheep pasture behind a abandon farmhouse what be leave of a farmhouse which be to say very little of it indeed the gun stand in a row and each one of they -- there be five in all -- stare with its single round eye at the blue sky where the sky show above a thick screen of tall slim poplar grow on the far side of the farmyard we barely have time to note that the man who serve the gun be den in hole in the earth like wolf with earthen roof above they and straw bed to lie on and that they have screen each gun in green sapling cut from the wood and stick upright in the ground to hide its position from the sight of prying aeroplane scout and that the wheel of the gun be tire with huge broad steel plate call caterpillar to keep they from bog down in miry place -- i say we barely have time to note these detail mentally when thing begin to happen there be a large and much be-mired soldier who spraddle face downward upon he belly in one of the straw-lined dugout with he ear hitch to a telephone without lift he head or turn it he sing out at that all the other man spring up very promptly before they have be sprawl about in sunny place smoking and sleeping and write on postcard postcard butter and beer -- these be the german private 's luxury but most of all postcard the man bestir themselves you be in luck gentleman say the lieutenant this battery have be idle all day but now it be to begin firing the order to fire just come the balloon operator who be in communication with the observation pit beyond the foremost infantry trench will give the range and the distance listen please he hold up he hand for silence intent on hear what the man at the telephone be repeat back over the line ah that be it -- 5400 meter straight over the tree top he wave we together into a more compact group that be the idea stand here please behind number one gun and watch straight ahead of you for the shot -- you must watch very closely or you will miss it -- and remember to keep you mouth open to save you eardrum from be injure by the concussion so far as i personally be concern this last bit of advice be unnecessary -- my mouth be open already four man trot to a magazine that be in a earthen kennel and come back bear a wheelless sheet - metal barrow on which rest a three-foot-long brass shell very trim and slim and handsome and shiny like gold it be a expensive-looking shell and quite ornate at the tail of number one the bearer heave the barrow up shoulder-high at the same time tilt it forward then a round vent open magically and the cyclops suck the morsel forward into its gullet thus reverse the natural swallow process and smack its steel lip behind it with a loud and greasy snuck a glutton of a gun -- you could tell that from the sound it make a lieutenant snap out something a sergeant snap it back to he the gun crew jump aside balance themselves on tiptoe with they mouth all agape and the gun-firer either pull a lever out or else push one home i could not tell which then everything -- sky and wood and field and all -- fuse and run together in a great spatter of red flame and white smoke and the earth beneath we foot shiver and shake as the twenty-one-centimeter spat out its twenty-one-centimeter mouthful a vast obscenity of sound beat upon we make we reel backward and for just the one-thousandth part of a second i see a round white spot like a new baseball against a cloud background the poplar which have bent forward as if before a quick wind-squall stand up tremble in they top and we dare to breathe again then each in its turn the other four gun speak profane the welkin and we rock on we heel like drunken man and i remember there be a queer taste as of something burn in my mouth all of which be very fine no doubt and very inspiring too if one care deeply for that sort of thing but to myself when the hemisphere have cease from its quivering i say : it be not true -- this be not war it be just a costly useless game of play at war behold now these gun do not fire at anybody visible or anything tangible they merely elevate they muzzle into the sky and fire into the sky to make a great tumult and spoil the good air with a bad-tasting smoke no enemy be in sight and no enemy will answer back therefore no enemy exist it be all a useless and a fussy business signify nothing nor do any enemy answer back the gun have be fire with due pomp and circumstance the gunner go back to those pipe-smoking and postcard-writing pursuit of theirs and everything be as before -- peaceful and entirely serene only the telephone man remain in he bed in the straw with he ear at he telephone he be still couch there spraddle ridiculously on he stomach with he leg outstretch in a sawbuck pattern as we come away it be not always quite so quiet hereabouts say the lieutenant the commander of this battery tell I that yesterday the french drop some shrapnel among he gun and kill a man or two perhaps thing will be brisker at the ten-centimeter-gun battery he speak as one who regret that the show which he offer be not more exciting the twenty-one-centimeter as i have tell you be in the edge of the wood with leafy ambush about they but the little ten-centimeter gun range themselves quite boldly in a meadow of rank long grass just under the weather-rim of a small hill they be bury to they haunch -- if a field gun may be say to have haunch -- in depression gouge out by they own frequent recoil otherwise they be without concealment of any sort to reach they we ride a mile or two and then walk a quarter of a mile through a series of chalky bare gully and we escort make we stoop low and hurry fast wherever the path wind up to the crest of the bank lest we figure be outline against the sky should betray we whereabouts and what be more important the whereabouts of the battery to the sharpshooter in the french rifle pit forward of the french infantry trench and not exceed a mile from we we stop first at a observation station cunningly hide in a haw thicket on the brow of a steep and heavily wooded defile overlook the right side of the river valley -- the river however be entirely out of sight standing here we hear the gun speak apparently from almost beneath we foot and three or four seconds thereafter we see five little puffball of white smoke uncurl above a line of tree across the valley somebody say this be we battery shell the french and english in those wood yonder but you could hardly be expect to believe that since no reply come back and no french or english whatsoever show themselves altogether it seem a most impotent and impersonal proceeding and when the novelty of wait for the blast of sound and then watch for the smoke plume to appear have wear off as it very soon do we visit the gun themselves they be not under we foot at all they be some two hundred yard away across a field where the telephone wire stretch over the old plow furrow and through the rank meadow grass like spring to catch woodcock here again the trick of take a message off the telephone and shout it forth from the mouth of a fox burrow be repeat whenever this procedure come to pass a sergeant who have strain he vocal cord from much give of order would swell out he chest and throw back he head and shriek hoarsely with what be leave of he voice which be not much this mean a fury of noise result instantly and much white smoke to follow for a while the gun be fire singly and then they be fire in salvo and you might mark how the grass for fifty yard in front of the muzzle would lie on the earth quite flat and then stand erect and how the gun like shy broncho would leap backward upon they carriage and then slide forward again as the air in the air cushion take up the kick also we take note that the crew of the ten - centimeter have build for themselves dugout to sleep in and to live in and have cover the sod roof over with straw and broken tree limb we judge they would be very glad indeed to crawl into those same shelter when night come for they have be serve the gun all day and plainly be about as weary as man could be to burn powder hour after hour and day after day and week after week at a foe who never see you and whom you never see to go at this dreary heavy trade of war with the sober uninspired earnestness of convict build a prison wall about themselves -- the ghastly unreality of the proposition leave I mentally numbed howsoever we arrive not long after that at a field hospital -- namely field hospital number 36 and here be realism enough to satisfy the lexicographer who first coin the word this field hospital be establish in eight abandon house of the abandon small french village of colligi and all eight house be crowd with wound man lie as closely as they could lie upon mattress place side by side on the floor with just room to step between the mattress be it remember also that these be all man too seriously wound to be move even to a point as close as laon those more lightly injure than these be already carry back to the main hospital we go into one room contain only man suffer from chest wound who cough and wheeze and constantly fight off the swarm fly that assail they and into another room give over entirely to brutally abbreviated human fragment -- fractional part of man who have lose they arm or leg on the far mattress against the wall lay a little pale german with he leg go below the knee who smile upward at the ceiling and be quite chipper a wonderful man that little chap say one of the surgeon to I when they first bring he here two week ago i say to he : ` it be hard on you that you should lose both you foot ' and he look up at I and grin and say : ` herr doctor it might have be worse it might have be my hand -- and I a tailor by trade ' this surgeon tell we he have a american wife and he ask I to bear a message for he to he wife 's people in the state so if these line should come to the notice of mr rosamond harri who live at hinesburg vermont she may know that she son-in-law doctor schilling be at last account very busy and very well although coated with white dust -- face head and eyebrow -- so that he remind I of a clown in a pantomime and dye as to he hand with iodine to a extent that make he finger look like piece of well-cured meerschaum they be bring in more man newly wound that day as we come out of doctor schilling 's improvise operating room in the little village schoolhouse and one of the litter bearer be a smart-faced little london cockney a capture english ambulance-hand who wear a german soldier 's cap to save he from possible annoyance as he go about he work not very many wound have arrive since the morning -- it be a dull day for they the surgeon say -- but i take note that when the red cross man put down a canvas stretcher upon the courtyard flag and shortly thereafter take it up again it leave a broad red smear where it rest against the flat stone also this stretcher and all the other stretcher have be so sag by the weight of body that they threaten to rip from the frame and so stain by that which have stain they that the canvas be as stiff as though it have be varnish and revarnish with many coat of brown shellac but it be not shellac there be just one fluid which leave that brown hard coating when it dry upon weave cloth as i recall now we have come through the gate of the schoolhouse to where the automobile stand when a puff of wind blow to we from the left which mean from across the battlefront bring to we nose a certain smell which we already know full well you get it i see say the german officer who stand alongside I it come from three mile off but you can get it five mile distant when the wind be strong that -- and he wave he left arm toward it as though the stench have be a visible thing -- that explain why tobacco be so scarce with we among the staff back yonder in laon all the tobacco which can be spare be send to the man in the front trench as long as they smoke and keep on smoking they can stand -- that you see he go on painstakingly the situation out there at cerny be like this : the french and english but mainly the english hold the ground first we drive they back and they lose very heavily in place they trench be actually full of dead and die man when we take those trench you could have bury they merely by fill up the trench with earth and that old beet-sugar factory which you see this noon when we be at field headquarters -- it be crowd with badly wound englishman at once they rally and force we back and now it be we turn to lose heavily that be nearly three week ago and since then the ground over which we fight have be debatable ground lie between we line and the enemy 's line -- a stretch four mile long and half a mile wide that be literally carpet with body of dead man they be not all dead at first for two day and night we man in the earthwork hear the cry of those who still live and the sound of they almost drive they mad there be no reach the wound though either from we line or from the ally ' line those who try to reach they be themselves kill now there be only dead out there -- thousand of dead i think and they have be there twenty day once in a while a shell strike that old sugar mill or fall into one of those trench then -- well then it be worse for those who serve in the front line but in the name of god man i say why do not they call a truce -- both side -- and put that horror underground he shrug he shoulder war be different now he say truce be out of fashion i stand there and i smell that smell and i think of all those fly and those blood-stiffened stretcher and those little inch-long figure which i myself look through that telescope have see lie on the green hill and those automobile load with mangled man and war de luxe betray itself to I beneath its bogus glamour i see war for what it be -- the next morning of drunken glory chapter 12 the rut of big gun in france let I say at the outset of this chapter that i do not set up as one profess to have any knowledge whatsoever of so-called military science the more i have see of the carrying-on of the actual business of war the less able do i seem to be to understand the meaning of the business for I strategy remain a closed book even the simplest primary lesson of it the a b c 's of it continue to impress I as be stupid but none the less unplumbable mystery the physical aspect of campaigning i can in a way grasp at least i flatter myself that i can a man would have to be deaf and dumb and blind not to grasp they do they reveal themselves before he as they have reveal themselves before I indeed if he preserve only the faculty of scent unimpaired he might still be able to comprehend the thing since as i have say before war in its commoner phase be not so much a sight as a great bad smell as for the rudiment of the system which dictate the movement of troops in large mass or in small which sacrifice thousand of man to take a town or hold a river when that town and that river physically consider appear to be of no consequence whatsoever those element i have not be able to sense even though i study the matter most diligently so after sundry month of first-hand observation in one of the theater of hostility i tell myself that the trade of fighting be a trade to be learn by slow and laborious degree and even then may be learn with thoroughness only by one who have a natural aptitude for it either that or else i be most extraordinarily thick-headed for i own that i be still as complete a greenhorn now as i be at the begin have make the confession which be say to be good for the soul and which in any event have the merit of blunt in advance the critical judgment of the expert since he must pity my ignorance and my innocence even though he quarrel with my conclusion i now assume the role of prophet long enough to venture to say that the day of the modern walled fort be over and do with i do not presume to speak regard coast defens maintain for the purpose of repel attack or invasion from the sea i be speak with regard to land defens which be assailable by land force i believe in the future great war -- if indeed there be to be any more great war follow after this one -- that the nation involve instead of button they frontier down with great fortress and ring they principal city about with circle of protect work will put they trust more and more in transportable cannon of a caliber and a project force greater than any yet build or plan i make this assertion after view the visible result of the operation of the german 42-centimeter gun in belgium and france notably at liege in the former country and at maubeuge in the latter except for purpose of frightening non-combatant the zeppelin apparently have prove of most dubious value nor bar its value as a scout -- a field in which it be of marvelous efficiency -- do the aeroplane appear to have be of much consequence in inflict loss upon the enemy of the comparatively new device for wage war the submarine and the great gun alone seem to have justify in any great degree the hope of they sponsor since i come back out of the war zone i have meet person who question the existence of a 42-centimeter gun they hold it to be a nightmare create out of the german imagination with intent to break the confidence of the enemy of germany i do not see a 42-centimeter gun with my own eye and personally i doubt whether the german have as many of they as they claim to have but i talk with one entirely reliable witness a american consular officer who see a 42-centimeter gun as it be be transport to the front in the opening week of the war and with another american a diplomat of high rank who interview a man who see one of these gun and who in detail the conversation to I say the spectator have be literally stun by the size and length and the whole terrific contour of the monster finally i know from personal experience that these gun have be employ and employ with a result that go past adequate description but if i have not see the effect of they fire i would not have believe it be true i would not have believe anything evolve out of the brain of man and put together by the finger of man could operate with such devilish accuracy to compass such utter destruction i would have say it be some planetic force some convulsion of natural force and not a agency of human devisement that turn fort loncin inside out and transform it within a space of hour from a supposedly impregnable stronghold into a hodgepodge of complete and hideous ruination and what befall fort loncin on the hill behind liege befall fort des sarts outside of maubeuge as i have reason to know when the first of the 42-centimeter emerge from essen it take a team of thirty horse to haul it and with it out of that nest of the prussian war eagle come also a force of mechanic and engineer to set it up and aim it and fire it here too be a interesting fact that i have not see print anywhere though i hear it often enough in germany : by reason of its bulk the 42 - centimeter must be mount upon a concrete base before it can be use heretofore the concrete which be available for this purpose require at least a fortnight of exposure before it be sufficiently firm and hardened but when fraulein bertha krupp 's engineer escort the fraulein 's newest and most impressive steel masterpiece to the war they bring along with they the ingredient for a new kind of concrete and those who claim to have be present on the occasion declare that within forty-eight hour after they have mix and mold it it be ready to bear the weight of the gun and withstand the shock of they recoil this have be do i conceive of the operator as hoist they gun into position and post up a set of rule -- even in time of war it be impossible to imagine the german do anything of importance without a set of rule to go by -- and work out the distance by mathematics and then turn loose they potential cataclysm upon the stubborn fort which oppose they further progress from the viewpoint of the german the consequence to the foe must amply have justify the trouble and the cost for where a 42-centimeter shell fall it do more than merely alter landscape almost you might say it alter geography in the open field where he must aim he gun with he own eye and discharge it with he own finger i take it the kaiser 's private soldier be no great shake as a marksman the german themselves begrudgingly admit the french excel they in the use of light artillery there be wonderment as well as reluctance in this concession to they it seem well-nigh incredible that any nation should be they superior in any department pertain to the practice of war they could not bring themselves fully to understand it it remain as much a puzzle to they as the unaccountable obstinacy of the english in refuse to be budge out of they position by display of cold steel or to be shake by the volley bull-like roar of the german charge cry which at first the german count upon as be almost as efficacious as the bayonet for instil a wholesome fear of the german war god into the soul of they foe while give the frenchman credit for know how to handle and serve small field-piece the german nevertheless insist that they infantry fire or they skirmish fire be as deadly as that of the ally or even deadlier this i be not prepare to believe i do not think the german be a good rifle shoot by instinct as the american often be and in a lesser degree perhaps the englishman be too but where he can work the range out on paper where he have to do with mechanic instead of a shift mark where he can apply to the detail of gun firing the exact principle of arithmetic i be pretty sure the german be as good a gunner as may be find on the continent of europe to-day this may not apply to he at sea for he have neither the sailor tradition nor the inherit naval craftsmanship of the english but judge by what i have see i be quite certain that with the solid earth beneath he and a set of figure before he and a enemy out of sight of he to be damage he be in a class all by himself a german staff officer who profess to have be present tell I that at manonvillum -- so he spell the name -- a 42-centimeter gun be fire one hundred and forty-seven time from a distance of 14000 meter at a fort measure 600 meter in length by 400 meter in breadth -- a very small target indeed consider the range -- and that investigation after the capture of the fort show not a single one of the one hundred and forty-seven shot have be a outright miss some few he say hit the wall or at the basis of the wall but all the other he claim have bull 's - eye into the fort itself subsequently on subject this tale to the acid test of second thought i be compel to doubt what the staff officer have say to begin with i do not understand how a 42-centimeter gun could be fire one hundred and forty-seven time without its wear out for i have often hear that the larger the bear of you gun and the heavier the charge of explosive which it carry the shorter be its period of efficiency in the second place it do not seem possible after be hit one hundred and forty-seven time with 42-centimeter bomb that enough of any fort of whatsoever size would be leave to permit of a tallying-up of separate shot ten shot properly place should have raze it twenty more should have blow its level remainder to powder and scatter the powder be the fact what they may with regard to this case of the fort of manonvillum -- if that be its proper name -- i be prepare to speak with the assurance of a eyewitness concern the effect of the german fire upon the defens of maubeuge what i see at liege i have describe in a previous chapter of this volume what i see at maubeuge be even more convincing testimony have i need it that the german have a 42 - centimeter gun and that give certain favored condition they know how to handle it effectively we spend the better part of a day in two of the fort which be fondly presume to guard maubeuge toward the north -- fort des sarts and fort boussois but fort des sart be the one where the 42-centimeter gun give the first exhibition of its power upon french soil in this war so we go there first to reach it we run a matter of seven kilometer through a succession of village each with its mutely eloquent tale of devastation and general smash to tell each with its group of contemptuously tolerant german soldier on guard and its handful of native strive feebly to piece together the broken and bankrupt fragment of they worldly affair approach des sarts more nearly we come to a longish stretch of highway which the french have clear of visual obstruction in anticipation of resistance by infantry in the event that the outer ring of defens give way before the german bombardment it have all be labor in vain for the town capitulate after the outpost fall but it must have be very great labor any number of fine elm tree have be fell and they bough strip now of leaf stick up like bare bone there be hole in the metal road where misaim shell have descend and in any one of these hole you might have bury a horse a little gray church stand off by itself upon the plain it have be homely enough to start with now with its steeple shear away and one of its two belfry window obliterate by a stray shot it have a rakish cock-eyed look to it just beyond where the church be we chauffeur halt the car in obedience to a order from the staff officer who have be detail by major von abercron commandant of maubeuge to accompany we on this particular excursion we guide point off to the right there he say be where we drop the first of we big one when we be try to get the range of the fort you see we gun be post at a point between eight and nine kilometer away and at the start we overshoot a trifle still to the garrison yonder it must have be a unhappy foretaste of what they might shortly expect when they see the forty - two striking here in this field and see what execution they do among the cabbage and the beet patch we leave the car and follow we guide go to look space very neatly at interval apart of perhaps a hundred and fifty yard a series of crater break the surface of the earth consider the tool which dig they they be rather symmetrical crater not jag and gouge but with smooth wall and each in shape a perfect funnel we measure roughly a typical specimen across the top it be between fifty and sixty foot in diameter and it slope down evenly for a depth of eighteen foot in the chalky soil to a pointed bottom where two man would have difficulty stand together without tread upon each other 's toe its side be line with loose pellet of earth of the average size of a tennis ball and when we slide down into the hole these round clod accompany we in small avalanche we be fill with astonishment first that a explosive grenade weigh upward of a ton could be so construct that it would penetrate thus far into firm and solid earth before it explode and second that it could make such a neat saucer of a hole when it do explode but there be a still more amazing thing to be ponder of the earth which have be dispossess from the crevasse amount to a great many wagonload no sign remain it be not heap up about the lip of the funnel it be not visibly scatter over the nearermost furrow of that truck field so far as we might tell it be utterly go and from that we deduce that the force of the explosion have be sufficient to pulverize the clay so finely and cast it so far and so wide that it fall upon the surface in a fine shower leave no trace unless one make a minute search for it note the wonder upon we face the officer be move to speak further in a tone of sincere admiration touch on the capability of the crowning achievement of the krupp work : pretty strong medicine eh well wait until i have show you american gentleman what remains of the fort then you will better understand even here out in the open for a radius of a hundred and fifty meter any man concede he be not kill outright would be knock senseless and after that for hour even for day perhaps he would be entirely unnerve the force of the concussion appear to have that effect upon person who be at a considerable distance -- it rip they nerve to tatters some seem numbed and dazed other develop a acute hysteria highly interesting be it not listen then here be something even more interesting : within a inclosed space where there be a roof to hold in the gas generate by the explosion or where there be reasonably high wall the man who escape be tear apart in the instant of impact or who escape be crush to death by collapse masonry or kill by fly fragment be exceedingly likely to choke to death as he lie temporarily paralyzed and helpless from the shock i be at liege and again here and i know from my own observation that this be true at liege particularly many of the garrison be catch and pen up in underground casement and there we find they afterward dead but with no mark of wound upon they -- they have be asphyxiate i suppose in time of peace the speaker be a reasonably kind man and reasonably regardful of the rights of he fellowmen certainly he be most courteous to we and most considerate but he describe this slaughter-pit scene with the enthusiasm of one who be a partner in a most creditable and worthy enterprise immediately about des sarts stand many telegraph pole in a row for here the road which be the main road from pari to brussels curve close up under the grass-covered bastion all the telegraph wire have be cut and they dangle about the basis of the pole in snarled tangle like love vine the ditch parallel the road be choke with fell tree and what with the naked limb be as spiky as shad spine of the small cottage which once have stand in the vicinity of the fort not one remain stand they site be mark by flatten heap of brick and plaster from which char end of rafter protrude it be as though a giant have sit himself down upon each little house in turn and squashed it to the foundation stone as a fort des sarts date back to 1883 i speak of it in the past tense because the german have put it in that tense as a fort or as anything resemble a fort it have cease to be absolutely the inner work of it -- the redan and the underground barracks and the magazine and all -- be build after the style follow by military engineer back in 1883 have revetment face up with brick and stone but only a little while ago -- in the summer of 1913 to be exact -- the job of inclose the original work with a glaci of a newer type have be complete so when the german come along in the first week of September it be in most respects make over into a modern fort no doubt the re-enforcement of reserve that hurry into it to strengthen the regular garrison count themselves lucky man to have so massive and stout a shelter from which to fight a enemy who must work in the open against they poor devil they hope crumble along with they wall when the german bring up the forty-two we enter in through a breach in the first parapet and cross one at a time on a tottery wooden bridge which be prop across a fossé half full of rubble and so come to what have be the heart of the fort of des sarts have i not already gather some notion of the power for destruction of those one-ton four-foot-long shell i should have say that the spot where we halt have be batter and crash at for hour that score and perhaps hundred of bomb have be plump into it now though i be prepare to believe the german captain when he say probably not more than five or six of the devil device have strike this target make it six for good measure conceive each of the six as have be dam by a hurricane and sire by a earthquake and as be relate to a active volcano on one side of the family and to a flaming meteor on the other conceive it as fall upon a man-made masonry-walled burrow in the earth and be follow in rapid succession by five of its blood brethren then you will begin to get some fashion of mental photograph of the result i confess myself as unable to supply any better suggestion for a comparison nor shall i attempt to describe the picture in any considerable detail i only know that for the first time in my life i realize the full and adequate meaning of the word chaos the proper definition of it be spread broadcast before my eye appreciate the impossibility of comprehend the full scope of the disaster which here have befall or of put it concretely into word if i do comprehend it i seek to pick out small individual detail which be hard to do too see that all thing be jumble together so this have be a series of cunningly bury tunnel and arcade with cozy subterranean dormitory open off of side passage and still farther down there have be magazine and storage space now it be all a hole in the ground and the force which blast it out have then pull the hole in behind itself we stand on the verge look downward into a chasm which seem to split its way to infinite depths although in fact it be probably not nearly so deep as it appear if we look upward there forty foot above we head be a wide riven gap in the earth crust near I i discern a litter of metal fragment from such of the scrap as retain any shape at all i figure that they have be part of the protective casing of a gun mount somewhere above the missile which wreck the gun fling its armor down here i search my brain for a simile which might serve to give a notion of the present state of that steel jacket i do not find the one i want but if you will think of a earthenware pot which have be throw from a very high building upon a brick sidewalk you may have some idea of what i see at that it be no completer a ruin than any of the surround debris indeed in the whole vista of annihilation but two object remain recognizably intact and these strange to say be two iron bed frame bolt to the back wall of what i think must have be a barrack room for officer the room itself be no longer there brick mortar stone concrete steel reinforcement iron prop the hard-packed earth have be rip out and churn into indistinguishable bit but those two iron bed hang fast to a discolor patch of plaster though the floor be go from beneath they seemingly they be hardly damage one gather that a 42-centimeter shell possess in some degree the freakishness which we associate with the behavior of cyclone we be tell that at the last when the gun have be silence and dismount and the wall have be pierce and the embrasure blow bodily away the garrison or what be leave of it flee to these lowermost shelter but the burrow bomb find the refugee out and kill they nearly all and those of they who die be still bury beneath we foot in as hideous a sepulcher as ever be dig there be no get they out from that tomb the crack of doom will find they still there i guess to reach a portion of des sarts as yet un-visited we skirt the gape of the crater climb over craggy accumulation of wreckage and traverse a tunnel with a arched roof and mildewed brick wall like a wine vault the floor of it be litter with the knapsack and water bottle of dead or capture man with useless rifle break at the stock and bent in the barrel and with suchlike riffle at the far end of the passage we come out into the open at the back side of the fort right here say the officer who be pilot we i witness a sight which make a deeper impression upon I than anything i have see in this campaign after the white flag have be hoist by the survivor and we have march in i halt my man just here at the entrance to this arcade we do not dare venture into the redan for sporadic explosion be still occur in the ammunition store also there be fire rage smoke be pour thickly out of the mouth of the tunnel it do not seem possible that there could be anyone alive back yonder all of a sudden man begin to come out of the tunnel they come and come until there be nearly two hundred of they -- french reservist mostly they be crazy man -- crazy for the time be and still crazy i expect some of they they come out staggering choke fall down and get up again you see they nerve be go the fume the gas the shock the fire what they have endure and what they have escape -- all these have distract they they dance sing weep laugh shout in a sort of maudlin frenzy spin about deliriously until they drop they be deafen and some of they could not see but have to grope they way i remember one man who sit down and pull off he boot and sock and throw they away and then hobble on in he bare foot until he cut the bottom of they to piece i do not care to see anything like that again -- even if it be my enemy that suffer it he tell it so vividly that stand alongside of he before the tunnel opening i could see the procession myself -- those two hundred man who have drain horror to its lees and be drunk on it we go to fort boussois some four mile away it be another of the key to the town it be take on September sixth on the next day September seventh the citadel surrender here in lieu of the 42 - centimeter which be otherwise engage for the moment the attack force bring into play a austrian battery of 30-centimeter gun so far as i have be able to ascertain this be the only austrian command which have any part in the western campaign the austrian gunner shell the fort until the german infantry have be mass in a forest to the northward late in the afternoon the infantry charge across a succession of clear field and capture the outer slope with these in they possession it do not take they very long to compel the surrender of fort boussoi especially as the defender have already be terribly cut up by the artillery fire the austrian must have be first-rate marksman one of they shell fall squarely upon the rounded dome of a big armored turret which be sink in the earth and chip off the top of it as you would chip you breakfast egg the man who man the gun in that revolving turret must all have die in a flash of time the impact of the blow be such that the leaden solder which fill the interstice of the segment of the turret be squeeze out from between the plate in curly strip like icing from between the layer of a misuse birthday cake back within the main work we see where a shell have bore a smooth round orifice through eight meter of earth and a meter and a half of concrete and steel plate peer into the shaft we could make out the floor of a tunnel some thirty foot down to judge by its effect this shell have be of a different type from any other whose work we have witness apparently it have be devise to excavate hole rather than to explode and when we ask question about it we speedily ascertain that we guide do not care to discuss the gun which have inflict this particular bit of damage it be not permit to speak of this matter he say in explanation of he attitude it be a military secret this invention we call it a mine gun every man to he taste i should have call it a well-digger erect upon the highest stretch of riddled wall with he leg spraddle far apart and he arm jerk in expressive gesture he tell we how the german infantry have advance across the open ground it have be hard he say to hold the man back until the order for the charge be give and then they burst from they cover and come on at a dead run cheer it be very fine he add very glorious do you have any loss in the charge ask one of we party oh yes he answer as though that part of the proceeding be purely a incidental detail and of no great consequence we lose many man here -- very many -- several thousand i think most of they be bury where you see those long ridge in the second field beyond in a sheltered corner of a redoubt close up under a parapet and sheathe on its inner side with masonry be a single grave the pound foot of many fight man have beat the mound flat but a small wooden cross still stand in the soil and on it in french be pencil the word : here lie lieutenant verner kill in the charge of battle he man must have think well of the lieutenant to take the time in the midst of the defense to bury he in the place where he fall for there be no other grave to be see within the fort chapter 13 those yellow pine box it be late in the short afternoon and get close on to twilight when we get back into the town except for the soldier there be little life stir in the twist street there be a funeral or so in progress it seem to we that always no matter where we stop in whatsoever town or at whatsoever hour some dead soldier be be put away still i suppose we should not have feel any surprise at that by now half of europe be one great funeral part of it be on crutch and part of it be in the graveyard and the rest of it be in the field daily in these town back behind the firing line a certain percentage of the invalide and the injure who have be bring thus far before they condition become actually serious would die and twice daily or oftener the dead would be bury with military honor so naturally we be eyewitness to a great many of these funeral somehow they impress I more than the sight of dead man be hurriedly shovel under ground on the battle front where they have fall perhaps it be the consciousness that those who have these formal separate burial be man who come alive out of the fighting and who even after be stricken have a chance for life and then lose it perhaps it be the small show of ceremony and ritual which mark each one -- the firing squad the clergyman in he robe the tramp escort -- that leave so endure a impress upon my mind i do not try to analyze the reason but i know my companion feel as i do i remember quite distinctly the very first of these funeral that i witness possibly i remember it with such distinctness because it be the first on we way to the advance position of the german we have come as far as chimay which be a old belgian town just over the frontier from france i be sit on a bench just outside the doorway of a parochial school conduct by nun which have be take over by the conqueror and convert into a temporary receive hospital for man who be too seriously wound to stand the journey up into germany all the surgeon on duty here be german but the nursing force be about equally divide between nun and lutheran deaconess who have be bring overland for this duty also there be several volunteer nurse -- the wife of a officer a wealthy widow from dusseldorf and a school-teacher from coblenz among they catholic and protestant belgian and french and german they all labor together cheerfully and earnestly do drudgery of the most exacting the most unpleasant sort one of the patroness of the hospital who be also its manager ex officio have just leave with a soldier chauffeur for a guard and a slightly wound major for a escort she be start on a three - hundred-mile automobile run through a half subdue and dangerous country mean to visit base hospital along the german frontier until she find a supply of anti-tetanus serum lockjaw develop from seemingly trivial wound in foot or hand have already kill six man at chimay within a week four more be die of the same disease so since no able-bodied man could be spare from the overworked staff of the lazaret she be go for a stock of the serum which might save still other victim she mean to travel day and night and if a bullet do not stop she and if the automobile do not go through a temporary bridge she would be back she think within forty-eight hour she have already make several trip of the sort upon similar mission once she car have be fire at and once it have be wreck but she be go again she be from near cologne the wife of a rich manufacturer now serve as a captain of reserve she have not hear from he in four week she do not know whether he still live she hope he live she tell we with simple fortitude but of course these time one never know it be just before sundown the nun have go upstairs to they little chapel for evening service through a open window of the chapel just above my head they voice as they chant the response between the sonorous latin phrase of the priest who have come to lead they in they devotions float out in clear sweet snatch like the song of vesper sparrow behind I in a paved courtyard be perhaps twenty wound man lie on cot they have be bring out of the building and put in the sunshine they be on the way to recovery at least most of they be i sit face a triangular-shaped square which be flank on one of its face by a row of shutter private house and on another by the principal church of the town a fifteenth-century structure with outdoor shrine snuggle up under its eaves except for the chanting of the nun and the braggadocio boom of a big cock-pigeon which have fly down from the church tower to forage for spilt grain almost under my foot the place be quiet it be so quiet that when a little column of man turn into the head of the street which wind past the front of the church and off to the left i hear the measure tramp of they foot upon the stony roadway fully a minute before they come in sight i be wonder what that rhythmic thumping mean when one of the nursing sister come and close the high wooden door at my back shut off the view of the wound man there appear a little procession head by a priest in he robe and two altar-boy at the heel of these three be six soldier bear upon they shoulder a wooden box paint a glaring yellow and so narrow be the box and so shallow-looking that on the instant the thought come to I that the poor clay inclose therein must feel cramped in such scant quarter upon the top of the box at its widest highest point rest a wreath of red flower a clumsy spraddly wreath from which the red blossom threaten to shake loose even at a distance of some rod i could tell that a man 's inexpert finger must have fashion it upon the shoulder of the bearer the box sway and jolt follow it come first three uniformed officer two german nurse and two surgeon from another hospital as i subsequently learn and follow they half a company of soldier bear they rifle and wear side arm as the small cortege reach a point opposite we a officer snap a order and everybody halted and the gun-butt of the company come down with a smash abruptness upon the cobble at that moment two or three roughly clad civilian issue from a doorway near by be belgian they have small cause to love the german but they stop in they track and pull off they cap to pay the tribute of a bared head to the dead even to the unknown dead be in these catholic country of europe as much a part of a man 's rule of conduct as he religion be the priest who lead the line turn my way inquiringly he do not have to wait long for what be to come nor do i another gate farther along in the nunnery wall open and out come six more soldier bear another of these narrow-shouldered coffin and accompany by a couple of nurse a officer and a assistant surgeon at sight of they the soldier bring they piece up to a salute and hold the posture rigidly until the second dead man in he yellow box have join the company of the first dead man in he just before this happen though one of the nurse of the nunnery hospital do a thing which i shall never forget she must have see that the first coffin have flower upon it and in the same instant realize that the coffin in whose occupant she have a more direct interest be bare so she leave the straggle line and come run back the wall stream with woodbine very glorious in its autumnal flaming she snatch a trailer of the red and yellow leaf down from where it cling and as she hurry back she hand work with magic haste make it into a wreath she reach the second squad of bearer and put she wreath upon the lid of the box and then seek she place with the other nurse the gun go up with a snap upon the shoulder of the company the soldier ' foot thud down all together upon the stone and with the priest recite he office the procession pass out of sight go toward the burial ground at the back of the town presently when the shadow be thicken into gloom and the angelus bell be ring in the church i hear a long way off the rattle of the rifle as the soldier fire goodnight volley over the grave of they dead comrade on the next day at hirson which be another of we stop point on the journey to the front we see the joint funeral of seven man leave the hospital where they have die during the precede twelve hour and i sha not forget that picture either there be a vista bound by a stretch of one of those unutterably bleak backway of a small and shabby french town the rutted street twist along between small gray plaster house with ugly unnecessary gable-end which face the road at wrong angle small group of towns-people stand against the wall to watch there be also a handful of idle soldier who watch from the gateway of the house where they be billet seven time the bearer enter the hospital door and each time as they reappear bring one of the narrow gaudy yellow box the officer line up at the door would salute and the soldier in double line at the opposite side of the road would present arm and then as the box be lift upon the wagon wait to receive it would smash they gun down on the bouldered road with a crash when the job of bring forth the dead be do the wagon stand loaded pretty nearly to capacity four of the box rest crosswise upon the flat wagon-bed and the other three be rack lengthwise on top of they here too be a priest in he robe and here be two altar boy who straggle so that as the procession start the priest be move to break off he chant long enough to chide he small attendant and wave they back into proper alignment with the officer the nurse and the surgeon all march afoot march also three bearded civilian in frock coat have the air about they of village dignitary from they presence in such company we deduce that one of the seven silent traveler on the wagon must be a french soldier or else that the german have see fit to require the attendance of local functionary at the burial of dead german as the cortege -- i suppose you might call it that -- go by where i stand with my friend i see that upon the side of the coffin name be letter in big straggly black letter i read two of the name -- werner be one vogel be the other somehow i feel a acuter personal interest in vogel and werner than in the other five whose name i could not read wherever we stop in belgium or in france or in germany these soldier ' funeral be thing of daily almost of hourly occurrence and in maubeuge on this evening even though dusk have fall two of the inevitable yellow box mount upon a two-wheeled cart be go to the bury ground we figure the cemetery man would fill the grave by lantern light and know something of they hour of employment we imagine that with this job dispose of they would probably turn to and dig grave by night make they ready against the need of the follow morning the new grave always be ready they be make in advance and still there be rarely enough of they no matter how long or how hard the digger keep at they work at aix-la-chapelle for example in the principal cemetery the sexton 's man dig twenty new grave every morning by evening there would be twenty shaped mound of clay where the twenty hole have be the crop of the dead be the one sure crop upon which embattled europe might count that harvest could not fail the war nation however scanty other yield might be in the town in occupied territory the cemetery be the only actively and constantly busy spot to be find except the hospital every schoolhouse be a hospital indeed i think there can be no schoolhouse in the zone of actual hostility that have not serve such a purpose in they altered aspect we come to know these schoolhouse mighty well we would see the wound go in on stretcher and the dead come out in box we would see how the blackboard still scrawl over perhaps with the chalk sum of lesson which never be finish now bear pasted-on chart deal in nurse ' and surgeon ' cipher-manual with the bodily plight of the man in the cot and on the mattress beneath we would see classroom where plaster cast and globe map and dusty textbook have be cast aside in heap to make room on desktop and shelf for drug and bandage and surgical appliance we would see the row of hook intend originally for the cap and umbrella of little people but now from each hook dangle the rip bloody garment of a soldier -- gray for a german brown-tan for a englishman blue-and-red for a frenchman or a belgian by the german rule a wounded man 's uniform must be bring back with he from the place where he fall and keep handily near he with tag on it to prove its proper identity and there it must stay until its owner need it again -- if ever he need it again we would see these thing and we would wonder if these schoolhouse could ever shake off the scent and the stain and the memory of these present grim visitation -- wonder if child would ever frolic any more in the courtyard where the ambulance stand now with red drop trickle down from they bed upon the gravel but that on we part be mere morbidness bear of the sight we see child forget even more quickly than they elder forget and we know from we own experience how quickly the populace of a french or flemish community could rally back to a colorable counterfeit of they old sprightliness once the immediate burden of affliction and captivity have be lift from off they from a jumbled confusion of recollection of these schoolhouse-hospital sundry incidental picture stick out in my mind as i write this article i can shut my eye and visualize the german i saw in the little parish school building in the abandon hamlet of colligi near by the river aisne he be in a room with a dozen other all suffering from chest wound he have be pierce through both lung with a bullet and to keep he from choke to death the attendant have tie he in a half erect posture a sort of hammock-like sling pass under he arm and a rope run from it to a hook in a wall and be knot fast to the hook he swing there neither sit nor lie fight for the breath of life with a unspeakable misery look out from he eye and he be too far spend to lift a hand to brush away the fly that swarm upon he face and he lip and upon he bare throb throat the fly dapple the face of he fellow sufferer with loathsome black dot they literally mask he i preserve a memory which be just as vivid of certain thing i saw in a big institution in laon although in german hand and nominally under german control the building be give over entirely to cripple and ail french prisoner these patient be mind and feed by they own people and attend by capture french surgeon in we tour of the place i see only two man wear the german gray one be the armed sentry who stand at the gate to see that no recover inmate slip out and the other be a german surgeon - general who be make he daily round of inspection of the hospital and have bring we along with he of the native contingent the person who appear to be in direct charge be a handsome elderly lady tenderly solicitous of the frowziest turco in the ward and exquisitely polite with a frozen politeness to the german officer when he salute she she bow to he deeply and ceremoniously and silently i never think until then that a bow could be so profoundly execute and yet so icily cold it be a lesson in congeal manners as we be leave the room a nun serve as a nurse hail the german and tell he one of she charge be threaten to die not because of he wound but because he have lose heart and believe himself to be die where be he ask the german yonder she say indicate a bundled-up figure on a pallet near the door a draw hopeless face of a half-grown boy show from the huddle of blanket the surgeon-general cast a quick look at the swathe form and then speak in a undertone to a french regimental surgeon on duty in the room together the two approach the lad my son say the german to he in french i be tell you do not feel so well to-day the boy-soldier whisper a answer and waggle he head despondently the german put he hand on the youth 's forehead my son he say listen to I you be not go to die -- i promise you that you shall not die my colleague here -- he indicate the french doctor -- stand ready to make you the same promise if you will not believe a german surely you will take you own countryman 's professional word for it and he smile a little smile under he gray mustache between we we be go to make you well and send you when this war be over back to you mother but you must help we you must help we by be brave and confident be it not so doctor he add again address the french physician and the frenchman nod to show it be so and sit down alongside the youngster to comfort he further as we leave the room the german surgeon turn and look round i see that once again he salute the patrician french lady and this time as she bow the ice be all melt from she bearing she must have witness the little byplay perhaps she have a son of she own in service there be mighty few mother in france last fall who do not have son in service yet one of the few really humorous recollection of this war that i preserve have to do with a hospital too but this hospital be in england and we visit it on we way home to america we go -- two of we -- in the company of lord northcliffe down into surrey to spend a day with old lord robert within three week thereafter lord robert be dead where no doubt he would have will to die -- at the front in france with the sound of the gun in he ear guard in he last moment by the ghurka and the sikh of he beloved indian contingent but on this day of we visit to he we find he a hale kindly gentleman of eighty-two who show we he marvelous collection of firearm and oriental relic and the field gun all historic gun by the way which he keep upon the terrace of he mansion house and who tell we among other thing that in he opinion we own stonewall jackson be perhaps the greatest natural military genius the world have ever produce leave he house we stop on we return to london at a hospital for soldier in the grounds of ascot race course scarcely two mile from lord robert ' place the refreshment booth and the other room at the back and underside of the five-shilling stand have be throw together except the barber 's shop which be be convert into a operating chamber and what with its tiled wall and high sloped ceiling and glass front the place make a first-rate hospital it contain bed for fifty man but on this day there be less than twenty sick and cripple tommy convalesce here they have be bring out of france out of wet and cold and filth with hurry dressing on they hurt and now they be in this bright sweet wholesome place with soft bed under they and clean linen on they body and flower and dainty on the table that stand alongside they and the gentlefolk of the neighborhood to mind they as volunteer nurse there be professional nurse of course but under they the younger woman of the wealthy family of this corner of surrey be serve and mighty pretty they all look too in they crisp blue-and-white uniform with they arm badge and they cap and they big apron button round they slim athletic young body i judge there be about three amateur nurse to each patient yet you could not rightly call they amateur either each of they have take a short course in nursing it seem and be amply competent to perform many of the duty a regular nurse must know lady aileen robert be with we during we tour of the hospital as a daily visitor and patroness she spend much of she time here and she know most of the inmate by name she halt alongside one bed to ask its occupant how he feel he have be return from the front suffering from pneumonia he be a irishman before he answer she he cast a quick look about the long hall afternoon tea be just be serve consist besides tea of homemade strawberry jam and lettuce sandwich make of crisp fresh bread with plenty of butter and certain elderly lady have just arrive bring with they among other contribution sheaf of flower and a dogcart load with hothouse fruit and a dozen loaf of plumcake which last be still hot from the oven and which radiate a mouth-watering aroma as a footman bear they in behind he mistress the patient look at all these and he sniff and a grin split he face and a irish twinkle come into he eye thank you I lady for askin ' he say but i be very much afeared i be gettin ' better we might safely assume that the hospital and the graveyard of maubeuge would be busy place that evening thereby offer strong contrast to the rest of the town but i should add that we find two other busy spot too : the railroad station -- where the train bring wounded man continually shuttle past -- and the house where the commandant of the garrison have he headquarters in the latter place as guest of major von abercron we meet at dinner that night and again after dinner a strangely mixed company we meet many officer and the pretty american wife of a officer frau elsie von heinrich late of jersey city who have make a adventurous trip in a motor ambulance from germany to see she husband before he go to the front and who send regard by we to score of people in she old home whose name i have forget we meet also a civilian guest of the commandant who introduce himself as August blankhertz and who turn out to be a distinguished big-game hunter and gentleman aeronaut with major von abercron for a mate he sail from st loui in the great balloon race for the jame gordon bennett cup they come down in the canadian wood and nearly die of hunger and exposure before they find a lumber camp they balloon be call the germanium there be another civilian a member of the german secret-service staff wear the norfolk jacket and the green alpine hat and on a cord about he neck the big gold token of authority which invariably mark a representative of this branch of the german espionage bureau and he be wear likewise that transparent air of mystery which seem always to go with the follower of he ingenious profession during the evening the mayor of maubeuge come a bearded melancholy gentleman to confer with the commandant regard a clash between a german under-officer and a household of he constituent orderly and attendant bustle in and out and somebody play viennese waltz song on a piano and altogether there be quite a gay little party in the parlor of this handsome house which the german have commandeer for the use of they garrison staff at early bedtime when we step out of the door of the lit-up mansion into the street it be as though we have step into a far-off country except for the tramp of a sentry 's hobbed boot over the sidewalk and the challenging call of another sentry round the corner the town be as silent as a town of tomb all the people who remain in this place have close they forlorn shop where barren shelf and empty showcase testify to the state of trade and they have shut themselves up in they house away from sight of the invader we could guess what they thought must be they industry be paralyzed and they liberty be curtail and every other house be a breach and worthless shell among ourselves we debate as we walk along to the squalid tavern where we have be quarter which of the spectacles we have that day see most fitly typify the fruitage of war -- the shatter haunt fort lie now in the moonlight beyond the town or the brooding conquer half-destroyed town itself i guess if it come to that they both typify it chapter 14 the red glutton as we go along next day through the town of maubeuge we hear singing and singing be a most rare thing to be hear in this town in a country where no one smile any more who belong in that country singing be not a thing which you would naturally expect to hear so we turn off of we appoint route there be a small wine shop at the prow of a triangle of narrow street it have be a wine shop it be now a beer shop there have be a french proprietor he have a german partner now it have be only a few week -- you could not as yet measure the interval of time in term of month -- since the german come and sit themselves down before maubeuge and blow its defens flat with they 42-centimeter earthquake and march in and take it it have be only these few week but already the germanize brand of the conqueror be sear deep in the gall flank of this typically french community the town-hall clock be make to tick german time which vary by a even hour from french time tack upon the door of the little cafe where we eat we meal be a card setting forth with painful german particularity the tariff which might properly be charge for food and for lodging and drink and what not and it be do in german-gothic script all very angular and precise and it be sign by he excellency the german commandant and its price be predicate on german logic and the estimate depth of a german wallet you might read a newspaper print in german character if so mind but none print in french whether so mind or not so when we enter in at the door of the little french wine shop where the three street meet to find out who within have heart of grace to sing ' o strassburg o strassburg ' so lustily lo and behold it have be magically transform into a german beer shop it be as we presently learn the only beer shop in all of maubeuge and the reason for that be this : no sooner have the german clear and open the road back across belgium to they own frontier than a enterprising tradesman of the rhein country who somehow have escape military service load many keg of good german beer upon truck and bring he precious cargo overland a hundred mile and more southward certainly he could not have move the lager caravan without the consent and aid of the berlin war office for all i know to the contrary he may have be finance in that competent quarter that same morning i have see a field weather station mount on a automobile standing in front of we lodging place just off the square it be go to the front to make and compile meteorological report a general staff who provide weather office on wheel and printing office on wheel -- this last for the set up and striking off of small proclamation and order -- might very well have bethought themselves that the soldier in the field would be all the fitter for the job before he if stay with the familiar malt of the vaterland believe I i would not put it past they anyway have safely reach maubeuge the far-seeing rheinishman effect a work understanding with a native publican which be probably a good thing for both see that one have a stock of goods and a ready-made trade but no place to set up business and that the other own a shop but have lose he trade and he stock-in-trade likewise these two the little affable german and the tall grave frenchman stand now behind they counter draw off mug of pilsener as fast as they four hand could move they patron they most vocal and boisterous patron be a company of musketeer who have march in from the north that afternoon as a rule the new levy go down into france on troop train but this company be part of a draft which for some reason come afoot without exception they be young man husky and hearty and inspire with a beefish joviality at have find a place where they could ease they foot and rest they leg and slake they week-old thirst upon they own soothing brew be german they express they gratefulness in song we have difficulty get into the place so completely be it fill man sit in the window ledge and in the few chair that be available and even in the fireplace and on the end of the bar clunk they heel against the wooden baseboard the other stand in such close order they could hardly clear they elbow to lift they glass the air be choky with a blended smell derive from dust and worn boot leather and spilt essence of hop and healthy unwashed sweaty body on a chair in a corner stand a tall tired and happy youth who beat time for the singing with a empty mug and between beat nourish himself on draft from a fill mug which he hold in he other hand with we be a german officer he be a captain of reserve and a person of considerable wealth he shove he way to the bar and lay down upon its sloppy surface two gold coin and say something to a petty officer who be direct the distribution of the refreshment the noncom hammer for silence and when he get it announce that the herr hauptmann have donate twenty mark ' worth of beer all present be invite to cooperate in drink it up which they do but first give three cheer for the captain and three more for he american friend and afterward while the replenish mug radiate in crockery wave from the bar to the back wall sing for we a song which so far as the air be concerned sound amazingly like unto every little movement have a mean all its own they weariness be quite fall away from they they be like schoolboy on a frolic indeed i think a good many of they be schoolboy as we come out a private who stand in the doorway speak to we in fair english he have never be in america but he have a brother living in east st loui and he want to know if any of we know he brother this be a common experience with we every third german soldier we meet have a brother or a sister or somebody in america this soldier could not have be more than eighteen year the down on he cheek be like corn silk he tell we he and he comrade be very glad to be go forward where there would be fight they have have no luck yet there have be no fighting where they have be i remember afterward that luck be the word he use we go back to the main street and for a distance the roar of they volley chorus follow we man and woman stand at the door of the house along the way they be silent and idle idleness and silence seem always to have fall as grim legacy upon the civilian populace of these capture town but the look upon they face as they listen to the soldier ' voice be not hard to read they town be pierce by cannonball where it be not scarify with fire there be sorrow and the abundant cause for sorrow in every house commerce be dead and credit be kill and round the next turn they enemy sing he drinking song i judge that the thrifty frenchman who go partner with the german stranger in the beer traffic lose popularity that day among he fellow townsman we be bind for the railway station which the german already have rechristen bahnhof word have be bring to we that train of wounded man and prisoner be due in the course of the afternoon from the front and more especially from the right wing and in this prospect we scented a story to be write to reach the station we cross the river sambre over a damage bridge and pass beneath the arched passageway of the citadel which the great vauban build for the still greater loui xiv think no doubt when he build it that it would always be potent to keep out any foe however strong next to its stupid massiveness what most impressed we this day be its utter uselessness as a protection the station stand just beyond the wall with a park at one side of it but the park have become a timber deadfall at the approach of the enemy hundred of splendid tree have be fell to clear the way for gunfire from the inner defens in the event that the german get by the outer circle of fortress after the german take the fort though the town surrender so all this destruction have be futile there be acre of ragged stump and between the stump jungle of overlap trunk and interlace bough from which the dead and die leaf shake off in shower one of we party who know something of forestry estimate that these tree be about forty year old i suppose he add speculatively that when this war end these people will replant they tree then in another forty year or so another war will come and they will chop they all down again on the whole i be rather glad i do not live on this continent the train which be expect have not begin to arrive yet so with two companion i sit on a bench at the back of the station wait face we be a line of house one the corner house be a big black char it have catch fire during the shell and burn quite down its neighbor be intact except for shatter chimney and smash door and riddled window the concussion of a big gunfire have shiver every window in this quarter of town there be no sufficient stock of glass with which to replace the broken pane and no way of bring in fresh supplies the owner of the damaged building have patch the hole with bit of plank filch from more complete ruin near by of course there be other reason too if one stop to sum they up : few would have the money to buy fresh glass even if there be any fresh glass to buy and the local glazier -- such of they as survive -- would be serve the color all france have go to war and at this time of write have not come back except in dribble stream of wound and prisoner these ragged board sparingly nail across the window socket give the house the air of wear mask and of squint at we through narrow eye slit the railroad station be windowless too like all the building round about but nobody have close the opening here and it gape emptily in fifty place and the raw gusty wind of a north european fall search through it in this immediate neighborhood few of the citizen be to be see even those house which still be humanly habitable appear to be untenanted only soldier be about and not so very many of they a hundred yard up the track on a siding a squad of man with a derrick and crane be hoist capture french field gun upon flat car to be take to berlin and exhibit as spoil of conquest for the benefit of the stay-at-home a row of these cannon perhaps fifty in all be rank alongside await loading and transportation except for the agonize whine of the tackle-block and the buzz of the fly the place where we sit be pretty quiet there be a million fly and there seem to be a billion you would not have think unless you have be there to see for yourself that there be so many fly in the world by the time this be print the cold weather have cure europe of its fly plague but during the first three month i know that the track of war be absolutely sow with these vermin even after a night of hard frost they would be as thick as ever at midday -- as thick and as clinging and as nasty go into any close ill-aired place and no matter what else you might smell you smell fly too as i sit and look back on what i myself have see of it this war seem to I to have be not so much a sight as a stench everything which make for human happiness and human usefulness it have destroy what it have breed along with misery and pain and fat bury grounds be a vast and loathsome stench and a universe of fly the smell and the fly they be here in this railroad station in sickening profusion i call it a railroad station although it have lose its function as such week before the only train which run now be run by the german for strictly german purpose and so the station have become a victualing point for troops go south to the fighting and a way hospital for sick and wounded come back from the fight what in better day than these have be the lunch room be a place for the redressing of hurt its high counter which once hold sandwich and tart and wine bottle be pile with snowdrift of medicate cotton and roll of lint and bucket of antiseptic wash and drug vial the ticket booth be a improvise pharmacy spare medical supplies fill the room where formerly fussy custom officer examine the luggage of traveler come out of belgium into france just beyond the platform a wooden booth with no front to it have be knock together out of rough plank and relay of cook with greasy apron over they soil gray uniform make vast caldron of stew -- always stew -- and brew so-called coffee by the gallon against the come of those who would need it the stuff be sure to be need all of it and more too so they cook and cook unceasingly and never stop to wipe a pan or clean a spoon at we back be the wait room for first-class passenger but no passenger of any class come to it any more and so by common consent it be a sort of rest room for the red cross man who mostly be german but with a few capture frenchman among they still wear they french uniform there be three or four french military surgeon -- prisoner to be sure but go and come pretty much as they please the tacit arrangement be that the german should succor german and that the frenchman should minister to they own disabled countryman among the prisoner go north but in a time of stress -- and that mean every time a train come in from the south or west -- both nationality mingle together and serve without regard for the color of the coat worn by those whom they serve probably from the day it be put up this station have never be really and entirely clean judge by american standard continental railway station be rarely ever clean even when condition be normal now that condition be anything but normal this maubeuge station be incredibly and incurably filthy no doubt the german nursing sister who be bring here try at first with they german love for orderliness to keep the interior reasonably tidy but they have be swamp by more important task for two week now the wound have be pass through by the thousand and the ten of thousand daily so between train the woman drop into chair or down upon cot and take they rest in snatch but they finger do not rest always they hand be busy with the making of bandage and the fluffing of lint by bit i learn something about three of the woman who serve on the so-called day shift which mean that they work from early morning until long after midnight one be a title woman who have volunteer for this duty she be beyond middle age plainly in poor health herself and everlastingly on the verge of collapse from weakness and exhaustion she will keep she on she foot the second be a professional nurse from one of the university town -- from bonn i think she call herself sister bartholomew for the german nurse who go to war take other name than they own just as nun do she be a beautiful woman tall and strong and round-faced with big fine gray eye she energy have no limit she run rather than walk she have a smile for every maimed man who be bring to she but when the man have be treat and have limp away or have be carry away i see she often wring she hand and sob over the utter horror of it all then another sufferer would appear and she would wipe the tear off she cheek and get to work again the third -- so a assistant surgeon confide to we -- be the mistress of a officer at the front a prostitute of the berlin sidewalk who enrol for hospital work when she lover go to the front she be a tall dark handsome girl who look to be more spaniard than german and she be graceful and lithe even in the exceedingly shapeless costume of blue print that she wear she be less deft than either of she associate but very willing and eager as between the three -- the noblewoman the work woman and the woman of the street -- the medical official in charge make no distinction whatsoever why should they in this sisterhood of mercy they all three stand upon the same common ground i never know that slop jar be noble thing until i see woman in these military lazaret bear they in they arm then to I they become as altar vessel lack woman to do it the head surgeon have intrust the task of clear away the dirt to certain man a sorry job they make of it for accumulate nastiness that wait room be a augean stable and the two soldier who dawdle about in it with broom lack woefully in the quality of hercule put a broom in a man 's hand be the best argument in favor of woman 's suffrage that i know of anyhow a third man who help at chore in the transform lunch room have gather up and pile together in a heap upon the ground near we a bushel or so of use bandage -- grim reminder leave behind after the last train go by -- and he have touch a match to the heap in a effort to get rid of it by fire by reason of what be upon they the clothes burn slowly send up a smudge of acrid smoke to mingle with smell of carbolic acid and iodoform and the scent of boiling food and of thing infinitely less pleasant than these presently a train roll in and we cross through the building to the trackside to watch what would follow already we have see a sufficiency of such train we know before it come what it would be like : in front the dumpy locomotive with a soldier engineer in the cab then two or three box car of prisoner with the door lock and arm guard ride upon the roof then two or three shabby misuse passenger coach contain injured officer and sometimes injure common soldier too and then stretch off down the rail a long string of box car each of which would be bed with straw and would contain for furniture a few rough wooden bench range from side to side and each car would contain ten or fifteen or twenty or even a greater number of sick and cripple man those who could sit be upon the hard bench elbow to elbow pack snugly in those who be too weak to sit sprawl upon the straw and often have barely room in which to turn over so closely be they bestow it have be day since they have start back from the field hospital where they have have they first-aid treatment they have move by sluggish stage with long halt in between always the wound must wait upon the siding while the troop train from home speed down the clear main line to the smoking front that be the merciless but necessary rule the man who get himself cripple become a obstacle to further progress a drag upon the wheel of the machine whereas the man who be yet whole and fit be the man whom the general want so the fresh grist for the mill the raw material if you will be expedite upon its way to the hopper that which already have be ground up be relatively of the smallest consequence because of this law which might not be break or amend these wound man would perforce spend several day aboard train before they could expect to reach the base hospital upon german soil maubeuge be at considerably less than midway of the distance between start point and probable destination altogether the trip might last a week or even two week -- a trip that ordinarily would have last less than twelve hour through it these man who be mess and mangled in every imaginable fashion would wallow in the dirty matted straw with nothing except that thin layer of cover between they and the car floor that jolt and jerk beneath they we know it and they know it and there be nothing to be do they wound would fester and be hot with fever they clotted bandage would clot still more and grow stiffer and harder with each drag hour those who lack overcoat and blanket -- and some there be who lack both -- would half freeze at night for food they would have slop dish up for they at such stop place as this present one and they would slake they thirst on water draw from contaminate wayside well and be glad of the chance gangrene would come and blood poison and all manner of corruption tetanus would assuredly claim its toll indeed these horror be already at work among they i do not tell it to sicken my reader but because i think i should tell it that he may have a fuller conception of what this fashionable institution of war mean -- we could smell this train as we could smell all the train which follow after it when it be yet fifty yard away from we be it remember furthermore that no surgeon accompany this afflict living freightage that not even a qualify nurse travel with it accord to the classify process of those in authority on the battle line these man be lightly wound man and it be presume that while en route they would be competent to minister to themselves and to one another under the grading system employ by the chief surgeon a man who be still all in one piece and who probably would not break apart in transit be designate as be lightly wound this statement be no attempt upon my part to indulge in levity concern the most frightful situation i have encounter in nearly twenty year of active newspaper work it be the sober unexaggerated truth and so these lightly wound man -- man with they jaw shoot away man with hole in they breast and they abdomen man with they spine tip splintered man with they arm and leg break man with they hand and foot shred by shrapnel man with they scalp rip open man with they nose and they ear and they finger and toe go man jar to the very marrow of they bone by explosive -- these man for whom ordinarily soft bed would have be provide and expert care and special food come trundle up alongside that noisome station and through the door opening from where they be house like dumb beast they look out at we with the glaze eye of dumb suffering beast as the little toy-like european car halt bump together hard orderly go run down the train bearing bucket of soup and of coffee and of drinking water and loaf of the heavy dark german bread behind they go other man -- bull-necked strong man pick for this job because of they strength they task be to bring back in they arm or upon they shoulder such man as be past walk there be no stretcher there be no time for stretcher behind this train would be another one just like it and behind that one another and so on down a eighty-mile stretch of dolorous way and this mind you be but one of three line carry out of france and belgium into germany victim of the war to be make well again in order that they might return and once more be feed as tidbit into the maw of that war it be but one of a dozen or more such stream thread back from as many battle zone to the country engage in this wide and ardent scheme of mutual extermination half a minute after the train stop a procession be move toward we make up of man who have wriggle down or who have be ease down out of the car and who be come to the convert buffet room for help mostly they come afoot sometimes hold on to one another for mutual support perhaps one in five be bear bodily by a orderly he might be hunch in the orderly 's arm like a weary child or he might be travel upon the orderly 's back pack-fashion with he arm grip about the bearer 's neck and then in such a case the pair of they with the white hollow face of the wounded man nod above the sweat red face of the other become a monstrosity with two head and one pair of leg here advance toward we with the gait of a doddering grandsire would be a boy in he teens bent double and clutch he middle with both hand here would be a man whose hand have be smash and from beyond the rude swathing of cotton he finger protrude stiffly and be so congested and swollen they look like fat red plantain here be a man whose foot be damage he have a crutch make of a spade handle next would be a man with a hole in he neck and the bandage have pull away from about he throat show the raw inflamed hole in this parade i see a french infantryman aid along by a capture zouave on one side and on the other by a german sentry who swing he loaded carbine in he free hand behind they i see a awful nightmare of a man -- a man whose face and bare crop head and hand and shoe be all of a livid poisonous green cast a shell of some new and particularly devilish variety have burst near he and the fume which it generate in burst have dye he green every man would have tie about he neck or to one of he buttonhole the german field-doctor 's card tell of the nature of he hurt and the place where he have sustain it and the uniform of nearly every one would be discolor with dry blood and where the coat gape open you mark that the harsh white cambric lining be make harsher still by stiff brownish - red streaking in at the door of the improvise hospital file the parade and the wound man drop on the floor or else be lower upon chair and table and cot -- anywhere that there be space for they to huddle up or stretch out and then the overworked surgeon french and german and the german nursing sister and certain of the orderly would fall to there be no time for the finer daintier proceedings that might have spare the sufferer some measure of they agony it be cut away the old bandage pull off the filthy cotton dab with antiseptic what be beneath pour iodine or diluted acid upon the bare and shrink tissue perhaps do that with the knife or probe which must be do where incipient mortification have set in clap on fresh cotton wind a strip of cloth over it pin it in place and send this man away to be feed -- provide he could eat then turn to the next poor wretch the first man be out of that place almost before the last man be in that be how fast the work go forward one special horror be spare : the patient make no outcry they grit they tooth and writhe where they lay but none shriek out indeed neither here nor at any of the other place where i see wound man do we hear that chorus of moan and shriek with which fiction always have invest such scene those newly strike seem stunned into silence those who have have time to recover from the first shock of be strike appear buoy and sustain by a stoic quality which lift they mute and calm above the call of tortured nerve and tear flesh those who be delirious might call out those who be conscious lock they lip and be steadfast in all we experience i come upon just two man in they sens who give way at all one be a boy of nineteen or twenty in a field hospital near rheim whose kneecap have be smash he sit up on he bed rock he body and whimper fretfully like a infant he have be do that for day a nurse tell we but whether he whimper because of he suffering or at the thought of go through life with a stiffened leg she do not know the other be here at maubeuge i help hold he right arm steady while a surgeon take the bandage off he hand when the wrap come away a shatter finger come with it -- it have rot off if you care to know that detail -- and at the sight the victim utter growl rasp animal-like sound even so i think it be the thing he see more than the pain of it that overcome he the pain he could have bear he have be bear it for day i particularly remember one other man who be bring in off this first train he be a young giant for certain the old father of frederick the great would have have he in he regiment of grenadier guard well for that matter he be a grenadier in the employ of the same family now he hobble in under he own motive power and lean against the wall until the first flurry be over then at a nod from one of the shirt-sleeved surgeon he stretch himself upon a bare wooden table which have just be vacate and indicate that he want relief for he leg -- which leg i recall be incase in a rude splintlike arrangement of plaited straw the surgeon take off the straw and the packing beneath it the giant have a hole right through he knee from side to side and the flesh all about it be horribly swollen and purplish - black so the surgeon souse the joint wound and all with iodine the youth meanwhile stare blandly up at the ceiling with he arm cross on he wide breast i stand right by he look into he face and he do not so much as bat a eyelid but he do not offer to get up when the surgeon be do with treat he he turn laboriously over on he face pull he shirt free from he body as he do so and then we see that he have a long infected gash from a glance bullet across the small of he back he have be lie on one angry wound while the other be redress you marvel not that he have endure it without blench but that he have endure it at all the train stay with we perhaps half a hour and in that half hour at least a hundred man must have have treatment of sort a signal sound and the orderly lift up the few waste specter who still remain and tote they out almost the last man to be bear away be injure in both leg a orderly carry he in he arm see the need of haste the orderly seek to heave he burden aboard the nearest car the man in that car protest already they space be overcrowded so the patient orderly stagger down the train until he find the cripple soldier 's rightful place and thrust he into the straw just as the wheel begin to turn as the car gather speed roll by we we could see that nearly all the traveler be feed themselves from pannikin of the bull-meat stew wrapping on they hand and sometimes about they face make they doubly awkward and the hot tallowy mess spill in spatter stream upon they and upon the straw under they they be on they way at the end of another twenty-four hour stretch they might have travel fifty or sixty or even seventy mile the place they leave behind they be in worse case than before grease spatter the earth the floor of the buffet room be ankle deep literally in discard bandage and blood-stiffened cotton and the nurse and the doctor and the helper drop down in the midst of it all to snatch a few precious minute of rest before the next creak caravan of misery arrive there be no need to tell they of its come they know all through that afternoon and night and through the next day and night and through the half of the third day that we stay on in maubeuge the train come back they come ten minute apart twenty minute apart a hour apart but rarely more than a hour would elapse between train and this traffic in mar and mutilate humanity have be go on for four week and would go on for nobody know how many week more when the train have go out of sight beyond the first turn to the eastward i speak to the head surgeon of the german contingent -- a broad bearded middle-aged man who sit on a baggage truck while a orderly pour a mixture of water and antiseptic over he soil hand a lot of those poor devil will die i suggest less than three per cent of those who get back to the base hospital will die he say with a snap of he jaw as though challenge I to doubt the statement that be the wonder of this war -- that so many be kill in the fighting and that so few die who get back out of it alive these modern scientific bullet these civilized bullet -- he laugh in self-derision at the use of the word -- they be cruel and yet they be merciful too if they do not kill you outright they have a little way somehow of not kill you at all but the bayonet wound and the saber wound i say how about they i have be here since the very first he say since the day after we troops take this town and god know how many thousand of wounded man -- german englishman frenchman turco some belgian -- have pass through my hand but as yet i have to see a man who have be wound by a saber or a lance i see one bayonet wound yesterday or the day before the man have fall on he own bayonet and drive it into he side shrapnel wound yes wound from fragment of bomb again yes bullet wound i can not tell you how many of those i have see but surely many thousand but no bayonet wound this be a war of hot lead not of cold steel i read of these bayonet charge but i do not believe that many such story be true i do not believe it either the train which follow after the first come up out of france furnish for we much the same sight the first one have furnish and so with some slight variation do the third train and the fourth and all the rest of they the station become a sty where before it have be a kennel the fly multiply the stench increase in volume and strength if such be possible the window of the litter wait room with they crack half pane be like ribald eye wink at the living affliction which continually trail past they the floor look as though there have be a snowstorm a train come whose occupant be nearly all wound by shrapnel wound of the head the face and the neck abound among these man -- for the shell explode in the air above where they crouch in they trench have bespatter they with iron pebble each individual picture of suffer recur with such monotonous and regular frequency that after a hour or so it take something out of the common run -- a especially vivid splash of daubed and crimson horror -- to quicken we imagination and make we fetch out we note book i recall a young lieutenant of uhlan who have be wound in the breast by fragment of a grenade which likewise have smash in several of he rib he proudly finger he newly acquire iron cross while the surgeon relace he battered torso with strip of gauze afterward he ask I for a cigar provide i have one to spare say he have not taste tobacco for a week and be perish for a smoke we begin to take note then how the wound man watch we as we puff at we cigar and we realize they be dumbly envy we each mouthful of smoke so we send we chauffeur to the public market with order to buy all the cigar he could find on sale there he presently return with the front and rear seat of the automobile pile high with bundle sheaf of the brown weed -- you can get a astonishingly vast number of those domestic french cigar for the equivalent of thirty dollar in american money -- and we turn the whole cargo over to the head nurse on condition that until the supply be exhaust she give a cigar to every hurt soldier who might crave one regardless of he nationality she cry as she thank we for the small charity we can feed they -- yes she say but we have nothing to give they to smoke and it be very hard on they a little later a train arrive which bring three carload of french prisoner and one carload of english among the frenchman be many alpine ranger so call -- the first man we have see of this wing of the service -- and by reason of they dark blue uniform and they flat blue cap they look more like sailor than soldier at first we take they for sailor there be thirty-four of the englishman be all that be leave of a company of the west yorkshire regiment of infantry confinement for day in a bare box car with not even water to wash they face and hand in have not altogether rob they of a certain trim alertness which seem to belong to the british fighting man they puttee be snugly reef about they shank and they khaki tunic button up to they throat we talk with they they want to know if they have reach germany yet and when we tell they that they be not out of france and have all of belgium still to traverse they groan they dismay in chorus we have ` ad a very ` ard time of it sir say a spokesman who wear sergeant 's stripe on he sleeve and who tell we he come from sheffield seventeen ` ours we be in the trench under fire all the time with water up to we middle and nothing to eat we be ` old the center and when the frenchy fall back they do not give we chap no warning and pretty soon the dutchman they ` ad we flank both side and we ` ad to quit but we do not quit until we would lose all but one of we officer and a good ` alf of we man where be this one of we ask do not know sir he say it be a bloom funny war you never know the name of the place where you be fight at unless you ` ear it by chance then he add : could you tell we sir ` ow be the war go be we give the german a proper ` ide all along the line we inquire regard they treatment they do not particularly fancy the food -- narsty slop the sergeant call it -- although it be reasonably plentiful and be true englishman they sorely miss they tea then too on the night before they overcoat have be take from they and no explanation vouchsafe we could ` ave do with they say the speaker bitterly pretty cold it be in this ` ere car and what with winter come on and everything i call it a bit thick to be take we overcoat off of we we go and ask a german officer who have the convoy in charge the reason for this and he say the overcoat of all the uninjured man soldier as well as prisoner have be confiscate to furnish covering for such of the wound as lack blanket still i observe that the guard for the train have they overcoat so i do not vouch for the accuracy of he explanation it be get late in the afternoon and the fifth train to pull in from the south since we advent on the spot -- or possibly it be the sixth -- have just halt when from the opposite direction a troop-train long and heavy pant into sight and stop on the far track while the man aboard it get a early supper of hot victuals we cross over to have a look at the new arrival it be a long train draw by one locomotive and shove by another and it include in its length a string of flat car upon which be lash many field piece and commandeer automobile and even some family carriage not to mention baggage wagon and cook wagon and supply wagon for a wonder the coach in which the troops ride be new smart coach seemingly just out of the builder ' hand they be mainly first and second class coach varnish outside and equip with upholstered compartment where the trooper take they luxurious ease follow the german fashion the soldier have decorate each car with field flower and sheaf of wheat and bough of tree and even with long paper streamer of red and white and black also the artist and wag of the detachment have be busy with color chalk there be display on one car a lively crayon picture of a very fierce two-tailed bavarian lion eat up he enemy -- a nation at a bite another car bear a menu : russian caviar servian rice meat english roast beef belgian ragout french pastry upon this same car be letter a bit of crude verse which as we have come to know be a favorite with the german private by my poor translation it run somewhat as follow : for the slav a kick we have and for the jap a slap the briton too -- we 'll beat he blue and knock the frenchman flat altogether the train have quite the holiday air about it and the man who travel on it have the same spirit too they be bavarian -- all new troops and nearly all young fellow they accouterment be bright and they uniform almost unsoiled and i see that each man carry in he right boot top the long ugly-looking dirk-knife that the bavarian foot-soldier fancy the german always show heat when they find a big service clasp-knife hang about a capture englishman 's neck on a lanyard call it a barbarous weapon because of the length of the blade and long sharp brad-awl which fold into a slot at the back of the handle but a equally grim bit of cutlery in a bavarian 's bootleg seem to they a entirely proper tool for a soldier to be carry the troops -- there must have be a full battalion of they -- pile off the coach to exercise they leg they skylark about on the earth and sing and dance and be too full of coltish spirit to eat the ration that have be bring from the kitchen for they consumption see we camera a lieutenant who speak english come up to invite we to make a photograph of he and he man with they bedecked car for a background he have be ill he say since the outbreak of hostility which explain why he be just now get he first taste of active campaigning service wait he say vaingloriously just wait until we get at the damned british some one else may have the frenchman -- we want to get we hand on the englishman do you know what my man say they say they be glad for once in they life to enjoy a fight where the policeman will not interfere and spoil the sport that be the bavarian for you -- the prussian be best at drill but the bavarian be the best fighter in the whole world only let we see the enemy -- that be all we ask i say what news have you from the front all go well eh as for I i only hope there will be some of the enemy leave for we to kill it be a glorious thing -- this go to war i think we shall get there very soon where the fighting be i can hardly wait for it and with that he hop up on the step of the nearest car and pose for he picture have just come from the place whither he be so eagerly repair i might have tell he a few thing i might for example have tell he what the captain of a german battery in front of la fere have say and that be this : i have be on this one spot for nearly three week now serve my gun by day and by night i have lose nearly half of my original force of man and two of my lieutenant we shoot over those tree top yonder in accordance with direction for range and distance which come from somewhere else over field telephone but we never see the man at whom we be firing they fire back without see we and sometimes they shell fall short or go beyond we and sometimes they fall among we and kill and wind a few of we thus it go on day after day i have not with my own eye see a frenchman or a englishman unless he be a prisoner it be not so much pleasure -- fight like this i might have tell the young bavarian lieutenant of other place where i have be -- place where the dead lay for day unburied i might have tell he there be nothing particularly pretty or particularly edifying about the process of be kill death i take it be never a very tidy proceeding but in battle it acquire a add unkemptness man suddenly and sorely stricken have a way of shrink up inside they clothes unless they die on the instant they have a way of tear they coat open and grip with they hand at they vitals as though to hold the life in they have a way of sprawl they leg in grotesque posture they have a way of put they arm up before they face as though at the very last they would shut out a dreadful vision those contorted twisted arm with the elbow up those spraddled stark leg and most of all those white dot of shirt -- those i have learn to associate in my own mind with the accomplished fact of mortality upon the field i might have tell he of sundry field hospital which i have lately visit i could recreate in my memory as i shall be able to recreate it as long as i live and have my sens a certain room in a certain schoolhouse in a french town where seven man wriggle and fight in the unspeakable torment of lockjaw and another room fill to capacity with man who have be bear there because there be nothing humanly to be do for they and who now lay very quietly they suetty-gray face lace with tiny red stripe of fever and they paling eye stare up at nothing at all and still another room give over entirely to stump of man who lack each a leg or a arm or a leg and a arm or both leg or both arm and still a fourth room wherein be man -- and boy too -- all blind all learn to grope about in the everlasting black night which would be they portion through all they day indeed for a immediate illustration of the product of the business toward which he be hasten i might have take he by the arm and lead he across two set of track and show he man in the prime of life who be hatchel like flax and maul like block and riddled like sieve and macerate out of the living image of they maker but i do none of these thing he have a picture of something uplifting and splendid before he eye he want to fight or he think he do which come to the same thing so what i do be to take down he name and promise to send he a complete copy of he picture in the care of he regiment and brigade and the last i saw of he he be half out of a car window wave good-by to we and wish we auf wiedersehen as he be bear away to he ordain place as we ride back through the town of maubeuge in the dusk the company which have sing o strassburg in the franco-german beer shop at the prow of the corner where the three street meet be just march away i think i catch in the weave gray line that flow along like quicksilver a glimpse of the boy who be so glad because he be about to have some luck in two day fourteen thousand wound man come back through maubeuge and possibly ten time that many new troops belong to the first October draft of a million pass down the line in that week fifty thousand wound man return from the german right wing alone he be a busy red glutton there seem to be no satisfy he greed chapter 15 belgium -- the rag doll of europe i have tell you already how on the first battlefield of any consequence that be visit by we party i pick up from where it lay in the track of the ally ' retreat a child 's rag doll it be a grotesque thing of print cloth with sawdust inside i find it at a place where two road meet presumably some belgian child flee with she parent before the german advance drop it there and later a wagon or perhaps a cannon come along and run over it the heavy wheel have mash the head of it flat in impression which i write when the memory of the incident be vivid in my mind i say that to I this shabby little rag doll typify belgium since then i have see many sight some be dramatic and some be pathetic and nearly all be stir but i still recall quite clearly the little picture of the fork of the belgian road with a background of trampled field and sack house and just at my foot the doll with its head crush in and the sawdust spill out in the rut the ongoing army have make and always now when i think of this i find myself think of belgium they have call she the cockpit of europe she be too in war that be neither of she making nor she choosing she have bear the hardest blow -- a poor little buffer state thrust in between great and truculent neighbor to strike at one another they must strike belgium by the accident of geography and the caprice of boundary line she have always be the anvil for they hammer jemmape and waterloo to cite two especially conspicuous example among great continental battle be fight on she soil indeed there be scarcely a inch of she for the possession of which man of breed not she own -- austrian and spaniard hanoverian and hollander englishman and prussian saxon and frenchman -- have not contend these other win the victory or lose they keep the spoil or give they up she wear the scar of the grudge when the grudge be settle so there be a reason for call she the cockpit of the nation but as i say just now i shall think of she as europe 's rag doll -- a thing to be clout and kick about to be crush under the hoof and the heel to be bleed and despoil and ravish thinking of she so i do not mean by this comparison to reflect in any wise on the courage of she people it will be a long time before the rest of the world forget the resistance she soldier make against overbrimming odds or the fortitude with which the family of those soldier face a condition too lamentable for description unsolicited so competent a authority as julius caesar once give the belgian a testimonial for they courage if i recall the commentary aright he say they be the most valorous of all the tribe of gaul those who come afterward to set down the tale and tally of the great war will record that through the century the belgian retain they ancient valor first and last i have rather exceptional opportunity for view the travail of belgium i be in brussels before it surrender and after it surrender i be in louvain when the german enter it and i be there again after the german have wreck it i trail the original army of invasion from brussels southward to the french border start at the tail of the column and reach the head of it before with my companion i be arrest and return by another route across belgium to german soil within three week thereafter i start on a ten-day tour which carry I through liege namur huy dinant and chimay and bring I back by mon brussels louvain and tirlemont with a side trip to the trench before antwerp -- roughly a kite-shaped journey which comprehend practically all the scope of active operation among the contend army prior to the time when the struggle for western flander begin finally just after antwerp fall i skirt the northern frontier of belgium and watch the refugee pour across the border into holland i be four time in liege and three time in brussels and any number of time i cross and recross my own earlier trail i travel afoot in a railroad train with other prisoner in a taxi - cab which we lose in a butcher 's cart which we give away in a open carriage which desert we and in a automobile which vanish i see how the populace behave while they little army be yet intact offering gallant resistance to the german i see how they behave when the german wedge split that army into broken fragment and the german be among they hold dominion with the bayonet and the bullet and finally six week later i see how they behave when substantially all they country exclude a strip of seaboard have be reduce to the state of a conquer fief hold and rule by force of arm by turn i see they determine desperate despairing half rebellious half subdue resign with the resignation of sheer helplessness which i take it be a different thing from the resignation of sheer hopelessness it be no very pleasant sight to see a country flay and quarter like a bloody carcass in a meat shop but a even less pleasant thing than that be to see a country 's heart break and belgium to-day be a country with a broken heart these line be write with intent to be print early in January by that time christmas be over and do with on the other side of the atlantic ocean in lieu of the christmas carol the cannon have ring its brazen christmas message across the trench make mockery of the word : on earth peace good will toward man on we side of the ocean the fine spirit of charity and graciousness which come to most of we at christmastime and keep christmas from become a thoroughly commercialize institution have begin to abate somewhat of its fervor to ourselves we be say many of we : we have do enough for the poor whom we have with we always but not always do we have with we a land famous for its fecundity that be now at grip with famine a land that once be light-hearted but where now you never hear anyone laugh aloud a land that be half a waste and half a captive province a land that can not find bread to feed its hungry mouth yet be call on to pay a tribute heavy enough to bankrupt it even in normal time a land whose best manhood be dead on the battleground or rusting in military prison whose woman and child by the countless thousand be either homeless wanderer thrust forth on the bounty of stranger in strange place or else be helpless hungry pauper sit with idle hand in they desolate home -- and that land be belgium have be a eyewitness to the cause that beget this condition and to the condition itself i feel it my duty to tell the story as i know it i be try to tell it dispassionately without prejudice for any side and without hysteria i concede the same to be a difficult undertake some space back i write that i have be able to find in belgium no direct proof of the mutilation the torturing and other barbarity which be charge against the german by the belgian though fully a dozen seasoned journalist both english and american have agree with I say that they experience in this regard have be the same as mine and though i say in the same breath that i could not find in germany any direct evidence of the brutality charge against the belgian by the german the prior statement be accept by some person as proof that my sympathy for the belgian have be chill through association with the german no such thing but what i desire now be the opportunity to say this : in the face of the present plight of this little country we need not look for individual atrocity belgium herself be the capsheaf atrocity of the war no matter what we nationality we race or we sentiment may be none of we can get away from that go south into france from the german border city of aix-la-chapelle we automobile carry we down the meuse on the eastern bank which mainly we follow during the first six hour of ride there be craggy cliff cover with forest which at interval be cleft by deep ravine where small farm cling to the side of the steep hill on the opposite shore cultivate land extend from the limit of one 's vision down almost to the water there they meet a continuous chain of manufacturing plant now all idle which stretch along the river shore from end to end of the valley culm and flume and stack and kiln succeed one another unendingly but no smoke issue from any chimney and we note that already weed be spring up in the quarry yard and about the mouth of the coal pit and the doorway of the empty factory consider that the german have to fight they way along the meuse drive back the french and belgian before they trust they column to enter the narrow defile there be in the physical aspect of thing no great amount of damage visible stagnation though lay like a blight on what have be one of the busiest and most productive industrial district in all of europe except that train run by endlessly bear wound man north and fresh troops and fresh supplies south the river shore be empty and silent in twenty mile of run we pass just two group of busy man at one place a gang of german soldier be strengthen the temporary support of a railroad bridge which have be blow up by the retire force and immediately repair by the invader in another place a company of reserve be recharge case of artillery shell which have be send back from the front in carload lot there be horse here -- a whole troop of draft horse which have be wear out in that relentless heartbreaking labor into which war sooner or later resolve itself the drive have be ship back this far to be rest and cure up or to be shoot in the event that they be past mending i have see perhaps a hundred thousand head of horse draw cannon and wagon and serve as mount for officer in the first drive of the german toward pari and have marvel at the uniformly prime condition of the team presumably these sorry crow-bait which droop and limp about the barren railroad yard at the back of the siding where the shell loader squat have be whole-skinned and sound of wind and joint in early August two month of service have turn they into gaunt wreck they rib stick through they hollow side they hoof be break they hock be swell enormously and worst of all there be great raw wound on they shoulder and back where the collar and saddle have wear through hide and flesh to the bone from that time on the number of mistreat worn-out horse we encounter in transit back from the front increase steadily finally we cease to notice they at all i should explain that the description i have give of the prevalent idleness along the meuse apply to the town and to the scatter workingman 's village that flank all or nearly all the outlying and comparatively isolate factory in the field and the truck patch the farm folk -- woman and old man usually with here and there child -- bestir themselves to get the moldered and mildewed remnant of they summer-ripened crop under cover before the hard frost come invariably we find this state of affair to exist wherever we go in the district of france and of belgium that have be fight over and which be now occupy by the german woodland and clear place where engagement have take place would within a month or six week thereafter show astonishingly few trace of the violence and death that have violate the peace of the countryside new grass would be grow in the wheel rut of the gun and on the side of the trench in which infantry have screen itself as though they take pattern by the example of nature the peasant would be afield gathering what remain of they harvest -- even plow and harrowing the ground for new sowing on the very edge of the battle front we see they so engage seemingly pay less heed to the danger of chance shell-fire than do the soldier who pass and repass where they toil in the town almost always the situation be different the people who live in those town seem like so many victim of a universal torpor they have lose even they sense of inborn curiosity regard the pass stranger probably from force of habit the shopkeeper stay behind they counter but between they and the few customer who come there be little of the vivacious chatter one have learn to associate with dealings among the dweller in most continental community we pass through village after village and town after town to find in each the same picture -- man and woman in mute cluster about the doorway and in the little square who barely turn they head as the automobile flash by once in a while we catch the sound of a brisker tread on the cobble street but when we look nine time in ten we see that the walker be a soldier of the german garrison quarter there to keep the population quiet and to help hold the line of communication i think though this cankered apathy have its merciful compensation after the first shock and panic of war there appear to descend on all who have a share in it whether active or passive a kind of numbed indifference as to danger a kind of callousness as to consequence which i find it difficult to define in word but which nevertheless impress itself on the observer 's mind as a definite and tangible fact the soldier get it and it enable he to endure he own discomfort and suffering and the discomfort and suffering of he comrade without visible mental strain the civic populace get it and as soon as they have be readjust to the altered condition force on they by the presence of war they become merely sluggish dull spectator of the great and move event go on about they the nurse and the surgeon get it or else they would go mad from the horror that surround they the wound get it and cease from complaint and lament it be as though all the nerve end in every human body be burnt blunt in the first hot gush of war even the casual eyewitness get it we get it ourselves and not until we have quit the zone of hostility do we shake it off indeed we do not try it make for subsequent sanity to carry for the time a drugged and stupefied imagination bar only huy where there have be some sharp street fight as attest by shell building and sandbag barricade yet rest on housetops and in window sill we encounter in the first stage of we journey no considerable evidence of havoc until late in the afternoon when we reach dinant i do not understand why the contemporary chronicle of event do not give more space to dinant at the time of its destruction and why they have not give it more space subsequently i presume the reason lie in the fact that the same terrible week which include the burning of louvain include also the burning of dinant and in the world-wide cry of protestation and distress which arise with the smoke of the greater calamity the smaller voice of grief for little ruin dinant be almost lose yet area consider no place in belgium that i have visit -- and this do not exclude louvain -- suffer such wholesale demolition as dinant before war begin the town have something less than eight thousand inhabitant when i get there it have less than four thousand by the best available estimate of those four thousand more than twelve hundred be then without food from day to day except such as the german give they there be almost no able-bodied male adult leave some have flee some be behind bar as prisoner of the german and a great many be dead estimate of the number of male inhabitant who have be kill by the graycoat for offens against the inflexible code set up by the german in eastern belgium vary a cautious native whisper that nine hundred of he fellow townsman be up there -- by that mean the trench on the hill back of the town a german officer newly arrive on the spot and apparently sincere in he effort to alleviate the misery of the survivor tell we that judge by what datum he have be able to gather between four and six hundred man and youth of dinant have fall in the house-to-house conflict between german and civilian or in the wholesale execution which follow the subjugation of the place and the capture of such ununiformed belligerent as be leave in this instance subjugation mean annihilation the lower part of the town where the well-to-do class live be almost unscathed casual shell-fire in the two engagement with the french that precede the taking of dinant have smash some cornice and shatter some window but nothing worse befall the lower half make up mainly of the little plaster-and-stone house of work people be go extinguished obliterate it lay in scorch and crumble waste and in it as we ride through i see exclude soldier just two live creature two child both little girl be play at housekeeping on some stone step under a doorway where there be no door use bit of wreckage for furniture we stop a moment to watch they they have small china doll the river flow placidly along between the artificial boundary of its stone quay and the strange formation of cliff rise at the back to the height of hundred of foot be as they have be soldier paddle on the water in skiff and thousand of raven flicker about the pinnacle of the rock but between river and cliff there be nothing but ruination -- the graveyard of the home of three thousand people yes it be the graveyard not alone of they home but of they prosperity and they hope and they ambition and they aspiration -- the graveyard of everything human being count worth have this be worse than hervé or battice or visé or any of the level town we have see take on the basis of comparative size it be worse even than louvain as we discover later it be worse than anything i ever see -- worse than anything i ever shall see i think these hollow shell about we be like the pick cadaver of house end of burnt and broken rafter stand up like rib empty window opening stare at we like the eye socket in skull it be not a town upon which we look but the dead and rot bone of a town just over the ragged line that mark the lowermost limit of the destructive fury of the conqueror and inside the section which remain intact we traverse a narrow street call -- most appropriately i think -- the street of paul the penitent and pass a little house on the shutter of which be write in chalked german script these word : a grossmutter -- grandmother -- ninety-six year old life here do not disturb she other house along here bear the familiar line write by german soldier who have be billet in they : good people leave they alone the people who enjoy the protection of these public testimonial be visible a few of they they be nearly all woman and child they stand in they shallow doorway as we automobile go by bear four american two german officer and the orderly of one of the officer -- for we have pick up a couple of chance passenger in huy -- and a german chauffeur as we interpret they look they have no hate for the german i take it the weight of they woe be so heavy on they that they have no room in they soul for anything else just beyond dinant at anseremme a beautiful little village at the mouth of a tiny river where artist use to come to paint picture and sick folk to breathe the tonic balsam of the hill we get room for the night in a smart clean tavern here be quarter a captain of cavalry who find time -- so brisk be he and so high-spirited -- to welcome we to the best the place afford to help set the table for we belated supper and to keep on term of jovial yet punctilious amiability with the woman proprietor and she good-looking daughter also to require he trooper to pay the woman in salute and speak thanks for every small office perform the husband of the older woman and the husband of one of the daughter be then serve the belgian color assume that they have not be kill or catch but between they and this german captain a perfect understanding have be arrive at when the head of the house fix the price she mean to charge we for we accommodation he speak up and suggest that the rate be scarcely high enough and also since she regular patron have be drive away at the beginning of the war he advise we that sizable tip on we leave would probably be appreciate next morning we rise from a breakfast -- the meat part of it have be furnish from the german commissary -- to find twenty lancer exercise they horse in a lovely little natural arena wall by hill just below the small eminence whereon the house stand it be like a scene from a wild west exhibition at home except that these german horseman lack the dash of we cowpuncher watch the show from a back garden we stand waist deep in flower and the captain 's orderly when he come to tell we we automobile be ready have a huge peony stick in a buttonhole of he blouse i catch a peep at another soldier who be flirt with a personable flemish scullery maid behind the protection of the kitchen wall the proprietress and she daughter stand at the door to wave we good-by and to wish we with apparent sincerity a safe journey down into france and a safe return to drop from this cozy peaceful place into the town of dinant again be to drop from a small earthly paradise into a small earthly hell somewhere near the middle of the little perdition we cavalry captain point to a shell of a house a fortnight ago he tell we we find a french soldier in that house -- or under it rather he have be there four week hide in the basement he take some food with he or find some there at any rate he manage to live four week he be blind and nearly deaf too when we find out where he be and dig he out -- but he be still alive one of we say we should like to have a look at a man who have undergo such a entombment no you would not say the captain for he be no very pleasant sight he be a slobbering idiot in the grand place near the shell-riddled church of notre dame -- build by the bishop in the thirteenth century restore by the belgian government in the nineteenth and destroy by the german gun in the twentieth -- a long queue of woman wind past the doorway of a building where german noncommissioned officer hand out to each applicant a big loaf of black soldier bread oh yes we feed the poor devil the german commandant a elderly scholarly look man of the rank of major say to we when he have come up to be introduce when we troops enter this town the man of the lower class take up arm and fire at we soldier so the soldier burn all they house and shoot all the man who come out of those house all this occur before i be send here have i be the commander of the troops i should have shoot they without mercy it be we law for war time and these belgian civilian must be teach that they can not fire on german soldier and not pay for it with they life and they home with the woman and child however the case be different on my own responsibility i be feed the destitute every day i give away to these people between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred loaf of bread and i give to some who be particularly needy ration of tea and sugar and coffee and rice also i sell to the butcher shop fresh and salt meat from we military store at cost require only that they in turn shall sell it at no more than a fair profit so long as i be station here i shall do this for i can not let they starve before my eye i myself have child it be like escape from a pesthouse to cross the one bridge of dinant that remain standing on its pier and go wind down the lovely valley overtake and pass many german wagon train the stout middle-aged soldier driver of which drowse on they seat pass also one march battalion of foot-reserve who they officer concur break from the rank to beg newspaper and cigar from we on the mountain ash the bright red berry dangle in clump like christmas bell and some of the leaf of the elm still cling to they bough so that the wide yellow road be dapple like a wild-cat 's back with black splotch of shadow only when we curve through some village that have be the scene of a skirmish or a reprisal do the roofless shell and the topple wall of the house stand gaunt and ugly in the sharp sunlight make we realize that we be still in the war track as nearly as we could tell from we brief scrutiny a great change have come over the dweller in southern belgium in August they have be buoyant and confident of the ultimate outcome and very proud of the behavior of they little army even when the german burst through the frontier defens and descend on they in innumerable swarm they be for the most part not daunt by those evidence of the invader ' numerical superiority and of they magnificent equipment the more there be of the german the fewer of they there would be to come back when the ally over the french border fall on they this we conceive to be the mental attitude of the villager and the peasant but now they be different the difference show in all they outward aspect -- in they gait in they drooped shoulder and half-averted face and most of all in they eye they have feel the weight of the armed hand and they must have hear the boast filter down from the officer to the man and from the man to the native populace that have take they country the german mean to keep it that belgium cease to be belgium would henceforth be set down on the map as a part of greater prussium see they now i begin to understand how a enforced docility may reduce a whole people to the level of dazed unresisting automaton yet a national spirit be harder to kill than a national boundary -- so the student of these thing say a little flash of flaming hate from the dead ash of thing a quick dart glance of defiance a hiss word from a seemingly subdue man or woman a shrill hostile whoop from a ragged youngster behind a hedge -- thing such as these show we that the courage of the belgian be not dead it have be crush to the ground but it have not be tear up by the root the root go down too far the under dog have secret dream of the day to come when he should not be underneath but on top even have there be no abandon custom-house to convince we of it we should have know when we cross from southern belgium into northern france for in france the proportion of house that have suffer in punitive attack be compare with belgium as one to ten understand i be speaking of house that have be deliberately burn in punishment and not of house that stand in the way of the cannon and the rapid-fire gun and so undergo partial or complete destruction as the result of a accidental yet inevitable and unavoidable process of these last france to the square mile could offer as lamentably large a show as belgium but building that present indubitable sign of have be fire with torch rather than with shell be few explain this and applaud it german of high rank say it present direct and confirmatory proof of they claim that sheer wanton reprisal be practically unknown in they system of warfare perhaps i can best set forth the german attitude in this regard by quote a general whom we interview on the subject : we do not destroy for the pleasure it give we we destroy only when it be necessary the french rural populace be more rational more tractable and much less turbulent than the belgian to a much greater degree than the belgian they have refrain from act against we man that would call for severe retaliatory measure on we part consequently we have spare the house and respect the property of the french noncombatant personally i have a theory of my own so far as we observation go the people live immediately on both side of the line be a interrelated people use the same speech and be much alike in temperament manners and mode of conduct i reach the private conclusion that because of the chorus of protest that arise from all the neutral country and particularly from the united state against the severity visit on belgium in August and September the word go forth to the german force in the field that the scheme of punishment for offender who violate the field code should be somewhat softened and relax however that be merely a personal theory i may be absolutely wrong about it the german general who interpret the meaning of the situation may have be absolutely right about it certainly the physical testimony be on he side also it seem to I the psychology of the people -- particularly of the womenfolk -- in northern france be not that of they neighboor over the frontier in a trade way the small shopkeeper here face ruin the belgian already have be ruin the frenchwoman whose son and brother and husband and father be at the front walk in the shadow of a great fear as you might tell by a look into the face of any one of they they be as peppercorn between the upper millstone and the nether and the sound of the crunching be always in they ear even though they turn to be ground up have not yet come for the belgian woman however the worst that might befall have already happen to they they soul could be wring no more they have no terror of the future since the past have be so terrible and the present be a living desolation of all they count worth while you might say the frenchwoman dread what the belgian endure the refill cup be at the lip of france belgium have drain it dry yet in both country the woman generally manifest the same steadfast and silent patience they say little but they eye ask question in the french town we see how bravely they strive to carry on they common affair of life which be so sadly shake and distort out of all normality by the earthquake of war for currency they have small french coin and strange german coin and in some place futile-looking little green-and-white slip issue by the municipality in denomination of one franc and two franc and five franc and redeemable in hard specie three month after the declaration of peace for wares to sell they have what remain of they deplete stock and for customer they friend and neighbor who look forward to commercial ruin which each day bring nearer to they all outwardly they be placid enough but it be not the placidity of content it bespeak rather a dumb disciplined acceptance by those who have have fatalism literally thrust on they as a doctrine to be practice look back on it i can recall just one woman i saw in france who maintain a unquenchable blitheness of spirit she be the little woman who manage the small cafe in maubeuge where we eat we meal perhaps she frugal french mind rejoice that business remain so good for many officer dine at she table and by continental standard pay she well and abundantly for what she feed they but i think a better reason lay in the fact that she have within she a innate buoyancy which nothing -- not even war -- could daunt she be one of those woman who remain trig and chic though they be sloven by instinct she blouse be never clean but she wear it with a air she skirt testify that skillet spit grease but in it she somehow look as trim as a trout fly even the hole in she stock give she piquancy and she have wonderful black hair which probably have not be comb properly for a month and big crackling black eye they tell we that one day a week or two before we come she have be particularly cheerful -- so cheerful that one of she patron be move to inquire the cause of it oh she say i be quite content with life to-day i have word that my husband be a prisoner now he be out of danger and you german will have to feed he -- and he be a great eater if you starve he then i shall starve you at breakfast captain mannesmann who be with we ask she in he best french for more butter she pause in she quick bird-like movement -- for she be waitress cook cashier manager and owner all roll into one -- and cock a saucy unkempt head at he ask that the question be repeat this time in he effort to be understand he stretch he word out so that unwittingly he voice take on rather a whine tone well do not cry about it she snap i 'll see what i can do return from the battle front we itinerary include a long stretch of the great road that run between paris and brussels a road much favored formerly by auto tourist but now use almost altogether for military purpose consider that we traverse a corner of the stage of one of the greatest battle thus far wage -- mon -- and that this battle have take place but a few week before there be remarkably few evidence remain of it with add force we remark a condition that have give we material for wonderment in we earlier journeying though a retreat army and a advance army both enormous in size have lately pour through the country the house the farm and the town be almost undamaged certain contrast which take on a heighten emphasis by reason of they brutal abruptness abound all over belgium you pass at a step as it be from a district of complete and irreparable destruction to one wherein all thing be orderly and order and much as they should be in peaceful time be it not for the stagnate town and the depression that berode the people one would hardly know these area have lately be overrun by hostile soldier and now groan under enormous tithe in isolate instance the depression have begin to lift certain breed of the polyglot flemish race have it appear a almost unkillable resilience of temper but in a town a mile away all those whom we meet would be like dead people who walk also there be many grave if we pass a long ridged mound of clay in a field unmarked except by the piled-up clod we know that at this spot many have fight and many have fall but if as occur constantly one separate mound or a little row of separate mound be at the roadside that probably mean a small skirmish such a grave almost always be mark by a little wooden cross with a name pencil on it and often the comrade of the dead man have hang he cap on the upright of the cross if it be a french cap or a belgian the weather would have worn it to a fade blue-and-red wisp of worst the german helmet stand the exposure better they retain they shape on a cross i see one helmet with a bullet hole right through the center of it in front sometimes there would be flower on the mound fade garland of field poppy and wreath of withered wild vine and by the presence of these we could tell that the dead man 's mate have time and opportunity to accord he greater honor than usually be be-stowed on a soldier kill in a advance or during a retreat mon be reach soon look much as i imagine mon must always have look and then after a few stretch and weary league brussels -- to my mind the prettiest and smartest of the capital city of europe not exclude pari i first saw brussels when it be as gay as carnival -- that be in mid-august and though liege have fall and namur be fall and the german legion be eat up the mile as they hurry forward through the dust and smoke of they own make brussels still float she flag build she toy barricade and wear a gay face to mask the panic clutch at she nerve get back four day later i find she beginning to rally from the shock of the invasion she people relieve to find that the enemy do not mean to mistreat noncombatant who obey he code of law be go about they affair in such odd hour as they could spare from watch the unending gray freshet that roar and pound through they street the flag be down and the counterfeit light-heartedness be go but essentially she be the same brussels come now however six week later i find a city that have be transform out of she own customary image by captivity and hunger and hard-curbed resentment the pulse of she life seem hardly to beat at all she lay in a coma flash up feverishly sometimes at false rumor of german repulse to the southward only the day before we arrive a wild story get abroad among the starveling in the poorer quarter that the russian have take berlin and have sweep across prussium and be now push forward with a irresistible army to relieve brussels so thousand of the deluded populace go to a bridge on the eastern outskirts of the town to catch the first glimpse of the victorious oncoming russian and there they stay until nightfall watch and hope and -- what be more pitiable -- believe from what i saw of he i judge that the military governor of brussels major bayer be not only a diplomat but a kindly and a engaging gentleman certainly he be wrestle most manfully and i think tactfully with a difficult and a dangerous situation for one thing he be keep he soldier out of sight as much as possible without relax he grip on the community he do this he say to reduce the chance of friction between he man and the people for friction might mean a spark and a spark might mean a conflagration and that would mean another and greater louvain we could easily understand that small thing might readily grow into great and serious trouble even the most docile-minded man would be apt to resent in the wearer of a hate uniform what he might excuse as over-officiousness or love of petty authority be the offender a policeman of he own nationality brooding over they own misfortune have wear the nerve of these captive to the very quick in any event be the outcome of this war what it may i do not believe the belgian can ever be mold either by kindness or by sternness into a tractable vassal race german civilization i concede to be a magnificent thing -- for a german but it seem to press on a alien neck as a galling yoke belgium under berlin rule would be i be sure alsace and lorraine all over again on a larger scale and a unhappier one she would never in my humble opinion be a star in the prussian constellation but always a raw sore in the prussian side in major bayer 's office i see the major stamp a order that turn over to the act burgomaster ten thousand bag of flour for distribution among the more needy citizen we be encourage to believe that this be by way of a free gift from the german government it may have be make without payment or promise of payment in regard to that i can not say positively but this be the inference we draw from the statement of the german officer who take part in the proceeding as for the act burgomaster he stand through the scene silent and inscrutable say nothing at all possibly he do not understand the conversation -- or that part of it which concern we -- be carry on exclusively in english he face as he bow to accept the certified warrant for the flour give we no hint of he mental process major bayer claim a professional kinship with those of we who be newspaper man as he be the head of the boy scout movement in germany and edit the official organ of the boy scout he have a squad of he scout on messenger duty at he headquarters -- smart alert-looking youngster they seem to I to be much more competent in they department than be the important-appearing german secret service agent who infested the build the german may make first-rate spy -- assuredly they system of espionage be well organize before the war break out -- but i do not think they be conspicuous success as detective : they method be so delightfully translucent major bayer have be one of the foremost german officer to set foot on belgian soil after the severance of friendly relation between the two country i believe he say that i hear the first shot fire in this war it come from a clump of tree within half a hour after we advance guard cross the boundary south of aachen and it wound the leg of a captain who command a company of scout at the head of the column we skirmisher surround the wood and beat the thicket and presently they bring forth the man who have fire the shot he be sixty year old and he be a civilian under the law of war we shoot he on the spot so you see probably the first shot fire in this war be fire at we by a franc-tireur by he act he have forfeit he life but personally i feel sorry for he for i believe like many of he fellow countryman who afterward commit such offens he be ignorant of the military indefensibility of he attack on we and do not realize what the consequence would be i be sure though that the severity with which we punish these offens at the outset be really merciful for only by kill the civilian who fire on we and by burn they house could we bring home to thousand of other the lesson that if they wish to fight we they must enlist in they own army and come against we in uniform as soldier within the same hour we be introduce to privy councilor otto von falke a austrian by birth but now after long service in cologne and berlin promote to be director of industrial art for prussium he have be send he explain by order of he kaiser to superintend the removal of historic work of art from endanger church and other building and turn they over to the curator of the royal belgian gallery at brussels for storage in the vault of the museum until such time as peace have be restore and they might be return with safety to they original position so you see gentleman say professor von falke the german be not despoil belgium of its wealth of picture and statue we be take pain to preserve and perpetuate they they belong to belgium -- not to we and we have no desire to take they away certainly we be not vandal who would wantonly destroy the splendid thing of art as we enemy have claim he be plainly a sincere man and he be much in love with he work that too be easy to see afterward though the thought come to we that if belgium be to become a german state by right of seizure and conquest he be save these masterpiece of vandyke and ruben not for belgium but for the greater glory of the greater empire however that be beside the mark what at the moment seem to we of more consequence even than rescue holy picture be that all about we be sundry hundred of thousand of man woman and child who do not need picture but food you have only to look at they in the street to know that they belly feel the grind of hunger famine knock at half the door in that city of brussels and we sit in the glittering cafe of the palace hotel and talk of picture we call on minister brand whitlock whom we have not see -- mccutcheon and i -- since the Sunday afternoon a month and a half before when we two leave he official residence in a hire livery rig for a ride to waterloo which ride extend over a thousand mile one way and another and carry we into three of the war country mention of this call give I opportunity to say in parenthesis so to speak that if ever a man in acutely critical circumstance keep he head and do a big job in a big way and reflect credit at a thousand angle on himself and the country that have the honor to be serve by he that man be brand whitlock to he a citizen of another nation the people of forlorn brussels probably owe more than to any man of they own race grass be sprout from between the cobble of the street in the populous residential district through which we pass on the way from the american ministry to we next stop place view at a short distance each vista of empty street have a wavy green beard on its face and by this one might judge to what a low ebb the commerce and the pleasure of the city have fall since its occupation there be one small square where goat and goose might have be pasture it look as though week might have pass since wagon wheel have roll over those stone and the town folk whose house front on the little square lounge in they doorway with idle hand thrust into they pocket regard we with lackluster indifferent eye it may have be fancy but i think nearly all of they look gripe of frame and that they face seem draw see they so you would have say that with they nothing matter any more we see a good many people though who be take for the moment a acute and uneasy interest in they own affair at the big city prison where we spend half a hour or so here in a high-walled courtyard we find upward of two hundred offender against small civic regulation serve sentence range in length from seven day to thirty perhaps one in three be a german soldier and probably one in ten be a woman or a girl the rest be male citizen of all age size and social grading a few congo negro be mix in most of the time they stay in they cell in solitary confinement but on certain afternoon they might take the air and see visitor in the bleak and barren inclosure where they be now herd together by common rumor in brussels the german be shoot all person catch secretly peddling copy of french or english papers or unauthorized and clandestine belgian papers since only orthodox german papers be permit to be sell the german themselves take no step to deny these story but in the prison we find a large collection of forlorn newsdealer have be capture with the forbid wares in they possession they have mysteriously vanish from the ken of they friend but they have not be put against the wall as they say in europe they have be give fourteen day apiece with a promise of six month if they transgress a second time one little man with the longest and sleekest and silkiest black whisker i have see in many a day recognize we as american and draw near to tell we he trouble in a confidential whisper by he bleached indoor complexion and he manners anyone would have know he for a pastry cook or a hairdresser a hairdresser he be and in a better day than this not far remote have conduct a fashionable establishment on a fashionable boulevard ah i be in one very sad state he say in he twisted english i start for ostend to take winter garment for my two small daughter which be there at school and they arrest I -- these german -- and keep I two day in a cowsh and then bring I back here and put I here in this so-terrible-a-place for two week and all for nothing at all do not you have a pass to go through the line i ask perhaps that be it i have already a pass he say but when they search I they find in my pocket letter which i be take to people in ostend i do not know what be in those letter people ask I to take they to friend of theirs in ostend and i consent not know it be against the rule they read these letter -- the german -- and say i be carry news to they enemy and they become very enrage at I and lock I up never again will i take letter for anybody anywhere oh sir if you could but see the food we eat here for dinner we have a stew -- oh such a stew -- and for breakfast only bread and coffee who be not coffee and with both hand he comb he whisker in a despair that be comic and yet pitiful he be stand there still comb as we come away chapter 16 louvain the forsake it be Sunday when i see louvain in the ash of she desolation we be just back then from the german trench before antwerp and the hollow sound of the big gun which be fire there at space interval come to we ear as we ride over the road lead out from brussels like the booming of great bell the last time i have go that way the country be full of refugee flee from burn village on beyond now it be bare except for a few baggage train lumber along under escort of shaggy gray trooper perhaps i should say they be gray - and-yellow trooper for the plastered mud and powdered dust of three month of active campaigning have make they of true dirt color oh yes i forget one other thing : we overtake a string of wagon fit up as carryall and bear family party of the burgher to louvain to spend a day among the wreckage there be no accounting for taste if i have be a belgian the last thing i should want my wife and my baby to see would be the ancient university town the national cradle of the church in its present state nevertheless there be many excursionist in louvain that day the german have take down the bar and sight-seer come by autobuss from as far away as aix-la-chapelle and from liege and many from brussels they buy postal card and climb about over the mountain range of waste and they mine in the debris mound for souvenir altogether i suppose some of they regard it as a kind of picnic personally i should rather go to a morgue for a picnic than to louvain as it look to-day i try hard both in germany among the german soldier and in belgium among the belgian to get at the truth about louvain the german say the outbreak be plan and that firing break out at a give signal in various quarter of the town that from window and basement and roof bullet rain on they and that the fight continue until they have smoke the last of the inhabitant from they house with fire and put they to death as they flee the belgian proclaim just as stoutly that mistake a on march regiment for enemy the german fire on they own people and then in rage at have commit such a error and to cover it up they turn on the townspeople and mixed massacre with pillaging and burning for the better part of a night and a day i could i think sense something of the viewpoint of each to the belgian a german in he home or in he town be no more than a armed housebreaker what do he care for the code of war he be not responsible for the war he have no share in frame the code he take he gun and when the chance come he fire -- and fire to kill perhaps at first he do not know that by that same act he forfeit he life and sacrifice he home and jeopardize the life and home of all he neighbor perhaps in the blind fury of the moment he do not much care take the german soldier : he have prove he be ready to meet he enemy in the open and to fight he there when he comrade fall at he side strike down by a unseen skulk foe who lurk behind a hedge or a chimney he see red and he do red deed that in he reprisal he go farther than some might have go under similar condition be rather to have be expect in point of organization in discipline and in the enactment of a terribly stern terribly deadly course of conduct for just such emergency he master have go farther than the head of any modern army ever go before you see all the laboriously built-up ethic of civilized peace come into direct conflict with the bloody ethic of war which be never civilized and which frequently be bear in the instant and mold on the instant to suit the purpose of those who create they and louvain be perhaps the most finished and perfect example we have in this world to-day to show the consequence of such a clash i be not go to try to describe louvain other have do that competently the belgian be approximately correct when they say louvain have be destroy the german be technically right when they say not over twenty per cent of its area have be reduce but that twenty per cent include practically the whole business district practically all the better class of home the university the cathedral the main thoroughfare the principal hotel and shop and cafe the famous town hall alone stand unscathed it be save by german soldier from the common fate of all thing about it what remain in historic value and in physical beauty and even in tangible property value be much less than what be go forever i seek out the hotel near the station where we have stay as enforced guest of the german army for three day in August its site be a level gray mass sodden wreck past all redemption ruin beyond all thought of salvage i look for the little inn at which we have dine its front wall litter the street and its interior be a jumble of worthlessness i wonder again as i have wonder many time before what have become of its proprietor -- the dainty gentle little woman whose misshapen figure tell we she be near the time for she baby i endeavor to fix the location of the little sidewalk cafe where we sit on the second or the third day of the german occupation -- August twenty-first i think be the date -- and watch the sun go out in eclipse like a copper disk we do not know it then but it be louvain 's bloody eclipse we see presage that day in the suddenly darken heaven even the line of the sidewalk be lose the road be pile high with broken fire-smudged masonry the building behind be a building no longer it be a husk of a house open to the sky backless and front-less and fit only to tumble down in the next high wind as we stand before the empty railroad station in what i veritably believe to be the forlornest spot there be on this earth a woman in a shawl come whine to sell we postal card on which be view of the desolation that be all about we please buy some picture she say in french my husband be dead when do he die one of we ask she blink as though try to remember that night she say as though there have never be but one night they kill he then -- that night who kill he they do she point in the direction of the square front the station there be german soldier where she point -- both live one and dead one the dead one eighty-odd of they be bury in two big crosswise trench in a circular plot that have once be a bed of ornamental flower surround the monument of some local notable the living one be stand sentry duty at the fence that flank the railroad track beyond they do she say they kill he will you buy some postal card m ` sieur all the best picture of the ruin she say it flatly without color in she voice or feeling or emotion she do not i be sure flinch mentally as she look at the german certainly she do not flinch visibly she be past flinching i suppose the officer in command of the force hold the town come just before we start to warn we to beware of bicyclist who might be encounter near tirlemont they be all franc-tireur -- those belgian on wheel he say some of they be straggling soldier wear uniform under they other clothes they will shoot at you and trust to they bicycle to get away we have catch and kill some of they but there be still a few abroad take no chance with they if i be in you place i should be ready to shoot first we ask he how the survive populace of louvain be behave oh we have they -- like that he say with a laugh and clench he hand up in a knot of knuckle to show what he mean they know better than to shoot at a german soldier now but if look would kill we would all be dead man a hundred time a day and he laugh again of course it be none of we business but it seem to we that if we be choose a man to pacify and control the ruin people of ruin louvain this square-headed big-fisted captain would not have be we first choice it begin to rain hard as we automobile move through the wreckage - strew street which be follow would bring we to the homeward road -- home in this instance mean germany the rain soak into the debris send up a sour nasty smell which pursue we until we have clear the town that exhalation might fully have be the breath of the waste place just as the distant never-ending boom of the gun might have be the lament voice of the war-smitten land itself i remember liege best at this present distance by reason of a small thing that occur as we ride just before dusk through a byway near the river in the gloomy wet Sunday street two band of boy be play at be soldier be soldier be the game all the child in northern europe have play since the first of last August from doorway and window sill they lounge elder watch these liege urchin as they wage they mimic fight with wooden gun and wooden sword but while we look on one boy of a inventive turn of mind be possess of a great idea he proceed to organize a execution against a handy wall with one small person to enact the role of the condemn culprit and half a dozen other to make up the firing squad as the older spectator realize what be afoot a growl of dissent roll up and down the street and a stout red-faced matron shrilly protest run out into the road and cuff the boy until they break and scatter there be one game in liege the boy might not play the last i saw of belgium be when i skirt she northern frontier make for the seacoast the gun be silent now for antwerp have surrender and over all the road lead up into holland refugee be pour in wind stream they be such refugee as i have see a score of time before only now there be infinitely more of they than ever before : man woman and child all afoot all burden with bag and bundle all dress in they best clothes -- they do well to save they best since they could save so little else -- all or nearly all bear they inevitable black umbrella they must have come long distance but i mark that none of they moan or complain or give up in weariness and despair they go on and on with they weary back bent to they burden and they weary leg tremble under they and we do not know where they be go -- and they do not know they just go what they must face before they could not equal what they leave behind they so they go on that poor little rag doll with its head crush in the wheel track do not after all furnish such a good comparison for belgium i think as i finish this tale for it have sawdust inside -- and belgium 's vitals be the vitals of courage and patience end of the project gutenberg ebook of path of glory by irvin s cobb
