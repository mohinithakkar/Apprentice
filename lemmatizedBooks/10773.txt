the four manifest plane vi one place on earth vii the four globe viii the battle ground ix the dual man x the septenary world xi stumble block in eastern physics preface the editor of the theosophical forum in April 1901 note the death of mr thoma e willson in the previous month in a article which we reproduce for the reason that we believe many reader who have be follow the chapter of ancient and modern physics during the last year will like to know something of the author in these paragraph be say all that need be say of one of we most devoted and understanding theosophist in march 1901 the theosophical forum lose one of its most willing and unfailing contributor mr te willson die suddenly and the news of he death reach I when i actually be in the act of prepare the conclude chapter of he ancient and modern physics for the April number like the swan who sing he one song when feel that death be near mr willson give he brother co-worker in the theosophical field all that be best ripest and most suggestive in he thought in the series of article the last of which be to come out in the same number with this the last time i have a long talk with te willson he say for twenty year and more i be without a hearing yet my interest and my faith in what i have to say never flag the eagerness of my love for my subject never diminish this need no comment the quiet and sustained resistance to indifference and lack of appreciation be truly the steady ballast which have prevent we theosophical ship from aimless and fatal wanderings though of inclement weather and adverse wind we have plenty for many long year mr willson be the librarian of the new york world in the afternoon he be too busy to see outsider but begin with five o'clock in the afternoon until he go home somewhere in the neighborhood of midnight he always be glad to see he friend he have a tiny little room of he own very near the top of the tremendous building he one window look far above the roof of the tallest house in the district there he sit at he desk generally in he shirt sleeve if the weather be at all warm always busy with some matter already print or go to be a quiet yet impressive and dignified figure the elevated isolation both figuratively and literally speak in which te willson live and work in the midst of the most crowded thoroughfare of new york always make I think of professor teufelsdrockh on the attic floor of the highest house in the wahngasse the two have more than one point of resemblance they share the loftiness of they point of view they sympathetic understanding of other folk they loneliness and above all they patient even humorous resignation to the fact of this loneliness yet in he appearance mr willson be not like the great weissnichtwo philosopher in fact in the cast of he feature and in he way mr willson never look to I like a white man in british indium i have know brahman of the better type exactly with the same sallow complexion same quick and observant brown eye same portly figure and same wide-awakeness and agility of manner last summer i hear on good authority that mr willson have think himself into a most suggestive way of deal with the problem of matter and spirit a way which besides be suggestive bear a great resemblance to some theory of the same nature current in ancient indium consequently mr willson be offer for the first time in he life a chance of express he view on matter and spirit in as many article and in as extensive a shape as he choose the way he receive this tardy recognition of the fact that he have something to say be highly instructive he do not put on air of unrecognized greatness though i own the occasion be propitious he do not say i tell you so he simply and frankly be glad in the most childlike way and now that i have use the word it occur to I that childlike be a adjective the best apply to this man in spite of he portliness and he three score and more winter many a pleasant hour i have spend in the small bookroom of the great world building with mr willson talk never flag we discuss the past and the future of we planetary chain we build plan for the true and wholesome relation of sex we try to find out -- and needless to say never do -- the exact limit where matter stop be matter and become spirit we also read the latest comic poem and also from time to time we take a header into the stormy sea of american literature in order to find out what various wise head have to say consciously or unconsciously in favor of we beloved theosophical view and all this be interrupted every three minute or so by some weary apparition from some workroom in the world with some such question : mr willson how be i to find out the present whereabouts of this or that russian man-of-war mr willson what be the melting point of iron mr willson when be ` hm pinafore ' produce for the first time etc etc and every time mr willson get up in the leisurely manner peculiar to he reach for some book from the shelf that line the room give the desire information and as leisurely return to the pranic atom or to come and talk man talk willy or to whatever we subject chance to be at the time mr willson 's gratitude to the theosophical forum for its recognition be disproportionately great as he write to the editor : give I any kind of work write for you review manuscript or proof reading i shall do anything i shall undertake any job even to take editorial scolding in all good nature only give I work he devotion to theosophical thought and work in all they ramification be just as great as be he freedom from vanity he perfectly natural and unaffected modesty at the news of he death many a heart be sincerely sad but none so sad as the heart of the editor of the theosophical forum for a friend and co-worker like te willson ever ready to give material help and moral encouragement be not easily replace for a soul so pure of any kind of selfishness the transition from the turmoil of life to the bright dream of death must have be both easy and enviable -------------- chapter one the physical basis if metaphysics the hindu system of physics on which the metaphysical thought of the east be base do not in its beginning differ widely from the latest physics of the west but it go so much farther that we physics be soon lose sight of and forget the hindu conception of the material universe take from the upanishad and some open teaching will serve for a illustration they divide physical matter into four kind -- prakritus ether prana and manasa -- which they call plane these differ only in the rate of vibration each plane vibrate through one great octave with gulf of lose octave between the highest rate of vibration of prakritus be measure by the thousand the lowest of the ether by trillion and the lowest of prana by -- never mind they have and we have not the nomenclature the earth they teach be a globe of prakritus float in a ocean of ether which as it have the sun for its center of gravity must necessarily be a globe this etheric sun-globe have a diameter of over 300000000000 mile all the planet revolve around the sun far within its atmosphere the etheric sun-globe revolve on its axis once in about 21000 year and this revolution cause the precession of the equinox this etheric sun-globe be revolve around alcyone with other etheric globe have sun for they center and solar system of prakritic globe within they in a great year of 5640000000 of we common year its orbit have a diameter of 93000000000000000 mile beyond the etheric globe and between they be a third form of matter call prana as much rarer and finer than the ether as the ether be rarer and finer than prakritus as this prana have alcyone for a center of gravity it be necessarily a globe and there be many of these pranic globe float in a vast ocean of manasa -- a form of matter as much finer than prana as prana be finer than ether or ether than prakritus with this manasa -lrb- which be a globe -rrb- the material or physical universe end but there be spiritual globe beyond the material universe be create from manasa downward but it do not respond to or chord with the vibration of the globe above except in a special instance and in a special way which do not touch this inquiry the physical universe of the ancient -lrb- and modern -rrb- hindu physicist be make up of these four kind or plane of matter distribute in space as globe within globe professor lodge in 1884 put forth the theory that prakritus -lrb- physical matter -rrb- as we call it be in its atom but whirl of ether since then speculative science have generally accept the idea that the physical atom be make up of many cubic foot of ether in chemical union as many quart of oxygen and hydrogen unite chemically to make a drop of water this be a old story to the hindu sage he tell he pupil that the great globe of manasa once fill all space and there be nothing else precisely as on this earth we have we elementary substance that change from liquid into solid and gas so on this manasic globe there be elementary substance that take the form of liquid solid and gas its manasic matter be differentiate and vibrate through one octave as the prakritic matter do on the earth its substance combine as that do one combination produce prana the prana collect and form globe on these pranic globe the process be repeat with ether as the result and the etheric globe form then the process be repeat on the etheric globe as the modern scientist have discover and prakritus and prakritic globe come into be the true diameter of the earth the ancient hindu book say be about 50000 mile that be to say the true surface of the earth be the line of twenty-four-hour axial rotation the line where gravity and apergy exactly balance where a moon would have to be place to revolve once in 86400 seconds within that be prakritus without be ether it be also the line of no friction which do exist between matter of different plane there be friction between prakritus between ether between prana but not between ether and prana or ether and prakritus friction be a phenomenon confine to the matter of each plane separately we live at the bottom of this gaseous ocean -- on its floor -- 21000 mile from the surface and only 4000 mile from the center here in a narrow skin limit to a few mile above and below we be the realm of phenomenon where solid turn into liquid and liquid into gas or vice versa the lesson impressed upon the pupil 's mind by hindu physics be that he live far within the earth not on it there be a comparatively narrow skin of and for phenomenon within the etheric sun-globe say the eastern teacher where the etheric solid liquid and gas meet and mingle and interchange within this skin be all the planet -- the gaseous atmosphere of the etheric globe stretch million of mile beyond the outermost planetary orbit the earth be in this skin or belt of etheric phenomenon and its ether be in touch with the ether in manifestation on the etheric globe the sun and other etheric globe be within the corresponding skin of phenomenon of the pranic globe the prana manifest as solid liquid and gas or in combination and in form be in perfect touch with that of the etheric globe and through that with the prana of the earth that we prana be in touch with that on the pranic globe in all its manifestation mean much in metaphysics the same be true of the manasic globe and of we manasa the great lesson the eastern physics burn into the pupil be that we be live not only within the prakritic earth but within each of the other globe as well in identically the same way and subject to the same law we life be not pass on one globe but in four globe it be as if one say he live in buffalo erie county new york unite state that he be a citizen of each and subject to the law of each this question of the four globe of the four plane of matter of the four skin and of the four condition or state of all matter and necessarily of all person from the purely material standpoint be not only the foundation of oriental physics but the very essence of oriental metaphysics -- its starting-point and corner-stone to one who carry with he consciously or unconsciously the concrete knowledge of the physics the abstract teaching of the metaphysics present no difficulty it be as clear as crystal but without the physical teaching the metaphysical be not translatable we western physics teach that physical matter be divide into two kind prakritus -lrb- commonly call physical matter -rrb- and ether that the difference of each of the elementary prakritic substance -lrb- iron copper sulphur oxygen -rrb- be in they molecule the fundamental atom be the same that each of these elementary substance vibrate only through one octave though on different key that it change from solid to liquid and gas as the rate of vibration be increase and from gas to liquid and solid as its vibration be decrease within its octave that the ether obey identical law that it have elementary substance vibrate through one octave only and that these be solid liquid or gas on the etheric plane as prakritus be on this that these etheric substance change and combine in every way that prakritus do and that while all we prakritic substance vibrate within -lrb- say -rrb- fifty simply octave the lowest vibration of etheric matter begin over one thousand octave beyond we highest make a gulf to leap the eastern physics present this with a wealth of detail that daze the western student and then add : but beyond the etheric plane -lrb- or octave -rrb- of vibration for matter there be a third plane -lrb- or octave -rrb- of vibration call prana and beyond that a fourth call manasa what be true of one plane be true of the other three one law govern the four as above so below there be no real gulf there be perfect continuity the western scientist teach as the foundation of modern physics that each and every atom of prakritic matter be the center of a etheric molecule of many atom that no two prakritic atom touch although they etheric envelope or atmosphere do touch and that all physical phenomenon be cause by the chording vibration of the prakritic atom and its envelope of ether each sound the same note hundred of octave apart the solid earth with its atmosphere represent the atom with its ether as all the oxygen and hydrogen do not combine to make the drop of water some remain in mechanical union to give it a atmosphere and about one-fourth of its bulk be gas so the atom form of the ether do not use all the ether in its chemical union retain some in mechanical union for its envelope or atmosphere the hindu physics go much farther along this road it say that when the pranic globe be form each atom of prana have its manasic envelope -- be the center of a manasic molecule when the etheric globe form each atom of ether be the center of a pranic molecule each atom of which be surround with manasa when the prakritus be form from the ether each and every atom of prakritus have the triple etheric-pranic-manasic envelope each and every prakritic atom be the center of a etheric molecule say we western science but that of the east add this : and each atom of that etheric molecule be the center of a pranic molecule and each atom of prana in that pranic molecule be the center of a manasic molecule the four great globe of matter in the material universe be represent and reproduce in each and every atom of prakritus which be in touch with each one of the four globe and a part of it the same be true of any aggregation of prakritus -- of the earth itself and of all thing in it include man as there be four atom in each one so there be four earth four globe consubstantial one for each of the four element and in touch with it one be form of prakritic atom -- the globe we know another of the ether form they envelope another of the prana envelope of ether and a fourth of the manasa around the pranic atom they be not skin they be consubstantial and what be true of atom or globe be true of animal each have four material body with each body on the corresponding globe -- whether of the earth or of the universe this be the physical basis of the famous chain of seven globe that be such a stumbling-block in hindu metaphysics the spirit pass through four to get in and three to get out -- seven in all the hindu understand without explanation he understand he physics the hindu physics teach with ours that the ether be the source of all energy but it add as prana be the source of all life and manasa of all mind when the prakritic atom be vibrate in chord with its etheric envelope say we textbook we have physical phenomenon -- light heat electricity yes say the hindu teacher but when the atom and its ether and its prana be vibrate in chord we have life and vital phenomenon add to the energy when the atom and its ether prana and manasa be vibrate in chord we have mind and mental phenomenon add to the life and energy each atom have energy life and mind in posse in the live leaf the prakritus ether and prana be sound the threefold silver chord of life in the animal the manasa be sound the same note with they make the fourfold golden chord of mind even in the plant there may be a faint manasic overtone for the potentiality of life and mind be in everything this unity of the physical universe with the physical atom and with all thing create -- earth animal or crystal -- be the physical backbone of oriental metaphysics prakritus ether prana and manasa be in we vernacular the earth air fire and water of the old philosopher -- the four element the oriental physics have be guard most jealously for many thousand of year it have be the real occult and esoteric teaching while the oriental metaphysics have be open and exoteric it could not be understand without the key and the key be in the physics know only to the try and approve disciple a little have leak out -- enough to whet the appetite of the true student and make he ask for more chapter two the two kind of perception to the savage matter appear in two form -- solid and liquid as he advance a step he learn it have three form -- solid liquid and gas he can not see the gas but he know it be there a little further on he learn that matter as he know it be only a minute portion of the great universe of matter -- the few chord that can be strike on the five string of he sens and limit to one octave or key whether the particular matter he investigate have a solid a liquid or a gaseous form depend upon its rate of vibration if it be a liquid by raise its rate of vibration one third it become a gas by reduce it one third it become a solid each kind of matter have vibration only through one octave it be know to we only by its vibration in that octave each kind of matter have a different octave -- be set on a higher or lower key so to speak but all octave of vibration be between the highest of hydrogen gas and the lowest of carbon in mechanical compound such as air or brass the rate of vibration of the compound be the least common multiple of the two or more rate in chemical compound such as water or alcohol the rate be that of the highest the other unite in harmonic fraction all matter as we know it through we sens -- prakritus as it be call in the secret doctrine to distinguish it from non-sensual matter -- be the vibration of a universal something we do not know what through these different octave the elementary substance -lrb- so-called -rrb- be one and the same thing -- this something -- in different key and chord of vibration key that run into one another produce all sort of beautiful harmony take any one of these element or any of they compound all we know of it be limited strictly to its change during vibration through one octave what happen when the vibration go above or below the octave have not yet be treat hypothetically while some element be vibrate on higher and some on lower key we can consider they all as vibrate within one great octave that octave of the universal something which produce sensual matter or prakritus but matter be not confine we know to this great octave although we sensual knowledge of it be strictly confine to it how do we know it knowledge come to we in two way and there be two kind of knowledge 1 that which come through we sens by observation and experience this include reasoning from relation 2 that which come through intuition -- or as some writer inaccurately say through the formal law of think all the observation and experience of the rise and the setting of the sun for a thousand century could only have confirm the first natural belief that it revolve daily around the earth nor by join this experience with other experience could any deduction have come from we reason that would have oppose it not we reason but we intuition say that the sun stand still and the earth revolve daily the oldest book in existence tell we that this axial revolution of the earth be not only know in the very dawn of time but that it have be know to every race -lrb- except we own of european savage -rrb- from before the time thought be first transmit by write ask the ablest living geographer or physicist to prove to you that the earth revolve daily and he will reply that it would be the job of he life it can be do at great expense and great labor but that be because we know the answer and can invent a way of show it not because there be any observation from which a deduction would naturally follow nearly if not all we great discovery have come to we through intuition and not from observation and experience when we know the line on which to work when intuition have give we the key then the observation and experience man prize so highly and the reason they worship so devoutly will fill in the detail the knowledge that flow from observation and the reasoning from the fact it record be never more than relatively true it be always limit by the fact and any addition to the fact require the whole thing to be restate we never know all the fact seldom even the more important and reason grasp only detail lamarck 's theory of evolution know to all asiatic race from time immemorial be the intuitional and absolute knowledge that come to all man when they reach a certain stage of development reason could never have furnish it from the fact as cuvier prove in the great debate in the french academy in 1842 when he knock lamarck out for the time be because it do not conform to the fact and do not follow from any relation of the fact darwin 's theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence as a explanation of the origin of species be from observation and experience it be base on observe fact but darwin be a evolutionist -- a disciple of lamarck he hold the key he use the key the value of darwin 's work do not lie in he discover that some bug have be derive from other bug and that the intermediate bug have die off its overwhelming value to mankind be in show that work on the theory of evolution be correct work and that the theory be true when the intuition of man point out the way the reason of man can follow the path and macadam the road it usually do and claim all the credit for itself as the original discoverer this knowledge through intuition be absolute and exact it be not relatively true it be absolutely and invariably true no additional fact will ever modify it or require a restatement when sir william hamilton base he logic on the dictum that all knowledge be relative and only relatively true the proposition be self-evidently false it be in itself a statement of absolute knowledge about a certain thing it be in itself knowledge that be not relative all knowledge could not be relative if this knowledge be not this knowledge could not be either absolute or relative without upset he whole proposition for if relative then it be not always true and if absolute then it be never true sir william do not know the distinction between the two kind of knowledge and what he mean to say be that all knowledge obtain by observation and experience be relative and only relatively true he knowledge of this relativity be not obtain by observation or from reason it could not possibly have be obtain in that way it come from intuition and it be absolute and exact a man may have absolute and exact knowledge and yet not be able to put it into word that exactly express it to another hamilton have this knowledge but it be not clearly formulate even in he own mind he have two separate and distinct meaning for the word knowledge without be conscious of it we have yet to coin a proper word to express what come to we through intuition the old english word wisdom originally do the old verb wi be mean what a man know without be tell it as ken mean knowledge by experience try and prove by reason that a straight line be the shortest distance between two point or that a part can never be greater than the whole and you reason have a impossible task you must take they for axiom it say you must take they because you wi they not because you know -lrb- ken -rrb- they intuitional knowledge must not be confound with the relative knowledge that flow through the reason : that if the sum of two number be one and they difference be five the number be minus two and plus three the point can not be too strongly enforce that there be a distinction between the source of what we know and that while all we know through we sensation be only relatively true that which we know from intuition be invariably and absolutely true this be see through a glass darkly in theology where intuition be call inspiration and not differentiate from reason the false notion that we can only learn by observation and experience that the concept can never transcend the observation that we can only know what we can prove to we sens have work incalculable injury to progress in philosophy because we sensual knowledge of matter begin and end with vibration in one octave it do not follow that this end we knowledge of it we may have intuitional knowledge and this intuitional knowledge be as susceptible to reason as if we have obtain it by observation the knowledge that come through intuition tell we of matter vibrate in another great octave just beyond we own which science have choose to name the etheric octave or plane the instant we intuition reveal the cause of phenomenon we reason drop in and tell we it be the chording vibration of the matter of the two plane -- the physical and etheric -- that produce all physical phenomenon it go further and explain its variation this knowledge of another octave or plane of matter come from the logical relation of matter and its physical phenomenon but there be nothing in the observation or experience of mankind that would have lead we to infer from reason a etheric plane of matter it be reveal truth but the flash of revelation have once make the path apparent the light of reason carry we through all the wind way we knowledge of the ether be not guess-work or fancy any more than we geometry be because it be base on axiom we reason can not prove in both case the basic axiom be obtain from intuition the structural work from reason we knowledge of the ether may be as absolute and exact as we knowledge of prakritus work on physical as we work on geometrical axiom the recognition of the two source of knowledge the work of the spirit within we and of the mind within we be absolutely necessary to correctly comprehend the true significance of the result of modern science and to accept the ancient chapter three matter and ether it be not worthwhile translate homer into english unless the reader of the translation understand english it be not worthwhile attempt to translate the occult eastern physics into the language of we western and modern physics unless those who be to read the translation understand generally and broadly what we own modern physics teach it be not necessary that they should know all branch of we modern physics in all they minute ramification but it be necessary that they should understand clearly the fundamental principle upon which we scientific and technical knowledge of today rest these fundamental principle have be discover and apply in the past fifty year -- in the memory of the living they have revolutionize science in all its department we textbook on chemistry light heat electricity and sound have have to be entirely re-written and in many other department notably in medicine and psychology they have yet to be re-written we textbook be in a transition state each new one go a step farther to make the change gradual from the old form of belief to the new so that even tyndall 's textbook on sound be now so antedated or antiquated that it might have be write in darkest africa before the pyramid be build instead of twenty year ago all this change have flow from the discovery of faraday that there be two state or condition of matter in one it be reveal by one of we five sens visible tangible smellable tastable or ponderable matter this be matter as we know it it may be a lump of metal or a flask of gas the second condition or state of matter be not reveal by either of we five sens but by the sixth sense or intuition of man this be the ether -- suppose to be matter in a very rarefy form which permeate all space so rare and fine be this matter that it interpenetrate carbon or steel as water interpenetrate a sponge or ink a blotting pad in fact each atom of physical matter -- by which be mean matter in the first condition -- float in a atmosphere of ether as the solid earth float in its atmosphere of air no two physical atom touch say faraday each physical atom be the center of a etheric molecule and as far apart from every other atom as the star in heaven from one another this be true of every form of physical matter whether it be a lump of metal a cup of liquid or a flask of gas whether it be a bronze statue or a living man a leaf a cloud or the earth itself each and every physical atom be the center of a etheric molecule make up of many atom of the ether this duality of matter be a wonderful discovery revolutionize every department of science it place man in actual touch with the whole visible universe the ether in a man 's eye -lrb- and in he whole body -rrb- reach in one unbroken line -- like a telegraph wire -- from he to the sun or the outermost planet he be not separate and apart from space but a part of it each physical atom of he physical body be the center of a etheric molecule and he have two body as st paul say a visible physical and a invisible etheric body the latter in actual touch with the whole universe faraday go one step further he demonstrate that all physical phenomenon come from the chording vibration of the physical atom with the surround etheric atom and that the latter exercise the impel force on the former step into the sunshine the line of ether from the sun be vibrate faster than the ether in the body but the higher impel the lower the greater control the lesser and soon both ether be in unison the physical atom must coincide in vibration with they etheric envelope and the note be heat step into the shade where the ocean of ether be vibrate more slowly and the ether of the body reduce its vibration the ether be the origin of all force and of all phenomenon this etheric matter follow identical law with prakritic matter or accurately the law of we matter flow from the etheric matter from which it be make the ether have two hundred or more elementary substance each atom of we eighty or ninety element be the chemical union of great mass of two or more of the etheric element or they combination these etheric elementary substance combine and unite we elementary substance simply follow in they combination the law which they inherit from they parent they take form and shape they vibrate through one octave and take solid liquid or gaseous form in ether as they type here in we world take it in prakritus as they vibration be increase or diminish in short the ether be the prototype of we physical or prakritic world out of which it be make and a product of which it be as this ether be physical matter the same as prakritus one harmonic law cover both and as this ether fill all space modern science divide physical matter into two kind which for convenience in differentiation be here call prakritic and etheric matter be something -- science do not know or care to know what -- in vibration a very low octave of vibration produce prakritus a very high octave of vibration produce ether the vibration of prakritus end in thousand that of ether begin in billion between they there be a gulf of vibration that have not yet be bridge for that reason science divide matter into two plane or octave of vibration -- the matter of this visible and tangible plane be call prakritus and that of the invisible and intangible plane be call etheric across this gulf the two plane respond to each other note for note the note in trillion chord when the note in thousand be strike note for note chord for chord they answer one another and the minutest and the most complex phenomenon be alike the result of this harmonic vibration that of the ether supply force and that of the prakritus a medium in which it can manifest this knowledge of ether be not guesswork or fancy and while it be as impossible of proof as the axiom of geometry it be worthy the same credence and honor we be work on physical axiom exactly as we work on geometrical axiom modern science represent each and every prakritic atom as a globe like the earth float in space and surround by a atmosphere of ether the subdivision of prakritic matter until we reach etheric atom chemically unite to make the physical unit be the correct definition of a atom the prakritic physical atom have length breadth and thickness and it have a atmosphere of ether which not only interpenetrate the atom as oxygen and hydrogen interpenetrate the drop of water but furnish it with a envelope as the oxygen and hydrogen furnish the drop of water with one each physical atom be the center of a etheric molecule compose of many etheric atom vibrate at a greater or lesser speed and interpenetrate the atom each may be consider a miniature earth with its aerial envelope the air penetrate all part of it the etheric plane of matter not only unite with this prakritic plane through the atom but it interpenetrate all combination of it beside the atom as well as through the atom the grain of sand compose of many prakritic atom be also compose of many time that number of etheric atom the grain of sand be etheric matter as well as prakritic matter it exist on the etheric plane exactly the same as it exist on the prakritic and it have etheric form as well as prakritic form as each atom of this physical world of ours -- whether of land or water or air whether of solid liquid or gas -- be the center of a etheric molecule we have two world not one : a physical world and a etheric one a visible world and a invisible world a tangible world and a intangible world a world of effect and a world of cause and each animal include man be make in the same way he have a prakritic body and a etheric body a visible body and a invisible body a earthly body and one not make with hand in common touch with the whole universe chapter four what a teacher should teach let we suppose that a certain wise teacher of physics place a row of bunsen burner under a long steel bar have a daniell 's pyrometer at one end and address he class -lrb- substantially -rrb- as follow : at we last lecture we find that the matter of the universe permeate all space but in two condition which we agree to call physical and etheric or tangible and intangible it be all the same matter subject to the same law but differ in the rate of vibration the physical matter vibrate through one great octave or plane and the etheric vibrate through another great octave or plane one degree higher -- the chording vibration of the matter of the two plane in one note produce what we call energy or force and with it phenomenon this be a bar of steel 36 inch long it be compose of physical atom but no two physical atom touch each physical atom be as far apart from every other atom as the star in heaven from one another -- in proportion to they size the atom and the space between they be so small to we sight that they seem to touch if we have a microscope of sufficient power to reveal the atom you would see that no two atom touch and that the space between they be as faraday say very great in proportion to they size i show you last term that what appear to be a solid stream of water when magnify and throw upon a screen be merely a succession of independent drop that do not touch i can not yet give you proof of the bar of iron be compose of independent atom but that be the fault of we instrument and you must take my word for it until the proof be simplify and make easy of application each one of these physical atom be a miniature world it be the center of a ocean of ether compose of many atom and while no two physical atom touch they etheric atmosphere do touch and any change in the vibration of the etheric atmosphere of one will be impart to that of the next as the vibration of the physical atom must be in harmony with that of its etheric atmosphere any change come to one will be impart to the next and the next through the ether surround they you can see that the index at the end of the bar have move show that it be now longer that mean the etheric atom be now vibrate faster take more space and have necessarily force each physical atom farther apart the bar be not only longer but softer and as the vibration increase in rapidity the time will come when it will bend by its own weight and even when it will become a liquid and a gas if you put you hand anywhere near the bar you will feel a sensation call heat and say it have become hot the reason for that be that you be in actual and literal touch with the bar or iron through the ether it be not alone each atom of the bar of iron that be surround by the ether but each atom of the air and each atom of you body they etheric atmosphere be all touching and the increase in the vibration of the ether surround the atom of iron be impart to those of the air surround it and these in turn raise the rate of vibration in the etheric atom surround the physical atom of you hand this rate of vibration in you nerve cause a sensation or mental impression you call heat consciousness of it come through you sense of touch but after all it be merely a rate of vibration which you brain recognize and name the bar have now reach a temperature of about 700 degree and have become a dull red why do you say the color have change and why do you say red because the rate of vibration of the etheric atom in the bar be now about 412 trillion per second and this rate of vibration have be impart to the ether of the air have in turn be impart to the ether of you eye and this rate of vibration in the ether of the nerve of you eye you brain recognize and call ` red ' the heat still continue and increase you now have both heat and light so you see that the ether be not vibrate in a single note but in two chording note produce light and heat there be two kind of ether around the iron atom there be sound also but the note be too high for one 's ear it be a chord of three note professor silliman of yale discover over twenty year ago that the ether could be differentiate into the luminiferous or light ether and the sonoriferous or sound ether other great scientist since then have find a third ether -- the heat ether they discovery show that the atmospheric etheric envelope of each etheric atom be make up of etheric atom of different vibratory power as the atmosphere of the earth be make up of atom of oxygen and nitrogen and argon so that of a atom be make up of three kind of ether correspond to three of we sens that it consist of five ether correspond to we five sens as the ancient hindu assert -- who can say i mention this subject of the differentiation of the ether merely that you may not suppose that the ether be a simple substance for the present we will treat it as a simple substance but next year we will take it up as a compound one this steel bar before you be not one bar but two bar there be a visible bar and a invisible bar the visible bar be make of physical atom and the invisible bar of etheric atom the etheric bar be invisible but it be make of matter the same as the visible bar and it be just as real just as truly a bar as the one we see more than this the etheric invisible bar be the source and cause of all phenomenon connect with the bar it be the real bar and the one we see be merely the shadow in physical matter of a real bar in shape strength color in short in everything it depend on the invisible one the invisible dominate govern dispose the visible be merely its attendant shadow change as the invisible etheric bar change and record for we sens these invisible change the invisible change always come first the invisible phenomenon invariably precede the visible in all this physical world -- in all this universe -- there be nothing not even a grain of sand or a atom of hydrogen that be not as this bar of iron be -- the shadow cast on a visible world by the unknown and mysterious work of a invisible world land or water mountain or lake man or beast bird or reptile cold or heat light or darkness all be the reflection in physical matter of the true and real thing in the invisible and intangible world about we if we have a visible body we have a invisible one also say saint paul modern science have prove he be right and that it be the invisible body which be the real body if this earth and all that it be compose of -- land or ocean or air man or beast pyramid or pavement -- could be resolve into the physical atom compose everything in it or on it create by god or man each atom of this dust would be identical physically there would not be one kind of atom for iron and another for oxygen the differentiation between what be call elementary substance be first make apparent in the molecule or first combination of the atom it be not in the atom itself unless it be in the size as may not be improbable the atom combine in different number to make differently shaped molecule and it be from this difference in the shape of the molecule that we get the difference between gold and silver copper and tin or oxygen and hydrogen in all chemical compound such as water and alcohol the molecule at the base of the two or more substance break up into they original atom and form a new molecule compose of all the atom in the two or more thing combine to make this chemical combination we must change the rate of vibration of one or the other or both until they strike a common chord as we see last term oxygen and hydrogen have different specific heat and no two other element have the same specific heat while heat raise the rate of vibration any give amount of heat raise the vibration of one more than another apply heat and the rate of one will rise faster than that of the other until they reach a common chord then they fall apart and recombine if we pass a current of electricity through this seal jar contain oxygen and hydrogen in mechanical union the spark that leap across the point furnish the heat and a drop of water appear and fall to the bottom a large portion of the gas have disappear it have be convert into water what be leave of the gas will expand and fill the bottle the drop of water but for local cause but for a certain attraction of the earth would float in the center of the jar at the center of gravity as the earth do in space but the center of gravity of the two body be far within the earth and the drop get as close to it as it can the earth 's ` pull ' take it to the bottom if the jar be far enough away in space the drop would float as the earth float at a point where all pull balance and the drop of water would have enough pull of its own enough gravity within itself to hold all the gas leave in the jar to itself as a atmosphere it would be a center of energy a minature world the drop of water be not a homogenous mass about one third of the bulk of the drop of water be make up of independent oxygen and hydrogen atom intersperse through it as any liquid be through this piece of blot paper and it have and keep by its own attraction a atmosphere of the gas each molecule of water have a thin layer or skin of the gas even as it come from this faucet let we return again to the physical dust the atom why should it form by fives for iron by nines for hydrogen where do the atom come from what be it we know that like the drop of water it be a miniature world with a atmosphere of ether and the natural inference be that it be make from ether as the drop of water be make from gas many thing confirm this inference and it may be accept as ' a work hypothesis ' that it be make from ether as the drop of water be make from gas by the chemical union of a large amount of ether of different kind the etheric molecule of which consist of 2 and 3 or 5 and 4 etheric atom and that the tendency to combine in this or that number in physical matter be a inherit tendency bring with it from the etheric world of matter on which or in which each element of this world be two or more there be no kind of matter in this physical world that have not its prototype in the etheric and the law of its action and reaction here be law which it inherit and bring with it they be not law make here they be law of the other world -- even as the matter itself be matter of the other world in 1882 professor lodge in a lecture before the royal institution on ` the luminiferous ether ' define it as : ` one continuous substance fill all space which can vibrate as light which can be shear into positive and negative electricity which in whirl constitute matter and which transmit by continuity and not impact every action and reaction of which matter be capable ' this read today like baby-talk but at that time -lrb- eighteen year ago -rrb- it be consider by many timid conservative scientist as ' a daring movement ' it be noteworthy in that it be the first public scientific announcement that the physical matter be a manifestation or form of the ether and it be make before general acceptance of the division of the ether into soniferous luminiferous and tangiferous ` which in whirl constitute matter ' professor lodge believe that ` some etheric molecule revolve so rapidly on they axis that they could not be penetrate ' watch the soap-bubble that i be blow each and every one be revolve as the earth revolve from west to east what i wish to call you attention to be the fact that can be prove both mathematically and theoretically that at a certain rate of speed in the revolution they could not be penetrate by any rifle-ball at a higher rate of speed they would be harder than globe of solid chill steel harder even than carbon professor lodge believe that the etheric molecule revolve so rapidly that thin as it be in its shell it give we the dust out of which world be make there be one fatal error in this idea although it be hold even now by many it be base entirely on gravity and gravity be alone consider in its problem there be two great force in the universe not one as many scientific people fail to remember -- gravity and apergy or the centrifugal and centripetal force the pull in be and must be always balance by the pull out there be in the universe as much repulsion as attraction and the former be a force quite as important as the latter the bubble 's speed keep increase until apergy the tendency to fly off overcome gravity and it rupture professor lodge fail to take into account this apergic force this tendency to fly off when he give such high revolutionary speed to the etheric molecule a speed in which apergy would necessarily exceed gravity the failure to take apergy into consideration have be the undoing of many physicist today we know that the ether be matter the same as we own only finer and rarer and in much more rapid vibration we know that this ether have its solid liquid and gas form from molecule of its atom even as we own be form we know that its atom combine as ours do and while we have but eighty elementary combination it must have more than double the number we know that every form and shape and combination of these element from this plane flow from inherit tendency have they root in the etheric world the two world be one world -- as much at one with ours as the world of gas about we be at one with we liquid and solid it be ` continuity not impact ' they not only touch everywhere and in everything but they be one and the same in action and reaction thus speak a certain wise teacher of physics to he wise utterance we can only add that such as we be today we see through a glass darkly yet there will come a day when the physical bandage will be remove from we eye and we shall see face to face the beauty and grandeur and glory of this invisible world and that in truth it ` transmit by continuity and not impact every action and reaction of which matter be capable ' form one continuous chain of cause and effect without a link miss there be no gulf to cross no bridge to be make it be here not there it be at one with we and we be at one with it one and the same law control and guide the etheric atom and the physical atom make from its molecule whether the latter be make in whirl as at first suppose or by orderly combination as now believe in fact this visible world of ours be the perfect product of the other invisible one have in it its root and foundation the very sap of its life chapter five the four manifest plane the oriental idea of the universe do not differ fundamentally in its general conception from that of modern science but it go farther and explain more the physics of the secret doctrine be base upon a material universe of four plane of vibration and a spiritual universe of three plane of vibration beyond matter this something in vibration may be give the english name consciousness -- without enter upon its nature spirit be consciousness in vibration and undifferentiated matter be consciousness in vibration and differentiate as we divide the seven octave of a piano into treble and bass for clearness of thought and write so the hidden knowledge divide the seven octave of vibration or plane into spirit and matter in they ultimate analysis they be one and the same thing as ice and water be the same thing but for study they must be differentiate the material and physical universe consist of four plane of matter or four great octave of vibration each differentiate from the other as in we physics prakritus be differentiate from ether the material universe the ancient physics teach be originally pure thought manasa the product of the spiritual plane above this manasic world be differentiate a real world that be to say it be give elementary substance by the union of its atom in different size molecule some of its element combine and form prana the prana gather and form other world pranic world then in the pranic world etheric world be form and finally in the etheric world prakritic globe like the earth be form the earth be the center of a prakritic globe revolve in ether around the sun the sun be the center of a solar globe of ether revolve in prana around alcyone alcyone be the center of a stellar globe of prana revolve in manasa around the central and hidden sun of the great manasic globe these four condition of matter prakritus ether prana and manasa be the earth water fire air of the ancient metaphysics the four element of matter and be present in every atom of prakritus when the atom of prana be form it have a envelope of manasa when the atom of ether be form it have a envelope of pranic-manasic atom when the prakritic atom be form it have a envelope of etheric-pranic - manasic atom each of its encircle etheric atom be the center of a pranic molecule and each pranic atom of that molecule be the center of a manasic molecule each atom of prakritus be the material universe in miniature it hold the potentiality of mind life and phenomenon in every aggregation of atom there be the four plane each in touch through the cosmic mind its manasa with other atom in the universe with every other globe of whatever kind as above so below be the secret key-word the unity of all the material universe in its prakritus ether prana and manasa be the corner stone of this knowledge the three plane above prakritus be call astral and in common speech there be the ordinary division into two plane visible and invisible or spirit as the invisible be call and matter as the visible be call only in the hidden secret doctrine of physics and in the open metaphysics which be a stumbling block and foolishness to those who have not the inner light of the physics be the three division of the astral make known and the true distinction between the spirit of the three higher plane and the matter of the four lower be keep out of the metaphysics or only vaguely allude to there be no oriental science because the oriental do not attach the same value to merely physical knowledge that we do but that must not be understand to imply that there be no oriental physics in all the matter that interest we now as far as principle be concern the oriental know all that we know he know it thousand of year ago when we ancestor be sleep with the cave bear that be all the good it do he the scientist say no that be not true it be perfectly true that the oriental the babylonian who carve on the black stone now in the british museum the five moon of jupiter expose himself to the derision of we astronomer prior to they own discovery of the fifth moon in 1898 do not care particularly whether there be four moon or five and have no sale for any telescope he might make for no one else care particularly but it be not true that he do not care for any and all knowledge that would improve he spiritual condition by give he correct idea of the universe and of he own part in it to he life be more than meat and the body more than raiment he be more afraid of sin than of ignorance we be more afraid of ignorance than of sin he prefer to better man 's moral condition we prefer to better they physical condition if one of the sage of the east could be call up and put on the stand to be question he would say substantially : you be right in regard to you ether and to prakritus be ether that have be drop a great octave in vibration you physical atom be surround by a molecule of ether this molecule contain many atom of ether the chording vibration do produce all physical phenomenon but where do the ether atom come from how can you explain how and whence life come or what it be this explain physical but how do you explain vital phenomenon you be wrong in assume that all the matter of the universe apart from the earth or planet be ether and only ether the etheric world in which you be interested end with you solar system it end with each solar system to the people of that system between each solar system and another there be another form of matter that be not ether this etheric solar world of ours be very large many billion of mile in diameter but it be not the whole universe you know that the sun and all its planet be revolve around the star alcyone you astronomer tell you that year ago and they have recently give you the rate of speed as 4838 mile per hour do you not see and know that if they have this revolution around a central sun it must be within a solar globe do you think that the sun and its planet and other sun and they planet be tear they way through the ether like so many fish on a dipsy-hook from a marblehead fishing smack run before the wind do it never occur to you that the ether of this solar system must be revolve around this central sun the whole solar system ether and planet be revolve around alcyone and the reason why they minor revolution around the sun be not affect by it be because the solar system be a vast globe of ether have a thinner and rarer medium to revolve in the same as we earth have it be the motion of a fly in a move car now fix you attention on this globe of ether this solar globe you must do it to get the concept before you you have know of it all you life without once really apprehend it for you have never learn to think or to utilize the knowledge that be give you the idea be as new and as strange as if you have never know it what lie beyond the surface of the solar globe something must something as much rarer and thinner than the ether as the ether be rarer and thinner than prakritus can you not guess it be prana the life force of the universe as prakritus be make from ether so ether be make from prana it be make in the same way each atom of the ether be the center of a molecule of prana surround by a atmosphere of pranic atom exactly as you prakritic atom be surround by a atmosphere of etheric atom you say that each atom of prakritus be the center of a molecule of ether so it be but each atom of that etheric molecule be the center of a pranic molecule each atom of you physical matter be triple not double you say that all physical phenomenon come from the chording vibration of the etheric and prakritic atom of the two plane of matter yes but do you not see that all vital phenomenon come from the chording vibration of the pranic etheric and prakritic atom of the three plane of matter which be in each atom in the live leaf the three plane be sound in chord in each atom of it in the dead leaf dry up and fall to piece only the lower two be sound in chord the silver chord have be break each atom of prakritus you say have the potentiality of some kind of phenomenon we add ` and of life also ' the potentiality of life be in every atom of prakritus even the atom of iron may live in the blood it can not become a part of any live organism until its prana be sound the chord of life in unison with the ether and prakritus -- the threefold silver chord what be the center of this prana it be alcyone there be other solar globe beside ours circle around alcyone and we have be consider only we own solar globe of ether alcyone be the center of the prana in which they revolve as the sun be the center of we ether in which the planet revolve as this prana have a center around which we revolve with other solar system then it must have a center of gravity then this prana be a globe the prana do not then fill this material universe there must be yet another form of matter rarer and finer than prana from which prana be make as ether be make from prana and prakritus from ether have we any other class of phenomenon to explain except vital and physical yes there be a very important class mental and here we have the explanation if we exercise we reason these pranic globe be float in a ocean of manasa matter in its rarest form each atom of prana be form from manasa exactly as ether be form from prana and each pranic atom in the universe be the center of a manasic molecule have a atmosphere of manasic atom so we be not exact in give the prakritic atom three plane or octave of vibration it have four you merely surround it with etheric atom and this be correct so far as it go you only wish to explain physical problem but there be other problem to be explain problem of life and mind and the same knowledge you have explain they as well as the other if you simply avail yourself of it that you do not consider the atom as four-fold instead of two-fold be you own fault i have not tell you anything you do not already know i have only ask you to apply you present knowledge of physics to these problem of life and mind and apply you reasoning power the chording vibration in a atom of matter of the two plane produce force or phenomenon the three plane produce life -- the silver chord the four plane produce mind -- the golden chord you say there be no gulf between the prakritic and etheric world that it be one continuous world and all its phenomenon be by continuity and not impact that be true but it be not the whole truth there be no gulf to cross between the prakritic and etheric world none to cross between that and the manasic the four world be one great world continuous interchangeable through the four as well as through the two there be continuity and not impact whether it be a atom or a world the four be there nothing no combination of atom no matter of any kind however small or large can exist in this prakritic world unless it have the four element which from time immemorial we philosopher have call earth water fire air mean the four globe or form of matter in the universe we do not have to leave the earth to live in the etheric globe it be here nor do we have to go million of mile to reach the pranic globe it be here the problem of light and heat be no easier than the problem of birth and death the pranic globe be within we within everything so be the manasic it be here on these higher plane that the chance for worthy study be greatest at least we think so though you may not we live on the manasic -- pranic -- etheric globe on precisely the same term that we live on this of prakritus and the problem of the three be equally open to we if there be any who care to follow up the line of thought i have open who care for the question that interest we of the east i will talk as long as they care to listen provide they will not ask for knowledge that will give they power over other which can not fail to be use for evil this be but a glimpse of hindu physics yet it have help we in the metaphysics we now understand the chain of globe -- in part the earth be fourfold as each atom of the earth be fourfold so they aggregation give we prakritic earth a etheric earth a pranic earth and a manasic earth -- in coadunition and not like the skin of a onion they be separate and distinct globe each on its own plane it be four down and three up for the angel enter matter whether from the outmost boundary of manasic matter or the surface of the earth or the cover of a baseball the chain of globe in the secret doctrine represent the unity of the material universe the three-fold nature of the astral model be reveal and the unity of all prakritic thing but more than that to many mind will be the explanation it give of why there be but four plane of vibration in matter that the highest form of development in prakritus show only four element prakritus or body sensation or force life and mind and that these last three present in all thing in esse become present in posse when they work together harmonically chapter six we place on earth the next time we wise man from the east be ask to say a few word and make he own topic he speak perhaps as follow : how large do you think the earth be you answer promptly 7912 mile in diameter you be as far out of the way as you be in suppose that we sun could be a center of gravity of a lot of planet revolve around it and around alcyone without be a globe of ether now that it have be mention you see very clearly for yourself that it must be a solar globe of ether it follow from one of you physical axiom when i tell you why the earth be and must be about fifty thousand mile in diameter you will see that it must be so and that you know it all the time but never stop to formulate you knowledge you have have the knowledge for three century without apply it it be in 1609 that you greatest astronomer john kepler announce as one of three harmonic law by which the universe be govern that the square of the time of the planet be proportional to the cube of they distance from the sun and that this law be true in physics and everywhere no one of you scientist have have the wisdom to study out what it mean and for three century for 291 year you have repeat he word like so many parrot instead of use the key he give you to unlock the mystery of the universe a corollary of he law be that the planet move in they orbit because they be impel thereto between the two force and move in a mean curve between they but it be not until 1896 that you discover that the mean between two force be always a curve and never a straight line you have not a text book in a school today that do not repeat this fundamental and absurd error -- which you have know for three century to be a error -- that the motion result from a mean between force be in a straight line the curve result here be not to be measure easily and be so large that small segment appear straight line and it be not until carpenter demonstrate it mathematically that any one could believe it true there be two great force in this universe you grandfather call they centripetal and centrifugal force you father call they gravity and apergy name which still cling to they and you call they attraction and repulsion it be kepler not newton who discover that attraction or gravity be in inverse proportion to the square of the distance you know the meaning of this mystic phrase ` as the square of the distance ' you understand that it mean the attraction at two foot be only one-fourth the attraction at one foot at four foot only one-sixteenth at eight foot only one sixty-fourth but who know or care for kepler 's great law of repulsion or apergy that be that the ` square of the time be as the cube of the distance ' it have lie fallow for century no one of you western physicist have ever study it or try to explain it it remain just where kepler leave it as the mere law of orbital revolution of the planet only it be the key to the proper understanding of the universe ` the square of the time be as the cube of the distance ' mean that all motion be the result of two force act upon prakritus and that where the two force be balanced or equal the result in motion be a circle or ellipse the square of the repulsion be equal to the cube of the attraction to make they equal and produce a circle in other case they produce hyperbola and parabola this be a little dry -- nearly all fundamental knowledge be -- but the reward of patience be great the orbital speed of the earth be about 60000 mile per hour the attraction of the sun exactly equal the repulsion create by the motion more accurately the speed create by the repulsion the result of the two force work together at exact balance be a circle a ellipse be a circle bent a little and the ellipse in which the earth actually move come from vary attraction and repulsion kepler 's second law cover that if the orbital speed of the earth be a mile less per hour or even a foot less then the earth would wind up around the sun as a dog get wind up with he chain around a tree if this speed be a mile more per hour then the earth would wind out each year get farther and farther away until finally it would be lose when the speed be exactly proportional to the pull -- that be when it be as 16 be to 2 -- the result be a circular orbit the eccentricity of which be cause by certain fluctuation in the attraction and repulsion suppose a planet be to be place so that it would have a time of two year its distance from the sun would be 16 that of the earth why because to get the time double we would have to take the square root of 4 and to get the distance the cube root of the same number 4 if you wish to be very exact the cube root be 15889 but 16 be near enough for all ordinary work if you want to find out the distance of a planet revolve in six month you would divide the earth 's distance by 16 in proportion you get any time or distance you may desire with absolute accuracy the distance of any planet from the sun give its time or its time give its distance -- when that of any of the other be know this law apply throughout the universe in everything and everywhere it be not a law of orbital revolution alone but a law of all motion we moon have a time of 29 day and a speed of about 50000 mile per day if the speed be greater it would leave we if less it would wind up fall to the earth in the form of a spiral at what distance would it have to be to have a time of fourteen day divide 240000 mile by 16 a seven-day moon would be 16 that distance and the exact distance for a one-day moon for a moon that would always be in the same place in the heaven move as the earth revolve on its axis would be about 24998 mile this give we the line of 24-hour axial rotation the true surface of the earth and the sheer-line of prakritic matter beyond that line be the ether within that line be prakriti it be the line of no weight where gravity and apergy exactly balance inside that line gravity exceed apergy and everything revolving in less time or that time must fall to the center it be the true surface of any 24-hour globe of this size and weight a moon to revolve around the earth in less than one day must move faster than the earth to develop enough apergy to overcome the attraction that phenomenon we see in the moon of mar which be within its atmosphere within the planet itself we of the east learn this true size of the earth over six thousand year ago from observe the moon of jupiter the time of the first three be double we ask ourselves what this mean and find that they distance be increase by the cube root of 4 when they time be increase by the square root of 4 that time be to distance as 16 be to 2 then we apply the key and find it unlock many mystery the first lesson this teach we be that we do not live on the earth but within the earth at the line of liquid and gaseous change where the three form of matter meet and mingle and interchange with each other we live at the bottom of a gaseous ocean 21000 mile above we and 4000 mile from the center of the globe it give we a entirely new conception of the earth and of we place in it we see that we live in a narrow belt or skin of the earth not more than 100 mile thick perhaps not more than ten mile within this belt the prakritic elementary substance vary they condition combine and make form by increase or decrease vibration it be the creative and destructive zone the evolutionary mother -- the liquid level of the prakritus -- the seat of all physical phenomenon fifty mile above the mass of nitrogen and oxygen and argon be too cold to change they rate of vibration fifty mile below the surface of the earth all thing be too hot for change in vibration in this kinetic belt between two static mass we body have be make and also in all probability all combination of the elementary substance it be four thousand mile to the center of the static prakritic mass beneath we twenty-one thousand mile to the surface of the static prakritic mass above we and the small kinetic belt between be only one hundred mile thick but we have one consolation the prakritus we have be all kinetic and the best in the whole mass the second lesson it teach we be that as the earth have be make in the etheric globe in a corresponding skin or plane of kinetic etheric energy with we ether the best of the solar output that we ourselves be subject through we ether to the phenomenon of that kinetic solar plane in precisely the same way we now be to the phenomenon of the kinetic prakritic plane once rid of the fallacious notion that we be creature of the surface of the earth once clearly conscious that we be creature of the interior of the bottom of this gaseous ocean then we could understand not only how the earth could be create in this etheric globe but how we could be creature of the solar globe living on it when we learn that lesson and learn it well it dawn upon we that we be live in the pranic globe at the same kinetic level or plane of that globe the line where its solid and liquid and gas mingle and pass from one state to another the kinetic belt in which we solar globe have be make and that we be live as truly on that globe as we be on this prakritic globe we position on each globe be the same and then the great truth come that we live in the manasic globe at the same kinetic level and that we live we life on the four globe simultaneously we body be fourfold every atom be fourfold ready to respond in we mind to the vibration of the manasic world in we vitality to the pranic vibration of the pranic world in we nerve to the etheric vibration of the etheric world and in we prakritus to vibration of the prakritic world each one of we body live on its own earth globe for there be four globe of this earth -- in coadunition -- in its corresponding kind of globe the four earth globe become one globe as we four body be one body and the chain of four kind of globe in matter become one globe as the manasic with the other on it these four kind of globe be the beginning and the end of matter as we distinguish and know matter they be not the end of vibration or of plane of vibration or of realm beyond this material universe but they be the limit of all that be common to each and every atom of this lower plane of vibration it be upon this solid and perfect foundation of physics that account for and explain every kind of phenomenon we have construct we metaphysics all that belong to these four lower plane we consider and treat as physics all that relate to the plane beyond we consider metaphysics can you teach a child equation of payment before he know the first four rule you would not attempt such a task the first four rule be the physics of arithmetic all beyond be the metaphysics of arithmetic it flow out of they can you comprehend we system of metaphysics until you have clearly and completely master we physics would you not get into a fog at the very start there can be no system of metaphysics without a solid foundation of physics the idea be unthinkable the one grow out of the other it be its life its fruit its flower you have no western system of physics you physics be without form and void patchwork constantly change there be no substantial foundation for any system of metaphysics what you say or do in physics be fragmentary or chaotic it be perfectly true so far as you have go through the first invisible world of ether you be much more master of detail than we be we have not care particularly for the minor detail by which explosive be make or metal obtain from oxide we have prefer to push on into realm beyond as fast as we could seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness know that when it be find all these thing would be add unto we chapter seven the four globe that we live in the earth not on the earth be one of the most important of the fact of eastern physics in the study of its metaphysics the mathematical and physical proof that the physical earth be 50000 mile in diameter should not be pass over lightly in we haste to get on for the perfect understanding of all this fact imply make easy the comprehension of how we live etherically in the solar etheric globe of how we live pranically in the stellar pranic globe and how we live manasically in the manasic globe as we live within the narrow skin of phenomenon not more than 100 mile thick of this prakritic globe with the whole earth within the corresponding skin of phenomenon of the solar etheric globe within the kinetic belt in which it be make the ether which surround each prakritic molecule be not merely any and every kind of ether but that particular kind of kinetic ether which by change its rate of vibration through a octave create phenomenon the ether of all prakritic matter belong to the kinetic or creative belt of the solar etheric globe it be not static ether the ether in we prakritus be in touch with all the prakritic kinetic ether of the solar globe subject to all solar law of change and all we prak-solar law of change and all we prakritic matter a mere detail of it be a part of the solar phenomenon we father the sun or dyaus pitar -lrb- heavenly father -- latin jupiter -rrb- mean more once than it do now then the solar globe be the first heaven and to live under its law putting off the coat of skin be a object which man believe to be worth strive for they recognize as we do not that we prakritic law be not all they have to obey that the higher law of the solar globe on which they live of which the lower prakritic law be merely a outcome and detail be worthy of the closest study and they recognize that these higher law of the etheric globe be metaphysical as well as physical that we moral law flow out of the moral law of the solar etheric world as we physics flow from and out of solar physics religion be correct in its assumption of this higher law of moral incorrect only in its grasp and explanation science be correct in hold only in its assumption that it be physical science incorrect only in its assumption that it be physical science of this plane and globe only there be no quarrel between science and religion when the full knowledge of one stand beside the full knowledge of the other they be twin-sister this solar-etheric globe in which we be interested revolve around alcyone within that kinetic belt or skin of prana which be subject to phenomenon or vibration through one octave -- else it would never have be form all prana in the solar-etheric globe be of this particular kind of kinetic prana which create life of all kind -- which be subject to vibration through one octave the solar globe be a detail of kinetic prana only one of its phenomenon necessarily all we prana be of this kinetic kind and we earth a minor detail of it in the alcyone globe all the change and combination possible in kinetic prana on the pranic globe be possible here in we kinetic prana as all the phenomenon of the etheric world be possible here in we kinetic ether as we earth be a globe of ether and a globe of prana as well as a globe of prakritus we be actually live on a small cabbage of that pranic globe and subject to all its law in the vast manasic globe that include this whole material universe there be the same kinetic belt or skin of phenomenon or vibration similar to that kinetic belt in which we live on the earth and the manasa which permeate the alcyonic globe the solar globe and the earth be that kinetic manasa which be involve and evolve this involve and evolve kinetic manasa of the alcyonic globe be that which surround every atom of ether of the solar globe and every atom of prakritus of this earth globe in the great manasic globe this earth of ours be a minute village of helio -lrb- sun -rrb- county in the state of alcyone we be actually and literally live in this manasic globe precisely as we live in this earth and as in the village we be subject to all the law of the manasic world we can study they here in this village as well as we could elsewhere we can study they as easily as we study we prakritic village law or we etheric county law for all the form of manasa subject to they anywhere be here with we we be not limit to a study of the prakritic law of the village father nor yet to the etheric law of the supervisor of helio county as scientist say nor even to the state law of alcyone only the manasic law of the universe limit we material study in that direction as some man on this earth never leave they native village and never know or care for any matter outside of it so in this little earth village in the kinetic belt of the manasic globe there be man who do not care to know anything which relate to matter outside its boundary as some man may pass the boundary of they village but not of they county care only for the matter concern it so the western scientist of this earth village on the manasic globe do not pass the boundary of helio county care only for etheric matter the philosopher and wise man of the east be broader mind and from time immemorial have take greater interest in the pranic affair of alcyone and the manasic condition of the universe in which alcyone be a state than in the rustic murmur of they village or the gossip of they county there be nothing lack in we manasic earth-village nothing that be in more abundant measure in we county state and nation we be of the best we of this village may imagine if we like that there be nothing beyond the village limit and nothing in it but that which relate to the village we have the right to be silly if we wish to be and it be no sign of wisdom to say that there be a county beyond but that the county boundary end all and only village and county politics may be study the european who believe -- no asiatic or african or american could have believe -- that the earth rest on a elephant and the elephant on a turtle be wise in comparison nor be it any sign of intelligence to say that we may learn something of the village and county while we live but that to learn anything about the state and nation we must wait until we be dead there be too many in the village who be familiar with both state and nation and who have study they law for this to be anything but idiotic chapter eight the battle ground each and every one of we eighty-odd elementary substance owe they condition -- whether solid liquid or gas -- to they rate of vibration we have reduce all gas to a liquid and nearly all to a solid form conversely we have raise all solid to a liquid and nearly all to a gaseous condition this have be do by reduce or raise the vibration of each within one octave -- each one of the eighty odd have a special octave a tone or half-tone different from any other normally the solid vibrate in the lower note gather together under attraction while the gas vibrate in the higher note diffuse under repulsion between they create by the interchange of these two force be we skin of phenomenon or kinetics broadly the attraction of the universe come from its vibration at certain centre in the three higher note the repulsion come from its vibration everywhere else in the three higher note the central note d of the scale represent the battle ground between the field of kinetics this in simple illustration be water turn into gas this be the great battle ground the only one worth consider in a general view there be minor critical stage which the chemist study but for we in this broad sketch of the universe the important battle-ground be that between solid and liquid on one side represent gravity and gas on the other represent apergy all the solid and liquid of this earth of ours gather at the center in a core each of the element -lrb- or they combination -rrb- in this core vibrate in they three lower note produce the attraction which be in proportion to the mass and which decrease from the surface of the core as the square of the substance around this central core gather all the element vibrate in the three higher note of they octave as gas produce repulsion which increase by 16 for each double time it be worth while make this clear it have never before appear in print let the amount of apergy or repulsion or centrifugal force at the surface of the earth be represent by x this be the result of motion at the rate of 1000 mile per hour make this motion 2000 mile per hour and the apergy be increase 16 four thousand mile above the surface of this earth the rotation be at the rate of 2000 it be the globe of 48000 mile in circumference revolve in 24 hour and the speed be double this apergy have increase by 16 as the apergy increase at this rate every time the speed be double at a distance of 21000 mile the speed be 7000 mile per hour and the centrifugal force have be increase nearly four time what it be at the surface of the ocean the attraction have be decrease to about one-thirtieth at the surface it be equal to 120 x at 4000 mile to one-quarter or 30 x at 16000 mile to one-sixteenth or 7 x and at 21000 mile to 4 x if equatorial gravity be about 120 time that of the equatorial apergy at the ocean level then at the distance of 21000 mile from it in a revolving globe the two force would be equal the pull of each be 4 x and a anchor will weigh no more than a feather for weight be the excess of gravity or apergy if the pyramid have be build of the heaviest known material on the gas 21000 mile above we and so that they should revolve in the same time 7000 mile per hour they would remain there all the attraction of the solid core of the earth that could be exert on they at that distance would not be enough to pull they a inch nearer to it through we gaseous envelope they gaseous foundation there would be as firm as igneous rock here the force of repulsion create by the three higher note of a octave mean just as much at the attraction create by the three lower note whether it be in a chemical retort within this earth or within this universe the two force balance and be exactly equal they fight only within kinetic zone give the vast manasic globe of differentiate matter its atom unite in different number to form molecule as the basis of elementary substance manasic substance of course the thrill of vibration be sweep through it from the spiritual plane above and the element -lrb- and they combination -rrb- which answer in the lower note gather and form a core the invisible central sun with its attraction the element answer in the higher note gather around it with they repulsion so the two oppose force be bear with a vast kinetic skin for a battle-ground between they the attraction of the invisible central sun manifest itself to we in prakritus as light the repulsion of its cover or the higher static vibration of manasa manifest itself to we as darkness the first creative act in or on matter be the creation of light and its separation from the darkness the next creative act be the establishment of a kinetic skin or zone between they a firmament in which the two force of light and darkness could strive for mastery and god call the firmament heaven the third creative act be the gathering of the solid and liquid together and the beginning of the kinetic work in the creation of form and shape by the cross play of the two force in they combination of solid with gas all this have to happen before the manasa combine and drop in vibration to prana -- and before the pranic globe be form and the light could be manifest to we through they it may be well to read the first chapter of genesis over and ask forgiveness for we ignorance from the writer who record this creation of the pranic globe as the fourth act of creation and the creation of the etheric sun and prakritic moon to follow that that record be mutilate fragmentary but the writer of it know the fact if we have the full story instead of a sentence here and there take from a older story not to tell of creation but to hide another tale for the priest the writer of genesis would laugh last but let we return to the kinetic skin of energy between light and the darkness -- the firmament which god call heaven -- the battle ground for gravity and apergy or attraction and repulsion or good and evil or the power of light and darkness this skin be like that of a onion thickest at the equator and thinnest at the pole -- not only on this earth but in the solar alcyonic and manasic globe the equatorial belt where phenomenon be richest in the manasic globe we call the milky way in the solar globe we call it the plane of the ecliptic and on the earth the tropics modern science have not yet find it in alcyonic globe -- because it have never think of look for it this division of the light from the darkness be all that be require for evolution on the manasic globe within the kinetic belt this evolution be not confine to the making of a few alcyonic or pranic globe it be -lrb- and be -rrb- a great and wonderful evolution beyond word and almost beyond imagination it be the heaven which mankind have long to see and know the writer of genesis mixed it with the creation of this earth use earthly metaphor before find fault we should better he language we have not the word in physics to do it and must wait for we metaphysics but of one thing we may be sure that the pranic - alcyonic globe here and there at the sea level of the manasic globe -- in what god call heaven -- amount to no more on that globe or in heaven than so many ball of thistle-down blow across a meadow do on this earth of ours everything that can be create in thought must be there it be in think only but in think it be differentiate as sharply as anything in prakritus the manasic world the heaven of the bible be as real as we own world can possibly be in fact more real for when ours be resolve back into its final element it will be but the dust of the ground of the manasic world the pranic globe create in this manasic skin by sound or the logo or vibration evolve in identically the same way -- with a central static core and a outer static envelope of low and high vibration in prana create attraction and repulsion or gravity and apergy the kinetic skin between in which these force play in the pranic world make a real not a imaginary pranic world though but a faint reflection of the manasic when we father the central invisible sun transfer he attraction to these alcyonic sun the light have something in which to manifest itself and we see this manifest core and call it alcyone and its manifestation light but light in its last material analysis be but the static mind or think vibrate in the three lower note of the octave chapter nine the dual man within the alcyonic globe of differentiate pranic-manasic atom the vibration divide they also into solid-liquid core and gaseous envelope and a kinetic skin of phenomenon and then a new world -- a world of life come into material existence all the atom of thought or manasa surround each and every pranic atom and make its molecule of energy so to speak be that particular kind of kinetic manasa ready to change its rate of vibration within a octave and the form prana assume from the action of think within the kinetic belt be live and think each pranic globe which be a small state of product of the manasic consist of two globe in coadunition -- two in one each pranic atom be the center of a manasic molecule and represent the universe all thing be two in one create by harmonic vibration between they and existence by the greater strength of the lower note or attraction it be at once less and more wonderful than the manasic world -- a specialized form of it when within this kinetic belt of the prana the etheric solar globe form here and there they be three fold each atom of the new plane of matter have its surrounding envelope of prana - manasa -- a specialization of the pranic world in which -lrb- what we call -rrb- force have be add to life and mind the static ether vibrate in each of its element through one octave divide into central core -lrb- we sun and other sun -rrb- and outer cover with a skin or belt of kinetic energy as above which develop a etheric world all thing on this etheric world be cause by the harmonic vibration between the etheric atom and they surrounding envelope except that while all thing in this etheric world must have life not all need have mind the chord of three be not necessary to create the chord of two be enough and the manasic atom might cease to vibrate in chord with the prana and ether without affect the creation only in the etheric world -lrb- and below it -rrb- could there be live mindless one to the etheric globe the stellar pranic core transfer they light which manifest itself in the solid static ether as attraction and in the gaseous static ether as repulsion within the kinetic skin of each etheric world more specialized and less varied than the pranic we sun be not of prakritus but of static ether compose of the separate and individual elementary substance of the ether and they compound vibrate in the lower note of they octave it be we father not we elder brother its envelope of static ether in which the planet revolve be compose of the elementary substance and combination vibrate in the higher note of they octave the light transfer to this etheric globe from its mother alcyone manifest itself in the lower vibration of the sun as attraction in the higher vibration of its envelope as repulsion and within the kinetic skin wherein these force play the prakritic globe planet be bear take we earth each atom be fourfold -- whether of the static core or of the static gaseous envelope creation on it be limit to the kinetic skin wherein the attraction of the lower and repulsion of the higher note in each octave of vibration have full play all thing on it must have come from the chording vibration of the atom of the prakritic elementary substance and they envelope of ether they may or may not have life or mind the ether atom may have lose its chord with its pranic envelope or the pranic envelope may have lose its chord with the manasic but the combination must have force or energy within it it may have lose mind and life in acquire it or after acquire it but it have to have life before it could become prakritus all thing in the prakritic world flow from the life of the etheric and the mind of the pranic world everything in the etheric world have life and we unconscious personification or vivification of etheric life transfer into fauna or flora or into force of any kind have a natural explanation the thrill of vibration in one octave through the differentiate consciousness of the universe by which the light be separate from the darkness the lower from the higher be all that be require to create each star and sun and world and all that in they be and it be all good each thing on every lower world be but the translation into form of the type of the next world -lrb- or plane -rrb- above as each element on this prakritic type so each combination of those element into crystal or tree or animal be but the translation the normal earth from the crystal to -lrb- the animal -rrb- man be pure and clean and holy sin have not enter how do it come on the vast manasic world there be a special creation -- that of the angel man the three plane of spirit above be undifferentiated consciousness but they be in different octave of vibration and these work on the three highest form of differentiate consciousness -lrb- manasic matter -rrb- bring they to chord vibration so that when they combine and reach they highest point in evolution they create the angel -lrb- or manasic -rrb- man he be the product in kinetic manasa of the three spiritual plane above he precisely as the animal man be the product in kinetic prakritus of the three material plane above he the latter be the shadow of the other the angel-man have a material -lrb- manasic -rrb- body but he energy life and mind be spiritual the animal man have a prakritic body with energy life and mind that be material so far all be good the animal man have four body -- one of prakritus one of ether one of prana and one of manasa it may be true and probably be that he manasic body be not sound in chord with he prakritic body but only with those atom of it which be in he brain and nerve but that be immaterial -- for future consideration the angel man have but one body of manasa in which the spirit dwelt but that body be identical in substance with the body that make the mind of the animal man he manasic body join the manasic body of the animal man join with it by enter into the animal man 's mind as easily as water from one glass be add to water in another glass and the animal man become a living soul endowed with speech while the angel-man be give a skin coat the prakritic body of the animal man be the result in prakritus of a etheric-pranic-manasic or astral body form in accordance with the universal law for what he be by nature he could not be blame he stand naked and not ashamed before the radiance he do not make he astral body he be the mere translation of it into prakritus as all other create thing be and that invisible astral self -lrb- figuratively -rrb- stand at he right hand moulding and shape he but when the angel-man enter he mind all this be change he know good from evil to he mind of manasa have be add the spirit -- the atma-buddhus 's consciousness of the three spiritual plane he have become as one of we say the angel - man of the firmament of heaven he now hold the seven plane and be a creator each thought and desire that when a animal only fall harmless now create on the pranic and etheric world soon beside he at he left hand -lrb- figuratively -rrb- there grow up a second etheric or astral body that of he desire and he prakritic body be no longer the product of the astral body on he right hand it be the joint product of the left-hand kamic astral body he have create and the right hand normal astral body he be no longer in harmony with the radiance he could no longer face it he have create discord -- sin the pretty legend of the two angel one on the right hand and one on the left have its physical basis in this truth but of course as a matter of actual fact the normal and abnormal astral body be in mechanical union it be the kamic self-made astral body that remain from one incarnation to another produce in joint action with a new normal astral body a new physical body for the inner-self or angel take the pilgrimage through the lower world all the angel-man do not enter the animal man on the pranic etheric-prakritic globe only a few it be a pilgrimage through matter in which those who make it be meet many adventure but the legend be many and have no place in the physics although the legend be all found on the fact of the physics of the number of monad willing to undertake the pilgrimage only a few of those within the kinetic belt of the manasic globe have reach the pranic only a few of those within the pranic kinetic belt reach the etheric and of all who have reach this earth only a few may win they way back before the great day be-with-us the problem of man and he relation to the universe be a entirely different line of study from that of the spiritual monad the over-soul of every prakritic atom each prakritic atom have what may be call a soul its three-fold astral cause and a over-soul or the three-fold spiritual archetype or causeless cause every combination of these atom whether a knife a leaf a animal a earth a sun or a star have this soul and oversoul once the idea of what be mean by these term become clear the difficulty in understand they vanish the study of man be physical in its lower branch metaphysical only in its highest and last analysis the study of the monad be metaphysical from start to finish the two study be apt to be confuse because metaphysically they be often join for study the teacher take it for grant that the pupil fully understand the simple and easy physics of the problem of humanity this in crude and bold outline be the story of creation to the fall of man accord to the ancient physics translate into the word and phrase of modern physics the latter in the latest discovery of modern science seem to have steal a shive from the ancient loaf in the expectation that it would not be detect each and every step forward that modern science have make in the past twenty year each and every discovery of every kind in the physical field have be but the affirmative of some ancient doctrine teach in the temple of the east before cain take unto himself a wife chapter ten the septenary world in the physical universe we have the four inform physical globe so that as a whole or in its part it be a string of seven globe reach from the highest spirit to the lowest matter the awaken universal consciousness in vibration -- undifferentiated in the three globe above differentiate in the four globe below -- in its last analysis be all one but there be a gulf between matter and spirit radically divide they and in the physical universe we be concern only with physics and physical law until we reach its outmost boundary and come in touch with the spiritual plane beyond this be the view of the universe at first glance as in the smaller universe of this earth we at first see only its solid and liquid globe and even after the discovery of the gas we do not apprehend its important work in and behind the other until it have be point out to we nor do we at first apprehend the work of the spiritual in the material and the object of metaphysics be to show through the physics the connection between they that the spirit work through matter that where we can see but four there be seven bead on each material string and that the last bead of each string be itself a chain of bead the chain of seven apply only to the seventh manifestation or prakritus while the string apply to the way in which they come on each unravel string lead from we central sun down to a planet there be seven bead correspond to the seven globe in the chain of each planet each to each yet not the same there be a distinction and it be no wonder there should have be confusion at first and a mix of string with chain the physics as they progress will clear this confusion away in the manasic globe which be the first differentiation of that which form the spiritual globe above the result mind or manasa be mainly the differentiate divine mind of the highest it have a chain of two globe only itself and the divine mind globe although its string of globe be four it be the perfect differentiation of the buddhus in manasa that cause the formation of the pranic globe which have chain of four and string of five and the full and perfect differentiation of the atma in manasa-prana that cause the formation of the etheric globe which have chain of six and string of six consciousness buddhus and atma be practically the same as the manasa prana and ether each to each only the latter be differentiate and the former be not each of the three astral globe be the reflection in matter of the three spiritual globe beyond each to each and all to all the difference between matter and spirit be a difference in motion only both be vibrate so that both be in mechanical motion from force without like the wave of the ocean but only the matter have what we may properly call motion of its own or that produce from within -- from the atom and each organism of it up to the all as the vibration be from the all down to the atom it be this center of force in a atom this motion outside of vibration or rather beside it which we call differentiation brinton 's daring psychological speculation that mind be coextensive with motion -lrb- from organization -rrb- be but a repetition of one of the most ancient axiom take we solar etheric globe it have two other globe of matter consubstantial a globe of prana and a globe of manasa they be not beyond it or beside it but one with it atom for atom but what be they in reality globe of atma buddhus and consciousness in which the atom have organize be in motion be they not let this motion in this material universe cease and matter would melt away and resolve into spirit from spirit it come to spirit it belong and to spirit it return behind each and every astral globe whether the globe be but a astral atom or a astral planet or a astral world beyond its physics there be a meta-physical globe its cause and that be the real globe of which the astral be but a temporary phenomenon take a spiritual globe and differentiate it the motion result produce a material astral globe stop the motion bring it to a state of rest the astral shadow disappear it be merely spiritual phenomenon each and every astral atom be a model in miniature of the material and spiritual universe each and every prakritic atom be the joint result of spirit and matter unite and work together -- of physics and metaphysics and in its last analysis pure spirit pure metaphysics behind each and every prakritic atom of we earth there be six other atom -lrb- or globe -rrb- three material shadow and three spiritual reality so that it be a string of seven -- the whole universe in miniature -- material and spiritual and all thing combine and form on a prakritic base be a chain of seven -- whether a peach or a planet the chain belong to the prakritic plane the line of descent from the light through the star and sun to planet be string the chain be bead of the same size string on a thread the string be bead of different size string on a thread the bead of the chain be in coadunition -- in the same space as gas in water and the water in a sponge in metaphysics this earth can only be regard as a chain of seven globe its three astral globe in coadunition have they three spiritual double of course no one of the higher globe can be see by the prakritic eye but that be not to say the astral world can not be see by the astral eye in sleep or by the person who qualify himself for the astral world through the development of he astral body no upper globe of any chain in the solar system can be see say hp blavatsky in the secret doctrine -lrb- vol i p 187 -rrb- yet she mean by astronomer not by sage and she do not mean the upper globe in the stellar system of alcyone and its companion in pure physics the earth can only be regard as a chain of four globe consubstantial and in coadunition -- four in and three out this make seven and the metaphysician when talk physics use the metaphysical term interchangeably and speak of the chain of seven globe mean in one sentence the four material globe make this earth in another mean the line of descent or string of bead of different size reach down from the divine consciousness and in still another the seven bead or globe of the same size in coadunition to form this earth chain to the student who be thoroughly ground in the eastern physics this interweaving of the physical and metaphysical present no difficulty but to the western mind just begin the study it be a tangle we can now see what be mean by illusion or maya and understand why such stress be lay upon it by every teacher take the physical side first the motion of a top give it band of color to we eye that it do not have at rest they be temporary and not permanent a result of motion merely illusion and not reality the motion of the material atom of the four plane in harmony with they vibration a motion the spiritual world do not have produce all material phenomenon this be of course within the kinetic belt for above or below they there be no change and its phenomenon be the mere change in relation of one atom to another cause by motion the change be not real they disappear when the motion stop they have no existence in matter above or below the belt all phenomenon of every kind be as much a illusion as the suppose band of color around the top the illusion be the result of change of relation in differentiate atom cause by they motion without this motion the four material globe would dissolve into the atomic dust of the manasic world with all that be within they the whole material universe be all illusion a mere temporary relation of its atom through motion without reality or permanence what then be real what be not illusion that which be beyond the physical that which be its cause and root broadly the metaphysical which be not the result of differentiate atom through relation what be real in the top be real here what be illusion in the top be illusion here the meta-physical or spiritual -lrb- the term be interchangeable -rrb- do not have to pass beyond the manasic globe to get on the solid ground of reality the spiritual world be here in every physical atom and in every aggregation of they in every planet sun and star for they be seven each and every one not four behind the illusion of one atom or many whether here or on alcyone there be reality and permanency in the undifferentiated cause the spiritual archetype the three higher bead on the string which be the proper study of metaphysics chapter eleven stumble block in eastern physics the western student of the ancient eastern physics soon meet serious stumbling-block and one at the very threshold have in the last half century turn many back in begin he study of the solar system the pupil be tell : the first three planet -- mercury venus and the moon -- be dead and disintegrate evolution on they have cease the proof of this be find in the fact that they have no axial rotation mercury and venus always present the same surface to they father the sun and the moon the same surface to its daughter the earth this be a concrete statement of physical fact at which the western student protest if in the whole range of western astronomical science there be any one fact that he have accept as absolutely prove it be that mercury revolve once in 24h 5m 305 and venus once in 23h 21m 22 he would as soon credit a statement that the earth have no axial rotation as that mercury or venus have none and if he continue he study of eastern physics it be with no confidence in its accuracy and as a matter of curiosity the statement that mercury venus and the moon be dead and disintegrate the former two always present the same surface to the sun be the basis for a elaborate superstructure both in the physics and the metaphysics of the east it be use in physics to explain how the evolutionary wave come to a end at the perfection of the mineral on mercury with the loss of its axial rotation how the wave then pass on to venus with the seed of the vegetable kingdom where the vegetable evolution end with the loss of axial rotation how from venus it leap to the moon mother of animal and controller of animal life with the seed of animal life in the vegetable and how finally it come to the earth when the moon cease to revolve bring in the animal the seed of man here man will be evolve and perfect man have not yet be bear on this earth they say he be still in a prenatal or embryonic condition within the animal the lunar pitri the men-seed have a physical reason for be if this evolutionary theory be true none if it be not axial rotation be necessary in evolution the ancient physics teach which must cease with it the reason for this be too lengthy to give here briefly the rotation make the electrical flow and a thermopilic dynamo of each planet the ancient astronomical teaching be absolutely true there will not be a work on astronomy publish in europe or the united state this year or hereafter that will not state that mercury and venus revolve on they axis in the same time that they revolve around the sun which be another way of say that they have no axial rotation always present the same face to the sun and a inaccurate way of present the truth the screw that hold the tire at the outer end of the speak do not revolve once on its axis each time the wheel revolve run a cane through a orange and swing it around the orange have not revolve once on its axis nor do the stone in a sling revolve once on its axis for each revolution around the hand the motion of mercury be identically that of the impaled orange or the stone in the sling it have no axis and no axial rotation the modern astronomer detect in pretens to knowledge they never possess let themselves down easy this discovery of no axial rotation by the interior planet make by schiaparellus and confirm by flammarion in 1894 have since be fully verify by we western astronomer all the new astronomy accept it but the admission of astronomical error to speak politely come too late for the student it turn back from he study of eastern physics he can not regain he lose faith and lose ground thirty year ago proctor make it clear to western student that the orbit of the moon be a cycloidal curve -lrb- a drawn-out spring -rrb- around the sun the earth 's orbit be coincident with its axis and that the moon be astronomically and correctly a satellite of the sun not a satellite of the earth this have be the eastern view and teaching from time immemorial the eastern distinction between father sun and mother moon and the classification of the latter as a planet do not disturb the western student he understand that it be the absolute accuracy of modern astronomer in regard to the length of the day on mercury or venus which the astronomer declare have be correct down to the fraction of a second that make it impossible for he to accept the eastern physics when the latter squarely contradict he own this be but the first of many similar stumbling-block in the path of the student of eastern physics few be the follower straggle far that reach the lake of vennachar and when they do this be what they have to face : the planet absorb and use nearly all the solar energy -- all except the very small amount the minor speck of cosmic dust may receive there be not the least particle of the sun 's light or heat or any one of the seven condition of the solar energy waste except for the planet it be not manifest it be not there be no light no heat no form of solar energy except on the planet as it be transfer from the laya center of each in the sun to they the etheric globe be cold and dark except along the line to they -- the path of fohat -lrb- solar energy -rrb- six laya center be manifest in the sun one be lay aside though the wheel -lrb- planet -rrb- around the one eye be seven -lrb- this allude to the moon whose laya center in the sun be now also that of the earth but it be consider as a planet -rrb- what each receive that it also give back there be nothing lose that settle it say one student and the other agree of the hundred who start the foremost horseman ride alone before the next step be win in the light of the tardy but perfect justification of the first stumbling-block this statement may be worth follow out to see what it mean and how absurd it can be a etheric globe cold as absolute zero dark as erebus with here and there small pencil of light and heat from the sun to the planet -- just ray and nothing more -- be a very different one from the fiery furnace at absolute zero of the modern physicist on a line draw from the center of the earth to the center of the moon there be a point where the weight of the two body be say in we physics exactly to balance and it lie say we physics 2900 mile from the center of the earth and 1100 mile from the surface this be the earth 's laya center of the eastern physics it be of great importance in problem of life but it may be pass over for the present between the earth and the sun -- precisely speak between this laya center and the sun -- there be a point of balance which fall within the photosphere of the sun this point in the sun be the earth 's solar laya the occult or hide earth of the metaphysics a diagram will make this clearer draw a line from the laya center in the sun to that in the earth draw a narrow ellipse with this line as its major axis and shade it at each end of the axis strike the beginning of a ellipse that will be tangent if positive energy be along the shaded ellipse negative energy be in each field beyond -- earth and sun this be a very crude illustration of a fundamental statement elaborate to the most minute detail in explanation of all astronomical phenomenon but for the moment it will do the point be that along this axial line connect the laya center play all the seven solar force -- light heat electricity etc -- that affect the earth and on every side of this line be the electric field of these force to this line any escape solar energy be draw as the electricity of the air be draw to a live wire or magnet but there be little or none to escape from the laya point in the sun to the laya point in the earth the solar energy be transfer as sound be carry along a beam of light -lrb- photophone -rrb- or electricity from one point to another without a wire to the advanced student of electricity the ancient teaching be easily apprehend to other it be difficult to make clear these laya center it say be the transform point of energy from the earth laya to the solar laya center the energy we may say be positive beyond both the solar and the earth laya center in the field touch at they it be negative -- or vice versa the line connect the laya be the path of fohat -- the personification of solar energy this be a very crude and brief way of put many page of teaching but the important point be that this line between the laya be one of solar energy with a dynamic field of solar energy elliptical in shape connect with the reverse field at the laya point these dead point be the limit of each electric field which create we say in electrical work oppose field beyond they each one of these planet have its laya center inside the sun 's photosphere each planet have a line of solar energy with its field of solar energy -- not only a wireless telegraph but a wireless lighting heating and life-giving system these six solar laya point be the six hidden planet the earth and moon be one of the ancient metaphysics the moon be the one lay aside in they reception of energy from the sun it be as if the planet be at the solar laya point or connect with it by a special pipe-line the position of these six planetary laya point in the sun be indicate by the position of the planet in the heaven and they may often influence or modify one another if mar jupiter or saturn be anywhere near conjunction with the earth not only will a part of they field be join but they laya point in the sun will be modify the physical basis of the old astrology be the physical interference of these field of solar energy and what it depend on mainly in its work be the position of the six hidden planet or laya center which be show by the position of the planet with reference to the earth that the planet themselves affect any one or anything on this earth no real astrologer ever believe that they position in the heaven indicate certain change and modification of the flow of solar energy to the earth they know from they knowledge of physics the twelve house be in the sun say herme six in the north and six in the south connect they with the zodiac and the position of the planet show the interference of the solar current the one objection to this ancient theory be that it do not present enough difficulty the present value to science of the many theory in relation to the sun be the impossibility of reconcile any two of they and the fact that no two theorist can unite to pummel a third this ancient theory do not call for any great amount of heat light or energy in any condition to keep the cosmos in order -- not even enough for two person to quarrel over it merely turn the sun into a large dynamo connect with smaller dynamo and these with one another with return current by which there be nothing lose in its detail it account for all fact -- neatly simply and without exclamation point it be so simple and homespun so lack in the gaudiness that make -lrb- for example -rrb- we light and heat less than the billionth part waste on space always at absolute zero that we may have to wait many century to have it verify and confirm by we western science that it will be verify in time even as the first stumbling-block have be remove at the end of the nineteenth century its student may at least hope the lesson if there be one be that the western student of eastern physics do not ride a auto along asphalted road he must own himself and not be own by another man or even by modern science end of project gutenberg 's ancient and modern physics by thoma e willson
