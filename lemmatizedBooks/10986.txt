more than touch upon the salient feature of he career to suggest the respects in which he influence the course of event in he lifetime and to epitomize for the reader of another generation the judgment of he contemporary as to he genius and he character douglass 's fame as a orator have long be secure he position as the champion of a oppressed race and at the same time a example of its possibility be in he own generation as picturesque as it be unique and he life may serve for all time as a incentive to aspire soul who would fight the battle and win the love of mankind the average american of to-day who see when he attention be call to it and deplore if he be a thoughtful and just man the deep undertow of race prejudice that retard the progress of the color people of we own generation can not except by read the painful record of the past conceive of the mental and spiritual darkness to which slavery as the inexorable condition of its existence condemn its victim and in a less measure they oppressor or of the blank wall of proscription and scorn by which free people of color be shut up in a moral and social ghetto the gate of which have yet not be entirely tear down from this night of slavery douglass emerge pass through the limbo of prejudice which he encounter as a freeman and take he place in history as few of the world 's great man have ever have so checkered and diversify a career say henry wilson so it may at least be plausibly claim that no man represent in himself more conflicting idea and interest he life be in itself a epic which find few to equal it in the realm of either romance or reality it be after all no misfortune for humanity that frederick douglass feel the iron hand of slavery for he genius change the drawback of color and condition into lever by which he raise himself and he people the material for this work have be near at hand though there be a vast amount of which lack of space must prevent the use acknowledgment be here make to member of the douglass family for aid in secure the photograph from which the frontispiece be reproduce the more the writer have study the record of douglass 's life the more it have appeal to he imagination and he heart he can claim no special qualification for this task unless perhaps it be a profound and in some degree a personal sympathy with every step of douglass 's upward career belong to a later generation he be only privileged to see the man and hear the orator after he life-work be substantially complete but often enough then to appreciate something of the strength and eloquence by which he impress he contemporary if by this brief sketch the writer can revive among the reader of another generation a tithe of the interest that douglass create for himself when he lead the

passage in the 1899 original edition and identification that be not need in 1899 but may be need in the twenty-first century i if it be no small task for a man of the most favored antecedent and the most fortunate surroundings to rise above mediocrity in a great nation it be surely a more remarkable achievement for a man of the very humblest origin possible to humanity in any country in any age of the world in the face of obstacle seemingly insurmountable to win high honor and reward to retain for more than a generation the respect of good man in many land and to be deem worthy of enrolment among he country 's great man such a man be frederick douglass and the example of one who thus rise to eminence by sheer force of character and talent that neither slavery nor caste proscription could crush must ever remain as a shine illustration of the essential superiority of manhood to environment circumstance make frederick douglass a slave but they could not prevent he from become a freeman and a leader among mankind the early life of douglass as detail by himself from the platform in vigorous and eloquent speech and as record in the three volume write by himself at different period of he career be perhaps the completest indictment of the slave system ever present at the bar of public opinion fanny kemble 's _ journal of a residence on a georgian plantation _ keep by she in the very year of douglass 's escape from bondage but not publish until 1863 too late to contribute anything to the downfall of slavery be a singularly clear revelation of plantation life from the standpoint of a outsider entirely unbiased by american prejudice _ frederick douglass 's narrative _ be the same story tell from the inside they coincide in the main fact and in the matter of detail like the two slightly differ view of a stereoscopic picture they bring out into bold relief the real character of the peculiar institution _ uncle tom 's cabin _ lend to the structure of fact the decoration of humor a dramatic plot and character to whose fate the touch of creative genius give a living interest but after all it be not uncle tom nor topsy nor miss ophelium nor eliza nor little eva that make the book the power it prove to stir the heart of man but the great underlying tragedy then already rapidly approach a bloody climax frederick douglass be bear in February l8l7 -- as nearly as the date could be determine in after year when it become a matter of public interest -- at tuckahoe near easton talbot county on the eastern shore of maryland a barren and poverty-stricken district which possess in the birth of douglass its sole title to distinction he mother be a negro slave tall erect and well-proportioned of a deep black and glossy complexion with regular feature and manners of a natural dignity and sedateness though a field hand and compel to toil many hour a day she have in some mysterious way learn to read be the only person of color in tuckahoe slave or free who possess that accomplishment he father be a white man it be in the nature of thing that in after year attempt should be make to analyze the source of douglass 's talent and that the question should be raise whether he owe it to the black or the white half of he mixed ancestry but douglass himself who know he own mother and grandmother ascribe such power as he possess to the negro half of he blood and as to it certainly he owe the experience which give he anti-slavery work its peculiar distinction and value he doubtless believe it only fair that the credit for what he accomplish should go to those who need it most and could justly be proud of it he never know with certainty who he white father be for the exigency of slavery separate the boy from he mother before the subject of he paternity become of interest to he and in after year he white father never claim the honor which might have give he a place in history douglass 's earliest recollection center around the cabin of he grandmother betsey bailey who seem to have be something of a privileged character on the plantation be permit to live with she husband isaac in a cabin of they own charge with only the relatively light duty of look after a number of young child mostly the offspring of she own five daughter and provide for she own support it be impossible in a work of the scope of this to go into very elaborate detail with reference to this period of douglass 's life however interesting it might be the real importance of he life to we of another generation lie in what he accomplish toward the world 's progress which he only begin to influence several year after he escape from slavery enough ought to be state however to trace he development from slave to freeman and he preparation for the platform where he secure he hearing and earn he fame douglass be bear the slave of one captain aaron anthony a man of some consequence in eastern maryland the manager or chief clerk of one colonel lloyd the head for that generation of a old exceedingly wealthy and highly honor family in maryland the possessor of a stately mansion and one of the largest and most fertile plantation in the state captain anthony though only the satellite of this great man himself own several farm and a number of slave at the age of seven douglass be take from the cabin of he grandmother at tuckahoe to he master residence on colonel lloyd 's plantation up to this time he have never to he recollection see he mother all he impression of she be derive from a few brief visit make to he at colonel lloyd 's plantation most of they at night these fleeting visit of the mother be important event in the life of the child now no longer under the care of he grandmother but turn over to the tender mercy of he master 's cook with whom he do not seem to have be a favorite he mother die when he be eight or nine year old she son do not see she during she illness nor learn of it until after she death it be always a matter of grief to he that he do not know she better and that he could not be one of the sin of slavery that he never forgive on colonel lloyd 's plantation douglass spend four year of the slave life of which he graphic description on the platform stir humane heart to righteous judgment of a unrighteous institution it be enough to say that this lad with keen eye and susceptible feeling be a eye-witness of all the evil to which slavery give birth its extreme of luxury and misery could be find within the limit of one estate he see the field hand drive forth at dawn to labor until dark he behold every natural affection crush when inconsistent with slavery or warped and distorted to fit the necessity and promote the interest of the institution he hear the unmerited stroke of the lash on the back of other and feel they on he own in the wild song of the slave he read beneath they senseless jargon or they fulsome praise of old master the often unconscious note of grief and despair he perceive too the debasing effect of slavery upon master and slave alike crush all semblance of manhood in the one and in the other substitute passion for judgment caprice for justice and indolence and effeminacy for the more virile virtue of freeman doubtless the gentle hand of time will some time spread the veil of silence over this painful past but while we be still gather its evil aftermath it be well enough that we do not forget the origin of so many of we civic problem when douglass be ten year old he be send from the lloyd plantation to baltimore to live with one hugh auld a relative of he master here he enjoy the high privilege for a slave of living in the house with he master 's family in the capacity of house boy it be he duty to run errand and take care of a little white boy tommy auld the son of he mistress for the time be mr sophia auld mr auld be of a religious turn of mind and from hear she reading the bible aloud frequently curiosity prompt the boy to ask she to teach he to read she comply and find he a apt pupil until she husband learn of she unlawful and dangerous conduct and put a end to the instruction but the evil be already do and the seed thus sown bring forth fruit in the after career of the orator and leader of man the mere fact that he master wish to prevent he learning make he all the more eager to acquire knowledge in after year even when most bitter in he denunciation of the palpable evil of slavery douglass always acknowledge the debt he owe to this good lady who innocently break the law and at the same time break the chain that hold a mind in bondage douglass live in the family of hugh auld at baltimore for seven year during this time the achievement that have the greatest influence upon he future be he learn to read and write he mistress have give he a start he own effort gain the rest he carry in he pocket a blue-backed _ webster 's spelling book _ and as occasion offer induce he young white playmate by the bribe of childhood to give he lesson in spelling when he be about thirteen he begin to feel deeply the moral yoke of slavery and to seek for knowledge of the means to escape it one book seem to have have a marked influence upon he life at this epoch he obtain somehow a copy of _ the columbian orator _ contain some of the choicest masterpiece of english oratory in which he see liberty praise and oppression condemn and the glowing period of pitt and fox and sheridan and we own patrick henry stir to life in the heart of this slave boy the genius for oratory which do not burst forth until year afterward the worldly wisdom of deny to slave the key to knowledge be apparent when it be say that douglass first learn from a newspaper that there be such people as abolitionist who be oppose to human bondage and seek to make all man free at about this same period douglass 's mind fall under religious influence he be convert profess faith in jesus christ and begin to read the bible he have dream of liberty before he now pray for it and trust in god but with the shrewd common sense which mark he whole life and save it from shipwreck in more than one instance he never forget that god help they that help themselves and so never miss a opportunity to acquire the knowledge that would prepare he for freedom and give he the means of escape from slavery douglass have learn to read partly from childish curiosity and the desire to be able to do what other around he do but it be with a definite end in view that he learn to write by the slave code it be unlawful for a slave to go beyond the limit of he own neighborhood without the write permission of he master douglass 's desire to write grow mainly out of the fact that in order to escape from bondage which he have early determine to do he would probably need such a pass as this write permission be term and could write it himself if he but know how he master for the time be keep a ship-yard and in this and neighbor establishment of the same kind the boy spend much of he time he notice that the carpenter after dress piece of timber mark they with certain letter to indicate they position in the vessel by ask question of the workman he learn the name of these letter and they significance he get up write match with stick upon the ground with the little white boy copy the italics in he spelling-book and in the secrecy of the attic fill up all the blank space of he young master 's old copy-book in time he learn to write and thus again demonstrate the power of the mind to overleap the bound that man set for it and work out the destiny to which god design it ii it be the curious fate of douglass to pass through almost every phase of slavery as though to prepare he the more thoroughly for he future career shortly after he go to baltimore he master captain anthony die intestate and he property be divide between he two child douglass with the other slave be part of the personal estate and be send for to be appraise and dispose of in the division he fall to the share of mr lucretia auld he master daughter who send he back to baltimore where after a month 's absence he resume he life in the household of mr hugh auld the sister-in-law of he legal mistress owe to a family misunderstanding he be take in march 1833 from baltimore back to st michael he mistress lucretium auld have die in the mean time and the new household in which he find himself with thoma auld and he second wife rowena at its head be distinctly less favorable to the slave boy 's comfort than the home where he have live in baltimore here he see hardship of the life in bondage that have be less apparent in a large city it be to be fear that douglass be not the ideal slave govern by the meek and lowly spirit of uncle tom he seem by he own show to have manifest but little appreciation of the wise oversight the thoughtful care and the freedom from responsibility with which slavery claim to hedge round its victim and he be incline to spurn the rod rather than to kiss it a tendency to insubordination due partly to the freer life he have lead in baltimore get he into disfavor with a master easily displeased and not prove sufficiently amenable to the discipline of the home plantation he be send to a certain celebrated negro-breaker by the name of edward covey one of the poorer whites who as overseer and slave-catcher and in similar unsavory capacity earn a living as parasite on the system of slavery douglass spend a year under covey ministration and he life there may be sum up in he own word : i have neither sufficient time in which to eat nor to sleep except on sunday the overwork and the brutal chastisement of which i be the victim combine with that ever-gnawing and soul-destroying thought ' i be a slave -- a slave for life ' render I a living embodiment of mental and physical wretchedness but even all this do not entirely crush the indomitable spirit of a man destine to achieve he own freedom and thereafter to help win freedom for a race in August 1834 after a particularly atrocious beating which leave he wound and weak from loss of blood douglass escape the vigilance of the slave-breaker and make he way back to he own master to seek protection the master who would have lose he slave 's wages for a year if he have break the contract with covey before the year 's end send douglass back to he taskmaster anticipate the most direful consequence douglass make the desperate resolution to resist any further punishment at covey 's hand after a fight of two hour covey give up he attempt to whip frederick and thenceforth lay hand on he no more that covey do not invoke the law which make death the punishment of the slave who resist he master be probably due to shame at have be worst by a negro boy or to the prudent consideration that there be no profit to be derive from a dead negro strength of character re-enforce by strength of muscle thus win a victory over brute force that secure for douglass comparative immunity from abuse during the remain month of he year 's service with covey the next year 1835 douglass be hire out to a mr william freeland who live near st michael 's a gentleman who do not forget justice or humanity so far as they be consistent with slavery even in deal with bond-servant here douglass lead a comparatively comfortable life he have enough to eat be not overworked and find the time to conduct a surreptitious sunday-school where he try to help other by teach he fellow-slave to read the bible iii the manner of douglass 's escape from maryland be never publicly disclose by he until the war have make slavery a memory and the slave-catcher a thing of the past it be the theory of the anti-slavery worker of the time that the publication of the detail of escape or rescue from bondage seldom reach the ear of those who might have learn thereby to do likewise but merely furnish the master class with information that would render other escape more difficult and bring suspicion or punishment upon those who have assist fugitive that this be no idle fear there be abundant testimony in the annals of the period but in later year when there be no longer any danger of unpleasant consequence and when it have become a honor rather than a disgrace to have assist a distressed runaway douglass publish in detail the story of he flight it would not compare in dramatic interest with many other celebrated escape from slavery or imprisonment he simply masquerade as a sailor borrow a sailor protection or certificate that he belong to the navy take the train to baltimore in the evening and ride in the negro car until he reach new york city there be many anxious moment during this journey the protection he carry describe a man somewhat different from he but the conductor do not examine it carefully fear clutch at the fugitive 's heart whenever he near a state border line he see several person whom he know but if they recognize he or suspect he purpose they make no sign a little boldness a little address and a great deal of good luck carry he safely to he journey 's end douglass arrive in new york on September 4 1838 have attain only a few month before what would have be in a freeman he legal majority but though land in a free state he be by no mean a free man he be still a piece of property and could be reclaim by the law 's aid if he whereabouts be discover while local sentiment at the north afford a measure of protection to fugitive and few be ever return to bondage compare with the number that escape yet the fear of recapture be ever with they darken they life and impede they pursuit of happiness but even the partial freedom douglass have achieve give birth to a thousand delightful sensation in he autobiography he describe this dawn of liberty thus : a new world have open up to I i live more in one day than in a year of my slave life i feel as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lion my chain be break and the victory bring I unspeakable joy but one can not live long on joy and while he chain be break he be not beyond the echo of they clanking he meet on the street within a few hour after he arrival in new york a man of he own color who inform he that new york be full of southerner at that season of the year and that slave-hunter and spy be numerous that old resident of the city be not safe and that any recent fugitive be in imminent danger after this cheerful communication douglass 's informant leave he evidently fear that douglass himself might be a slave-hunting spy there be negro base enough to play this role in a sailor whom he encounter he find a friend this good samaritan take he home for the night and accompany he next day to a mr david ruggle a color man the secretary of the new york vigilance committee and a active antislavery worker mr ruggle keep he conceal for several day during which time the woman douglass love a free woman come on from baltimore and they be marry he have no money in he pocket and nothing to depend upon but he hand which doubtless seem to he quite a valuable possession as he know they have bring in a income of several hundred dollar a year to they former owner douglass 's new friend advise he to go to new bedford massachusett where whaling fleet be fit out and where he might hope to find work at he trade of ship-calker it be believe too that he would be safer there as the anti-slavery sentiment be consider too strong to permit a fugitive slave 's be return to the south when douglass accompany by he wife arrive in new bedford a mr nathan johnson a color man to whom he have be recommend receive he kindly give he shelter and sympathy and lend he a small sum of money to redeem he meager baggage which have be hold by the stage-driver as security for a unpaid balance of the fare to new bedford in he autobiography douglass commend mr johnson for he noble-hearted hospitality and manly character in new york douglass have change he name in order the better to hide he identity from any possible pursuer douglass 's name be another tie that bind he to he race he have be call douglass by the writer because that be the name he take for himself as he do he education and he freedom and as douglass he make himself famous as a slave he be legally entitle to but one name -- frederick from he grandfather isaac bailey a freeman he have derive the surname bailey he mother with unconscious sarcasm have call the little slave boy frederick augustus washington bailey the bearer of this impose string of appellation have with a finer sense of fitness cut it down to frederick bailey in new york he have call himself frederick johnson but finding when he reach new bedford that a considerable portion of the color population of the city already rejoice in this familiar designation he fall in with the suggestion of he host who have be read scott 's _ lady of the lake _ and trace a analogy between the runaway slave and the fugitive chieftain that the new freeman should call himself douglass after the noble scot of that name -lrb- dougla -rrb- the choice prove not inappropriate for this modern douglass fight as valiantly in he own cause and with he own weapon as ever any douglass -lrb- dougla -rrb- fight with flash steel in border foray here then in a new england town douglass begin the life of a freeman from which relieved now of the incubus of slavery he soon emerge into the career for which in the providence of god he seem by he multiform experience to have be especially fit he do not find himself even in massachusett quite beyond the influence of slavery while before the law of the state he be the equal of any other man caste prejudice prevent he from find work at he trade of calker and he therefore seek employment as a laborer this he find easily and for three year work at whatever he hand find to do the hardest toil be easy to he the heaviest burden be light for the money that he earn go into he own pocket if it do not remain there long he at least have the satisfaction of spend it and of enjoy what it purchase during these three year he be learn the lesson of liberty and unconsciously continue he training for the work of a anti-slavery agitator he become a subscriber to the _ liberator _ each number of which he devour with eagerness he hear william lloyd garrison lecture and become one of he most devoted disciple he attend every anti-slavery meeting in new bedford and now and then speak on the subject of slavery in humble gathering of he own people iv in 1841 douglass enter upon that epoch of he life which bring the hitherto obscure refugee prominently before the public and in which he service as anti-slavery orator and reformer constitute he chief claim to endure recollection million of negro whose life have be far less bright than douglass 's have live and die in slavery thousand of fugitive under assume name be win a precarious livelihood in the free state and tremble in constant fear of the slave-catcher some of these be do noble work in assist other to escape from bondage mr siebert in he _ underground railroad _ mention one fugitive slave john mason by name who assist thirteen hundred other to escape from kentucky another picturesque fugitive be harriet tubman who devote she life to this work with a courage skill and success that win she a wide reputation among the friend of freedom a number of free color man in the north a few of they wealthy and cultivate lend they time and they means to this cause but it be reserve for douglass by virtue of he marvellous gift of oratory to become pre-eminently the personal representative of he people for a generation in 1841 the massachusett anti-slavery society which have be for some little time weaken by faction arrange its difference and enter upon a campaign of unusual activity which find expression in numerous meeting throughout the free state mainly in new england on August 15 of that year a meeting be hold at nantucket massachusett the meeting be conduct by john a collin at that time general agent of the society and be address by william lloyd garrison and other lead abolitionist douglass have take a holiday and come from new bedford to attend this convention without the remotest thought of take part except as a spectator the proceedings be interesting and arouse the audience to a high state of feeling there be present in the meeting a certain abolitionist by name william c coffin who have hear douglass speak in the little negro sunday-school at new bedford and who know of he recent escape from slavery to he come the happy inspiration to ask douglass to speak a few word to the convention by way of personal testimony collin introduce the speaker as a graduate from slavery with he diploma write upon he back douglass himself speak very modestly about this he first public appearance he seem from he own account to have suffer somewhat from stage fright which be apparently he chief memory concern it the impression of other however allow a little for the enthusiasm of the moment be a safer guide as to the effect of douglass 's first speech parker pillsbury report that though it be late in the evening when the young man close he remark none seem to know or care for the hour the crowded congregation have be work up almost to enchantment during the whole long evening particularly by some of the utterance of the last speaker -lrb- douglass -rrb- as he turn over the terrible apocalypse of he experience in slavery mr garrison bear testimony to the extraordinary emotion it exert on he own mind and to the powerful impression it exert upon a crowded auditory patrick henry he declare have never make a more eloquent speech than the one they have just listen to from the lip of the hunt fugitive upon douglass and he speech as a text mr garrison deliver one of the sublimest and most masterly effort of he life and then and there begin the friendship between the fugitive slave and the great agitator which open the door for douglass to a life of noble usefulness and secure to the anti-slavery cause one of its most brilliant and effective orator at garrison 's instance collin offer douglass employment as lecturer for the anti-slavery society though the idea of thus engage he doubtless occur to more than one of the abolition leader who hear he nantucket speech douglass be distrustful of he own power only three year out of slavery with little learning and no experience as a public speaker painfully aware of the prejudice which must be encounter by man of he color fearful too of the publicity that might reveal he whereabouts to he legal owner who might reclaim he property wherever find he yield only reluctantly to mr collin 's proposition and agree at first upon only a three month ' term of service most of the abolitionist be or mean to be consistent in they practice of what they preach and so when douglass be enrol as one of the little band of apostle they treat he literally as a man and a brother they home they heart and they often none too well-filled purse be open to he in this new atmosphere he mind expand he spirit take on high courage and he read and study diligently that he might make himself worthy of he opportunity to do something for he people during the remainder of 1841 douglass travel and lecture in eastern massachusett with george

color the feeling toward the negro in new england in 1841 be but little different from that in the state of georgium to-day man of color be regard and treat as belong to a distinctly inferior order of creation at hotel and place of public resort they be refuse entertainment on railroad and steamboat they be herd off by themselves in mean and uncomfortable car if welcome in church at all they be carefully restricted to the negro pew as in the southern state to-day no distinction be make among they in these respects by virtue of dress or manners or culture or mean but all be alike discriminate against because of they dark skin some of douglass 's abolition friend among whom he especially mention wendell phillip and two other of lesser note win they way to he heart by at all time refuse to accept privilege that be deny to they swarthy companion douglass resent proscription wherever meet with and resist it with force when the odds be not too overwhelming more than once he be beat and maltreat by railroad conductor and brakeman for a time the eastern railroad run its car through lynn massachusett without stop because douglass who reside at that time in lynn insist on ride in the white people 's car and make trouble when interfere with often it be impossible for the abolitionist to secure a meeting-place and in several instance douglass parade the street with a bell like a town crier to announce that he would lecture in the open air some of douglass 's friend it must be admit be at time rather extreme in they language and perhaps stir up feeling that a more temperate vocabulary would not have arouse none of they ever hesitate to call a spade a spade and some of they denounce slavery and all its sympathizer with the vigor and picturesqueness of a muggletonian or fifth monarchy man of cromwell 's time execrate he religious adversary and while it be true enough that the church and the state be generally speak the obsequious tool of slavery it be not easy for a abolitionist to say so in vehement language without incur the charge of treason or blasphemy -- a old trick of bigotry and tyranny to curb freedom of thought and freedom of speech the little personal idiosyncrasy which some of the reformer affect such as long hair in the man and short hair in the woman -- there be surely some psychological reason why reformer run to such thing -- serve as convenient excuse for gibe and unseemly interruption at they public meeting on one memorable occasion at syracuse new york in November 1842 douglass and he fellow narrowly escape tar and feather but although douglass be vehemently denunciatory of slavery in all its aspect he twenty year of training in that hard school have develop in he a vein of prudence that save he from these verbal excess -- perhaps there be also some element of taste involve -- and thus make he argument more effective than if he have alienate he audience by indiscriminate attack on all the institution of society no one could justly accuse frederick douglass of cowardice or self-seeking yet he be opportunist enough to sacrifice the immaterial for the essential and to use the best means at hand to promote the ultimate object seek although the means thus offer might not be the ideal instrument it be doubtless this trait that lead douglass after he separate from he abolitionist friend to modify he view upon the subject of disunion and the constitutionality of slavery and to support political party whose platform by no means express the full measure of he conviction in 1843 the new england anti-slavery society resolve at its annual meeting in the spring to stir the northern heart and rouse the national conscience by a series of one hundred convention in new hampshire vermont new york ohio indiana and pennsylvanium douglass be assign as one of the agent for the conduct of this undertaking among those associate in this work which extend over five month be john a collin the president of the society who map out the campaign jame monroe george bradburn william a white charle l remond a color orator bear in massachusett who render effective service in the abolition cause and sidney howard gay at that time manage editor of the _ national anti-slavery standard _ and later of the new york _ tribune _ and the new york _ evening post _ the campaign upon which this little band of missionary set out be no inconsiderable one they be not go forth to face enthusiastic crowd of supporter who would meet they with brass band and shout of welcome they be more likely to be greet with hiss and cat-call stick and stone stale egg and decayed cabbage hoot and yell of derision and decoration of tar and feather in some town of vermont slanderous report be make in advance of they arrival they character be assail and they aim and object misrepresent in syracuse afterward distinguish for its strong anti-slavery sentiment the abolitionist be compel to hold they meeting in the public park from inability to procure a house in which to speak and only after they convention be well under way be they offer the shelter of a dilapidated and abandon church in rochester they meet with a more hospitable reception the indifference of buffalo so disgusted douglass 's companion that they shake the dust of the city from they foot and leave douglass who be accustom to coldness and therefore undaunted by it to tread the wine-press alone he speak in a old post-office for nearly a week to such good purpose that a church be throw open to he and on a certain Sunday in the public park he hold and thrill by he eloquence a audience of five thousand people on leave buffalo douglass join the other speaker and go with they to clinton county ohio where under a large tent a mass meeting be hold of abolitionist who have come from widely scatter point during a excursion make about this time to pennsylvanium to attend a convention at norristown a attempt be make to lynch he at manayunk but he usual good fortune serve he and he live to be threaten by higher power than a pro-slavery mob when the party of reformer reach indiana where the pro-slavery spirit be always strong the state have be settle largely by southerner they campaign of education become a run fight in which douglass whose dark skin attract most attention often get more than he share he strength and address bring he safely out of many a encounter but in a struggle with a mob at richmond indiana he be badly beat and leave unconscious on the ground a good quaker take he home in he wagon he wife bind up douglass 's wound and nurse he tenderly -- the quaker be ever the consistent friend of freedom -- but for the lack of proper setting he carry to the grave a stiff hand as the result of this affray he have often be introduce to audience as a graduate from slavery with he diploma write upon he back : from indiana he receive the distinction of a post-graduate degree v it can easily be understand that such a man as douglass throw thus into stimulate daily intercourse with some of the brightest mind of he generation all animated by a high and noble enthusiasm for liberty and humanity -- such man as garrison and phillip and gay and monroe and many other -- should have develop with remarkable rapidity those reserve of character and intellect which slavery have keep in repression and yet while aware of he wonderful talent for oratory he never for a moment let this knowledge turn he head or obscure the consciousness that he have bring with he out of slavery of some of the disability of that status naturally he expand intelligence seek a wider range of expression and he simple narrative of the wrong of slavery give way sometimes to a discussion of its philosophy he abolitionist friend would have prefer he to stick a little more closely to the old line -- to furnish the experience while they provide the argument but the strong will that slavery have not be able to break be not always amenable to politic suggestion douglass 's style and vocabulary and logic improve so rapidly that people begin to question he have be a slave he appearance speech and manner differ so little in material particulars from those of he excellent exemplar that many people be sceptical of he antecedent douglass have since he escape from slavery carefully keep silent about the place he come from and he master 's name and the manner of he escape for the very good reason that they revelation would have inform he master of he whereabouts and render he freedom precarious for the fugitive slave law be in force and only here and there could local public sentiment have prevent its operation confront with the probability of lose he usefulness as the awful example douglass take the bold step of publishing in the spring of 1845 the narrative of he experience as a slave give name of people and place and date as nearly as he could recall they he abolitionist friend doubt the expediency of this step and wendell phillip advise he to throw the manuscript into the fire declare that the government of massachusett have neither the power nor the will to protect he from the consequence of he daring the pamphlet be widely read it be write in a style of graphic simplicity and be such a _ exposé _ of slavery as exasperated its jealous supporter and beneficiary douglass soon have excellent reason to fear that he would be recapture by force or guile and return to slavery or a worse fate the prospect be not a alluring one and hence to avoid a involuntary visit to the scene of he childhood he seek liberty beyond the sea where man of he color have always enjoy a larger freedom than in they native land in 1845 douglass set sail for england on board the _ cambrium _ of the cunard line accompany by jame n buffum a prominent abolitionist of lynn massachusett on the same steamer be the hutchinson family who lend they sweet song to the anti-slavery crusade douglass 's color render he ineligible for cabin passage and he be relegate to the steerage nevertheless he become quite the lion of the vessel make the steerage fashionable be give the freedom of the ship and invite to lecture on slavery this he do to the satisfaction of all the passenger except a few young man from new orlean and georgium who true to the instinct of they caste make he stricture on the south a personal matter and threaten to throw he overboard they zeal be diminish by a order of the captain to put they in iron they sulk in they cabin however and rush into print when they reach liverpool thus give douglass the very introduction he need to the british public which be promptly inform by himself and other of the true fact in regard to the steamer speech and the speaker vi the two year douglass spend in great britain upon this visit be active and fruitful one and do much to bring he to that full measure of development scarcely possible for he in slave-ridden america for while the english government have foster slavery prior to the revolution and have only a few year before douglass 's visit abolish it in its own colony this wretched system have never fasten its clutch upon the home island slave have be bring to england it be true and carry away but when the right to remove they be question in court lord chief justice mansfield with a abundance of argument and precedent to support a position similar to that of justice taney in the dred scott case have take the contrary view and declare that the air of england be free and the slave who breathe it but once cease thereby to be a slave history and humanity have deliver they verdict on these two decision and time be not likely to disturb it a few day after landing at liverpool douglass go to ireland where the agitation for the repeal of the union between great britain and ireland be in full swing under the leadership of daniel o'connell the great irish orator o'connell have denounce slavery in word of burn eloquence the garrisonian abolitionist advocate the separation of the free and slave state as the only means of secure some part of the united state to freedom the american and irish disunionist be unite by a strong bond of sympathy douglass be soon refer to as the black o'connell and lecture on slavery and on temperance to large and enthusiastic audience he be introduce to o'connell and exchange compliment with he a public breakfast be give he at cork and a soiree by father matthew the eminent leader of the great temperance crusade which at that time share with the repeal agitation the public interest of ireland a reception to douglass and he friend buffum be hold in st patrick temperance hall where they be greet with a special song of welcome write for the occasion on January 6 1846 a public breakfast be give douglass at belfast at which the local branch of the british and foreign anti-slavery society present he with a bible bind in gold after four month in ireland where he deliver more than fifty lecture douglass and he friend buffum leave ireland on January 10 1846 for scotland where another important reform be in progress it be a epoch of rebellion against the established order of thing the spirit of revolt be in the air the disruption movement in the established church of scotland lead by the famous dr chalmer have culminate in 1843 in the withdrawal of four hundred and seventy minister who give up the shelter and security of the establishment for the principle that a congregation should choose its own pastor and organize themselves into the free protest church commonly call the free kirk a appeal have be issue to the presbyterian church of the world for aid to establish a sustentation fund for the use of the new church among the contribution from the united state be one from a presbyterian church in charleston south carolina just before this contribution arrive a south carolina judge have condemn a northern man to death for aid the escape of a female slave this incident have arouse horror and indignation throughout great britain lord brougham have comment on it in the house of lord and lord chief justice denham have characterize it in the name of all the judge of england as a horrible iniquity o'connell have reject profferr contribution from the southern state and a effort be make in scotland to have the south carolina money send back the attempt fail ultimately but the agitation on the subject be for a time very fierce and give douglass and he friend the opportunity to strike many tell blow at slavery he have never mince he word in the united state and he now handle without glove the government whose law have drive he from its border from scotland douglass go to england where he find still another great reform movement near a triumphant conclusion the anti-corn law league after many year of labor under the leadership of richard cobden and john bright for the abolition of the protective tariff on wheat and other kind of grain for food have bring its agitation to a successful issue and on June 26 1846 the corn law be repeal the generous enthusiasm for reform of one kind or another that pervade the british island give ready sympathy and support to the abolitionist in they mission the abolition of slavery in the colony have be decree by parliament in 1833 but the old leader in that reform have not lose they zeal for liberty george thompson who with clarkson and wilberforce have lead the british abolitionist invite garrison over to help reorganize the anti-slavery sentiment of great britain against american slavery and in August 1846 garrison go to england in that year evidently a paradise of reformer during the week beginning may 17 1846 douglass address respectively the annual meeting of the british and foreign anti-slavery society a peace convention a suffrage extension meeting and a temperance convention and speak also at a reception where effort be make to induce he to remain in england and money subscribe to bring over he family as will be see hereafter he choose the alternative of return to the united state on August 7 1846 douglass address the world 's temperance convention hold at covent garden theater london there be many speaker and the time allot to each be brief but douglass never lose a opportunity to attack slavery and he do so on this occasion over the shoulder of temperance he state that he be not a delegate to the convention because those whom he might have represent be place beyond the pale of american temperance society either by slavery or by a inveterate prejudice against they color he refer to the mobbing of a procession of color temperance society in philadelphium several year before the burning of one of they church and the wreck of they best temperance hall these remark bring out loud protest and call for order from the american delegate present who manifest the usual american sensitiveness to criticism especially on the subject of slavery but the house sustain douglass and demand that he go on douglass be denounce for this in a letter to the new york papers by rev dr cox one of the american delegate douglass 's reply to this letter give he the better of the controversy he sometimes express the belief found on long experience that doctor of divinity be as a rule among the most ardent supporter of slavery dr cox who seem at least to have meet the description be also a delegate to the evangelical alliance which meet in london August 19 1846 with a membership of one thousand delegate from fifty different evangelical sect throughout the world the question be raise in the convention whether or not fellowship should be hold with slaveholder dr cox and the other american hold that it should and they view ultimately prevail douglass make some tell speech at anti-slavery league meeting in denunciation of the cowardice of the alliance and win a wide popularity douglass remain in england two year not only do this visit give he a great opportunity to influence british public opinion against slavery but the material benefit to himself be inestimable he have leave the united state a slave before the law deny every civil right and every social privilege literally a man without a country and force to cross the atlantic among the cattle in the steerage of the steamboat during he sojourn in great britain a english lady mr ellen richardson of newcastle have raise seven hundred and fifty dollar which be pay over to hugh auld of maryland to secure douglass 's legal manumission and not content with this generous work the same large-hearted lady have raise by subscription about two thousand five hundred dollar which douglass carry back to the united state as a free gift and use to start he newspaper he have meet in europe as he say in a farewell speech man quite as white as he have ever see in the united state and of quite as noble exterior and have see in they face no scorn of he complexion he have travel over the four kingdom and have encounter no sign of disrespect he have be lionize in london have speak every night of he last month there and have decline as many more invitation he have shake hand with the venerable clarkson and have breakfast with the philosopher combe the author of _ the constitution of man _ he have win the friendship of john bright have break bread with sir john bowring have be introduce to lord brougham the brilliant leader of the liberal party and have listen to he wonderful eloquence he have meet dougla jerrold the famous wit and have be entertain by the poet william howitt who make a farewell speech in he honor everywhere he have denounce slavery everywhere hospitable door have open wide to receive he everywhere he have make friend for himself and he cause a slave and a outcast at home he have be make to feel himself a gentleman have be the companion of great man and good woman urge to remain in this land of freedom and offer aid to establish himself in life there he heart bleed for he less fortunate brethren in captivity and with the god-speed of he english friend ring in he ear he go back to america -- to scorn to obloquy to ostracism but after all to the work to which he have be ordain and which he be so well qualify to perform vii douglass land April 20 1847 he return to the united state with the intention of publish the newspaper for which he english friend have so kindly furnish the means but he plan meeting with opposition from he abolitionist friend who think the platform offer he a better field for usefulness he defer the enterprise until near the end of the year in the mean time he plunge again into the thick of the anti-slavery agitation we find he lecture in may in the broadway tabernacle new york and write letter to the anti-slavery papers in June he be elect president of the new england anti-slavery convention in August and September he go on a lecture tour with garrison and other through pennsylvanium and ohio on this tour the party attend the commencement exercise of oberlin college famous for its anti-slavery principle and practice and speak to immense meeting at various place in ohio and new york they cause be grow in popular favor and in place where formerly they have speak out of door because of the difficulty of secure a place of meeting they be now compel to speak in the open air because the church and hall would not contain they audience on December 3 1847 the first number of the _ north star _ appear douglass 's abolitionist friend have not yet become reconcile to this project and he persistence in it result in a temporary coldness between they they very naturally expect he to be guide by they advice they have find he on the wharf at new bedford and give he he chance in life and they may easily be pardon for find it presumptuous in he to disregard they advice and adopt a new line of conduct without consult they mr garrison write in a letter to he wife from cleveland it will also greatly surprise we friend in boston to hear that in regard to he prospect of establish a paper here to be call the north star he never open he lip to I on the subject nor asked my advice in any particular whatever but samuel may jr in a letter write to one of douglass 's english friend in which he mention this charge of garrison add it be only common justice to frederick douglass to inform you that this be a mistake that on the contrary he do speak to mr garrison about it just before he be take ill at cleveland the probability be that douglass have he mind make up and do not seek advice and that mr garrison do not attach much importance to any casual remark douglass may have make upon the subject in a foot-note to the _ life and time of garrison _ it be state : -- this enterprise be not regard with favor by the lead abolitionist who know only too well the precarious support which a fifth anti-slavery paper edit by a color man must have and who appreciate to the full douglass 's unrivalled power as a lecturer in the field as anticipate it nearly prove the ruin of its projector but by extraordinary exertion it be keep alive not however on the platform of garrisonian abolitionism the necessary support could only be secure by a change of principle in accordance with mr douglass 's immediate -lrb- political abolition -rrb- environment douglass 's own statement do not differ very widely from this except that he do not admit the mercenary motive for he change of principle it be in deference however to the feeling of he former associate that the _ north star _ be establish at rochester instead of in the east where the field for anti-slavery papers be already fully occupy in rochester then as now the center of a thrifty liberal and progressive population douglass gradually win the sympathy and support which such a enterprise demand the _ north star _ in size typography and interest compare favorably with the other weekly of the day and live for seventeen year it have however its up and downs at one time the editor have mortgage he house to pay the running expense but friend come to he aid he debt be pay and the circulation of the paper double in _ my bondage and my freedom _ douglass give the name of numerous person who help he in these earlier year of editorial effort among whom be a dozen of the most distinguished public man of he day after the _ north star _ have be in existence several year its name be change to _ frederick douglass 's paper _ to give it a more distinctive designation the newspaper firmament already scintillate with many other star in later year douglass speak of this newspaper enterprise as one of the wisest thing he ever undertake to paraphrase lord bacon 's famous maxim much reading of life and of book have make he a full man and much speaking have make he a ready man the attempt to put fact and argument into literary form tend to make he more logical in reasoning and more exact in statement one of the effect of douglass 's editorial responsibility and the influence bring to bear upon he by reason of it be a change in he political view until he begin the publication of the _ north star _ and for several year thereafter he be with the rest of the garrisonian a pronounced disunionist he hold to the garrisonian doctrine that the pro-slavery constitution of the united state be a league with death and a covenant with hell maintain that anti-slavery man should not vote under it and advocate the separation of the free state as the only means of prevent the utter extinction of freedom by the ever-advancing encroachment of the slave power in rochester he find himself in the region where the liberty party under the leadership of jame g birney salmon p chase gerrit smith and other have its largest support the liberty party maintain that slavery could be fight best with political weapon that by the power of the ballot slavery could be confine strictly within its constitutional limit and prevent from invade new territory and that it could be extinguish by the respective state whenever the growth of public opinion demand it one wing of the party take the more extreme ground that slavery be contrary to the true intent and meaning of the constitution and demand that the country should return to the principle of liberty upon which it be found though the more radical abolitionist be for a time bitterly oppose to these view yet the liberty party be the natural outgrowth of the abolition agitation garrison and phillip and douglass and the rest have plant birney and gerrit smith and chase and the rest water and the union party lead by the great emancipator garner the grain after a bloody harvest several influence must have co-operate to modify douglass 's political view the moral support and occasional financial aid give he paper by member of the liberty party undoubtedly predispose he favorably to they opinion he retirement as agent of the anti-slavery society and the coolness result therefrom have take he out of the close personal contact with those fervent spirit who have lead the van in the struggle for liberty they zeal have be more disinterested perhaps than douglass 's own for after all they have no personal stake in the outcome while to douglass and he people the abolition of slavery be a matter of life and death serene in the high altitude of they conviction the garrisonian would accept no halfway measure would compromise no principle and if they right arm offend they would cut it off with sublime fortitude and cast it into the fire they want a free country where the flee victim of slavery could find a refuge douglass perceive the immense advantage these swarm million would gain through be free in the state where they already be he have always be mind to do the best thing possible when a slave he have postpone he escape until it seem entirely feasible when deny cabin passage on steamboat he have go in the steerage or on deck when he have be refuse accommodation in a hotel he have seek it under any humble roof that offer it would have be a fine thing in the abstract to refuse the half-loaf but in that event we should have have no frederick douglass it be this very vein of prudence keep always in view the object to be attain and in a broad non-jesuitical sense subordinate the means to the end that enable douglass to prolong he usefulness a generation after the abolition of slavery douglass in he _ life and time _ state he own case as follow : after a time a careful reconsideration of the subject convinced I that there be no necessity for dissolve the union between the northern and southern state that to seek this dissolution be no part of my duty as a abolitionist that to abstain from voting be to refuse to exercise a legitimate and powerful means for abolish slavery and that the constitution of the united state not only contain no guarantee in favor of slavery but on the contrary be in its letter and spirit a anti-slavery instrument demand the abolition of slavery as a condition of its own existence as the supreme law of the land this opinion be not exactly the opinion of the majority of the liberty party which do not question the constitutionality of slavery in the slave state neither be it the opinion of the supreme court which in the dred scott case hold that the constitution guarantee not only the right to hold slave but to hold they in free state nevertheless entertain the view he do douglass be able to support the measure which seek to oppose slavery through political action in August 1848 while he garrisonian view be as yet unchanged he have be present as a spectator at the free soil convention at buffalo in he life and time he say of this gathering : this buffalo convention of free soiler however low they standard do lay the foundation of a grand superstructure it be a powerful link in the chain of event by which the slave system have be abolish the slave emancipate and the country save from dismemberment in 1851 douglass announce that he sympathy be with the voting abolitionist and thenceforth he support by voice and pen hale fremont and lincoln the successive candidate of the new party douglass 's political defection very much intensify the feeling against he among he former coadjutor the garrisonian with they usual plain speaking do not hesitate to say what they think of douglass they three papers the _ liberator _ the _ standard _ and the _ freeman _ assail douglass fiercely and charge he with treachery inconsistency ingratitude and all the other crime so easily imputed to one who change he opinion garrison and phillip and other of he former associate denounce he as a deserter and attribute he change of heart to mercenary motive douglass seem to have bear himself with rare dignity and moderation in this try period he realize perfectly well that he be on the defensive and that the burden devolve upon he to justify he change of front this he seem to have attempt vigorously but by argument rather than invective even during the height of the indignation against he douglass disclaim any desire to antagonize he former associate he simply realize that there be more than one way to fight slavery -- which know a dozen way to maintain itself -- and have conclude to select the one that seem most practical he be quite willing that he former friend should go they own way no personal assault he write to george thompson the english abolitionist who write to he for a explanation of the charge make against he shall ever lead I to forget that some who in america have often make I the subject of personal abuse be in they own way earnestly work for the abolition of slavery in later year when political action have result in abolition some of these harsh judgment be modify and douglass and he earlier friend meet in peace and harmony the debt he owe to william lloyd garrison he ever delight to acknowledge he speech on the death of garrison breathe in every word the love and honor in which he hold he in one of the last chapter of he _ life and time _ he make a sweeping acknowledgment of he obligation to the man and woman who render he career possible it be my good fortune he write to get out of slavery at the right time to be speedily bring in contact with that circle of highly cultivate man and woman band together for the overthrow of slavery of which william lloyd garrison be the acknowledged leader to these friend earnest courageous inflexible ready to own I as a man and a brother against all the scorn contempt and derision of a slavery-polluted atmosphere i owe my success in life viii event move rapidly in the decade precede the war in 1850 the new fugitive slave law bring discouragement to the heart of the friend of liberty douglass 's utterance during this period breathe the fiery indignation which he feel when the slave-driver 's whip be hear crack over the free state and all citizen be order to aid in the enforcement of this inhuman statute when call upon this law really defeat its own purpose there be thousand of conservative northern man who recognize the constitutional guarantee of slavery and the difficulty of abolish it unless the south should take the initiative be content that it should be preserve intact so long as it remain a local institution but when the attempt be make to make the north wash the south 's dirty linen and transform every man in the northern state into a slave-catcher it work a revulsion of feeling that arouse widespread sympathy for the slave and strengthen the cause of freedom amazingly thousand of escape slave be live in northern community some of they have acquire home have educate they child and in some state have become citizen and voter already social pariah restricted generally to menial labor bear the burden of poverty and prejudice they now have thrust before they the spectre of the kidnapper the slave-catcher with he affidavit and the united state -lrb- supreme -rrb- court which be make by this law the subservient tool of tyranny this law give douglass and the other abolitionist a new text it be a set-back to they cause but they be not entirely dishearten for they see in it the desperate expedient by which it be seek to bolster up a institution already doom by the advance tide of civilization the loss of slave have become a serious drain upon the border state the number of refugee settle in the north be of course largely a matter of estimate runaway slave be not apt to advertise they status but rather to conceal it so that most estimate be more likely to be under than over the truth henry wilson place the number in the free state at twenty thousand there be in boston in 1850 accord to a public statement of theodore parker from four to six hundred and in other new england town notably new bedford the number be large other estimate place the figure much higher mr siebert in he _ underground railroad _ after a careful calculation from the best obtainable datum put the number of fugitive aid in ohio alone at forty thousand in the thirty year precede 1860 and in the same period nine thousand in the city of philadelphium alone which be one of the principal station of the underground railroad and the home of william still whose elaborate work on the _ underground railroad _ give the detail of many thrilling escape in the work of assist runaway slave douglass find congenial employment it be exciting and dangerous but inspiring and soul-satisfying he keep a room in he house always ready for fugitive have with he as many as eleven at a time he would keep they over night pay they fare on the train for canada and give they half a dollar extra and canada to she eternal honor be it say receive these assist emigrant with they fifty cent apiece of alien race debauch by slavery give they welcome and protection refuse to enter into diplomatic relation for they rendition to bondage and speak well of they as man and citizen when henry clay and the other slave -lrb- pro-slavery -rrb- leader denounce they as the most worthless of they class the example of canada may be commend to those person in the united state of little faith who because in thirty year the emancipate race have not equal the white man in achievement be fearful lest nothing good can be expect of they in the stir year of the early fifty douglass lead a busy life he have each week to fill the column of he paper and raise the money to pay its expense add to this he platform work and the underground railroad work which consist not only in personal aid to the fugitive but in raise money to pay they expense and he time be very adequately employ in every anti-slavery meeting he face be welcome and he position as a representative of he own peculiar people be daily strengthen when uncle tom 's cabin in 1852 set the world on fire over the wrong of the slave -- or rather the wrong of slavery for that wonderful book do not portray the negro as the only sufferer from this hoary iniquity -- mr stowe in she new capacity as a champion of liberty conceive the plan of raise a fund for the benefit of the color race and in 1853 invite douglass to visit she at andover massachusett where she consult with he in reference to the establishment of a industrial institute or trade school for color youth with a view to improve they condition in the free state douglass approve heartily of this plan and through he paper make himself its sponsor when later on mr stowe abandon the project douglass be make the subject of some criticism though he be not at all to blame for mr stowe alter plan in we own time the value of such institution have be widely recognize and the success of those at hampton and tuskegee have stimulate anew the interest in industrial education as one important factor in the elevation of the color race in the year from 1853 to 1860 the slave power inspire with divine madness rush headlong toward its doom the arbitrary enforcement of the fugitive slave act the struggle between freedom and slavery in kansas the dred scott decision by which a learn and subtle judge who have it within he power to enlarge the boundary of human liberty and cover he own name with glory deliberately and laboriously summarize and dignified with the sanction of a court of last resort all the most odious prejudice that have restrict the opportunity of the color people the repeal of the missourus compromise the john brown raid the -lrb- 1855 -rrb- assault on -lrb- massachusett antislavery we senator -rrb- charle sumner -- each of these incident have be in itself the subject of more than one volume of these event the dred scott decision be the most disheartening douglass be not proof against the universal gloom and begin to feel that there be little hope of the peaceful solution of the question of slavery it be in one of he darker moment that old sojourner truth whose face appear in so many anti-slavery gathering put she famous question which breathe a sublime and childlike faith in god even when he hand seem heaviest on she people : frederick she ask be god dead the orator pause impressively and then thunder in a voice that thrill he audience with prophetic intimation no god be not dead and therefore it be that slavery must end in blood during this period john brown stamped he name indelibly upon american history it be almost inevitable that a man of the view activity and prominence of douglass should become acquaint with john brown they first meeting however be in 1847 more than ten year before the tragic episode at harper ferry at that time brown be a merchant at springfield massachusett whither douglass be invite to visit he in he _ life and time _ he describe brown as a prosperous merchant who in he home live with the utmost abstemiousness in order that he might save money for the great scheme he be already revolve he wife believe in he and he child observe he with reverence he argument seem to convince all he appeal touch all and he will impress all certainly i never feel myself in the presence of stronger religious influence than while in this man 's house there in he own home where douglass stay as he guest brown outline a plan which in substantially the same form he hold dear to he heart for a decade longer this plan briefly state be to establish camp at certain easily defend point in the allegheny mountain to send emissary down to the plantation in the lowland start in virginium and draw off the slave to these mountain fastness to maintain band of they there if possible as a constant menace to slavery and a example of freedom or if that be impracticable to lead they to canada from time to time by the most available route wild as this plan may seem in the light of the desperate game subsequently play by slavery it do not at the time seem impracticable to such level-headed man as theodore parker and thoma wentworth higginson douglass 's view be very much color by he association with brown but with he usual prudence and foresight he point out the difficulty of this plan from the time of they first meeting the relation of the two man be friendly and confidential captain brown have he scheme ever in mind and succeed in convincing douglass and other that it would subserve a useful purpose -- that even if it result in failure it would stir the conscience of the nation to a juster appreciation of the iniquity of slavery the kansas trouble however turn brown 's energy for a time into a different channel after kansa have be secure to freedom he return with renew ardor to he old project he stay for three week at douglass 's house at rochester and while there carry on a extensive correspondence with sympathizer and supporter and thoroughly demonstrate to all with whom he converse that he be a man of one all-absorbing idea in 1859 very shortly before the raid at harper ferry douglass meet brown by appointment in a abandon stone quarry near chambersburg pennsylvanium john brown be already a outlaw with a price upon he head for a traitor have betray he plan the year before and he have for this reason defer its execution for a year the meeting be surround by all the mystery and conduct with all the precaution befitting a meeting of conspirator brown have change the detail of he former plan and tell douglass of he determination to take harper ferry douglass oppose the measure vehemently point out its certain and disastrous failure brown meet each argument with another and be not to be sway from he purpose they spend more than a day together discuss the detail of the movement when the more practical douglass decline to take part in brown 's attempt the old man throw he arm around he swarthy friend in a manner typical of he friendship for the dark race and say : come with I douglass i will defend you with my life i want you for a special purpose when i strike the bee will begin to swarm and i shall want you to help hive they but douglass would not be persuade he abandonment of he old friend on the eve of a desperate enterprise be criticise by some who as douglass say keep even farther from this brave and heroic man than i do john brown go forth to meet a felon 's fate and wear a martyr 's crown : douglass live to fight the battle of he race for year to come there be room for both and each play the part for which he be best adapt it would have strengthen the cause of liberty very little for douglass to die with brown it be quite likely however that he narrowly escape brown 's fate when the raid at harper ferry have rouse the country douglass with other lead northern man be indict in virginium for complicity in the affair brown 's correspondence have fall into the hand of the virginium authority and certain letter seem to implicate douglass a trial in virginia mean almost certain death governor wise of virginium would have hang he with cheerful alacrity and publicly express he desire to do so douglass with timely warning that extradition papers have be issue for he arrest escape to canada he have previously plan a second visit to england and the john brown affair have delay he departure by some day he sail from quebec November 12 1859 after a most uncomfortable winter voyage of fourteen day douglass find himself again in england a object of marked interest and in very great demand as a speaker six month he spend on the hospitable shore of great britain lecture on john brown on slavery and other subject and renew the friendship of former year be inform of the death of he youngest daughter he cut short he visit which he have mean to extend to france and return to the united state so rapid have be the course of event since he departure that the excitement over the john brown raid have subside the first lincoln campaign be in active progress and the whole country quiver with vague anticipation of the impending crisis which be to end the conflict of irreconcilable principle and sweep slavery out of the path of civilization and progress douglass plunge into the campaign with he accustomed zeal and do what he could to promote the triumph of the republican party lincoln be elect and in a few short month the country find itself in the midst of war god be not dead and slavery be to end in blood ix ever mindful of he people and seek always to promote they welfare douglass be one of those who urge in all he address at this period the abolition of slavery and the arming of the negro as the most effective means of crush the rebellion in 1862 he deliver a series of lecture in new england under the auspices of the recently form emancipation league which contend for abolition as a military necessity the first or conditional emancipation proclamation be issue in September 1862 and shortly afterward douglass publish a pamphlet for circulation in great britain entitle _ the slave 's appeal to great britain _ in which he urge the english people to refuse recognition of the independence of the confederate state he always endeavor in he public utterance to remove the doubt and fear of those who be tempt to leave the negro in slavery because of the difficulty of dispose of they after they become free douglass with the simple direct primitive sense of justice that have always marked he mind take the only true ground for the solution of the race problem of that or any other epoch-that the situation should be meet with equal and exact justice and that he people should be allow to do as they please with themselves subject only to the same great law which apply to other man he be a conspicuous figure at the meeting in tremont temple boston on January 1 1863 when the emancipation proclamation hourly expect by a anxious gathering finally flash over the wire douglass be among the first to suggest the employment of color troops in the union army in spite of all assertion to the contrary he foresee in the war the end of slavery he perceive that by the enlistment of color man not only would the northern arm be strengthen but he people would win a opportunity to exercise one of the highest rights of freeman and by valor on the field of battle to remove some of the stigma that slavery have place upon they he strive through every channel at he command to impress he view upon the country and he effort help to swell the current of opinion which find expression after several intermediate step in the enlistment of two color regiment by governor andrew the famous war governor of massachusett a state foremost in all good work when mr lincoln have grant permission for the recruiting of these regiment douglass issue through he paper a stir appeal which be copy in the principal journal of the union state exhort he people to rally to this call to seize this opportunity to strike a blow at slavery and win the gratitude of the country and the blessing of liberty for themselves and they posterity douglass exert himself personally in procure enlistment he two son -lrb- he youngest and he oldest -rrb- charle and lewi being -lrb- among -rrb- the first in new york to enlist for the two massachusett regiment be recruit all over the north lewi h douglass sergeant-major in the fifty-fourth massachusett be among the foremost on the rampart at fort wagner both these son of douglass survive the war and be now well know and respect citizen of washington dc the fifty-fourth massachusett under the gallant but ill-fated colonel shaw win undying glory in the conflict and the heroic deed of the officer and man of this regiment be fittingly commemorate in the noble monument by st gauden recently erect on boston common to stand as a inspiration of freedom and patriotism for the future and as testimony that a race which for generation have be deprive of arm and liberty could worthily bear the one and defend the other douglass be instrumental in persuade the government to put colored soldier on a equal footing with white soldier both as to pay and protection in the course of these effort he be invite to visit president lincoln he describe this memorable interview in detail in he _ life and time _ the president welcome he with outstretch hand put he at once at he ease and listen patiently and attentively to all that he have to say douglass maintain that color soldier should receive the same pay as white soldier should be protect and exchange as prisoner and should be reward by promotion for deed of valor the president suggest some of the difficulty to be overcome but both he and secretary of war stanton whom douglass also visit assure he that in the end he race should be justly treat stanton before the close of the interview with he promise douglass a commission as assistant adjutant to general lorenzo thoma then recruit color troops in the mississippus valley but stanton evidently change he mind since the commission somewhat to douglass 's chagrin never come to hand when mcclellan have be relieve by grant and the new leader of the union force be fight the stubbornly contest campaign of the wilderness president lincoln again send for douglass to confer with he with reference to bring slave in the rebel state within the union line so that in the event of premature peace as many slave as possible might be free douglass undertake at the president 's suggestion to organize a band of color scout to go among the negro and induce they to enter the union line the plan be never carry out owe to the rapid success of the union arm but the interview greatly impressed douglass with the sincerity of the president 's conviction against slavery and he desire to see the war result in its overthrow what the color race may have owe to the service in such a quarter of such a advocate as douglass brave eloquent high-principled and a example to lincoln of what the enslaved race be capable of can only be imagine that lincoln be deeply impress by these interview be a matter of history douglass support vigorously the nomination of lincoln for a second term and be present at he -lrb- march 4 -rrb- inauguration and a few day later while the inspired word of the inaugural address long bracket with the noblest of human utterance be still ring in he ear he speak at the meeting hold in rochester to mourn the death of the martyred president and make one of he most eloquent and move address it be a time that wring man 's heart and none more than the strong-hearted man 's whose race have find its liberty through he who lay dead at washington slay by the hand of a assassin whom slavery have spawn x with the fall of slavery and the emancipation of the color race the heroic epoch of douglass 's career may be say to have close the text upon which he so long have preach have be expunge from the national bible and he have be a one-text preacher a one-theme orator he feel the natural reaction which come with relief from high mental or physical tension and wonder somewhat sadly what he should do with himself and how he should earn a live the same consideration in vary measure apply to other of the anti-slavery reformer some unable to escape the reform habit turn they attention to different social evil real or imaginary other sufficiently supply with this world goods for they moderate want withdraw from public life douglass be think of buy a farm and retire to rural solitude when a new career open up for he in the lyceum lecture field the north be favorably dispose toward color man they have acquit themselves well during the war and have show become gratitude to they deliverer the once despise abolitionist be now popular hero douglass 's checkered past seem all the more romantic in the light of the brighter present like a novel with a pleasant ending and those who have hang thrillingly upon he word when he denounce slavery now listen with interest to what he have to say upon other topic he speak sometimes on woman suffrage of which he be always a consistent advocate he most popular lecture be one on self-made man another on ethnology in which he seek a scientific basis for he claim for the negro 's equality with the white man be not so popular -- with white people the wave of enthusiasm which have sweep the enfranchised slave into what seem at that time the safe harbor of constitutional right be not after all base on abstract doctrine of equality of intellect but on a inspiring sense of justice -lrb- long dormant under the influence of slavery but thoroughly awaken under the moral stress of the war -rrb- which concede to every man the right of a voice in he own government and the right to a equal opportunity in life to develop such power as he possess however great or small these might be but douglass 's work in direct behalf of he race be not yet entirely do in fact he realize very distinctly the vast amount of work that would be necessary to lift he people up to the level of they enlarged opportunity and as may be gather from some of he publish utterance he foresee that the process would be a long one and that they friend might weary sometimes of wait and that there would be reaction toward slavery which would rob emancipation of much of its value it be the very imminence of such backward step in the shape of various restrictive and oppressive law promptly enact by the old slave state under president johnson 's administration that lead douglass to urge the enfranchisement of the freedman he maintain that in a free country there could be no safe or logical middle ground between the status of freeman and that of serf there have be much criticism because the negro it be say acquire the ballot prematurely there seem imperative reason besides that of political expediency for put the ballot in he hand recent event have demonstrate that this necessity be as great now as then the assumption that negro -- under which generalization be include all man of color regardless of that sympathy to which kinship at least should entitle many of they -- be unfit to have a voice in government be meet by the word of lincoln which have all the weight of a political axiom : no man can be safely trust to govern other man without they consent the contention that a class who constitute half the population of a state shall be entirely unrepresented in its council because forsooth they will there express may affect the government of another class of the same general population be as repugnant to justice and human rights as be the institution of slavery itself such a condition of affair have not the melodramatic and soul-stirring incident of chattel slavery but its effect can be as far-reaching and as debase there have be some manifestation of its possible consequence in the recent outbreak of lynching and other race oppression in the south the practical disfranchisement of the color people in several state and the apparent acquiescence by the supreme court in the attempt annulment by restrictive and oppressive law of the war amendment to the constitution have bring a foretaste of what might be expect should the spirit of the dred scott decision become again the paramount law of the land on February 7 1866 douglass act as chief spokesman of a committee of lead color man of the country who call upon president johnson to urge the importance of enfranchisement mr johnson true to he southern instinct be coldly hostile to the proposition recount all the argument against it and refuse the committee a opportunity to reply the matter be not leave with mr johnson however and the committee turn its attention to the lead republican statesman in whom they find more impressionable material under the leadership of senator sumner wilson wade and other the matter be fully argue in congress the democratic party be in opposition as always in national politics to any measure enlarge the rights or liberty of the color race in September 1866 douglass be elect a delegate from rochester to the national loyalist ' convention at philadelphium call to consider the momentous question of government grow out of the war while he have often attend anti-slavery convention as the representative of a small class of abolitionist he election to represent a large city in a national convention be so novel a departure from establish usage as to provoke surprise and comment all over the country on the way to philadelphium he be wait upon by a committee of other delegate who come to he seat on the train and urge upon he the impropriety of he take a seat as a delegate douglass listen patiently but decline to be move by they argument he reply that he have be duly elect a delegate from rochester and he would represent that city in the convention a procession of the member and friend of the convention be to take place on its opening day douglass be solemnly warn that if he walk in the procession he would probably be mob but he have be mob before more than once and have live through it and he promptly present himself at the place of assembly he reception by he fellow-delegate be not cordial and he seem condemn to march alone in the procession when theodore tilton at that time editor of the _ independent _ pair off with he and march by he side through the street of the quaker city the result be gratify alike to douglass and the friend of liberty and progress he be cheer enthusiastically all along the line of march and become as popular in the convention as he have hitherto be neglect a romantic incident of this march be a pleasant meeting on the street with a daughter of mr lucretia auld the mistress who have treat he kindly during he childhood on the lloyd plantation the auld have always take a interest in douglass 's career -- he have indeed give the family a wide though not altogether enviable reputation in he book and lecture -- and this good lady have follow the procession for mile that she might have the opportunity to speak to she grandfather 's former slave and see he walk in the procession in the convention the ever-ready and imperial douglass as colonel higginson describe he speak in behalf of he race the convention however divide upon the question of negro suffrage and adjourn without decisive action but under president grant 's administration the fourteenth amendment be pass and by the solemn sanction of the constitution the ballot be confer upon the black man upon the same term as those upon which it be enjoy by the whites xi it be perhaps fitting before we take leave of douglass to give some estimate of the remarkable oratory which give he he hold upon the past generation for while he labor as editor and in other direction be of great value to the cause of freedom it be upon he genius as a orator that he fame must ultimately rest while douglass 's color put he in a class by himself among great orator and although he slave past throw around he a element of romance that add charm to he eloquence these be mere incidental element of distinction the north be full of fugitive slave and more than one have passionately proclaimed he wrong there be several color orator who stand high in the council of the abolitionist and do good service for the cause of humanity douglass possess in large measure the physical equipment most impressive in a orator he be a man of magnificent figure tall strong he head crown with a mass of hair which make a striking element of he appearance he have deep-set and flash eye a firm well-moulded chin a countenance somewhat severe in repose but capable of a wide range of expression he voice be rich and melodious and of great carry power one writer who know he in the early day of he connection with the abolitionist say of he in johnson 's _ sketch of lynn _ : he be not then the polished orator he have since become but even at that early date he give promise of the grand part he be to play in the conflict which be to end in the destruction of the system that have so long curse he race he be more than six foot in height and he majestic form as he rise to speak straight as a arrow muscular yet lithe and graceful he flash eye and more than all he voice that rival webster 's in its richness and in the depth and sonorousness of its cadence make up such a ideal of a orator as the listener never forget and they never forget he burning word he pathos nor the rich play of he humor the poet william howitt say of he on he departure from england in 1847 he have appear in this country before the most accomplished audience who be surprise not only at he talent but at he extraordinary information in ireland he be introduce as the black o'connell -- a high compliment for o'connell be at that time the idol of the irish people in scotland they call he the black douglass -lrb- dougla -rrb- after he prototype in _ the lady of the lake _ because of he fìre and vigor in rochester he be call the swarthy ajax from he indignant denunciation and defiance of the fugitive slave law of 1850 which come like a flash of lightning to blast the hope of the anti-slavery people douglass possess in unusual degree the faculty of sway he audience sometimes against they maturer judgment there be something in the argument from first principle which if present with force and eloquence never fail to appeal to those who be not blind by self-interest or deep-seated prejudice douglass 's argument be that of the declaration of independence -- that _ all _ man be create equal that they be endow by they creator with certain inalienable rights that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights government be institute among man derive they just power from the _ consent of the govern _ the writer may be pardon for this quotation for there be time when we seem to forget that now and here no less than in ancient rome eternal vigilance be the price of liberty douglass brush aside all sophistry about constitutional guarantee and vested rights and inferior race and have postulate the right of man to be free maintain that negro be man and offer himself as a proof of he assertion -- a argument that few have the temerity to deny if it be answer that he be only half a negro he would reply that slavery make no such distinction and as a still more irrefutable argument would point to he friend samuel r ward who often accompany he on the platform -- a eloquent and effective orator of whom wendell phillip say that he be so black that if he would shut he eye one could not see he it be difficult for a auditor to avoid assent to such argument present with all the force and fire of genius relieve by a ready wit a contagious humor and a tear-compelling power rarely excel as a speaker say one of he contemporary he have few equal it be not declamation but oratory power of description he watch the tide of discussion and dash into it at once with all the tact of the forum or the bar he have art argument sarcasm pathos -- all that first-rate man show in they master effort he readiness be admirably illustrate in the run debate with captain rynder a ward politician and gambler of new york who lead a gang of rough with the intention of break up the meeting of the american anti-slavery society in new york city may 7 1850 the newspaper have announce the propose meeting in language calculate to excite riot rynder pack the meeting with rowdy and himself occupy a seat on the platform some remark by mr garrison the first speaker provoke a demonstration of hostility when this be finally quell by a promise to permit one of the rynder party to reply mr garrison finish he speech he be follow by a prosy individual who brand the negro as brother to the monkey douglass perceive that the speaker be weary even he own friend intervene at a opportune moment capture the audience by a timely display of wit and then improve the occasion by a long and effective speech when douglass offer himself as a refutation of the last speaker 's argument rynder reply that douglass be half white douglass thereupon greet rynder as he half-brother and make this expression the catchword of he speech when rynder interrupt from time to time he be silence with a laugh he appear to have be a somewhat philosophic scoundrel with a appreciation of humor that permit the meeting to proceed to a orderly close douglass 's speech be the feature of the evening that gifted man say garrison in whose _ life and time _ a graphic description of this famous meeting be give effectually put to shame he assailant by he wit and eloquence a speech deliver by douglass at concord new hampshire be thus describe by another writer : he gradually let out the outraged humanity that be labor in he in indignant and terrible speech there be great oratory in he speech but more of dignity and earnestness than what we call eloquence he be a insurgent slave take hold on the rights of speech and charge on he tyrant the bondage of he race in holland 's biography of douglass extract be give from letter of distinguished contemporary who know the orator colonel tw higginson write thus : i have hardly hear he equal in grasp upon a audience in dramatic presentation in striking at the pith of a ethical question and in single -lrb- signal -rrb- illustration and example another write in reference to the impromptu speech deliver at the meeting at rochester on the death of lincoln : i have hear webster and clay in they best moment chan and beecher in they highest inspiration i never hear truer eloquence i never see profounder impression the publish speech of douglass of which example may be find scatter throughout he various autobiography reveal something of the power thus characterize though like other print speech they lose by be put in type but one can easily imagine they effect upon a sympathetic or receptive audience when deliver with flash eye and deep-toned resonant voice by a man whose complexion and past history give he the highest right to describe and denounce the iniquity of slavery and contend for the rights of a race in later year when brighter day have dawn for he people and age have dim the recollection of he suffering and temper he animosity he become more charitable to he old enemy but in the vigor of he manhood with the memory of he wrong and those of he race fresh upon he he possess that indispensable quality of the true reformer : he go straight to the root of the evil and make no admission and no compromise slavery for he be conceive in greed bear in sin cradle in shame and worthy of utter and relentless condemnation he have the quality of directness and simplicity when collin would have turn the abolition influence to the support of a communistic scheme douglass oppose it vehemently slavery be the evil they be fight and they cause would be render still more unpopular if they run after strange god when garrison plead for the rights of man when phillip with golden eloquence preach the doctrine of humanity and progress man approve and applaud when parker paint the moral baseness of the time man acquiesce shamefacedly when chan preach the gospel of love they wish the dream might become a reality but when douglass tell the story of he wrong and those of he brethren in bondage they feel that here indeed be slavery embody here be a argument for freedom that could not be gainsay that the race that could produce in slavery such a man as frederick douglass must surely be worthy of freedom what douglass 's platform utterance in later year lack of the vehemence and fire of he earlier speech they make up in wisdom and mature judgment there be a note of exultation in he speech just after the war jehovah have triumph he people be free he have see the red sea of blood open and let they pass and engulf the enemy who pursue they among the most noteworthy of douglass 's later address be the oration at the unveiling of the freedman 's monument to abraham lincoln in washington in 1876 which may be find in he _ life and time _ the address on decoration day new york 1878 he eulogy on wendell phillip print in austin 's _ life and time of wendell phillip _ and the speech on the death of garrison June 1879 he lecture in the parker fraternity course in boston deliver numerous address to gathering of color man speak at public dinner and woman suffrage meeting and retain he hold upon the interest of the public down to the very day of he death xii with the full enfranchisement of he people douglass enter upon what may be call the third epoch of he career that of fruition not every worthy life receive its reward in this world but douglass have fight the good fight be now single out by virtue of he prominence for various honor and emolument at the hand of the public he be urge by many friend to take up he residence in some southern district and run for congress but from modesty or some doubt of he fitness -- which one would think he need not have feel -- and the consideration that he people need a advocate at the north to keep alive there the friendship and zeal for liberty that have accomplish so much for he race he do not adopt the suggestion in 1860 -lrb- 1870 -rrb- douglass move to washington and begin -lrb- take over -rrb- the publication of the _ new national era _ a weekly paper devote to the interest of the color race the venture do not receive the support hope for and the paper be turn over to douglass 's two -lrb- oldest -rrb- son lewi and frederick and be finally abandon -lrb- in 1874 -rrb- douglass have sink about ten thousand dollar in the enterprise later newspaper for circulation among the color people have prove more successful and it ought to be a matter of interest that the race which thirty year ago could not support one publication edit by its most prominent man now maintain several hundred newspaper which make they appearance regularly in 1871 douglass be elect president of the freedman bank this ill-starred venture be then apparently in the full tide of prosperity and promise to be a great lever in the uplifting of the submerge race douglass soon after he election as president discover the insolvency of the institution and insist that it be close up the negro be in the hand of he friend and be destine to suffer for they mistake as well as he own other honor that fall to douglass be less empty than the presidency of a bankrupt bank in 1870 he be appoint by president grant a member of the santo domingo commission the object of which be to arrange term for the annexation of the mulatto republic to the union some of the best friend of the color race among they senator sumner oppose this step but douglass maintain that to receive santo domingo as a state would add to its strength and importance the scheme ultimately fall through whether for the good or ill of santo domingo can best be judge when the result of more recent annexation scheme -lrb- 1898 : puerto rico guam the philippine hawaii and _ de facto _ cuba -rrb- become apparent douglass go to santo domingo on a american man-of-war in the company of three other commissioner in he _ life and time _ he draw a please contrast between some of he earlier experience in travel and the term of cordial intimacy upon which as the representative of a nation which a few year before have deny he a passport he be now receive in the company of able and distinguished gentleman on he return to the united state douglass receive from president grant a appointment as member of the legislative council or upper house of the legislature of the district of columbium where he serve for a short time until other engagement demand he resignation -lrb- one of -rrb- he son -lrb- s -rrb- be appoint to fill out he term to this appointment douglass owe the title of honorable subsequently apply to he in 1872 douglass preside over and address a convention of color man at new orlean and urge they to support president grant for renomination he be elect a presidential elector for new york and on the meeting of the electoral college in albany after grant 's triumphant re-election receive a further mark of confidence and esteem in the appointment at the hand of he fellow-elector to carry the sealed vote to washington douglass seek no personal reward for he service in this campaign but to he influence be due the appointment of several of he friend to higher position than have ever theretofore be hold in this country by color man when r b haye be nominate for president douglass again take the stump and receive as a reward the honorable and lucrative office of marshal of the united state for the district of columbium this appointment be not agreeable to the white people of the district whose sympathy be largely pro-slavery and a effort be make to have its confirmation defeat in the senate the appointment be confirm however and douglass serve he term of four year in spite of numerous effort to bring about he removal in 1879 the hard condition under which the negro in the south be compel to live lead to a movement to promote a exodus of the color people to the north and west in the search for better opportunity the white people of the south alarmed at the prospect of lose they labor be glad to welcome douglass when he go among they to oppose this movement which he at that time consider detrimental to the true interest of the color population under the garfield administration douglass be appoint in may 1881 recorder of deed for the district of columbium he hold this very lucrative office through the term of president garfìeld and arthur and until remove by president cleveland in 1886 have serve nearly a year after cleveland 's inauguration in 1889 he be appoint by president harrison as minister resident and consul-general to the republic of haytus in which capacity he act until 1891 when he resign and return permanently to washington the writer have hear he speak with enthusiasm of the substantial progress make by the haytian in the art of government and civilization and with indignation of what he consider slander against the island due to ignorance or prejudice when it be suggest to douglass that the haytian be give to revolution as a mode of express disapproval of they ruler he reply that a four year ' rebellion have be fight and two president assassinate in the united state during a comparatively peaceful political period in haytus he last official connection with the black republic be at the world 's columbian exposition at chicago in 1893 where he act as agent in charge of the haytian building and the very creditable exhibit therein contain he stately figure which age have not bow he strong dark face and he head of thick white hair make he one of the conspicuous feature of the exposition and many a visitor take advantage of the occasion to recall old acquaintance make in the stir anti-slavery day in 1878 he revisit the lloyd plantation in maryland where he have spend part of he youth and a affect meeting take place between he and thoma auld whom he have once call master once in former year he have be seek out by the good lady who in he childhood have teach he to read nowhere more than in he own account of these meeting do the essentially affectionate and forgiving character of douglass and he race become apparent and one can not refrain from think that a different state of affair might prevail in the southern state if other method than those at present in vogue be use to regulate the relation between the two race and they various admixture that make up the southern population in June 1879 a bronze bust of douglass be erect in sibley hall of rochester university as a tribute to one who have shed lustre on the city in 1882 occur the death of douglass 's first wife whom he have marry in new york immediately after he escape from slavery and who have be he faithful companion through so many year of stress and struggle in the same year he _ life and time _ be publish in 1884 he marry miss helen pitt a white woman of culture and refinement there be some criticism of this step by white people who do not approve of the admixture of the race and by color person who think they leader have slight he own people when he overlook the many worthy and accomplished woman among they but douglass to the extent that he notice these stricture at all declare that he have devote he life to break down the color line and that he do not know any more effectual way to accomplish it that he be white by half he blood and as he have give most of he life to he mother race he claim the right to dispose of the remnant as he see fit the latter year of he life be spend at he beautiful home know as cedar hill on anacostium height near washington amid all that which should accompany old age as honor love obedience troops of friend he possess strong and attractive social quality and he home form a mecca for the advanced and aspiring of he race he be a skilful violinist and derive great pleasure from the valuable instrument he possess a wholesome
