before i sign on that there be some funny yarn float round about she but i be pretty nearly on the beach and too jolly anxious to get away to worry about trifle besides by all account she be right enough so far as grub and treatment go when i ask fellow to give it a name they generally could not all they could tell I be that she be unlucky and make thunder long passage and have no more than a fair share of dirty weather also that she have twice have the stick blow out of she and she cargo shift besides all these a heap of other thing that might happen to any packet and would not be comfortable to run into still they be the ordinary thing and i be willing enough to risk they to get home all the same if i have be give the chance i should have ship in some other vessel as a matter of preference when i take my bag down i find that they have sign on the rest of the crowd you see the home lot clear out when they get into ` frisco that be all except one young fellow a cockney who have stick by the ship in port he tell I afterwards when i get to know he that he intend to draw a pay-day out of she whether any one else do or not the first night i be in she i find that it be common talk among the other fellow that there be something queer about the ship they speak of she as if it be a accept fact that she be haunt yet they all treat the matter as a joke all that be except the young cockney -- william -- who instead of laugh at they jest on the subject seem to take the whole matter seriously this make I rather curious i begin to wonder whether there be after all some truth underlie the vague story i have hear and i take the first opportunity to ask he whether he have any reason for believe that there be anything in the yarn about the ship at first he be incline to be a bit offish but presently he come round and tell I that he do not know of any particular incident which could be call unusual in the sense in which i mean yet that at the same time there be lot of little thing which if you put they together make you think a bit for instance she always make such long passage and have so much dirty weather -- nothing but that and calm and head wind then other thing happen sail that he know himself have be properly stow be always blow adrift _ at night _ and then he say a thing that surprise I there be too many bloomin ' shadder about this ` ere packet they get onter yer nerve like nothin ' as ever i see before in I nat ` ral he blurt it all out in a heap and i turn round and look at he too many shadow i say what on earth do you mean but he refuse to explain himself or tell I anything further -- just shake he head stupidly when i question he he seem to have take a sudden sulky fit i feel certain that he be act dense purposely i believe the truth of the matter be that he be in a way ashamed of have let himself go like he have in speak out he thought about shadder that type of man may think thing at time but he do not often put they into word anyhow i see it be no use ask any further question so i let the matter drop there yet for several day afterwards i catch myself wonder at time what the fellow have mean by shadder we leave ` frisco next day with a fine fair wind that seem a bit like put the stopper on the yarn i have hear about the ship 's ill luck and yet -- he hesitate a moment and then go on again for the first couple of week out nothing unusual happen and the wind still hold fair i begin to feel that i have be rather lucky after all in the packet into which i have be shunt most of the other fellow give she a good name and there be a pretty general opinion grow among the crowd that it be all a silly yarn about she be haunt and then just when i be settle down to thing something happen that open my eye no end it be in the eight to twelve watch and i be sit on the step on the starboard side lead up to the fo ` cas ` le head the night be fine and there be a splendid moon away aft i hear the timekeeper strike four bell and the look-out a old fellow name jaskett answer he as he let go the bell lanyard he catch sight of I where i sit quietly smoking he lean over the rail and look down at I that you jessop he ask i believe it be i reply we would ` ave we gran ` mother a ' all the rest of we petticoated relash ` ns comin ' to sea if ` twere always like this he remark reflectively -- indicate with a sweep of he pipe and hand the calmness of the sea and sky i see no reason for deny that and he continue : if this ole packet be ` aunt as some on 'em seem to think well all as i can say be let I ` ave the luck to tumble across another of the same sort good grub a ' duff fer sunday a ' a decent crowd of 'em aft a ' everythin ' comfertable like so as yer can feel yer know where yer be as fer ` er bein ' ` aunt that be all ` ellish nonsense i have come ` cross lot of 'em before as be say to be ` aunt a ' so some on 'em be but 'twa not with ghostess one packet i be in they be that bad yer could not sleep a wink in yer watch below until yer would ` ad every stitch out yer bunk a ' ` ad a reg ` lar ` unt sometimes -- at that moment the relief one of the ordinary seaman go up the other ladder on to the fo ` cas ` le head and the old chap turn to ask he why the ` ell he would not relieved he a bit smarter the ordinary make some reply but what it be i do not catch for abruptly away aft my rather sleepy gaze have light on something altogether extraordinary and outrageous it be nothing less than the form of a man step inboard over the starboard rail a little abaft the main rigging i stand up and catch at the handrail and stare behind I someone speak it be the look-out who have come down off the fo ` cas ` le head on he way aft to report the name of he relief to the second mate what be it mate he ask curiously see my intent attitude the thing whatever it be have disappear into the shadow on the lee side of the deck nothing i reply shortly for i be too bewildered then at what my eye have just show I to say any more i want to think the old shellback glance at I but only mutter something and go on he way aft for a minute perhaps i stand there watch but could see nothing then i walk slowly aft as far as the after end of the deck house from there i could see most of the main deck but nothing show except of course the move shadow of the rope and spar and sail as they swing to and fro in the moonlight the old chap who have just come off the look-out have return forrard again and i be alone on that part of the deck and then all at once as i stand peer into the shadow to leeward i remember what william have say about there be too many shadder i have be puzzle to understand he real meaning then i have no difficulty _ now _ there _ be _ too many shadow yet shadow or no shadow i realize that for my own peace of mind i must settle once and for all whether the thing i have seem to see step aboard out of the ocean have be a reality or simply a phantom as you might say of my imagination my reason say it be nothing more than imagination a rapid dream -- i must have doze but something deeper than reason tell I that this be not so i put it to the test and go straight in amongst the shadow -- there be nothing i grow bolder my common sense tell I i must have fancy it all i walk over to the mainmast and look behind the pinrail that partly surround it and down into the shadow of the pump but here again be nothing then i go in under the break of the poop it be darker under there than out on deck i look up both side of the deck and see that they be bare of anything such as i look for the assurance be comforting i glance at the poop ladder and remember that nothing could have go up there without the second mate or the time-keeper see it then i lean my back up against the bulkshead and think the whole matter over rapidly suck at my pipe and keep my glance about the deck i conclude my think and say no out loud then something occur to I and i say unless -- and go over to the starboard bulwark and look over and down into the sea but there be nothing but sea and so i turn and make my way forrard my common sense have triumph and i be convince that my imagination have be play trick with I i reach the door on the portside lead into the fo ` cas ` le and be about to enter when something make I look behind as i do so i have a shaker away aft a dim shadowy form stand in the wake of a sway belt of moonlight that sweep the deck a bit abaft the main-mast it be the same figure that i have just be attribute to my fancy i will admit that i feel more than startled i be quite a bit frightened i be convince now that it be no mere imaginary thing it be a human figure and yet with the flicker of the moonlight and the shadow chase over it i be unable to say more than that then as i stand there irresolute and funky i get the thought that someone be act the goat though for what reason or purpose i never stop to consider i be glad of any suggestion that my common sense assure I be not impossible and for the moment i feel quite relieved that side to the question have not present itself to I before i begin to pluck up courage i accuse myself of get fanciful otherwise i should have tumble to it earlier and then funnily enough in spite of all my reasoning i be still afraid of go aft to discover who that be stand on the lee side of the maindeck yet i feel that if i shirk it i be only fit to be dump overboard and so i go though not with any great speed as you can imagine i have go half the distance and still the figure remain there motionless and silent -- the moonlight and the shadow play over it with each roll of the ship i think i try to be surprise if it be one of the fellow play the fool he must have hear I coming and why do not he scoot while he have the chance and where could he have hide himself before all these thing i ask myself in a rush with a queer mixture of doubt and belief and you know in the meantime i be draw nearer i have pass the house and be not twelve pace distant when abruptly the silent figure make three quick stride to the port rail and _ climb over it into the sea _ i rush to the side and stare over but nothing meet my gaze except the shadow of the ship sweep over the moonlit sea how long i stare down blankly into the water it would be impossible to say certainly for a good minute i feel blank -- just horribly blank it be such a beastly confirmation of the _ unnaturalness _ of the thing i have conclude to be only a sort of brain fancy i seem for that little time deprive you know of the power of coherent thought i suppose i be daze -- mentally stunned in a way as i have say a minute or so must have go while i have be stare into the dark of the water under the ship 's side then i come suddenly to my ordinary self the second mate be sing out : lee fore brace i go to the brace like a chap in a dream ii what tammy the ` prentice see the next morning in my watch below i have a look at the place where that strange thing have come aboard and leave the ship but i find nothing unusual and no clue to help I to understand the mystery of the strange man for several day after that all go quietly though i prowl about the deck at night try to discover anything fresh that might tend to throw some light on the matter i be careful to say nothing to any one about the thing i have see in any case i feel sure i should only have be laugh at several night pass away in this manner and i be no nearer to a understanding of the affair and then in the middle watch something happen it be my wheel tammy one of the first voyage ` prentice be keep time -- walk up and down the lee side of the poop the second mate be forrard lean over the break of the poop smoking the weather still continue fine and the moon though decline be sufficiently powerful to make every detail about the poop stand out distinctly three bell have go and i 'll admit i be feel sleepy indeed i believe i must have doze for the old packet steer very easily and there be precious little to do beyond give she a odd speak now and again and then all at once it seem to I that i hear someone call my name softly i could not be certain and first i glance forrard to where the second stand smoking and from he i look into the binnacle the ship 's head be right on she course and i feel easier then suddenly i hear it again there be no doubt about it this time and i glance to leeward there i see tammy reach over the steering gear he hand out in the act of try to touch my arm i be about to ask he what the devil he want when he hold up he finger for silence and point forrard along the lee side of the poop in the dim light he face show palely and he seem much agitate for a few seconds i stare in the direction he indicate but could see nothing what be it i ask in a undertone after a couple of moment ' further ineffectual peer i can not see anything h ` sh he mutter hoarsely without look in my direction then all at once with a quick little gasp he spring across the wheel-box and stand beside I tremble he gaze appear to follow the movement of something i could not see i must say that i be startle he movement have show such terror and the way he stare to leeward make I think he see something uncanny what the deuce be up with you i ask sharply and then i remember the second mate i glance forrard to where he lounge he back be still towards we and he have not see tammy then i turn to the boy for goodness sake get to looard before the second see you i say if you want to say anything say it across the wheel-box you have be dream even as i speak the little beggar catch at my sleeve with one hand and point across to the log-reel with the other scream : he be come he be come -- at this instant the second mate come run aft singing out to know what be the matter then suddenly crouch under the rail near the log-reel i see something that look like a man but so hazy and unreal that i could scarcely say i see anything yet like a flash my thought rip back to the silent figure i have see in the flicker of the moonlight a week earlier the second mate reach I and i point dumbly and yet as i do so it be with the knowledge that _ he _ would not be able to see what i saw -lrb- queer be not it -rrb- and then almost in a breath i lose sight of the thing and become aware that tammy be hug my knee the second continue to stare at the log-reel for a brief instant then he turn to I with a sneer be asleep the pair of you i suppose then without wait for my denial he tell tammy to go to hell out of it and stop he noise or he would boot he off the poop after that he walk forward to the break of the poop and light he pipe again -- walk forward and aft every few minute and eye I at time i think with a strange half-doubtful half-puzzled look later as soon as i be relieved i hurry down to the ` prentice 's berth i be anxious to speak to tammy there be a dozen question that worry I and i be in doubt what i ought to do i find he crouch on a sea-chest he knee up to he chin and he gaze fix on the doorway with a frightened stare i put my head into the berth and he give a gasp then he see who it be and he face relax something of its strained expression he say : come in in a low voice which he try to steady and i step over the wash-board and sit down on a chest face he what be _ it _ he ask put he foot down on to the deck and lean forward for god 's sake tell I what it be he voice have rise and i put up my hand to warn he h ` sh i say you 'll wake the other fellow he repeat he question but in a lower tone i hesitate before answer he i feel all at once that it might be better to deny all knowledge -- to say i have not see anything unusual i think quickly and make answer on the turn of the moment what be _ what _ i say that be just the thing i have come to ask you a pretty pair of fool you make of the two of we up on the poop just now with you hysterical tomfoolery i conclude my remark in a tone of anger i do not he answer in a passionate whisper you know i do not you know _ you _ see it yourself you point it out to the second mate i see you the little beggar be nearly cry between fear and vexation at my assume unbelief rot i reply you know jolly well you be sleep in you time-keeping you dream something and wake up suddenly you be off you chump i be determine to reassure he if possible though goodness i want assurance myself if he have know of that other thing i have see down on the maindeck what then i be not asleep any more than you be he say bitterly and you know it you be just fool I the ship 's haunt what i say sharply she be haunt he say again she be haunt who say so i inquire in a tone of unbelief i do and you _ know _ it everybody know it but they do not more than half believe it i do not until tonight damned rot i answer that be all a bloom old shellback 's yarn she be no more haunted than i be it be not damned rot he reply totally unconvinced and it be not a old shellback 's yarn why will not you say you see it he cry grow almost tearfully excite and raise he voice again i warn he not to wake the sleeper why will not you say that you see it he repeat i get up from the chest and go towards the door you be a young idiot i say and i should advise you not to go gas about like this round the deck take my tip and turn-in and get a sleep you be talk dotty tomorrow you 'll perhaps feel what a unholy ass you have make of yourself i step over the washboard and leave he i believe he follow I to the door to say something further but i be half-way forward by then for the next couple of day i avoid he as much as possible take care never to let he catch I alone i be determine if possible to convince he that he have be mistake in suppose that he have see anything that night yet after all it be little enough use as you will soon see for on the night of the second day there be a further extraordinary development that make denial on my part useless iii the man up the main it occur in the first watch just after six bell i be forward sit on the fore-hatch no one be about the maindeck the night be exceedingly fine and the wind have drop away almost to nothing so that the ship be very quiet suddenly i hear the second mate 's voice -- in the main-rigging there who be that go aloft i sit up on the hatch and listen there succeed a intense silence then the second 's voice come again he be evidently get wild do you damn well hear I what the hell be you do up there come down i rise to my foot and walk up to wind ` ard from there i could see the break of the poop the second mate be stand by the starboard ladder he appear to be look up at something that be hide from I by the topsail as i stare he break out again : hell and damnation you blast sojer come down when i tell you he stamp on the poop and repeat he order savagely but there be no answer i start to walk aft what have happen who have go aloft who would be fool enough to go without be tell and then all at once a thought come to I the figure tammy and i have see have the second mate see something -- someone i hurry on and then stop suddenly in the same moment there come the shrill blast of the second 's whistle he be whistle for the watch and i turn and run to the fo ` cas ` le to rouse they out another minute and i be hurry aft with they to see what be want he voice meet we half-way : up the main some of you smartly now and find out who that damned fool be up there see what mischief he be up to i i sir several of the man sing out and a couple jump into the weather rigging i join they and the rest be proceed to follow but the second shout for some to go up to leeward -- in case the fellow try to get down that side as i follow the other two aloft i hear the second mate tell tammy whose time-keeping it be to get down on to the maindeck with the other ` prentice and keep a eye on the fore and aft stay he may try down one of they if he be corner i hear he explain if you see anything just sing out for I right away tammy hesitate well say the second mate sharply nothing sir say tammy and go down on to the maindeck the first man to wind ` ard have reach the futtock shroud he head be above the top and he be take a preliminary look before venture higher see anythin ' jock ask plummer the man next above I na ' say jock tersely and climb over the top and so disappear from my sight the fellow ahead of I follow he reach the futtock rigging and stop to expectorate i be close at he heel and he look down to I what be up anyway he say what be ' e see ` oo be we chasin ' after i say i do not know and he swing up into the topmast rigging i follow on the chap on the lee side be about level with we under the foot of the topsail i could see tammy and the other ` prentice down on the maindeck look upward the fellow be a bit excited in a sort of subdue way though i be incline to think there be far more curiosity and perhaps a certain consciousness of the strangeness of it all i know that look to leeward there be a tendancy to keep well together in which i sympathised must be a bloomin ' stowaway one of the man suggest i grab at the idea instantly perhaps -- and then in a moment i dismiss it i remember how that first thing have step over the rail _ into the sea that _ matter could not be explain in such a manner with regard to this i be curious and anxious i have see nothing this time what could the second mate have see i wonder be we chase fancy or be there really someone -- something real among the shadow above we my thought return to that thing tammy and i have see near the log-reel i remember how incapable the second mate have be of see anything then i remember how natural it have seem that he should not be able to see i catch the word stowaway again after all that might explain away _ this _ affair it would -- my train of thought be break suddenly one of the man be shout and gesticulate i see ` im i see ` im he be point upward over we head where say the man above I where i be look up for all that i be worth i be conscious of a certain sense of relief it be _ real _ then i say to myself i screw my head round and look along the yard above we yet still i could see nothing nothing except shadow and patch of light down on deck i catch the second mate 's voice have you get he he be shout not yet zur sing out the lowest man on the lee side we see ` im sir add quoin i do not i say there ' e be agen he say we have reach the t ` gallant rigging and he be point up to the royal yard ye be a fule quoin that be what ye be the voice come from above it be jock 's and there be a burst of laughter at quoin 's expense i could see jock now he be stand in the rig just below the yard he have go straight away up while the rest of we be moon over the top ye be a fule quoin he say again and i be think the second 's juist as saft he begin to descend then there be no one i ask na ' he say briefly as we reach the deck the second mate run down off the poop he come towards we with a expectant air you have get he he ask confidently there be not anyone i say what he nearly shout you be hide something he continue angrily and glance from one to another out with it who be it we be hide nothing i reply speak for the lot there be no one up there the second look round upon we be i a fool he ask contemptuously there be a assent silence i see he myself he continue tammy here see he he be not over the top when i first spot he there be no mistake about it it be all damned rot say he be not there well he be not sir i answer jock go right up to the royal yard the second mate say nothing in immediate reply but go aft a few step and look up the main then he turn to the two ` prentice sure you two boy do not see anyone come down from the main he inquire suspiciously yes sir they answer together anyway i hear he mutter to himself i would have spot he myself if he have have you any idea sir who it be you see i ask at this juncture he look at I keenly no he say he think for a few moment while we all stand about in silence wait for he to let we go by the holy poker he exclaim suddenly but i ought to have think of that before he turn and eye we individually you be all here he ask yes sir we say in a chorus i could see that he be count we then he speak again all of you man stay here where you be tammy you go into _ you _ place and see if the other fellow be in they bunk then come and tell I smartly now the boy go and he turn to the other ` prentice you get along forrard to the fo ` cas ` le he say count the other watch then come aft and report to I as the youngster disappear along the deck to the fo ` cas ` le tammy return from he visit to the glory hole to tell the second mate that the other two ` prentice be sound asleep in they bunk whereupon the second bundle he off to the carpenter 's and sailmaker 's berth to see whether they be turned-in while he be go the other boy come aft and report that all the man be in they bunk and asleep sure the second ask he quite sir he answer the second mate make a quick gesture go and see if the steward be in he berth he say abruptly it be plain to I that he be tremendously puzzle you have something to learn yet mr second mate i think to myself then i fall to wonder to what conclusion he would come a few seconds later tammy return to say that the carpenter sailmaker and doctor be all turned-in the second mate mutter something and tell he to go down into the saloon to see whether the first and third mate by any chance be not in they berth tammy start off then halt shall i have a look into the old man 's place sir while i be down there he inquire no say the second mate do what i tell you and then come and tell I if anyone 's to go into the captain 's cabin it be get to be I tammy say i i sir and skip away up on to the poop while he be go the other ` prentice come up to say that the steward be in he berth and that he want to know what the hell he be fool round he part of the ship for the second mate say nothing for nearly a minute then he turn to we and tell we we might go forrard as we move off in a body and talk in undertone tammy come down from the poop and go up to the second mate i hear he say that the two mate be in they berth asleep then he add as if it be a afterthought -- so be the old man i think i tell you -- the second mate begin i do not sir tammy say he cabin door be open the second mate start to go aft i catch a fragment of a remark he be make to tammy -- account for the whole crew i be -- he go up on to the poop i do not catch the rest i have loiter a moment now however i hurry after the other as we near the fo ` cas ` le one bell go and we rouse out the other watch and tell they what jinks we have be up to i rec ` on ' e must be rocky one of the man remark not ` im say another ` e 's bin ` avin ' forty wink on the break a ' dreem ` be mother-en-lore ` ad come on ` er visit friendly like there be some laughter at this suggestion and i catch myself smile along with the rest though i have no reason for share they belief that there be nothing in it all might ` ave be a stowaway yer know i hear quoin the one who have suggest it before remark to one of the ab 's name stubbin -- a short rather surly-looking chap might have be hell return stubbin stowaway hai not such fool as all that i dunno say the first i wish i ` ad arsk the second what ' e think about it i do not think it be a stowaway somehow i say chip in what would a stowaway want aloft i guess he would be try more for the steward 's pantry you bet he would hevry time say stubbin he light he pipe and suck at it slowly i do not hunderstand it all ther same he remark after a moment 's silence neither do i i say and after that i be quiet for a while listen to the run of conversation on the subject presently my glance fall upon william the man who have speak to I about shadder he be sit in he bunk smoking and make no effort to join in the talk i go across to he what do you think of it william i ask do _ you _ think the second mate really see anything he look at I with a sort of gloomy suspicion but say nothing i feel a trifle annoy by he silence but take care not to show it after a few moment i go on do you know william i be begin to understand what you mean that night when you say there be too many shadow wot yer mean he say pull he pipe from out of he mouth and fairly surprise into answer what i say of course i say there _ be _ too many shadow he sit up and lean forward out from he bunk extend he hand and pipe he eye plainly show he excitement ` ave yer see -- he hesitate and look at I struggle inwardly to express himself well i prompt for perhaps a minute he try to say something then he expression altered suddenly from doubt and something else more indefinite to a pretty grim look of determination he speak i be blime he say ef i do not tike er piy-diy out of ` er shadders or no shadder i look at he with astonishment what be it get to do with you get a pay-day out of she i ask he nod he head with a sort of stolid resolution look ` ere he say i wait ther crowd clear he indicate with he hand and pipe towards the stern you mean in ` frisco i say yus he reply ` a withart er cent of ther piy i styied i comprehend he suddenly you think they see i hesitate then i say shadow he nod but say nothing and so they all bunk he nod again and begin tap out he pipe on the edge of he bunk-board and the officer and the skipper i ask fresh un he say and get out of he bunk for eight bell be striking iv _ the fool with the sail _ it be on the Friday night that the second mate have the watch aloft look for the man up the main and for the next five day little else be talk about though with the exception of william tammy and myself no one seem to think of treat the matter seriously perhaps i should not exclude quoin who still persist on every occasion that there be a stowaway aboard as for the second mate i have very little doubt _ now _ but that he be begin to realize there be something deeper and less understandable than he have at first dream of yet all the same i know he have to keep he guess and half-formed opinion pretty well to himself for the old man and the first mate chaff he unmercifully about he bogy this i get from tammy who have hear they both rag he during the second dog-watch the follow day there be another thing tammy tell I that show how the second mate bother about he inability to understand the mysterious appearance and disappearance of the man he have see go aloft he have make tammy give he every detail he could remember about the figure we have see by the log-reel what be more the second have not even affect to treat the matter lightly nor as a thing to be sneer at but have listen seriously and ask a great many question it be very evident to I that he be reach out towards the only possible conclusion though goodness know it be one that be impossible and improbable enough it be on the Wednesday night after the five day of talk i have mention that there come to I and to those who _ know _ another element of fear and yet i can quite understand that at _ that _ time those who have see nothing would find little to be afraid of in all that i be go to tell you still even they be much puzzle and astonish and perhaps after all a little awed there be so much in the affair that be inexplicable and yet again such a lot that be natural and commonplace for when all be say and do it be nothing more than the blow adrift of one of the sail yet accompany by what be really significant detail -- significant that be in the light of that which tammy and i and the second mate know seven bell and then one have go in the first watch and we side be be rouse out to relieve the mate 's most of the man be already out of they bunk and sit about on they sea-chest get into they tog suddenly one of the ` prentice in the other watch put he head in through the doorway on the port side the mate want to know he say which of you chap make fast the fore royal last watch wot 's ' e want to know that for inquire one of the man the lee side 's blow adrift say the ` prentice and he say that the chap who make it fast be to go up and see to it as soon as the watch be relieved oh do ' e well 'twa not I any'ow reply the man you would better arsk sum of t ` other ask what inquire plummer get out of he bunk sleepily the ` prentice repeat he message the man yawn and stretch himself let I see he mutter and scratch he head with one hand while he fumble for he trousers with the other ` oo make ther fore r ` yal fast he get into he trousers and stand up why ther or ` nary er course ` oo else do yer suppose that be all i want to know say the ` prentice and go away hi tom stubbins sing out to the ordinary wake up you lazy young devil ther mate 's just send to hinquire who it be make the fore royal fast it be all blowin ' adrift and he say you be to get along up as soon as eight bell go and make it fast again tom jump out of he bunk and begin to dress quickly blowin ' adrift he say there be not all that much wind and i tuck the end of the gasket well in under the other turn p ` rap one of ther gasket be rotten and given way suggest stubbin anyway you would better hurry up it be just on eight bell a minute later eight bell go and we troop away aft for roll-call as soon as the name be call over i see the mate lean towards the second and say something then the second mate sing out : tom sir answer tom be it you make fast that fore royal last watch yes sir how 's that it be broken adrift car not say sir well it have and you would better jump aloft and shove the gasket round it again and mind you make a better job of it this time i i sir say tom and follow the rest of we forrard reach the fore rig he climb into it and begin to make he way leisurely aloft i could see he with a fair amount of distinctness as the moon be very clear and bright though get old i go over to the weather pin-rail and lean up against it watch he while i fill my pipe the other man both the watch on deck and the watch below have go into the fo ` cas ` le so that i imagine i be the only one about the maindeck yet a minute later i discover that i be mistake for as i proceed to light up i see william the young cockney come out from under the lee of the house and turn and look up at the ordinary as he go steadily upwards i be a little surprised as i know he and three of the other have a poker fight on and he would win over sixty pound of tobacco i believe i open my mouth to sing out to he to know why he be not play and then all at once there come into my mind the memory of my first conversation with he i remember that he have say sail be always blow adrift _ at night _ i remember the then unaccountable emphasis he have lay on those two word and remember that i feel suddenly afraid for all at once the absurdity have strike I of a sail -- even a badly stow one -- blow adrift in such fine and calm weather as we be then have i wonder i have not see before that there be something queer and unlikely about the affair sail do not blow adrift in fine weather with the sea calm and the ship as steady as a rock i move away from the rail and go towards william he know something or at least he guess at something that be very much a blankness to I at that time up above the boy be climb up to what that be the thing that make I feel so frightened ought i to tell all i know and guess and then who should i tell i should only be laugh at -- i -- william turn towards I and speak gawd he say it be start agen what i say though i know what he mean they syle he answer and make a gesture towards the fore royal i glance up briefly all the lee side of the sail be adrift from the bunt gasket outwards lower i see tom he be just hoist himself into the t ` gallant rigging william speak again we lose two on 'em just sime way comin ' art two of the man i exclaimed yus he say tersely i can not understand i go on i never hear anything about it who would yer get ter tell yer abart it he ask i make no reply to he question indeed i have scarcely comprehend it for the problem of what i ought to do in the matter have rise again in my mind i have a good mind to go aft and tell the second mate all i know i say he be see something himself that he can not explain away and -- and anyway i can not stand this state of thing if the second mate know all -- garn he cut in interrupt I a ' be tell yer be a blastid hidiot not yer yer sty be yer be i stand irresolute what he have say be perfectly correct and i be positively stump what to do for the best that there be danger aloft i be convince though if i have be ask my reason for suppose this they would have be hard to find yet of its existence i be as certain as though my eye already see it i wonder whether be so ignorant of the form it would assume i could stop it by join tom on the yard this thought come as i stare up at the royal tom have reach the sail and be stand on the foot-rope close in to the bunt he be bend over the yard and reach down for the slack of the sail and then as i look i see the belly of the royal toss up and down abruptly as though a sudden heavy gust of wind have catch it i be blime -- william begin with a sort of excited expectation and then he stop as abruptly as he have begin for in a moment the sail have thrash right over the after side of the yard apparently knock tom clean from off the foot-rope my god i shout out loud he be go for a instant there be a blur over my eye and william be sing out something that i could not catch then just as quickly it go and i could see again clearly william be point and i see something black swinging below the yard william call out something fresh and make a run for the fore rigging i catch the last part -- -- ther garskit straightway i know that tom have manage to grab the gasket as he fall and i bolt after william to give he a hand in get the youngster into safety down on deck i catch the sound of run foot and then the second mate 's voice he be ask what the devil be up but i do not trouble to answer he then i want all my breath to help I aloft i know very well that some of the gasket be little better than old shakin and unless tom get hold of something on the t ` gallant yard below he he might come down with a run any moment i reach the top and lift myself over it in quick time william be some distance above I in less than half a minute i reach the t ` gallant yard william have go up on to the royal i slide out on to the t ` gallant foot-rope until i be just below tom then i sing out to he to let himself down to I and i would catch he he make no answer and i see that he be hang in a curiously limp fashion and by one hand william 's voice come down to I from the royal yard he be sing out to I to go up and give he a hand to pull tom up on to the yard when i reach he he tell I that the gasket have hitch itself round the lad 's wrist i bent beside the yard and peer down it be as william have say and i realize how near a thing it have be strangely enough even at that moment the thought come to I how little wind there be i remember the wild way in which the sail have lash at the boy all this time i be busily work unreeve the port buntline i take the end make a run bowline with it round the gasket and let the loop slide down over the boy 's head and shoulder then i take a strain on it and tighten it under he arm a minute later we have he safely on the yard between we in the uncertain moonlight i could just make out the mark of a great lump on he forehead where the foot of the sail must have catch he when it knock he over as we stand there a moment take we breath i catch the sound of the second mate 's voice close beneath we william glance down then he look up at I and give a short grunt laugh crikey he say what be up i ask quickly he jerk he head backwards and downwards i screw round a bit hold the jackstay with one hand and steadying the insensible ordinary with the other in this way i could look below at first i could see nothing then the second mate 's voice come up to I again who the hell be you what be you do i see he now he be stand at the foot of the weather t ` gallant rig he face be turn upward peer round the after side of the mast it show to I only as a blur pale-coloured oval in the moonlight he repeat he question it be william and i sir i say tom here have have a accident i stop he begin to come up higher towards we from the rig to leeward there come suddenly a buzz of man talk the second mate reach we well what be up anyway he inquire suspiciously what be happen he have bent forward and be peer at tom i start to explain but he cut I short with : be he dead no sir i say i do not think so but the poor beggar 's have a bad fall he be hang by the gasket when we get to he the sail knock he off the yard what he say sharply the wind catch the sail and it lash back over the yard -- what wind he interrupt there be no wind scarcely he shift he weight on to the other foot what do you mean i mean what i say sir the wind bring the foot of the sail over the top of the yard and knock tom clean off the foot-rope william and i both see it happen but there be no wind to do such a thing you be talk nonsense it seem to I that there be as much of bewilderment as anything else in he voice yet i could tell that he be suspicious -- though of what i doubt whether he himself could have tell he glance at william and seem about to say something then seem to change he mind he turn and sing out to one of the man who have follow he aloft to go down and pass out a coil of new three-inch manilla and a tailblock smartly now he conclude i i sir say the man and go down swiftly the second mate turn to I when you have get tom below i shall want a better explanation of all this than the one you have give I it will not wash very well sir i answer but you will not get any other what do you mean he shout at I i 'll let you know i 'll have no impertinence from you or any one else i do not mean any impertinence sir -- i mean that it be the only explanation there be to give i tell you it will not wash he repeat there be something too damned funny about it all i shall have to report the matter to the captain i can not tell he that yarn -- he break off abruptly it be not the only damned funny thing that be happen aboard this old hooker i answer you ought to know that sir what do you mean he ask quickly well sir i say to be straight what about that chap you send we hunting after up the main the other night that be a funny enough affair be not it this one be not half so funny that will do jessop he say angrily i will not have any back talk yet there be something about he tone that tell I i have get one in on my own he seem all at once less able to appear confident that i be tell he a fairy tale after that for perhaps half a minute he say nothing i guess he be do some hard thinking when he speak again it be on the matter of get the ordinary down on deck one of you 'll have to go down the lee side and steady he down he conclude he turn and look downward be you bring that gantline he sing out yes sir i hear one of the man answer a moment later i see the man 's head appear over the top he have the tail-block slung round he neck and the end of the gantline over he shoulder very soon we have the gantline rig and tom down on deck then we take he into the fo ` cas ` le and put he in he bunk the second mate have send for some brandy and now he start to dose he well with it at the same time a couple of the man chafe he hand and foot in a little he begin to show sign of come round presently after a sudden fit of cough he open he eye with a surprised bewildered stare then he catch at the edge of he bunk-board and sit up giddily one of the man steady he while the second mate stand back and eye he critically the boy rock as he sit and put up he hand to he head here say the second mate take another drink tom catch he breath and choke a little then he speak by gum he say my head do ache he put up he hand again and feel at the lump on he forehead then he bent forward and stare round at the man group about he bunk what be up he inquire in a confused sort of way and seem as if he could not see we clearly what be up he ask again that be just what i want to know say the second mate speak for the first time with some sternness i be not be snoozin ' while there be be a job on tom inquire anxiously he look round at the man appealingly it be knock ` im dotty strike I say one of the man audibly no i say answering tom 's question you have have -- shut that jessop say the second mate quickly interrupt I i want to hear what the boy 's get to say for himself he turn again to tom you be up at the fore royal he prompt i car not say i be sir say tom doubtfully i could see that he have not grip the second mate 's meaning but you be say the second with some impatience it be blow adrift and i send you up to shove a gasket round it blowin ' adrift sir say tom dully yes blow adrift do not i speak plainly the dullness go from tom 's face suddenly so it be sir he say he memory return the bloomin ' sail get chock full of wind it catch I bang in the face he pause a moment i believe -- he begin and then stop once more go on say the second mate spit it out i do not know sir tom say i do not understand -- he hesitate again that be all i can remember he mutter and put he hand up to the bruise on he forehead as though try to remember something in the momentary silence that succeed i catch the voice of stubbin there hai not hardly no wind he be say in a puzzle tone there be a low murmur of assent from the surround man the second mate say nothing and i glance at he curiously be he begin to see i wonder how useless it be to try to find any sensible explanation of the affair have he begin at last to couple it with that peculiar business of the man up the main i be inclined _ now _ to think that this be so for after stare a few moment at tom in a doubtful sort of way he go out of the fo ` cas ` le say that he would inquire further into the matter in the morning yet when the morning come he do no such thing as for he report the affair to the skipper i much doubt it even do he it must have be in a very casual way for we hear nothing more about it though of course we talk it over pretty thoroughly among ourselves with regard to the second mate even now i be rather puzzle by he attitude to we aloft sometimes i have think that he must have suspect we of try to play off some trick on he -- perhaps at the time he still half suspect one of we of be in some way connect with the other business or again he may have be try to fight against the conviction that be be force upon he that there be really something impossible and beastly about the old packet of course these be only supposition and then close upon this there be further development v _ the end of william _ as i have say there be a lot of talk among the crowd of we forrard about tom 's strange accident none of the man know that william and i have see it _ happen _ stubbin give it as he opinion that tom have be sleepy and miss the foot-rope tom of course would not have this by any means yet he have no one to appeal to for at that time he be just as ignorant as the rest that we have see the sail flap up over the yard stubbin insist that it stand to reason it could not be the wind there be not any he say and the rest of the man agree with he well i say i do not know about all that i be a bit inclined to think tom 's yarn be the truth how do you make that hout stubbin ask unbelievingly there haint nothin ' like enough wind what about the place on he forehead i inquire in turn how be you go to explain that i ` spect he knock himself there when he slip he answer likely ` nufflus agree old jaskett who be sit smoking on a chest near by well you be both a damn long way out of it tom chip in pretty warm i be not asleep a ' the sail do bloomin ' well hit I do not you be impertinent young feller say jaskett i join in again there be another thing stubbin i say the gasket tom be hang by be on the after side of the yard that look as if the sail might have flap it over if there be wind enough to do the one it seem to I that it might have do the other do you mean that it be hunder ther yard or hover ther top he ask over the top of course what be more the foot of the sail be hang over the after part of the yard in a bight stubbin be plainly surprise at that and before he be ready with he next objection plummer speak ` oo see it he ask i see it i say a bit sharply so do william so -- for that matter -- do the second mate plummer relapse into silence and smoke and stubbin break out afresh i reckon tom must have have a hold of the foot and the gasket and pull 'em hover the yard when he tumble no interrupted tom the gasket be under the sail i could not even see it a ' i have not time to get hold of the foot of the sail before it up and catch I smack in the face ` ow do yer get ` old er ther gasket when yer fall then ask plummer he do not get hold of it i answer for tom it have take a turn round he wrist and that be how we find he hang do you mean to say as ' e ` ad not get ` old of ther garsket quoin inquire pause in the lighting of he pipe of course i do i say a chap do not go hang on to a rope when he be jolly well be knock senseless ye be richt assent jock ye be quite richt there jessop quoin conclude the lighting of he pipe i dunno he say i go on without notice he anyway when william and i find he he be hang by the gasket and it have a couple of turn round he wrist and besides that as i say before the foot of the sail be hang over the after side of the yard and tom 's weight on the gasket be hold it there it be damned queer say stubbin in a puzzle voice there do not seem to be no way of gettin ' a proper hexplanation to it i glance at william to suggest that i should tell all that we have see but he shake he head and after a moment 's thought it seem to I that there be nothing to be gain by so do we have no very clear idea of the thing that have happen and we half fact and guess would only have tend to make the matter appear more grotesque and unlikely the only thing to be do be to wait and watch if we could only get hold of something tangible then we might hope to tell all that we know without be make into laughing-stock i come out from my think abruptly stubbin be speak again he be argue the matter with one of the other man you see with there bein ' no wind scarcely ther thing 's himpossible a ' yet -- the other man interrupt with some remark i do not catch no i hear stubbin say i be hout of my reckonin ' i do not savvy it one bit it be too much like a damned fairy tale look at he wrist i say tom hold out he right hand and arm for inspection it be considerably swollen where the rope have be round it yes admit stubbin that be right enough but it do not tell you nothin ' i make no reply as stubbin say it tell you nothin ' and there i let it drop yet i have tell you this as show how the matter be regard in the fo ` cas ` le still it do not occupy we mind very long for as i have say there be further development the three follow night pass quietly and then on the fourth all those curious sign and hint culminate suddenly in something extraordinarily grim yet everything have be so subtle and intangible and indeed so be the affair itself that only those who have actually come in touch with the invade fear seem really capable of comprehend the terror of the thing the man for the most part begin to say the ship be unlucky and of course as usual there be some talk of there be a jonah in the ship still i can not say that none of the man realize there be anything horrible and frightening in it all for i be sure that some do a little and i think stubbin be certainly one of they though i feel certain that he do not at that time you know grasp a quarter of the real significance that underlie the several queer matter that have disturb we night he seem to fail somehow to grasp the element of personal danger that to I be already plain he lack sufficient imagination i suppose to piece the thing together -- to trace the natural sequence of the event and they development yet i must not forget of course that he have no knowledge of those two first incident if he have perhaps he might have stand where i do as it be he have not seem to reach out at all you know not even in the matter of tom and the fore royal now however after the thing i be about to tell you he seem to see a little way into the darkness and realize possibility i remember the fourth night well it be a clear star-lit moonless sort of night : at least i think there be no moon or at any rate the moon could have be little more than a thin crescent for it be near the dark time the wind have breeze up a bit but still remain steady we be slip along at about six or seven knot a hour it be we middle watch on deck and the ship be full of the blow and hum of the wind aloft william and i be the only one about the maindeck he be lean over the weather pin-rail smoking while i be pacing up and down between he and the fore hatch stubbin be on the look-out two bell have go some minute and i be wish to goodness that it be eight and time to turn-in suddenly overhead there sound a sharp crack like the report of a rifle shoot it be follow instantly by the rattle and crash of sailcloth thrashing in the wind william jump away from the rail and run aft a few step i follow he and together we stare upward to see what have go indistinctly i make out that the weather sheet of the fore t ` gallant have carry away and the clew of the sail be whirling and bang about in the air and every few moment hit the steel yard a blow like the thump of a great sledge hammer it be the shackle or one of the link that be go i think i shout to william above the noise of the sail that be the spectacle that be hit the yard yus he shout back and go to get hold of the clewline i run to give he a hand at the same moment i catch the second mate 's voice away aft shout then come the noise of run foot and the rest of the watch and the second mate be with we almost at the same moment in a few minute we have the yard lower and the sail clew up then william and i go aloft to see where the sheet have go it be much as i have suppose the spectacle be all right but the pin have go out of the shackle and the shackle itself be jam into the sheavehole in the yard arm william send I down for another pin while he unbend the clewline and overhaul it down to the sheet when i return with the fresh pin i screw it into the shackle clip on the clewline and sing out to the man to take a pull on the rope this they do and at the second heave the shackle come away when it be high enough i go up on to the t ` gallant yard and hold the chain while william shackle it into the spectacle then he bent on the clewline afresh and sing out to the second mate that we be ready to hoist away yer would better go down a ' give 'em a ` aul he say i 'll sty a ' light up ther syle right ho william i say get into the rigging do not let the ship 's bogy run away with you this remark i make in a moment of light-heartedness such as will come to anyone aloft at time i be exhilarate for the time be and quite free from the sense of fear that have be with I so much of late i suppose this be due to the freshness of the wind there be more 'n one he say in that curiously short way of he what i ask he repeat he remark i be suddenly serious the _ reality _ of all the impossible detail of the past week come back to I vivid and beastly what do you mean william i ask he but he have shut up and would say nothing what do you know -- how much do you know i go on quickly why do you never tell I that you -- the second mate 's voice interrupt I abruptly : now then up there be you go to keep we wait all night one of you come down and give we a pull with the ha ` lyard the other stay up and light up the gear i i sir i shout back then i turn to william hurriedly look here williams i say if you think there be _ really _ a danger in you be alone up here -- i hesitate for word to express what i mean then i go on well i 'll jolly well stay up with you the second mate 's voice come again come on now one of you make a move what the hell be you do come sir i sing out shall i stay i ask definitely garn he say do not yer fret yerself i 'll tike er bloomin ' piy-diy out of ` er blarst 'em i be not funky of 'em i go that be the last word william speak to anyone living i reach the deck and tail on to the haulyard we have nearly mast-headed the yard and the second mate be look up at the dark outline of the sail ready to sing out belay when all at once there come a queer sort of muffle shout from william vast haul you man shout the second mate we stand silent and listen what be that william he sing out be you all clear for nearly half a minute we stand listen but there come no reply some of the man say afterwards that they have notice a curious rattle and vibrate noise aloft that sound faintly above the hum and swirl of the wind like the sound of loose rope be shake and slatt together you know whether this noise be really hear or whether it be something that have no existence outside of they imagination i can not say i hear nothing of it but then i be at the tail end of the rope and furthest from the fore rig while those who hear it be on the fore part of the haulyard and close up to the shroud the second mate put he hand to he mouth be you all clear there he shout again the answer come unintelligible and unexpected it run like this : blarst yer i have stye do yer think drive bl -- y piy-diy and then there be a sudden silence i stare up at the dim sail astonish he be dotty say stubbin who have be tell to come off the look-out and give we a pull ` e 's as mad as a bloomin ' ` atter say quoin who be stand foreside of I ` e 's be queer all along silence there shout the second mate then : william no answer william more loudly still no answer then : damn you you jumped-up cockney crocodile can not you hear be you blooming-well deaf there be no answer and the second mate turn to I jump aloft smartly now jessop and see what be wrong i i sir i say and make a run for the rigging i feel a bit queer have william go mad he certainly always have be a bit funny or -- and the thought come with a jump -- have he see -- i do not finish suddenly up aloft there sound a frightful scream i stop with my hand on the sheerpole the next instant something fall out of the darkness -- a heavy body that strike the deck near the wait man with a tremendous crash and a loud ringing wheezy sound that sicken I several of the man shout out loud in they fright and let go of the haulyard but luckily the stopper hold it and the yard do not come down then for the space of several seconds there be a dead silence among the crowd and it seem to I that the wind have in it a strange moaning note the second mate be the first to speak he voice come so abruptly that it startle I get a light one of you quick now there be a moment 's hesitation fetch one of the binnacle lamp you tammy i i sir the youngster say in a quavering voice and run aft in less than a minute i see the light come towards we along the deck the boy be run he reach we and hand the lamp to the second mate who take it and go towards the dark huddle heap on the deck he hold the light out before he and peer at the thing my god he say it be william he stoop lower with the light and i see detail it be williams right enough the second mate tell a couple of the man to lift he and straighten he out on the hatch then he go aft to call the skipper he return in a couple of minute with a old ensign which he spread over the poor beggar almost directly the captain come hurry forward along the deck he pull back one end of the ensign and look then he put it back quietly and the second mate explain all that we know in a few word would you leave he where he be sir he ask after he have tell everything the night 's fine say the captain you may as well leave the poor devil there he turn and go aft slowly the man who be hold the light sweep it round so that it show the place where william have strike the deck the second mate speak abruptly get a broom and a couple of bucket some of you he turn sharply and order tammy on to the poop as soon as he have see the yard mast-headed and the rope clear up he follow tammy he know well enough that it would not do for the youngster to let he mind dwell too much on the poor chap on the hatch and i find out a little later that he give the boy something to occupy he thought after they have go aft we go into the fo ` cas ` le every one be moody and frightened for a little while we sit about in we bunk and on the chest and no one say a word the watch below be all asleep and not one of they know what have happen all at once plummer whose wheel it be step over the starboard washboard into the fo ` cas ` le what be up anyway he ask be williams much ` urt sh i say you 'll wake the other who be take you wheel tammy -- ther second send ` im ' e say i could go forrard a ' ` ave er smoke ' e say william ` ad ` ad er fall he break off and look across the fo ` cas ` le where be ' e he inquire in a puzzle voice i glance at the other but no one seem inclined to start yarn about it he fall from the t ` gallant rigging i say where be ' e he repeat smash up i say he be lie on the hatch dead he ask i nod i guess ` twere somethin' pretty bad when i see the old man come forrard ` ow do it ` appen he look round at the lot of we sit there silent and smoking no one know i say and glance at stubbin i catch he eye I doubtfully after a moment 's silence plummer speak again i ` eard ` im screech when i be at ther wheel ' e must ` ave get ` urt up aloft stubbin strike a match and proceed to relight he pipe how d'yer mean he ask speak for the first time ` ow do i mean well i can not say maybe ' e jam ` be finger between ther parrel a ' ther mast what about ` be swearin ' at ther second mate be that 'cause ` e would jam ` be finger put in quoin i never ` eard about that say plummer ` oo ` eard ` im i should think heverybody in ther bloomin ' ship hear he stubbin answer all ther same i hai not sure he _ be _ swearin ' at ther second mate i think at first he would go dotty a ' be cussin ' he but somehow it do not seem likely now i come to think it do not stand to reason he should go to cuss ther man there be nothin ' to go cussin ' about what be more he do not seem ter be talkin ' down to we on deck -- what i could make hout ` side what would he want ter go talkin ' to ther second about he pay-day he look across to where i be sit jock who be smoking quietly on the chest next to I take he pipe slowly out from between he tooth ye be no far oot stubbin i be thinkin ' ye be no far oot he say nod he head stubbin still continue to gaze at I what be you idee he say abruptly it may have be my fancy but it seem to I that there be something deeper than the mere sense the question convey i glance at he i could not have say myself just what my idea be i do not know i answer a little adrift he do not strike I as cursing at the second mate that be i should say after the first minute just what i say he reply another thing -- do not it strike you as bein ' bloomin ' queer about tom nearly comin ' down by ther run a ' then _ this _ i nod it would have be all hup with tom if it have not be for ther gasket he pause after a moment he go on again that be honly three or four night ago well say plummer what be yer drivin ' at nothin ' answer stubbin honly it be damned queer look as though ther ship might be unlucky after all well agree plummer thing ` as be a bit funny lately and then there be what be ` appen ter-night i shall ` ang on pretty tight ther next time i go aloft old jaskett take he pipe from he mouth and sigh thing be go wrong ` most every night he say almost pathetically it be as diff ` rent as chalk 'n' cheese ter what it be w ` en we start this ` ere trip i think it be all ` ellish rot about ` er bein ' ` aunted but it be not seem ` ly he stop and expectorate she hai not haunt say stubbin leastway not like you mean -- he pause as though try to grasp some elusive thought eh say jaskett in the interval stubbin continue without notice the query he appear to be answer some half-formed thought in he own brain rather than jaskett : thing be queer -- a ' it be be a bad job tonight i do not savvy one bit what william be sayin ' of hup aloft i have think sometimes he would somethin' on ` be mind -- then after a pause of about half a minute he say this : _ who _ be he sayin ' that to eh say jaskett again with a puzzle expression i be thinkin ' say stubbin knock out he pipe on the edge of the chest p ` rap you be right hafter all vi _ another man to the wheel _ the conversation have slack off we be all moody and shake and i know i for one be think some rather troublesome thought suddenly i hear the sound of the second 's whistle then he voice come along the deck : another man to the wheel ` e 's singin ' out for some one to go aft a ' relieve ther wheel say quoin who have go to the door to listen yer would better ` urry up plummer what be ther time ask plummer stand up and knock out he pipe must be close on ter four bell ` oo 's next wheel be it it be all right plummer i say get up from the chest on which i have be sit i 'll go along it be my wheel and it only want a couple of minute to four bell plummer sit down again and i go out of the fo ` cas ` le reach the poop i meet tammy on the lee side pacing up and down who be at the wheel i ask he in astonishment the second mate he say in a shaky sort of voice he be wait to be relieved i 'll tell you all about it as soon as i get a chance i go on aft to the wheel who be that the second inquire it be jessop sir i answer he give I the course and then without another word go forrard along the poop on the break i hear he call tammy 's name and then for some minute he be talk to he though what he be say i could not possibly hear for my part i be tremendously curious to know why the second mate have take the wheel i know that if it be just a matter of bad steering on tammy 's part he would not have dream of do such a thing there have be something queer happen about which i have yet to learn of this i feel sure presently the second mate leave tammy and commence to walk the weather side of the deck once he come right aft and stoop down peer under the wheel-box but never address a word to I sometime later he go down the weather ladder on to the main-deck directly afterwards tammy come run up to the lee side of the wheel-box i have see it again he say gasp with sheer nervousness what i say that _ thing _ he answer then he lean across the wheel-box and lower he voice it come over the lee rail -- _ up out of the sea _ he add with a air of tell something unbelievable i turn more towards he but it be too dark to see he face with any distinctness i feel suddenly husky my god i think and then i make a silly effort to protest but he cut I short with a certain impatient hopelessness for god 's sake jessop he say do stow all that it be no good i must have someone to talk to or i shall go dotty i see how useless it be to pretend any sort of ignorance indeed really i have know it all along and avoid the youngster on that very account as you know go on i say i 'll listen but you would better keep a eye for the second mate he may pop up any minute for a moment he say nothing and i see he peer stealthily about the poop go on i say you would better make haste or he 'll be up before you be half-way through what be he do at the wheel when i come up to relieve it why do he send you away from it he do not tammy reply turn he face towards I i bunk away from it what for i ask wait a minute he answer and i 'll tell you the whole business you know the second mate send I to the wheel after _ that _ -- he nod he head forrard yes i say well i would be here about ten minute or a quarter of a hour and i be feel rotten about william and try to forget it all and keep the ship on she course and all that when all at once i happen to glance to loo'ard and there i see it climb over the rail my god i do not know what to do the second mate be stand forrard on the break of the poop and i be here all by myself i feel as if i be freeze stiff when it come towards I i let go of the wheel and yell and bunk forrard to the second mate he catch hold of I and shake I but i be so jolly frightened i could not say a word i could only keep on point the second keep ask I ` where ' and then all at once i find i could not see the thing i do not know whether he see it i be not at all certain he do he just tell I to damn well get back to the wheel and stop make a damned fool of myself i say out straight i would not go so he blow he whistle and sing out for someone to come aft and take it then he run and get hold of the wheel himself you know the rest you be quite sure it be not think about william make you imagine you see something i say more to gain a moment to think than because i believe that it be the case i think you be go to listen to I seriously he say bitterly if you will not believe I what about the chap the second mate see what about tom what about william for goodness sake do not try to put I off like you do last time i nearly go crack with want to tell someone who would listen to I and would not laugh i could stand anything but this be alone there be a good chap do not pretend you do not understand tell I what it all mean what be this horrible man that i have twice see you know you know something and i believe you be afraid to tell anyone for fear of be laugh at why do not you tell I you need not be afraid of my laugh he stop suddenly for the moment i say nothing in reply do not treat I like a kid jessop he exclaim quite passionately i will not i say with a sudden resolve to tell he everything i need someone to talk to just as badly as you do what do it all mean then he burst out be they real i always use to think it be all a yarn about such thing i be sure i do not know what it all mean tammy i answer i be just as much in the dark there as you be and i do not know whether they be real -- that be not as we consider thing real you do not know that i see a queer figure down on the maindeck several night before you see that thing up here do not you see this one he cut in quickly yes i answer then why do you pretend not to have he say in a reproachful voice you do not know what a state you put I into what with my be certain that i have see it and then you be so jolly positive that there have be nothing at one time i think i be go clean off my dot -- until the second mate see that man go up the main then i know that there must be something in the thing i be certain i would see i think perhaps that if i tell you i have not see it you would think you would be mistaken i say i want you to think it be imagination or a dream or something of that sort and all the time you know about that other thing you would see he ask yes i reply it be thunder decent of you he say but it be not any good he pause a moment then he go on : it be terrible about william do you think he see something up aloft i do not know tammy i say it be impossible to say it _ may _ have be only a accident i hesitate to tell he what i really think what be he say about he pay-day who be he say it to i do not know i say again he be always crack about take a pay-day out of she you know he stay in she on purpose when all the other leave he tell I that he be not go to be do out of it for anyone what do the other lot leave for he ask then as the idea seem to strike he -- jove do you think they see something and get scare it be quite possible you know we only join she in ` frisco she have no ` prentice on the passage out we ship be sell so they send we aboard here to come home they may have i say indeed from thing i have hear william say i be pretty certain he for one guess or know a jolly sight more than we have any idea of and now he be dead say tammy solemnly we 'll never be able to find out from he now for a few moment he be silent then he go off on another track do not anything ever happen in the mate 's watch yes i answer there be several thing happen lately that seem pretty queer some of he side have be talk about they but he be too jolly pig-headed to see anything he just curse he chap and put it all down to they still he persist thing seem to happen more in we watch than in he -- i mean bigger thing look at tonight we have no proof you know i say he shake he head doubtfully i shall always funk go aloft now nonsense i tell he it may only have be a accident do not he say you know you do not think so really i answer nothing just then for i know very well that he be right we be silent for a couple of moment then he speak again : be the ship haunt for a instant i hesitate no i say at length i do not think she be i mean not in that way what way then well i have form a bit of a theory that seem wise one minute and crack the next of course it be as likely to be all wrong but it be the only thing that seem to I to fit in with all the beastly thing we have have lately go on he say with a impatient nervous movement well i have a idea that it be nothing _ in _ the ship that be likely to hurt we i scarcely know how to put it but if i be right in what i think it be the ship herself that be the cause of everything what do you mean he ask in a puzzle voice do you mean that the ship _ be _ haunt after all no i answer i have just tell you i do not wait until i have finish what i be go to say all right he say about that thing you see tonight i go on you say it come over the lee rail up on to the poop yes he answer well the thing i see _ come up out of the sea and go back into the sea _ jove he say and then : yes go on my idea be that this ship be open to be board by those thing i explain what they be of course i do not know they look like man -- in lot of way but -- well the lord know what be in the sea though we do not want to go imagine silly thing of course and then again you know it seem fat-headed call anything silly that be how i keep go in a sort of bless circle i do not know a bit whether they be flesh and blood or whether they be what we should call ghost or spirit they can not be flesh and blood tammy interrupt where would they live besides that first one i see i think i could see through it and this last one -- the second mate would have see it and they would drown -- not necessarily i say oh but i be sure they be not he insist it be impossible -- so be ghost -- when you be feel sensible i answer but i be not say they _ be _ flesh and blood though at the same time i be not go to say straight out they be ghost -- not yet at any rate where do they come from he ask stupidly enough out of the sea i tell he you see for yourself then why do not other vessel have they come aboard he say how do you account for that in a way -- though sometimes it seem cracky -- i think i can accord to my idea i answer how he inquire again why i believe that this ship be open as i have tell you -- expose unprotected or whatever you like to call it i should say it be reasonable to think that all the thing of the material world be bar as it be from the immaterial but that in some case the barrier may be break down that be what may have happen to this ship and if it have she may be naked to the attack of being belong to some other state of existence what be make she like that he ask in a really awed sort of tone the lord know i answer perhaps something to do with magnetic stress but you would not understand and i do not really and i suppose inside of I i do not believe it be anything of the kind for a minute i be not build that way and yet i do not know perhaps there may have be some rotten thing do aboard of she or again it be a heap more likely to be something quite outside of anything i know if they be immaterial then they be spirit he question i do not know i say it be so hard to say what i really think you know i have get a queer idea that my head-piece likes to think good but i do not believe my tummy believe it go on he say well i say suppose the earth be inhabit by two kind of life we be one and _ they be _ the other go on he say well i say do not you see in a normal state we may not be capable of appreciate the _ realness _ of the other but they may be just as _ real _ and material to _ they _ as _ we _ be to _ we _ do you see yes he say go on well i say the earth may be just as _ real _ to they as to we i mean that it may have quality as material to they as it have to we but neither of we could appreciate the other 's realness or the quality of realness in the earth which be real to the other it be so difficult to explain do not you understand yes he say go on well if we be in what i might call a healthy atmosphere they would be quite beyond we power to see or feel or anything and the same with they but the more we be like _ this _ the more _ real _ and actual they could grow _ to we _ see that be the more we should become able to appreciate they form of materialness that be all i can not make it any clearer then after all you _ really _ think they be ghost or something of that sort tammy say i suppose it do come to that i answer i mean that anyway i do not think they be we idea of flesh and blood but of course it be silly to say much and after all you must remember that i may be all wrong i think you ought to tell the second mate all this he say if it be really as you say the ship ought to be put into the nearest port and jolly well burnt the second mate could not do anything i reply even if he believe it all which we be not certain he would perhaps not tammy answer but if you could get he to believe it he might explain the whole business to the skipper and then something might be do it be not safe as it be he would only get jeer at again i say rather hopelessly no say tammy not after what be happen tonight perhaps not i reply doubtfully and just then the second mate come back on to the poop and tammy clear away from the wheel-box leave I with a worrying feeling that i ought to do something vii _ the come of the mist and that which it usher _ we bury william at midday poor beggar it have be so sudden all day the man be awed and gloomy and there be a lot of talk about there be a jonah aboard if they would only know what tammy and i and perhaps the second mate know and then the next thing come -- the mist i can not remember now whether it be on the day we bury william that we first see it or the day after when first i notice it like everybody else aboard i take it to be some form of haze due to the heat of the sun for it be broad daylight when the thing come the wind have die away to a light breeze and i be work at the main rig along with plummer put on seizing look as if ` twere middlin ' ` ot he remark yes i say and for the time take no further notice presently he speak again : it be gettin ' quite ` azy and he tone show he be surprised i glance up quickly at first i could see nothing then i see what he mean the air have a wavy strange unnatural appearance something like the heated air over the top of a engine 's funnel that you can often see when no smoke be come out must be the heat i say though i do not remember ever see anything just like it before nor I plummer agree it could not have be a minute later when i look up again and be astonish to find that the whole ship be surround by a thinnish haze that quite hide the horizon by jove plummer i say how queer yes he say look round i never see anythin ' like it before -- not in these part heat would not do that i say n -- no he say doubtfully we go on with we work again -- occasionally exchange a odd word or two presently after a little time of silence i bent forward and ask he to pass I up the spike he stoop and pick it up from the deck where it have tumble as he hold it out to I i see the stolid expression on he face change suddenly to a look of complete surprise he open he mouth by gum he say it be go i turn quickly and look and so it have -- the whole sea show clear and bright right away to the horizon i stare at plummer and he stare at I well i be blow he exclaim i do not think i make any reply for i have a sudden queer feeling that the thing be not right and then in a minute i call myself a ass but i could not really shake off the feeling i have another good look at the sea i have a vague idea that something be different the sea look brighter somehow and the air clearer i think and i miss something but not much you know and it be not until a couple of day later that i know that it be several vessel on the horizon which have be quite in sight before the mist and now be go during the rest of the watch and indeed all day there be no further sign of anything unusual only when the evening come -lrb- in the second dog-watch it be -rrb- i see the mist rise faintly -- the setting sun shine through it dim and unreal i know then as a certainty that it be not cause by heat and that be the beginning of it the next day i keep a pretty close watch during all my time on deck but the atmosphere remain clear yet i hear from one of the chap in the mate 's watch that it have be hazy during part of the time he be at the wheel comin ' a ' goin ' like he describe it to I when i question he about it he think it might be heat but though i know otherwise i do not contradict he at that time no one not even plummer seem to think very much of the matter and when i mention it to tammy and ask he whether he would notice it he only remark that it must have be heat or else the sun draw up water i let it stay at that for there be nothing to be gain by suggest that the thing have more to it then on the follow day something happen that set I wonder more than ever and show I how right i have be in feel the mist to be something unnatural it be in this way five bell in the eight to twelve morning watch have go i be at the wheel the sky be perfectly clear -- not a cloud to be see even on the horizon it be hot standing at the wheel for there be scarcely any wind and i be feel drowsy the second mate be down on the maindeck with the man see about some job he want do so that i be on the poop alone presently with the heat and the sun beat right down on to I i grow thirsty and for want of something better i pull out a bit of plug i have on I and bit off a chew though as a rule it be not a habit of mine after a little naturally enough i glance round for the spittoon but discover that it be not there probably it have be take forrard when the deck be wash to give it a scrub so as there be no one on the poop i leave the wheel and step aft to the taffrail it be thus that i come to see something altogether unthought of -- a full-rigged ship close-hauled on the port tack a few hundred yard on we starboard quarter she sail be scarcely fill by the light breeze and flap as she lift to the swell of the sea she appear to have very little way through the water certainly not more than a knot a hour away aft hang from the gaff-end be a string of flag evidently she be signalling to we all this i saw in a flash and i just stand and stare astonished i be astonished because i have not see she earlier in that light breeze i know that she must have be in sight for at least a couple of hour yet i could think of nothing rational to satisfy my wonder there she be -- of that much i be certain and yet how have she come there without my see she before all at once as i stand stare i hear the wheel behind I spin rapidly instinctively i jump to get hold of the spoke for i do not want the steering gear jam then i turn again to have another look at the other ship but to my utter bewilderment _ there be no sign of she _ -- nothing but the calm ocean spread away to the distant horizon i blink my eyelid a bit and push the hair off my forehead then i stare again but there be no vestige of she -- nothing you know and absolutely nothing unusual except a faint tremulous quiver in the air and the blank surface of the sea reach everywhere to the empty horizon have she founder i ask myself naturally enough and for the moment i really wonder i search round the sea for wreckage but there be nothing not even a odd hen-coop or a piece of deck furniture and so i throw away that idea as impossible then as i stand i get another thought or perhaps a intuition and i ask myself seriously whether this disappear ship might not be in some way connect with the other queer thing it occur to I then that the vessel i have see be nothing real and perhaps do not exist outside of my own brain i consider the idea gravely it help to explain the thing and i could think of nothing else that would have she be real i feel sure that other aboard we would have be bind to have see she long before i have -- i get a bit muddle there with try to think it out and then abruptly the reality of the other ship come back to I -- every rope and sail and spar you know and i remember how she have lift to the heave of the sea and how the sail have flap in the light breeze and the string of flag she have be signalling at that last i find it just as impossible to believe that she have not be real i have reach to this point of irresolution and be stand with my back partly turn to the wheel i be hold it steady with my left hand while i look over the sea to try to find something to help I to understand all at once as i stare i seem to see the ship again she be more on the beam now than on the quarter but i think little of that in the astonishment of see she once more it be only a glimpse i catch of she -- dim and wavering as though i look at she through the convolution of heated air then she grow indistinct and vanish again but i be convince now that she be real and have be in sight all the time if i could have see she that curious dim waver appearance have suggest something to I i remember the strange wavy look of the air a few day previously just before the mist have surround the ship and in my mind i connect the two it be nothing about the other packet that be strange the strangeness be with we it be something that be about -lrb- or invest -rrb- we ship that prevent I -- or indeed any one else aboard from see that other it be evident that she have be able to see we as be prove by she signalling in a irrelevant sort of way i wonder what the people aboard of she thought of we apparently intentional disregard of they signal after that i thought of the strangeness of it all even at that minute they could see we plainly and yet so far as we be concern the whole ocean seem empty it appear to I at that time to be the weirdest thing that could happen to we and then a fresh thought come to I how long have we be like that i puzzle for a few moment it be now that i recollected that we have sight several vessel on the morning of the day when the mist appear and since then we have see nothing this to say the least should have strike I as queer for some of the other packet be homeward bind along with we and steer the same course consequently with the weather be fine and the wind next to nothing they should have be in sight all the time this reasoning seem to I to show unmistakably some connection between the come of the mist and we inability to _ see _ so that it be possible we have be in that extraordinary state of blindness for nearly three day in my mind the last glimpse of that ship on the quarter come back to I and i remember a curious thought get I that i have look at she from out of some other dimension for a while you know i really believe the mystery of the idea and that it might be the actual truth take I instead of my realize just all that it might mean it seem so exactly to express all the half-defined thought that have come since see that other packet on the quarter suddenly behind I there come a rustle and rattle of the sail and in the same instant i hear the skipper say : where the devil have you get she to jessop i whirl round to the wheel i do not know -- sir i falter i have forget even that i be at the wheel do not know he shout i should damned well think you do not starboard you helm you fool you 'll have we all aback i i sir i answer and heave the wheel over i do it almost mechanically for i be still daze and have not yet have time to collect my sens during the follow half-minute i be only conscious in a confused sort of way that the old man be rant at I this feeling of bewilderment pass off and i find that i be peer blankly into the binnacle at the compass-card yet until then entirely without be aware of the fact now however i see that the ship be come back on to she course goodness know how much she have be off with the realisation that i have let the ship get almost aback there come a sudden memory of the alteration in the position of the other vessel she have appear last on the beam instead of on the quarter now however as my brain begin to work i see the cause of this apparent and until then inexplicable change it be due of course to we have come up until we have bring the other packet on to the beam it be curious how all this flash through my mind and hold my attention -- although only momentarily -- in the face of the skipper 's storm i think i have hardly realize he be still sing out at I anyhow the next thing i remember he be shake my arm what be the matter with you man he be shout and i just stare into he face like a ass without say a word i seem still incapable you know of actual reasoning speech be you damned well off you head he go on shout be you a lunatic have you have sunstroke speak you gaping idiot i try to say something but the word would not come clearly i -- i -- i -- i say and stop stupidly i be all right really but i be so bewildered with the thing i have find out and in a way i seem almost to have come back out of a distance you know you be a lunatic he say again he repeat the statement several time as if it be the only thing that sufficiently express he opinion of I then he let go of my arm and step back a couple of pace i be not a lunatic i say with a sudden gasp i be not a lunatic sir any more than you be why the devil do not you answer my question then he shout angrily what be the matter with you what have you be do with the ship answer I now i be look at that ship away on the starboard quarter sir i blurt out she be be signalling -- what he cut I short with disbelief what ship he turn quickly and look over the quarter then he wheel round to I again there be no ship what do you mean by try to spin up a cuffer like that there be sir i answer it be out there -- i point hold you tongue he say do not talk rubbish to I do you think i be blind i see it sir i persist do not you talk back to I he snap with a quick burst of temper i will not have it then just as suddenly he be silent he come a step towards I and stare into my face i believe the old ass think i be a bit mad anyway without another word he go to the break of the poop mr tulipson he sing out yes sir i hear the second mate reply send another man to the wheel very good sir the second answer a couple of minute later old jaskett come up to relieve I i give he the course and he repeat it what be up mate he ask I as i step off the grate nothing much i say and go forrard to where the skipper be stand on the break of the poop i give he the course but the crabby old devil take no notice of I whatever when i get down on to the maindeck i go up to the second and give it to he he answer I civilly enough and then ask I what i have be do to put the old man 's back up i tell he there be a ship on the starboard quarter signalling we i say there be no ship out there jessop the second mate reply look at I with a queer inscrutable expression there be sir i begin i -- that will do jessop he say go forrard and have a smoke i shall want you then to give a hand with these foot-rope you would better bring a serving-mallet aft with you when you come i hesitate a moment partly in anger but more i think in doubt i i sir i mutter at length and go forrard viii _ after the come of the mist _ after the come of the mist thing seem to develop pretty quickly in the follow two or three day a good deal happen on the night of the day on which the skipper have send I away from the wheel it be we watch on deck from eight o ' clock to twelve and my look-out from ten to twelve as i paced slowly to and fro across the fo ` cas ` le head i be think about the affair of the morning at first my thought be about the old man i curse he thoroughly to myself for be a pig-headed old fool until it occur to I that if i have be in he place and come on deck to find the ship almost aback and the fellow at the wheel stare out across the sea instead of attend to he business i should most certainly have kick up a thunder row and then i have be a ass to tell he about the ship i should never have do such a thing if i have not be a bit adrift most likely the old chap think i be crack i cease to bother my head about he and fall to wonder why the second mate have look at I so queerly in the morning do he guess more of the truth than i suppose and if that be the case why have he refuse to listen to I after that i go to puzzling about the mist i have think a great deal about it during the day one idea appeal to I very strongly it be that the actual visible mist be a materialise expression of a extraordinarily subtle atmosphere in which we be move abruptly as i walk backwards and forwards take occasional glance over the sea -lrb- which be almost calm -rrb- my eye catch the glow of a light out in the darkness i stand still and stare i wonder whether it be the light of a vessel in that case we be no longer envelop in that extraordinary atmosphere i bent forward and give the thing my more immediate attention i see then that it be undoubtedly the green light of a vessel on we port bow it be plain that she be bent on cross we bow what be more she be dangerously near -- the size and brightness of she light show that she would be close-hauled while we be go free so that of course it be we place to get out of she way instantly i turn and put my hand up to my mouth hail the second mate : light on the port bow sir the next moment he hail come back : whereabouts he must be blind i say to myself about two point on the bow sir i sing out then i turn to see whether she have shift she position at all yet when i come to look there be no light visible i run forrard to the bow and lean over the rail and stare but there be nothing -- absolutely nothing except the darkness all about we for perhaps a few seconds i stand thus and a suspicion sweep across I that the whole business be practically a repetition of the affair of the morning evidently the impalpable something that invest the ship have thin for a instant thus allow I to see the light ahead now it have close again yet whether i could see or not i do not doubt the fact that there be a vessel ahead and very close ahead too we might run on top of she any minute my only hope be that see we be not get out of she way she have put she helm up so as to let we pass with the intention of then cross under we stern i wait pretty anxiously watch and listen then all at once i hear step come along the deck forrard and the ` prentice whose time-keeping it be come up on to the fo ` cas ` le head the second mate say he can not see any light jessop he say come over to where i stand whereabouts be it i do not know i answer i have lose sight of it myself it be a green light about a couple of point on the port bow it seem fairly close perhaps they lamp 's go out he suggest after peer out pretty hard into the night for a minute or so perhaps i say i do not tell he that the light have be so close that even in the darkness we should _ now _ have be able to see the ship herself you be quite sure it be a light and not a star he ask doubtfully after another long stare oh no i say it may have be the moon now i come to think about it do not rot he reply it be easy enough to make a mistake what shall i say to the second mate tell he it be disappear of course where to he ask how the devil should i know i tell he do not ask silly question all right keep you rag in he say and go aft to report to the second mate five minute later it might have be i see the light again it be broad on the bow and tell I plainly enough that she have up with she helm to escape be run down i do not wait a moment but sing out to the second mate that there be a green light about four point on the port bow by jove it must have be a close shave the light do not _ seem _ to be more than about a hundred yard away it be fortunate that we have not much way through the water now i think to myself the second will see the thing and perhaps mr bloom ` prentice will be able to give the star its proper name even as the thought come into my head the light fade and vanish and i catch the second mate 's voice whereaway he be sing out it be go again sir i answer a minute later i hear he come along the deck he reach the foot of the starboard ladder where be you jessop he inquire here sir i say and go to the top of the weather ladder he come up slowly on to the fo ` cas ` le head what be this you have be sing out about a light he ask just point out exactly where it be you last see it this i do and he go over to the port rail and stare away into the night but without see anything it be go sir i venture to remind he though i have see it twice now -- once about a couple of point on the bow and this last time broad away on the bow but it disappear both time almost at once i do not understand it at all jessop he say in a puzzle voice be you sure it be a ship 's light yes sir a green light it be quite close i do not understand he say again run aft and ask the ` prentice to pass you down my night glass be as smart as you can i i sir i reply and run aft in less than a minute i be back with he binoculars and with they he stare for some time at the sea to leeward all at once he drop they to he side and face round on I with a sudden question : where 's she go to if she be shift she bearing as quickly as all that she must be precious close we should be able to see she spar and sail or she cabin light or she binnacle light or something it be queer sir i assent damned queer he say so damned queer that i be inclined to think you have make a mistake no sir i be certain it be a light where 's the ship then he ask i can not say sir that be just what be be puzzling I the second say nothing in reply but take a couple of quick turn across the fo ` cas ` le head -- stop at the port rail and take another look to leeward through he night glass perhaps a minute he stand there then without a word he go down the lee ladder and away aft along the main deck to the poop he be jolly well puzzle i think to myself or else he think i have be imagine thing either way i guess he would think that in a little i begin to wonder whether after all he have any idea of what might be the truth one minute i would feel certain he have and the next i be just as sure that he guess nothing i get one of my fit of ask myself whether it would not have be better to have tell he everything it seem to I that he must have see sufficient to make he incline to listen to I and yet i could not by any means be certain i might only have be make a ass of myself in he eye or set he think i be dotty i be walk about the fo ` cas ` le head feeling like this when i see the light for the third time it be very bright and big and i could see it move as i watch this again show I that it must be very close surely i think the second mate must see it now for himself i do not sing out this time right away i think i would let the second see for himself that i have not be mistaken besides i be not go to risk its vanish again the instant i have speak for quite half a minute i watch it and there be no sign of its disappear every moment i expect to hear the second mate 's hail show that he have spot it at last but none come i could stand it no longer and i run to the rail on the after part of the fo ` cas ` le head green light a little abaft the beam sir i sing out at the top of my voice but i have wait too long even as i shout the light blur and vanish i stamped my foot and swear the thing be make a fool of I yet i have a faint hope that those aft have see it just before it disappear but this i know be vain directly i hear the second 's voice light be damned he shout then he blow he whistle and one of the man run aft out of the fo ` cas ` le to see what it be he want whose next look-out be it i hear he ask jaskett 's sir then tell jaskett to relieve jessop at once do you hear yes sir say the man and come forrard in a minute jaskett stumble up onto the fo ` cas ` le head what be up mate he ask sleepily it be that fool of a second mate i say savagely i have report a light to he three time and because the blind fool can not see it he be send you up to relieve I where be it mate he inquire he look round at the dark sea i do not see no light he remark after a few moment no i say it be go eh he inquire it be go i repeat irritably he turn and regard I silently through the dark i would go a ' ` ave a sleep mate he say at length i have be that way meself ther 's nothin ' like a snooze w ` en yer get like that what i say like what it be all right mate yer 'll be all right in ther mornin ' do not yer worry ` bout I he tone be sympathetic hell be all i say and walk down off the fo ` cas ` le head i wonder whether the old fellow think i be go silly have a sleep by jove i muttered to myself i wonder who have feel like have a sleep after what i have see and stand today i feel rotten with no one understand what be really the matter i seem to be all alone through the thing i have learn then the thought come to I to go aft and talk the matter over with tammy i know he would be able to understand of course and it would be such a relief on the impulse i turn and go aft along the deck to the ` prentice ' berth as i near the break of the poop i look up and see the dark shape of the second mate lean over the rail above I who be that he ask it be jessop sir i say what do you want in this part of the ship he inquire i would come aft to speak to tammy sir i reply you go along forrard and turn-in he say not altogether unkindly a sleep will do you more good than yarn about you know you be get to fancy thing too much i be sure i be not sir i be perfectly well i -- that will do he interrupt sharply you go and have a sleep i give a short curse under my breath and go slowly forrard i be get madden with be treat as if i be not quite sane by god i say to myself wait till the fool know what i know -- just wait i enter the fo ` cas ` le through the port doorway and go across to my chest and sit down i feel angry and tired and miserable quoin and plummer be sit close by play card and smoking stubbin lay in he bunk watch they and also smoking as i sit down he put he head forward over the bunk-board and regard I in a curious meditative way what be hup with ther second hoffcer he ask after a short stare i look at he and the other two man look up at I i feel i should go off with a bang if i do not say something and i let out pretty stiffly tell they the whole business yet i have see enough to know that it be no good try to explain thing so i just tell they the plain bold fact and leave explanation as much alone as possible three time you say say stubbin when i have finish yes i assent a ' ther old man send yer from ther wheel this mornin ' 'cause yer ` appen ter see a ship ' e could not plummer add in a reflective tone yes i say again i think i see he look at quoin significantly but stubbin i notice look only at I i reckon ther second think you be a bit hoff color he remark after a short pause the second mate 's a fool i say with some bitterness a confounded fool i hai not so sure about that he reply it be bind ter seem queer ter he i do not understand it myself -- he lapse into silence and smoke i car not understand ` ow it be ther second mate do not ` appen to spot it quoin say in a puzzle voice it seem to I that plummer nudge he to be quiet it look as if plummer share the second mate 's opinion and the idea make I savage but stubbin 's next remark draw my attention i do not hunderstand it he say again speak with deliberation all ther same ther second should have savvy enough not to have sling you hoff ther look-hout he nod he head slowly keep he gaze fix on my face how do you mean i ask puzzle yet with a vague sense that the man understand more perhaps than i have hitherto think i mean what be ther second so bless cocksure about he take a draw at he pipe remove it and lean forward somewhat over he bunk-board do not he say nothin ' ter you after you come hoff ther look-hout he ask yes i reply he spot I go aft he tell I i be get to imagine thing too much he say i would better come forrard and get a sleep a ' what do you say nothing i come forrard why do not you bloomin ' well harsk he if he be not doin ' ther imaginin ' trick when he send we chasin ' hup ther main hafter that bogyman of he i never think of it i tell he well yer ought ter have he pause and sit up in he bunk and ask for a match as i pass he my box quoin look up from he game it might ` ave be a stowaway yer know yer car not say as it be ever be prove as it be not stubbin pass the box back to I and go on without notice quoin 's remark : tell you to go a ' have a snooze do he i do not hunderstand what he be bluffin ' at how do you mean bluffing i ask he nod he head sagely it be my hidea he know you see that light just as bloomin ' well as i do plummer look up from he game at this speech but say nothing then _ you _ do not doubt that i really see it i ask with a certain surprise not I he remark with assurance you hai not likely ter make that kind of mistake three time runnin ' no i say i _ know _ i see the light right enough but -- i hesitate a moment -- it be bless queer it _ be _ bless queer he agree it be damned queer a ' there be a lot of other damn queer thing happenin ' aboard this packet lately he be silent for a few seconds then he speak suddenly : it be not nat ` ral i be damned sure of that much he take a couple of draw at he pipe and in the momentary silence i catch jaskett 's voice above we he be hail the poop red light on the starboard quarter sir i hear he sing out there you be i say with a jerk of my head that be about where that packet i spot ought to be by now she could not cross we bow so she up helm and let we pass and now she be haul up again and go under we stern i get up from the chest and go to the door the other three follow as we step out on deck i hear the second mate shout out away aft to know the whereabouts of the light by jove stubbin i say i believe the bless thing 's go again we run to the starboard side in a body and look over but there be no sign of a light in the darkness astern i car not say as _ i _ see any light say quoin plummer say nothing i look up at the fo ` cas ` le head there i could faintly distinguish the outline of jaskett he be stand by the starboard rail with he hand up shade he eye evidently stare towards the place where he have last see the light where 's she get to jaskett i call out i can not say mate he answer it be the most ` ellishly funny thing i have ever come across she be there as plain as I ` att one minnit a ' ther next she be go -- clean go i turn to plummer what do you think about it _ now _ i ask he well he say i 'll admit i think at first ` twere somethin' a ' nothin ' i think yer be mistaken but it seem yer do see somethin' away aft we hear the sound of step along the deck ther second 's comin ' forrard for a hexplanation jaskett stubbin sing out you would better go down a ' change yer breek the second mate pass we and go up the starboard ladder what be up now jaskett he say quickly where be this light neither the ` prentice nor i can see it ther damn thing 's clean go sir jaskett reply go the second mate say go what do you mean she be there one minnit sir as plain as I ` att a ' ther next she would go that be a damn silly yarn to tell I the second reply you do not expect I to believe it do you it be gospel trewth any'ow sir jaskett answer a ' jessop see it just ther same he seem to have add that last part as a afterthought evidently the old beggar have change he opinion as to my need for sleep you be a old fool jaskett the second say sharply and that idiot jessop have be put thing into you silly old head he pause a instant then he continue : what the devil 's the matter with you all that you have take to this sort of game you know very well that you see no light i send jessop off the look-out and then you must go and start the same game we ` ave not -- jaskett start to say but the second silence he stow it he say and turn and go down the ladder pass we quickly without a word do not look to _ I _ stubbin i say as though the second do believe we have see the light i hai not so sure he answer he be a puzzler the rest of the watch pass away quietly and at eight bell i make haste to turn-in for i be tremendously tire when we be call again for the four to eight watch on deck i learn that one of the man in the mate 's watch have see a light soon after we have go below and have report it only for it to disappear immediately this i find have happen twice and the mate have get so wild -lrb- be under the impression that the man be play the fool -rrb- that he have nearly come to blow with he -- finally order he off the look-out and send another man up in he place if this last man see the light he take good care not to let the mate know so that the matter have end there and then on the follow night before we have cease to talk about the matter of the vanish light something else occur that temporarily drive from my mind all memory of the mist and the extraordinary blind atmosphere it have seem to usher ix _ the man who cry for help _ it be as i have say on the follow night that something further happen and it bring home pretty vividly to I if not to any of the other the sense of a personal danger aboard we have go below for the eight to twelve watch and my last impression of the weather at eight o'clock be that the wind be freshen there have be a great bank of cloud rise astern which have look as if it be go to breeze up still more at a quarter to twelve when we be call for we twelve to four watch on deck i could tell at once by the sound that there be a fresh breeze blow at the same time i hear the voice of the man on the other watch singing out as they haul on the rope i catch the rattle of canvas in the wind and guess that they be take the royal off she i look at my watch which i always keep hang in my bunk it show the time to be just after the quarter so that with luck we should escape have to go up to the sail i dress quickly and then go to the door to look at the weather i find that the wind have shift from the starboard quarter to right aft and by the look of the sky there seem to be a promise of more before long up aloft i could make out faintly the fore and mizzen royal flap in the wind the main have be leave for a while longer in the fore rigging jacob the ordinary seaman in the mate 's watch be follow another of the man aloft to the sail the mate 's two ` prentice be already up at the mizzen down on deck the rest of the man be busy clear up the rope i go back to my bunk and look at my watch -- the time be only a few minute off eight bell so i get my oilskin ready for it look like rain outside as i be do this jock go to the door for a look what be it doin ' jock tom ask get out of he bunk hurriedly i be thinkin ' maybe it be goin ' to blow a wee and ye 'll be needin ' yer ' oilskin jock answer when eight bell go and we muster aft for roll-call there be a considerable delay owe to the mate refuse to call the roll until tom -lrb- who as usual have only turn out of he bunk at the last minute -rrb- come aft to answer he name when at last he do come the second and the mate join in give he a good dress down for a lazy sojer so that several minute pass before we be on we way forrard again this be a small enough matter in itself and yet really terrible in its consequence to one of we number for just as we reach the fore rig there be a shout aloft loud above the noise of the wind and the next moment something crash down into we midst with a great slogging thud -- something bulky and weighty that strike full upon jock so that he go down with a loud horrible ringing ugg and never say a word from the whole crowd of we there go up a yell of fear and then with one accord there be a run for the light fo ` cas ` le i be not ashamed to say that i run with the rest a blind unreasoning fright have seize I and i do not stop to think once in the fo ` cas ` le and the light there be a reaction we all stand and look blankly at one another for a few moment then someone ask a question and there be a general murmur of denial we all feel ashamed and someone reach up and unhook the lantern on the port side i do the same with the starboard one and there be a quick movement towards the door as we stream out on deck i catch the sound of the mate ' voice they have evidently come down from off the poop to find out what have happen but it be too dark to see they whereabouts where the hell have you all get to i hear the mate shout the next instant they must have see the light from we lantern for i hear they footstep come along the deck at a run they come the starboard side and just abaft the fore rig one of they stumble and fall over something it be the first mate who have trip i know this by the cursing that come directly afterwards he pick himself up and apparently without stop to see what manner of thing it be that he have fall over make a rush to the pin-rail the second mate run into the circle of light throw by we lantern and stop dead -- eye we doubtfully i be not surprise at this _ now _ nor at the behavior of the mate the follow instant but at that time i must say i could not conceive what have come to they particularly the first mate he come out at we from the darkness with a rush and a roar like a bull and brandish a belaying-pin i have fail to take into account the scene which he eye must have show he : -- the whole crowd of man in the fo ` cas ` le -- both watch -- pour out on to the deck in utter confusion and greatly excite with a couple of fellow at they head carry lantern and before this there have be the cry aloft and the crash down on deck follow by the shout of the frightened crew and the sound of many foot run he may well have take the cry for a signal and we action for something not far short of mutiny indeed he word tell we that this be he very think i 'll knock the face off the first man that come a step further aft he shout shake the pin in my face i 'll show yer who be master here what the hell do yer mean by this get forrard into yer kennel there be a low growl from the man at the last remark and the old bully step back a couple of pace hold on you fellow i sing out shut up a minute mr tulipson i call out to the second who have not be able to get a word in edgeway i do not know what the devil 's the matter with the first mate but he 'll not find it pay to talk to a crowd like ours in that sort of fashion or there 'll be ructions aboard come come jessop this will not do i can not have you talk like that about the mate he say sharply let I know what be to-do and then go forrard again the lot of you we would have tell you at first sir i say only the mate would not give any of we a chance to speak there be be a awful accident sir something 's fall from aloft right on to jock -- i stop suddenly for there be a loud cry aloft help help help someone be shout and then it rise from a shout into a scream my god sir i shout that be one of the man up at the fore royal listen order the second mate listen even as he speak it come again -- broken and as it be in gasp help oh god oh help h-e-l-p abruptly stubbin 's voice strike in hup with we lad by god hup with we and he make a spring into the fore rigging i shove the handle of the lantern between my tooth and follow plummer be come but the second mate pull he back that be sufficient he say i be go and he come up after I we go over the foretop racing like fiend the light from the lantern prevent I from see to any distance in the darkness but at the crosstree stubbin who be some ratlin ahead shout out all at once and in gasp : they be fightin ' like hell what call the second mate breathlessly apparently stubbin do not hear he for he make no reply we clear the crosstree and climb into the t ` gallant rig the wind be fairly fresh up there and overhead there sound the flap flap of sailcloth fly in the wind but since we have leave the deck there have be no other sound from above now abruptly there come again a wild cry from the darkness over we a strange wild medley it be of scream for help mix up with violent breathless curse beneath the royal yard stubbin halt and look down to I hurry hup with ther lantern jessop he shout catch he breath between the word there 'll be murder do hin a minute i reach he and hold the light up for he to catch he stoop and take it from I then hold it above he head he go a few ratlin higher in this manner he reach to a level with the royal yard from my position a little below he the lantern seem but to throw a few straggle flicker ray along the spar yet they show I something my first glance have be to wind ` ard and i have see at once that there be nothing on the weather yard arm from there my gaze go to leeward indistinctly i see something upon the yard that cling struggle stubbin bent towards it with the light thus i see it more clearly it be jacob the ordinary seaman he have he right arm tightly round the yard with the other he appear to be fend himself from something on the other side of he and further out upon the yard at time moan and gasp come from he and sometimes curse once as he appear to be drag partly from he hold he scream like a woman he whole attitude suggest stubborn despair i can scarcely tell you how this extraordinary sight affect I i seem to stare at it without realize that the affair be a real happen during the few seconds which i have spend stare and breathless stubbin have climb round the after side of the mast and now i begin again to follow he from he position below I the second have not be able to see the thing that be occur on the yard and he sing out to I to know what be happen it be jacob sir i call back he seem to be fight with someone to looard of he i can not see very plainly yet stubbin have get round on to the lee foot-rope and now he hold the lantern up peer and i make my way quickly alongside of he the second mate follow but instead of get down on to the foot-rope he get on the yard and stand there hold on to the tie he sing out for one of we to pass he up the lantern which i do stubbin hand it to I the second hold it out at arm 's length so that it light up the lee part of the yard the light show through the darkness as far as to where jacob struggle so weirdly beyond he nothing be distinct there have be a moment 's delay while we be pass the lantern up to the second mate now however stubbin and i move out slowly along the foot-rope we go slowly but we do well to go at all with any show of boldness for the whole business be so abominably uncanny it seem impossible to convey truly to you the strange scene on the royal yard you may be able to picture it yourselve the second mate standing upon the spar hold the lantern he body sway with each roll of the ship and he head crane forward as he peer along the yard on we left jacob mad fight cursing pray gasping and outside of he shadow and the night the second mate speak abruptly hold on a moment he say then : jacob he shout jacob do you hear I there be no reply only the continual gasping and cursing go on the second mate say to we but be careful keep a tight hold he hold the lantern higher and we go out cautiously stubbin reach the ordinary and put he hand on he shoulder with a soothing gesture steady hon now jacob he say steady hon at he touch as though by magic the young fellow calm down and stubbin -- reach round he -- grasp the jackstay on the other side get a hold of he you side jessop he sing out i 'll get this side this i do and stubbin climb round he there hai not no one here stubbin call to I but he voice express no surprise what sing out the second mate no one there where 's svensen then i do not catch stubbin 's reply for suddenly it seem to I that i see something shadowy at the extreme end of the yard out by the lift i stare it rise up on the yard and i see that it be the figure of a man it grasp at the lift and commence to swarm up quickly it pass diagonally above stubbin 's head and reach down a vague hand and arm look out stubbin i shout look out what be up now he call in a startled voice at the same instant he cap go whirling away to leeward damn the wind he burst out then all at once jacob who have only be give a occasional moan commence to shriek and struggle hold fast onto he stubbin yell he 'll be throwin ' himself off the yard i put my left arm round the ordinary 's body -- get hold of the jackstay on the other side then i look up above we i seem to see something dark and indistinct that move rapidly up the lift keep tight hold of he while i get a gasket i hear the second mate sing out a moment later there be a crash and the light disappear damn and set fire to the sail shout the second mate i twisted round somewhat and look in he direction i could dimly make he out on the yard he have evidently be in the act of get down on to the foot-rope when the lantern be smash from he my gaze jump to the lee rig it seem that i make out some shadowy thing steal down through the darkness but i could not be sure and then in a breath it have go anything wrong sir i call out yes he answer i have drop the lantern the bless sail knock it out of my hand we 'll be all right sir i reply i think we can manage without it jacob seem to be quieter now well be careful as you come in he warn we come on jacob i say come on we 'll go down on deck go along young feller stubbin put in you be right now we 'll take care of you and we start to guide he along the yard he go willingly enough though without say a word he seem like a child once or twice he shiver but say nothing we get he in to the lee rigging then one go beside he and the other keep below we make we way slowly down on deck we go very slowly -- so slowly in fact that the second mate -- who have stay a minute to shove the gasket round the lee side of the sail -- be almost as soon down take jacobs forrard to he bunk he say and go away aft to where a crowd of the man one with a lantern stand round the door of a empty berth under the break of the poop on the starboard side we hurry forrard to the fo ` cas ` le there we find all in darkness they be haft with jock and svenson stubbin have hesitate a instant before say the name yes i reply that be what it must have be right enough i kind of know it all ther time he say i step in through the doorway and strike a match stubbin follow guide jacob before he and together we get he into he bunk we cover he up with he blanket for he be pretty shivery then we come out during the whole time he have not speak a word as we go aft stubbin remark that he think the business must have make he a bit dotty it be drive he clean barmy he go on he do not hunderstand a word that be say ter he he may be different in the morning i answer as we near the poop and the crowd of wait man he speak again : they have put 'em hinter ther second 's hempty berth yes i say poor beggar we reach the other man and they open out and allow we to get near the door several of they ask in low tone whether jacob be all right and i tell they yes not say anything then about he condition i get close up to the doorway and look into the berth the lamp be light and i could see plainly there be two bunk in the place and a man have be lay in each the skipper be there lean up against a bulkshead he look worried but be silent -- seem to be mood in he own thought the second mate be busy with a couple of flag which he be spread over the body the first mate be talk evidently tell he something but he tone be so low that i catch he word only with difficulty it strike I that he seem pretty subdue i get part of he sentence in patch as it be break i hear he say and the dutchman i have see he the second mate say shortly two straight off the reel say the mate three in the second make no reply of course yer know accident the first mate go on be it the second say in a queer voice i see the mate glance at he in a doubtful sort of way but the second be cover poor old jock 's dead face and do not appear to notice he look it -- it -- the mate say and stop after a moment 's hesitation he say something further that i could not catch but there seem a lot of funk in he voice the second mate appear not to have hear he at any rate he make no reply but bent and straighten out a corner of the flag over the rigid figure in the lower bunk there be a certain niceness in he action which make I warm towards he he be white i think to myself out loud i say : we have put jacob into he bunk sir the mate jump then whiz round and stare at I as though i have be a ghost the second mate turn also but before he could speak the skipper take a step towards I be he all right he ask well sir i say he be a bit queer but i think it be possible he may be better after a sleep i hope so too he reply and step out on deck he go towards the starboard poop ladder walk slowly the second go and stand by the lamp and the mate after a quick glance at he come out and follow the skipper up on to the poop it occur to I then like a flash that the man have stumble upon a portion of the _ truth _ this accident come so soon after that other it be evident that in he mind he have connect they i recollect the fragment of he remark to the second mate then those many minor happening that have crop up at different time and at which he have sneer i wonder whether he would begin to comprehend they significance -- they beastly sinister significance ah mr bully-mate i think to myself you be in for a bad time if you have begin to understand abruptly my thought jump to the vague future before we god help we i mutter the second mate after a look round turn down the wick of the lamp and come out close the door after he now you man he say to the mate 's watch get forrard we can not do anything more you would better go and get some sleep i i sir they say in a chorus then as we all turn to go forrard he ask if anyone have relieve the look-out no sir answer quoin be it yours the second ask yes sir he reply hurry up and relieve he then the second say i i sir the man answer and go forrard with the rest of we as we go i ask plummer who be at the wheel tom he say as he speak several spot of rain fall and i glance up at the sky it have become thickly cloud look as if it be go to breeze up i say yes he reply we 'll be shortenin ' ` er down ` fore long may be a all-hands job i remark yes he answer again ` two not be no use they turnin ' in if it be the man who be carry the lantern go into the fo ` cas ` le and we follow where 's ther one belongin ' to we side plummer ask get smash hupstair answer stubbin ` ow be that plummer inquire stubbin hesitate the second mate drop it i reply the sail hit it or something the man in the other watch seem to have no immediate intention of turning-in but sit in they bunk and around on the chest there be a general lighting of pipe in the midst of which there come a sudden moan from one of the bunk in the forepart of the fo ` cas ` le -- a part that be always a bit gloomy and be more so now on account of we have only one lamp wot 's that ask one of the man belong to the other side s -- sh say stubbin it be he ` oo inquire plummer jacob yes i reply poor devil wot be ` appenin ' w ` en yer get hup _ ther ' _ ask the man on the other side indicate with a jerk of he head the fore royal before i could reply stubbin jump up from he sea-chest ther second mate 's whistlin ' he say come hon and he run out on deck plummer jaskett and i follow quickly outside it have start to rain pretty heavily as we go the second mate 's voice come to we through the darkness stand by the main royal clewline and buntline i hear he shout and the next instant come the hollow thutter of the sail as he start to lower away in a few minute we have it haul up up and furl it a couple of you he sing out i go towards the starboard rigging then i hesitate no one else have move the second mate come among we come on now lad he say make a move it be get to be do i 'll go i say if someone else will come still no one stir and no one answer tammy come across to I i 'll come he volunteer in a nervous voice no by god no say the second mate abruptly he jump into the main rig himself come along jessop he shout i follow he but i be astonished i have fully expect he to get on to the other fellow ' track like a ton of brick it have not occur to I that he be make allowance i be simply puzzle then but afterwards it dawn upon I no sooner have i follow the second mate than straightway stubbin plummer and jaskett come up after we at a run about half-way to the maintop the second mate stop and look down who be that come up below you jessop he ask before i could speak stubbin answer : it be I sir a ' plummer a ' jaskett who the devil tell you to come _ now _ go straight down the lot of you we be comin ' hup ter keep you company sir be he reply at that i be confident of a burst of temper from the second and yet for the second time within a couple of minute i be wrong instead of cursing stubbin he after a moment 's pause go on up the rigging without another word and the rest of we follow we reach the royal and make short work of it indeed there be sufficient of we to have eat it when we have finish i notice that the second mate remain on the yard until we be all in the rig evidently he have determine to take a full share of any risk there might be but i take care to keep pretty close to he so as to be on hand if anything happen yet we reach the deck again without anything have occur i have say without anything have occur but i be not really correct in this for as the second mate come down over the crosstree he give a short abrupt cry anything wrong sir i ask no -- o he say nothing i banged my knee and yet _ now _ i believe he be lie for that same watch i be to hear man give just such cry but god know they have reason enough x _ hand that pluck _ directly we reach the deck the second mate give the order : mizzen t ` gallant clewline and buntline and lead the way up on to the poop he go and stand by the haulyard ready to lower away as i walk across to the starboard clewline i see that the old man be on deck and as i take hold of the rope i hear he sing out to the second mate call all hand to shorten sail mr tulipson very good sir the second mate reply then he raise he voice : go forrard you jessop and call all hand to shorten sail you would better give they a call in the bosun 's place as you go i i sir i sing out and hurry off as i go i hear he tell tammy to go down and call the mate reach the fo ` cas ` le i put my head in through the starboard doorway and find some of the man begin to turn-in it be all hand on deck shorten sail i sing out i step inside just wot i say grumble one of the man they do not damn well think we be goin ' aloft to-night after what be happen ask another we have be up to the main royal i answer the second mate go with we wot say the first man ther second mate hisself yes i reply the whole bloom watch go up a ' wot ` appen he ask nothing i say nothing at all we just make a mouthful apiece of it and come down again all the same remark the second man i do not fancy goin ' upstairs after what be happen well i reply it be not a matter of fancy we have get to get the sail off she or there 'll be a mess one of the ` prentice tell I the glass be fall come erlong boy we have get ter du it say one of the older man rise from a chest at this point what be it duin ' outside mate rain i say you 'll want you oilskin i hesitate a moment before go on deck again from the bunk forrard among the shadow i have seem to hear a faint moan poor beggar i think to myself then the old chap who have last speak break in upon my attention it be awl right mate he say rather testily yer need not wait we 'll be out in er minit that be all right i be not think about you lot i reply and walk forrard to jacob 's bunk some time before he have rig up a pair of curtain cut out of a old sack to keep off the draught these some one have draw so that i have to pull they aside to see he he be lie on he back breathing in a queer jerky fashion i could not see he face plainly but it seem rather pale in the half-light jacob i say jacob how do you feel now but he make no sign to show that he have hear I and so after a few moment i draw the curtain to again and leave he what like do ' e seem ask one of the fellow as i go towards the door bad i say damn bad i think the steward ought to be tell to come and have a look at he i 'll mention it to the second when i get a chance i step out on deck and run aft again to give they a hand with the sail we get it haul up and then go forrard to the fore t ` gallant and a minute later the other watch be out and with the mate be busy at the main by the time the main be ready for make fast we have the fore haul up so that now all three t ` gallant be in the rope and ready for stow then come the order : up aloft and furl up with you lad the second mate say do not let 's have any hang back this time away aft by the main the man in the mate 's watch seem to be stand in a clump by the mast but it be too dark to see clearly i hear the mate start to curse then there come a growl and he shut up be handy man be handy the second mate sing out at that stubbin jump into the rig come hon he shout we 'll have ther bloomin ' sail fast a ' down hon deck again before they be start plummer follow then jaskett i and quoin who have be call down off the look-out to give a hand that be the style lad the second sing out encouragingly then he run aft to the mate 's crowd i hear he and the mate talk to the man and presently when we be go over the foretop i make out that they be begin to get into the rigging i find out afterwards that as soon as the second mate have see they off the deck he go up to the mizzen t ` gallant along with the four ` prentice on we part we make we way slowly aloft keep one hand for ourselves and the other for the ship as you can fancy in this manner we have go as far as the crosstree at least stubbin who be first have when all at once he give out just another such cry as have the second mate a little earlier only that in he case he follow it by turn round and blast plummer you might have blarst well send I flyin ' down hon deck he shout if you bl -- dy well think it be a joke try it hon some one else -- it be not I interrupted plummer i ` ave not touch yer ` oo the ` ell be yer swearin ' at at you -- i hear he reply but what more he may have say be lose in a loud shout from plummer what be up plummer i sing out for god 's sake you two do not get fight up aloft but a loud frightened curse be all the answer he give then straightway he begin to shout at the top of he voice and in the lull of he noise i catch the voice of stubbin cursing savagely they 'll come down with a run i shout helplessly they 'll come down as sure as nut i catch jaskett by the boot what be they do what be they do i sing out can not you see i shake he leg as i speak but at my touch the old idiot -- as i think he at the moment -- begin to shout in a frightened voice : oh oh help hel -- shut up i bellowed shut up you old fool if you will not do anything let I get past you yet he only cry out the more and then abruptly i catch the sound of a frightened clamor of man 's voice away down somewhere about the maintop -- curse cry of fear even shriek and above it all someone shout to go down on deck : get down get down down down blarst -- the rest be drown in a fresh outburst of hoarse cry in the night i try to get past old jaskett but he be cling to the rigging sprawl on to it be the best way to describe he attitude so much of it as i could see in the darkness up above he stubbin and plummer still shout and curse and the shroud quiver and shake as though the two be fight desperately stubbin seem to be shout something definite but whatever it be i could not catch at my helplessness i grow angry and shake and prod jaskett to make he move damn you jaskett i roared damn you for a funky old fool let I get past let I get past will you but instead of let I pass i find that he be begin to make he way down at that i catch he by the slack of he trousers near the stern with my right hand and with the other i get hold of the after shroud somewhere above he left hip by these means i fairly hoisted myself up on to the old fellow 's back then with my right i could reach to the forrard shroud over he right shoulder and have get a grip i shift my leave to a level with it at the same moment i be able to get my foot on to the splice of a ratline and so give myself a further lift then i pause a instant and glance up stubbin stubbin i shout plummer plummer and even as i call plummer 's foot -- reach down through the gloom -- alight full on my upturned face i let go from the rig with my right hand and strike furiously at he leg cursing he for he clumsiness he lift he foot and in the same instant a sentence from stubbin float down to I with a strange distinctness : _ for god 's sake tell 'em to get down hon deck _ he be shout even as the word come to I something in the darkness grip my waist i make a desperate clutch at the rig with my disengaged right hand and it be well for I that i secure the hold so quickly for the same instant i be wrench at with a brutal ferocity that appal I i say nothing but lash out into the night with my left foot it be queer but i can not say with certainty that i strike anything i be too downright desperate with funk to be sure and yet it seem to I that my foot encounter something soft that give under the blow it may have be nothing more than a imagine sensation yet i be incline to think otherwise for instantly the hold about my waist be release and i commence to scramble down clutch the shroud pretty desperately i have only a very uncertain remembrance of that which follow whether i slide over jaskett or whether he give way to I i can not tell i know only that i reach the deck in a blind whirl of fear and excitement and the next thing i remember i be among a crowd of shout half-mad sailor-men xi _ the search for stubbin _ in a confused way i be conscious that the skipper and the mate be down among we try to get we into some state of calmness eventually they succeed and we be tell to go aft to the saloon door which we do in a body here the skipper himself serve out a large tot of rum to each of we then at he order the second mate call the roll he call over the mate 's watch first and everyone answer then he come to ours and he must have be much agitate for the first name he sing out be jock 's among we there come a moment of dead silence and i notice the wail and moan of the wind aloft and the flap flap of the three unfurled t ` gallan 's ` l the second mate call the next name hurriedly : jaskett he sing out sir jaskett answer quoin yes sir jessop sir i reply stubbin there be no answer stubbin again call the second mate again there be no reply be stubbin here -- anyone the second 's voice sound sharp and anxious there be a moment 's pause then one of the man speak : he be not here sir who see he last the second asked plummer step forward into the light that stream through the saloon doorway he have on neither coat nor cap and he shirt seem to be hang about he in tatters it be I sir he say the old man who be stand next to the second mate take a pace towards he and stop and stare but it be the second who speak where he ask ' e be just above I in ther crosstree when when -- the man break off short yes yes the second mate reply then he turn to the skipper someone will have to go up sir and see -- he hesitate but -- say the old man and stop the second mate cut in i shall go up for one sir he say quietly then he turn back to the crowd of we tammy he sing out get a couple of lamp out of the lamp-locker i i sir tammy reply and run off now say the second mate address we i want a couple of man to jump aloft along with I and take a look for stubbin not a man reply i would have like to step out and offer but the memory of that horrible clutch be with I and for the life of I i could not summon up the courage come come man he say we can not leave he up there we shall take lantern who 'll come now i walk out to the front i be in a horrible funk but for very shame i could not stand back any longer i 'll come with you sir i say not very loud and feeling fairly twist up with nervousness that be more the tune jessop he reply in a tone that make I glad i have stand out at this point tammy come up with the light he bring they to the second who take one and tell he to give the other to I the second mate hold he light above he head and look round at the hesitate man now man he sing out you be not go to let jessop and I go up alone come along another one or two of you do not act like a damned lot of coward quoin stand out and speak for the crowd i dunno as we be actin ' like cowyard sir but just look at _ ` im _ and he point at plummer who still stand full in the light from the saloon doorway what sort of a thing be it ` as do that sir he go on a ' then yer arsk we ter go up agen it be not likely as we be in a ` urry the second mate look at plummer and surely as i have before mention the poor beggar be in a state he ripped-up shirt be fairly flap in the breeze that come through the doorway the second look yet he say nothing it be as though the realisation of plummer 's condition have leave he without a word more to say it be plummer himself who finally break the silence i 'll come with yer sir he say only yer ought ter ` ave more light than they two lantern ` two not be no use unless we ` as plenty er light the man have grit and i be astonish at he offer to go after what he must have go through yet i be to have even a greater astonishment for abruptly the skipper -- who all this time have scarcely speak -- step forward a pace and put he hand on the second mate 's shoulder i 'll come with you mr tulipson he say the second mate twist he head round and stare at he a moment in astonishment then he open he mouth no sir i do not think -- he begin that be sufficient mr tulipson the old man interrupted i have make up my mind he turn to the first mate who have stand by without a word mr grainge he say take a couple of the ` prentice down with you and pass out a box of blue-light and some flare-up the mate answer something and hurry away into the saloon with the two ` prentice in he watch then the old man speak to the man now man he begin this be no time for dilly-dally the second mate and i will go aloft and i want about half a dozen of you to come along with we and carry light plummer and jessop here have volunteer i want four or five more of you step out now some of you there be no hesitation whatever now and the first man to come forward be quoin after he follow three of the mate 's crowd and then old jaskett that will do that will do say the old man he turn to the second mate have mr grainge come with those light yet he ask with a certain irritability here sir say the first mate 's voice behind he in the saloon doorway he have the box of blue-light in he hand and behind he come the two boy carry the flare the skipper take the box from he with a quick gesture and open it now one of you man come here he order one of the man in the mate 's watch run to he he take several of the light from the box and hand they to the man see here he say when we go aloft you get into the foretop and keep one of these go all the time do you hear yes sir reply the man you know how to strike they the skipper ask abruptly yes sir he answer the skipper sing out to the second mate : where 's that boy of yours -- tammy mr tulipson here sir say tammy answering for himself the old man take another light from the box listen to I boy he say take this and stand-by on the forrard deck house when we go aloft you must give we a light until the man get he go in the top you understand yes sir answer tammy and take the light one minute say the old man and stoop and take a second light from the box you first light may go out before we be ready you would better have another in case it do tammy take the second light and move away those flare all ready for light there mr grainge the captain ask all ready sir reply the mate the old man push one of the blue-light into he coat pocket and stand upright very well he say give each of the man one apiece and just see that they all have match he speak to the man particularly : as soon as we be ready the other two man in the mate 's watch will get up into the craneline and keep they flare go there take you paraffin tin with you when we reach the upper topsail quoin and jaskett will get out on the yard-arm and show they flare there be careful to keep you light away from the sail plummer and jessop will come up with the second mate and myself do every man clearly understand yes sir say the man in a chorus a sudden idea seem to occur to the skipper and he turn and go through the doorway into the saloon in about a minute he come back and hand something to the second mate that shine in the light from the lantern i see that it be a revolver and he hold another in he other hand and this i see he put into he side pocket the second mate hold the pistol a moment look a bit doubtful i do not think sir -- he begin but the skipper cut he short you do not know he say put it in you pocket then he turn to the first mate you will take charge of the deck mr grainge while we be aloft he say i i sir the mate answer and sing out to one of he ` prentice to take the blue-light box back into the cabin the old man turn and lead the way forrard as we go the light from the two lantern shine upon the deck show the litter of the t ` gallant gear the rope be foul of one another in a regular bunch o ' buffer -lrb- 1 -rrb- this have be cause i suppose by the crowd trample over they in they excitement when they reach the deck and then suddenly as though the sight have wake I up to a more vivid comprehension you know it come to I new and fresh how damned strange be the whole business i get a little touch of despair and ask myself what be go to be the end of all these beastly happening you can understand -lrb- footnote 1 : modify from the original -rrb- abruptly i hear the skipper shout away forward he be sing out to tammy to get up on to the house with he blue-light we reach the fore rigging and the same instant the strange ghastly flare of tammy 's blue-light burst out into the night cause every rope sail and spar to jump out weirdly i saw now that the second mate be already in the starboard rig with he lantern he be shout to tammy to keep the drip from he light clear of the staysail which be stow upon the house then from somewhere on the port side i hear the skipper shout to we to hurry smartly now you man he be say smartly now the man who have be tell to take up a station in the fore-top be just behind the second mate plummer be a couple of ratlin lower i catch the old man 's voice again where 's jessop with that other lantern i hear he shout here sir i sing out bring it over this side he order you do not want the two lantern on one side i run round the fore side of the house then i see he he be in the rigging and make he way smartly aloft one of the mate 's watch and quoin be with he this i see as i come round the house then i make a jump grip the sheerpole and swing myself up on to the rail and then all at once tammy 's blue-light go out and there come what seem by contrast pitchy darkness i stand where i be -- one foot on the rail and my knee upon the sheerpole the light from my lantern seem no more than a sickly yellow glow against the gloom and higher some forty or fifty foot and a few ratlin below the futtock rigging on the starboard side there be another glow of yellowness in the night apart from these all be blackness and then from above -- high above -- there wail down through the darkness a weird sobbing cry what it be i do not know but it sound horrible the skipper 's voice come down jerkily smartly with that light boy he shout and the blue glare blaze out again almost before he have finish speak i stare up at the skipper he be stand where i have see he before the light go out and so be the two man as i look he commence to climb again i glance across to starboard jaskett and the other man in the mate 's watch be about midway between the deck of the house and the foretop they face show extraordinary pale in the dead glare of the blue-light higher i see the second mate in the futtock rigging hold he light up over the edge of the top then he go further and disappear the man with the blue-light follow and also vanish from view on the port side and more directly above I the skipper 's foot be just step out of the futtock shroud at that i make haste to follow then suddenly when i be close under the top there come from above I the sharp flare of a blue-light and almost in the same instant tammy 's go out i glance down at the deck they be fill with flicker grotesque shadow cast by the drip light above a group of the man stand by the port galley door -- they face upturn and pale and unreal under the gleam of the light then i be in the futtock rigging and a moment afterwards stand in the top beside the old man he be shout to the man who have go out on the craneline it seem that the man on the port side be bungle but at last -- nearly a minute after the other man have light he flare -- he get go in that time the man in the top have light he second blue-light and we be ready to get into the topmast rig first however the skipper lean over the afterside of the top and sing out to the first mate to send a man up on to the fo ` cas ` le head with a flare the mate reply and then we start again the old man lead fortunately the rain have cease and there seem to be no increase in the wind indeed if anything there appear to be rather less yet what there be drive the flame of the flare-up out into occasional twist serpent of fire at least a yard long about half-way up the topmast rig the second mate sing out to the skipper to know whether plummer should light he flare but the old man say he have better wait until we reach the crosstree as then he could get out away from the gear to where there would be less danger of set fire to anything we near the crosstree and the old man stop and sing out to I to pass he the lantern by quoin a few ratlin more and both he and the second mate stop almost simultaneously hold they lantern as high as possible and peer up into the darkness see any sign of he mr tulipson the old man ask no sir reply the second not a sign he raise he voice stubbin he sing out stubbin be you there we listen but nothing come to we beyond the blow moan of the wind and the flap flap of the belly t ` gallant above the second mate climb over the crosstree and plummer follow the man get out by the royal backstay and light he flare by its light we could see plainly but there be no vestige of stubbin so far as the light go get out on to the yard-arm with those flare you two man shout the skipper be smart now keep they away from the sail the man get on to the foot-rope -- quoin on the port and jaskett on the starboard side by the light from plummer 's flare i could see they clearly as they lay out upon the yard it occur to I that they go gingerly -- which be no surprising thing and then as they draw near to the yard-arm they pass beyond the brilliance of the light so that i could not see they clearly a few seconds pass and then the light from quoin 's flare stream out upon the wind yet nearly a minute go by and there be no sign of jaskett 's then out from the semi-darkness at the starboard yard-arm there come a curse from jaskett follow almost immediately by a noise of something vibrate what be up shout the second mate what be up jaskett it be ther foot-rope sir-r-r he draw out the last word into a sort of gasp the second mate bent quickly with the lantern i craned round the after side of the top-mast and look what be the matter mr tulipson i hear the old man singing out out on the yard-arm jaskett begin to shout for help and then all at once in the light from the second mate 's lantern i see that the starboard foot-rope on the upper topsail yard be be violently shake -- savagely shake be perhaps a better word and then almost in the same instant the second mate shift the lantern from he right to he left hand he put the right into he pocket and bring out he gun with a jerk he extend he hand and arm as though point at something a little below the yard then a quick flash spat out across the shadow follow immediately by a sharp ringing crack in the same moment i see that the foot-rope cease to shake light you flare light you flare jaskett the second shout be smart now out at the yard-arm there come a splutter of a match and then straightaway a great spurt of fire as the flare take light that be better jaskett you be all right now the second mate call out to he what be it mr tulipson i hear the skipper ask i look up and see that he have spring across to where the second mate be stand the second mate explain to he but he do not speak loud enough for I to catch what he say i have be strike by jaskett 's attitude when the light of he flare have first reveal he he have be crouch with he right knee cock over the yard and he left leg down between it and the foot-rope while he elbow have be crooked over the yard for support as he be light the flare now however he have slide both foot back on to the foot-rope and be lie on he belly over the yard with the flare hold a little below the head of the sail it be thus with the light be on the foreside of the sail that i see a small hole a little below the foot-rope through which a ray of the light shone it be undoubtedly the hole which the bullet from the second mate 's revolver have make in the sail then i hear the old man shout to jaskett be careful with that flare there he sing out you 'll be have that sail scorch he leave the second mate and come back on to the port side of the mast to my right plummer 's flare seem to be dwindle i glance up at he face through the smoke he be pay no attention to it instead he be stare up above he head shove some paraffin on to it plummer i call to he it 'll be out in a minute he look down quickly to the light and do as i suggest then he hold it out at arm 's length and peer up again into the darkness see anything ask the old man suddenly observe he attitude plummer glance at he with a start it be ther r ` yal sir he explain it be all adrift what say the old man he be stand a few ratlin up the t ` gallant rigging and he bent he body outwards to get a better look mr tulipson he shout do you know that the royal 's all adrift no sir answer the second mate if it be it be more of this devilish work it be adrift right enough say the skipper and he and the second go a few ratlin higher keep level with one another i have now get above the crosstree and be just at the old man 's heel suddenly he shout out : there he be -- stubbin stubbin where sir ask the second eagerly i can not see he there there reply the skipper point i lean out from the rigging and look up along he back in the direction he finger indicate at first i could see nothing then slowly you know there grow upon my sight a dim figure crouch upon the bunt of the royal and partly hide by the mast i stare and gradually it come to I that there be a couple of they and further out upon the yard a hump that might have be anything and be only visible indistinctly amid the flutter of the canvas stubbin the skipper sing out stubbin come down out of that do you hear I but no one come and there be no answer there be two -- i begin but he be shout again : come down out of that do you damned well hear I still there be no reply i be hang if i can see he at all sir the second mate call out from he side of the mast can not see he say the old man now thoroughly angry i 'll soon let you see he he bent down to I with the lantern catch hold jessop he say which i do then he pull the blue light from he pocket and as he be do so i see the second peek round the back side of the mast at he evidently in the uncertain light he must have mistake the skipper 's action for all at once he shout out in a frightened voice : do not shoot sir for god 's sake do not shoot shoot be damned exclaim the old man watch he pull off the cap of the light there be two of they sir i call again to he what he say in a loud voice and at the same instant he rub the end of the light across the cap and it burst into fire he hold it up so that it light the royal yard like day and straightway a couple of shape drop silently from the royal on to the t ` gallant yard at the same moment the humped something midway out upon the yard rise up it run in to the mast and i lose sight of it god i hear the skipper gasp and he fumble in he side pocket i see the two figure which have drop on to the t ` gallant run swiftly along the yard -- one to the starboard and the other to the port yard-arm on the other side of the mast the second mate 's pistol crack out twice sharply then from over my head the skipper fire twice and then again but with what effect i could not tell abruptly as he fire he last shot i be aware of a indistinct something glide down the starboard royal backstay it be descend full upon plummer who all unconscious of the thing be stare towards the t ` gallant yard look out above you plummer i almost shriek what where he call and grab at the stay and wave he flare excitedly down on the upper topsail yard quoin 's and jaskett 's voice rise simultaneously and in the identical instant they flare go out then plummer shout and he light go utterly there be leave only the two lantern and the blue-light hold by the skipper and that a few seconds afterwards finish and die out the skipper and the second mate be shout to the man upon the yard and i hear they answer in shaky voice out on the crosstree i could see by the light from my lantern that plummer be hold in a dazed fashion to the backstay be you all right plummer i call yes he say after a little pause and then he swear come in off that yard you man the skipper be sing out come in come in down on deck i hear someone call but could not distinguish the word above I pistol in hand the skipper be glance about uneasily hold up that light jessop he say i can not see below we the man get off the yard into the rig down on deck with you order the old man as smartly as you can come in off there plummer sing out the second mate get down with the other down with you jessop say the skipper speak rapidly down with you i get over the crosstree and he follow on the other side the second mate be level with we he have pass he lantern to plummer and i catch the glint of he revolver in he right hand in this fashion we reach the top the man who have be station there with the blue-light have go afterwards i find that he go down on deck as soon as they be finish there be no sign of the man with the flare on the starboard craneline he also i learn later have slide down one of the backstay on to the deck only a very short while before we reach the top he swear that a great black shadow of a man have come suddenly upon he from aloft when i hear that i remember the thing i have see descend upon plummer yet the man who have go out upon the port craneline -- the one who have bungle with the lighting of he flare -- be still where we have leave he though he light be burn now but dimly come in out of that _ you _ the old man sing out smartly now and get down on deck i i sir the man reply and start to make he way in the skipper wait until he have get into the main rigging and then he tell I to get down out of the top he be in the act of follow when all at once there rise a loud outcry on deck and then come the sound of a man scream get out of my way jessop the skipper roar and swing himself down alongside of I i hear the second mate shout something from the starboard rigging then we be all race down as hard as we could go i have catch a momentary glimpse of a man run from the doorway on the port side of the fo ` cas ` le in less than half a minute we be upon the deck and among a crowd of the man who be group round something yet strangely enough they be not look at the thing among they but away aft at something in the darkness it be on the rail cry several voice overboard call somebody in a excited voice it be jump over the side ther ' wer 'n' t nothin ' say a man in the crowd silence shout the old man where 's the mate what be happen here sir call the first mate shakily from near the center of the group it be jacob sir he -- he -- what say the skipper what he -- he be -- he be -- dead i think say the first mate in jerk let I see say the old man in a quieter tone the man have stand to one side to give he room and he kneel beside the man upon the deck pass the lantern here jessop he say i stand by he and hold the light the man be lie face downward on the deck under the light from the lantern the skipper turn he over and look at he yes he say after a short examination he be dead he stand up and regard the body a moment in silence then he turn to the second mate who have be stand by during the last couple of minute three he say in a grim undertone the second mate nod and clear he voice he seem on the point of say something then he turn and look at jacob and say nothing three repeat the old man since eight bell he stoop and look again at jacob poor devil poor devil he mutter the second mate grunt some of the huskiness out of he throat and speak where must we take he he ask quietly the two bunk be full you 'll have to put he down on the deck by the lower bunk reply the skipper as they carry he away i hear the old man make a sound that be almost a groan the rest of the man have go forrard and i do not think he realize that i be stand by he my god o my god he mutter and begin to walk slowly aft he have cause enough for groan there be three dead and stubbin have go utterly and completely we never see he again xii _ the council _ a few minute later the second mate come forrard again i be still stand near the rig hold the lantern in a aimless sort of way that you plummer he ask no sir i say it be jessop where 's plummer then he inquire i do not know sir i answer i expect he be go forrard shall i go and tell he you want he no there be no need he say tie you lamp up in the rigging -- on the sheerpole there then go and get he and shove it up on the starboard side after that you would better go aft and give the two ` prentice a hand in the lamp locker i i sir i reply and proceed to do as he direct after i have get the light from plummer and lash it up to the starboard sherpole i hurry aft i find tammy and the other ` prentice in we watch busy in the locker lighting lamp what be we do i ask the old man 's give order to lash all the spare lamp we can find in the rig so as to have the deck light say tammy and a damned good job too he hand I a couple of the lamp and take two himself come on he say and step out on deck we 'll fix these in the main rigging and then i want to talk to you what about the mizzen i inquire oh he reply he -lrb- mean the other ` prentice -rrb- will see to that anyway it 'll be daylight directly we shove the lamp up on the sherpole -- two on each side then he come across to I look here jessop he say without any hesitation you 'll have to jolly well tell the skipper and the second mate all you know about all this how do you mean i ask why that it be something about the ship herself that be the cause of what be happen he reply if you would only explain to the second mate when i tell you to this might never have be but i do not _ know _ i say i may be all wrong it be only a idea of mine i have no proof -- proof he cut in with proof what about tonight we have have all the proof ever i want i hesitate before answer he so have i for that matter i say at length what i mean be i have nothing that the skipper and the second mate would consider as proof they would never listen seriously to I they would listen fast enough he reply after what be happen this watch they would listen to anything anyway it be jolly well you duty to tell they what could they do anyway i say despondently as thing be go we 'll all be dead before another week be over at this rate you tell they he answer that be what you have get to do if you can only get they to realize that you be right they 'll be glad to put into the nearest port and send we all ashore i shake my head well anyway they 'll have to do something he reply in answer to my gesture we can not go round the horn with the number of man we have lose we have not enough to handle she if it come on to blow you have forget tammy i say even if i could get the old man to believe i would get at the truth of the matter he could not do anything do not you see if i be right we could not even see the land if we make it we be like blind man what on earth do you mean he interrupt how do you make out we be like blind man of course we could see the land -- wait a minute wait a minute i say you do not understand do not i tell you tell what he ask about the ship i spot i say i think you know no he say when why i reply you know when the old man send I away from the wheel yes he answer you mean in the morning watch day before yesterday yes i say well do not you know what be the matter no he reply that be i hear you be snooze at the wheel and the old man come up and catch you that be all a darned silly yarn i say and then i tell he the whole truth of the affair after i have do that i explain my idea about it to he now you see what i mean i ask you mean that this strange atmosphere -- or whatever it be -- we be in would not allow we to see another ship he ask a bit awestruck yes i say but the point i want you to see be that if we can not see another vessel even when she be quite close then in the same way we should not be able to see land to all intent and purpose we be blind just you think of it we be out in the middle of the briny do a sort of eternal blind man 's hop the old man could not put into port even if he want to he would run we bang on shore without we ever see it what be we go to do then he ask in a despairing sort of way do you mean to say we can not do anything surely something can be do it be terrible for perhaps a minute we walk up and down in the light from the different lantern then he speak again we might be run down then he say and never even see the other vessel it be possible i reply though from what i see it be evident that _ we be _ quite visible so that it would be easy for they to see we and steer clear of we even though we could not see they and we might run into something and never see it he ask I follow up the train of think yes i say only there be nothing to stop the other ship from get out of we way but if it be not a vessel he persist it might be a iceberg or a rock or even a derelict in that case i say put it a bit flippantly naturally we would probably damage it he make no answer to this and for a few moment we be quiet then he speak abruptly as though the idea have come suddenly to he those light the other night he say be they a ship 's light yes i reply why why he answer do not you see if they be really light we _ could _ see they well i should think i ought to know that i reply you seem to forget that the second mate sling I off the look-out for daring to do that very thing i do not mean that he say do not you see that if we could see they at all it show that the atmosphere-thing be not round we then not necessarily i answer it may have be nothing more than a rift in it though of course i may be all wrong but anyway the fact that the light disappear almost as soon as they be see show that it be very much round the ship that make he feel a bit the way i do and when next he speak he tone have lose its hopefulness then you think it 'll be no use tell the second mate and the skipper anything he ask i do not know i reply i have be think about it and it can not do any harm i have a very good mind to i should he say you need not be afraid of anybody laughing at you now it might do some good you have see more than anyone else he stop in he walk and look round wait a minute he say and run aft a few step i see he look up at the break of the poop then he come back come along now he say the old man 's up on the poop talk to the second mate you 'll never get a better chance still i hesitate but he catch I by the sleeve and almost drag I to the lee ladder all right i say when i get there all right i 'll come only i be hang if i know what to say when i get there just tell they you want to speak to they he say they 'll ask what you want and then you spit out all you know they 'll find it interesting enough you would better come too i suggest you 'll be able to back I up in lot of thing i 'll come fast enough he reply you go up i go up the ladder and walk across to where the skipper and the second mate stand talk earnestly by the rail tammy keep behind as i come near to they i catch two or three word though i attach no meaning then to they they be : send for he then the two of they turn and look at I and the second mate ask what i want i want to speak to you and the old m -- captain sir i answer what be it jessop the skipper inquire i scarcely know how to put it sir i say it be -- it be about these -- these thing what thing speak out man he say well sir i blurt out there be some dreadful thing or thing come aboard this ship since we leave port i see he give one quick glance at the second mate and the second look back then the skipper reply how do you mean come aboard he ask out of the sea sir i say i have see they so be tammy here ah he exclaim and it seem to I from he face that he be understand something better out of the sea again he look at the second mate but the second be stare at I yes sir i say it be the _ ship _ she be not safe i have watch i think i understand a bit but there be a lot i do not i stop the skipper have turn to the second mate the second nod gravely then i hear he mutter in a low voice and the old man reply after which he turn to I again look here jessop he say i be go to talk straight to you you strike I as be a cut above the ordinary shellback and i think you have sense enough to hold you tongue i have get my mate 's ticket sir i say simply behind I i hear tammy give a little start he have not know about it until then the skipper nod so much the better he answer i may have to speak to you about that later on he pause and the second mate say something to he in a undertone yes he say as though in reply to what the second have be say then he speak to I again you have see thing come out of the sea you say he question now just tell I all you can remember from the very begin i set to and tell he everything in detail commence with the strange figure that have step aboard out of the sea and continue my yarn up to the thing that have happen in that very watch i stick well to solid fact and now and then he and the second mate would look at one another and nod at the end he turn to I with a abrupt gesture you still hold then that you see a ship the other morning when i send you from the wheel he ask yes sir i say i most certainly do but you know there be not any he say yes sir i reply in a apologetic tone there be and if you will let I i believe that i can explain it a bit well he say go on now that i know he be willing to listen to I in a serious manner all my funk of tell he have go and i go ahead and tell he my idea about the mist and the thing it seem to have usher you know i finish up by tell he how tammy have worry I to come and tell what i know he think then sir i go on that you might wish to put into the nearest port but i tell he that i do not think you could even if you want to how 's that he ask profoundly interested well sir i reply if we be unable to see other vessel we should not be able to see the land you would be pile the ship up without ever see where you be put she this view of the matter affect the old man in a extraordinary manner as it do i believe the second mate and neither speak for a moment then the skipper burst out by gad jessop he say if you be right the lord have mercy on we he think for a couple of seconds then he speak again and i could see that he be pretty well twist up : my god if you be right the second mate speak the man must not know sir he warn he it would be a mess if they do yes say the old man he speak to I remember that jessop he say whatever you do do not go yarn about this forrard no sir i reply and you too boy say the skipper keep you tongue between you tooth we be in a bad enough mess without you make it worse do you hear yes sir answer tammy the old man turn to I again these thing or creature that you say come out of the sea he say you have never see they except after nightfall he ask no sir i reply never he turn to the second mate so far as i can make out mr tulipson he remark the danger seem to be only at night it be always be at night sir the second answer the old man nod have you anything to propose mr tulipson he ask well sir reply the second mate i think you ought to have she snug down every night before dark he speak with considerable emphasis then he glance aloft and jerk he head in the direction of the unfurled t ` gallant it be a damned good thing sir he say that it do not come on to blow any harder the old man nod again yes he remark we shall have to do it but god know when we 'll get home better late than not at all i hear the second mutter under he breath out loud he say : and the light sir yes say the old man i will have lamp in the rig every night after dark very good sir assent the second then he turn to we it be get daylight jessop he remark with a glance at the sky you would better take tammy with you and shove those lamp back again into the locker i i sir i say and go down off the poop with tammy xiii _ the shadow in the sea _ when eight bell go at four o'clock and the other watch come on deck to relieve we it have be broad daylight for some time before we go below the second mate have the three t ` gallant set and now that it be light we be pretty curious to have a look aloft especially up the fore and tom who have be up to overhaul the gear be question a lot when he come down as to whether there be any sign of anything queer up there but he tell we there be nothing unusual to be see at eight o'clock when we come on deck for the eight to twelve watch i see the sailmaker come forrard along the deck from the second mate 's old berth he have he rule in he hand and i know he have be measure the poor beggar in there for they burial outfit from breakfast time until near noon he work shape out three canvas wrapper from some old sailcloth then with the aid of the second mate and one of the hand he bring out the three dead chap on to the after hatch and there sew they up with a few lump of holy stone at they foot he be just finish when eight bell go and i hear the old man tell the second mate to call all hand aft for the burial this be do and one of the gangway unshipp we have no decent grate big enough so they have to get off one of the hatch and use it instead the wind have die away during the morning and the sea be almost a calm -- the ship lifting ever so slightly to a occasional glassy heave the only sound that strike on the ear be the soft slow rustle and occasional shiver of the sail and the continuous and monotonous creak creak of the spar and gear at the gentle movement of the vessel and it be in this solemn half-quietness that the skipper read the burial service they have put the dutchman first upon the hatch -lrb- i could tell he by he stumpiness -rrb- and when at last the old man give the signal the second mate tilted he end and he slide off and down into the dark poor old dutchie i hear one of the man say and i fancy we all feel a bit like that then they lift jacob on to the hatch and when he have go jock when jock be lift a sort of sudden shiver run through the crowd he have be a favorite in a quiet way and i know i feel all at once just a bit queer i be stand by the rail upon the after bollard and tammy be next to I while plummer stand a little behind as the second mate tilted the hatch for the last time a little hoarse chorus break from the man : s ` long jock so long jock and then at the sudden plunge they rush to the side to see the last of he as he go downwards even the second mate be not able to resist this universal feeling and he too peer over from where i have be stand i have be able to see the body take the water and now for a brief couple of seconds i see the white of the canvas blur by the blue of the water dwindle and dwindle in the extreme depth abruptly as i stare it disappear -- too abruptly it seem to I go i hear several voice say and then we watch begin to go slowly forrard while one or two of the other start to replace the hatch tammy point and nudge I see jessop he say what be it what i ask that queer shadow he reply look and then i see what he mean it be something big and shadowy that appear to be grow clearer it occupy the exact place -- so it seem to I -- in which jock have disappear look at it say tammy again it be get bigger he be pretty excite and so be i i be peer down the thing seem to be rise out of the depths it be take shape as i realize what the shape be a queer cold funk take I see say tammy it be just like the shadow of a ship and it be the shadow of a ship rise out of the unexplored immensity beneath we keel plummer who have not yet go forrard catch tammy 's last remark and glance over what be ' e mean he ask that reply tammy and point i jab my elbow into he rib but it be too late plummer have see curiously enough though he seem to think nothing of it that be not nothin ' ` cept ther shadder er ther ship he say tammy after my hint let it go at that but when plummer have go forrard with the other i tell he not to go tell everything round the deck like that we have get to be thunder careful i remark you know what the old man say last watch yes say tammy i be not think i 'll be careful next time a little way from I the second mate be still stare down into the water i turn and speak to he what do you make it out to be sir i ask god know he say with a quick glance round to see whether any of the man be about he get down from the rail and turn to go up on to the poop at the top of the ladder he lean over the break you may as well ship that gangway you two he tell we and mind jessop keep you mouth shut about this i i sir i answer and you too youngster he add and go aft along the poop tammy and i be busy with the gangway when the second come back he have bring the skipper right under the gangway sir i hear the second say and he point down into the water for a little while the old man stare then i hear he speak i do not see anything he say at that the second mate bent more forward and peer down so do i but the thing whatever it be have go completely it be go sir say the second it be there right enough when i come for you about a minute later have finish ship the gangway i be go forrard when the second 's voice call I back tell the captain what it be you see just now he say in a low voice i can not say exactly sir i reply but it seem to I like the shadow of a ship rise up through the water there sir remark the second mate to the old man just what i tell you the skipper stare at I you be quite sure he ask yes sir i answer tammy see it too i wait a minute then they turn to go aft the second be say something can i go sir i ask yes that will do jessop he say over he shoulder but the old man come back to the break and speak to I remember not a word of this forrard he say no sir i reply and he go back to the second mate while i walk forrard to the fo ` cas ` le to get something to eat you whack 's in the kettle jessop say tom as i step in over the washboard a ' i get you lime-juice in a pannikin thanks i say and sit down as i stow away my grub i take no notice of the chatter of the other i be too stuff with my own thought that shadow of a vessel rise you know out of the profound deep have impressed I tremendously it have not be imagination three of we have see it -- really four for plummer distinctly see it though he fail to recognize it as anything extraordinary as you can understand i think a lot about this shadow of a vessel but i be sure for a time my idea must just have go in a everlasting blind circle and then i get another think for i get thinking of the figure i have see aloft in the early morning and i begin to imagine fresh thing you see that first thing that have come up over the side have come _ out of the sea _ and it have go back and now there be this shadow vessel-thing -- ghost-ship i call it it be a damned good name too and the dark noiseless man i think a lot on these line unconsciously i put a question to myself aloud : be they the crew eh say jaskett who be on the next chest i take hold of myself as it be and glance at he in a apparently careless manner do i speak i ask yes mate he reply eye I curiously yer say sumthin ' about a crew i must have be dream i say and rise up to put away my plate xiv _ the ghost ship _ at four o'clock when again we go on deck the second mate tell I to go on with a paunch mat i be make while tammy he send to get out he sinnet i have the mat slug on the fore side of the mainmast between it and the after end of the house and in a few minute tammy bring he sinnet and yarn to the mast and make fast to one of the pin what do you think it be jessop he ask abruptly after a short silence i look at he what do you think i reply i do not know what to think he say but i have a feeling that it be something to do with all the rest and he indicate aloft with he head i have be think too i remark that it be he inquire yes i answer and tell he how the idea have come to I at my dinner that the strange men-shadow which come aboard might come from that indistinct vessel we have see down in the sea good lord he exclaim as he get my meaning and then for a little he stand and think that be where they live you mean he say at last and pause again well i reply it can not be the sort of existence _ we _ should call life he nod doubtfully no he say and be silent again presently he put out a idea that have come to he you _ think _ then that that -- vessel have be with we for some time if we would only know he ask all along i reply i mean ever since these thing start suppose there be other he say suddenly i look at he if there be i say you can pray to god that they will not stumble across we it strike I that whether they be ghost or not ghost they be blood-gutted pirate it seem horrible he say solemnly to be talk seriously like this about -- you know about such thing i have try to stop think that way i tell he i have feel i should go crack if i do not there be damned queer thing happen at sea i know but this be not one of they it seem so strange and unreal one moment do not it he say and the next you _ know _ it be really true and you can not understand why you do not always know and yet they would never believe if you tell they ashore about it they would believe if they would be in this packet in the middle watch this morning i say besides i go on they do not understand we do not i shall always feel different now when i read that some packet have not be hear of tammy stare at I i have hear some of the old shellback talk about thing he say but i never take they really seriously well i say i guess we 'll have to take this seriously i wish to god we be home my god so do i he say for a good while after that we both work on in silence but presently he go off on another tack do you think we 'll really shorten she down every night before it get dark he ask certainly i reply they 'll never get the man to go aloft at night after what be happen but but -- suppose they _ order _ we aloft -- he begin would you go i interrupted no he say emphatically i would jolly well be put in iron first that settle it then i reply you would not go nor would any one else at this moment the second mate come along shove that mat and that sinnet away you two he say then get you broom and clear up i i sir we say and he go on forrard jump on the house tammy i say and let go the other end of this rope will you right he say and do as i have ask he when he come back i get he to give I a hand to roll up the mat which be a very large one i 'll finish stop it i say you go and put you sinnet away wait a minute he reply and gather up a double handful of shakin from the deck under where i have be work then he run to the side here i say do not go dump those they 'll only float and the second mate or the skipper will be sure to spot they come here jessop he interrupt in a low voice and take no notice of what i have be say i get up off the hatch where i be kneel he be stare over the side what be up i ask for god 's sake hurry he say and i run and jump on to the spar alongside of he look he say and point with a handful of shakin right down directly beneath we some of the shakin drop from he hand and blur the water momentarily so that i could not see then as the ripple clear away i see what he mean two of they he say in a voice that be scarcely above a whisper and there be another out there and he point again with the handful of shakin there be another a little further aft i muttered where -- where he ask there i say and point that be four he whisper four of they i say nothing but continue to stare they appear to I to be a great way down in the sea and quite motionless yet though they outline be somewhat blur and indistinct there be no mistaking that they be very like exact though shadowy representation of vessel for some minute we watch they without speak at last tammy speak they be real right enough he say in a low voice i do not know i answer i mean we be not mistake this morning he say no i reply i never think we be away forrard i hear the second mate return aft he come nearer and see we what be up now you two he call sharply this be not clear up i put out my hand to warn he not to shout and draw the attention of the rest of the man he take several step towards I what be it what be it he say with a certain irritability but in a lower voice you would better take a look over the side sir i reply my tone must have give he a inkling that we have discover something fresh for at my word he make one spring and stand on the spar alongside of I look sir say tammy there be four of they the second mate glance down see something and bent sharply forward my god i hear he mutter under he breath after that for some half-minute he stare without a word there be two more out there sir i tell he and indicate the place with my finger it be a little time before he manage to locate these and when he do he give they only a short glance then he get down off the spar and speak to we come down off there he say quickly get you broom and clear up do not say a word -- it may be nothing he appear to add that last bit as a afterthought and we both know it mean nothing then he turn and go swiftly aft i expect he be go to tell the old man tammy remark as we go forrard carry the mat and he sinnet h be i say scarcely notice what he be say for i be full of the thought of those four shadowy craft wait quietly down there we get we broom and go aft on the way the second mate and the skipper pass we they go forrard too by the fore brace and get up on the spar i see the second point up at the brace and he appear to be say something about the gear i guess that this be do purposely to act as a blind should any of the other man be look then the old man glance down over the side in a casual sort of manner so do the second mate a minute or two later they come aft and go back up on to the poop i catch a glimpse of the skipper 's face as he pass I on he return he strike I as look worried -- bewildered perhaps would be a better word both tammy and i be tremendously keen to have another look but when at last we get a chance the sky reflect so much on the water we could see nothing below we have just finish sweep up when four bell go and we clear below for tea some of the man get chat while they be grub i ` ave ` eard remark quoin as we be goin ' ter shorten ` er down afore dark eh say old jaskett over he pannikin of tea quoin repeat he remark ` oo say so inquire plummer i ` eard it from ther doc answer quoin ' e get it from ther stooard ` ow would ` ee know ask plummer i dunno say quoin i ` spect ` e 's ` eard 'em talkin ' ` bout it arft plummer turn to I ` ave you ` eard anythin ' jessop he inquire what about shorten down i reply yes he say be not ther old man talkin ' ter yer up on ther poop this mornin ' yes i answer he say something to the second mate about shorten down but it be not to I they be say quoin ` ave not i just say so at that instant one of the chap in the other watch poke he head in through the starboard doorway all hand shorten sail he sing out at the same moment the mate 's whistle come sharp along the deck plummer stand up and reach for he cap well he say it be evydent they be not goin ' ter lose no more of we then we go out on deck it be a dead calm but all the same we furl the three royal and then the three t ` gallant after that we haul up the main and foresail and stow they the crossjack of course have be furl some time with the wind be plumb aft it be while we be up at the foresail that the sun go over the edge of the horizon we have finish stow the sail out upon the yard and i be wait for the other to clear in and let I get off the foot-rope thus it happen that have nothing to do for nearly a minute i stand watch the sun set and so see something that otherwise i should most probably have miss the sun have dip nearly half-way below the horizon and be show like a great red dome of dull fire abruptly far away on the starboard bow a faint mist drive up out of the sea it spread across the face of the sun so that its light shone now as though it come through a dim haze of smoke quickly this mist or haze grow thicker but at the same time separate and take strange shape so that the red of the sun strike through ruddily between they then as i watch the weird mistiness collect and shape and rise into three tower these become more definite and there be something elongate beneath they the shaping and form continued and almost suddenly i see that the thing have take on the shape of a great ship directly afterwards i see that it be move it have be broadside on to the sun now it be swing the bow come round with a stately movement until the three mast bear in a line it be head directly towards we it grow larger but yet less distinct astern of it i saw now that the sun have sink to a mere line of light then in the gathering dusk it seem to I that the ship be sink back into the ocean the sun go beneath the sea and the thing i have see become merge as it be into the monotonous greyness of the come night a voice come to I from the rig it be the second mate 's he have be up to give we a hand now then jessop he be say come along come along i turn quickly and realize that the fellow be nearly all off the yard i i sir i mutter and slide in along the foot-rope and go down on deck i feel fresh dazed and frighten a little later eight bell go and after roll call i clear up on to the poop to relieve the wheel for a while as i stand at the wheel my mind seem blank and incapable of receive impression this sensation go after a time and i realize that there be a great stillness over the sea there be absolutely no wind and even the everlasting creak creak of the gear seem to ease off at time at the wheel there be nothing whatever to do i might just as well have be forrard smoking in the fo ` cas ` le down on the main-deck i could see the loom of the lantern that have be lash up to the sherpole in the fore and main rigging yet they show less than they might owe to the fact that they have be shaded on they after side so as not to blind the officer of the watch more than need be the night have come down strangely dark and yet of the dark and the stillness and the lantern i be only conscious in occasional flash of comprehension for now that my mind be work i be think chiefly of that queer vast phantom of mist i have see rise from the sea and take shape i keep stare into the night towards the west and then all round I for naturally the memory predominate that she have be come towards we when the darkness come and it be a pretty disquieting sort of thing to think about i have such a horrible feeling that something beastly be go to happen any minute yet two bell come and go and still all be quiet -- strangely quiet it seem to I and of course besides the queer misty vessel i have see in the west i be all the time remember the four shadowy craft lie down in the sea under we port side every time i remember they i feel thankful for the lantern round the maindeck and i wonder why none have be put in the mizzen rigging i wish to goodness that they have and make up my mind i would speak to the second mate about it next time he come aft at the time he be lean over the rail across the break of the poop he be not smoking as i could tell for have he be i should have see the glow of he pipe now and then it be plain to I that he be uneasy three time already he have be down on to the maindeck prowl about i guess that he have be to look down into the sea for any sign of those four grim craft i wonder whether they would be visible at night suddenly the time-keeper strike three bell and the deeper note of the bell forrard answer they i give a start it seem to I that they have be strike close to my elbow there be something unaccountably strange in the air that night then even as the second mate answer the look-out 's all 's well there come the sharp whir and rattle of run gear on the port side of the mainmast simultaneously there be the shrieking of a parrel up the main and i know that someone or something have let go the main-topsail haul-yard from aloft there come the sound of something parting then the crash of the yard as it cease fall the second mate shout out something unintelligible and jump for the ladder from the maindeck there come the sound of run foot and the voice of the watch shout then i catch the skipper 's voice he must have run out on deck through the saloon doorway get some more lamp get some more lamp he be sing out then he swear he sing out something further i catch the last two word carry away they sound like no sir shout the second mate i do not think so a minute of some confusion follow and then come the click of pawl i could tell that they have take the haulyard to the after capstan odd word float up to I all this water i hear in the old man 's voice he appear to be ask a question can not say sir come the second mate 's there be a period of time fill only by the clicking of the pawl and the sound of the creaking parrel and the run gear then the second mate 's voice come again seem all right sir i hear he say i never hear the old man 's reply for in the same moment there come to I a chill of cold breath at my back i turn sharply and see something peer over the taffrail it have eye that reflect the binnacle light weirdly with a frightful tigerish gleam but beyond that i could see nothing with any distinctness for the moment i just stare i seem frozen it be so close then movement come to I and i jump to the binnacle and snatch out the lamp i twitched round and shine the light towards it the thing whatever it be have come more forward over the rail but now before the light it recoil with a queer horrible litheness it slide back and down and so out of sight i have only a confused notion of a wet glisten something and two vile eye then i be run crazy towards the break of the poop i spring down the ladder and miss my footing and land on my stern at the bottom in my left hand i hold the still burn binnacle lamp the man be put away the capstan-bar but at my abrupt appearance and the yell i give out at fall one or two of they fairly run backwards a short distance in sheer funk before they realize what it be from somewhere further forrard the old man and the second mate come run aft what the devil 's up now sing out the second stop and bend to stare at I what be to do that you be away from the wheel i stand up and try to answer he but i be so shake that i could only stammer i -- i -- there -- i stutter damnation shout the second mate angrily get back to the wheel i hesitate and try to explain do you damned well hear I he sing out yes sir but -- i begin get up on to the poop jessop he say i go i mean to explain when he come up at the top of the ladder i stop i be not go back alone to that wheel down below i hear the old man speak what on earth be it now mr tulipson he be say the second mate make no immediate reply but turn to the man who be evidently crowd near that will do man he say somewhat sharply i hear the watch start to go forrard there come a mutter of talk from they then the second mate answer the old man he could not have know that i be near enough to overhear he it be jessop sir he must have see something but we must not frighten the crowd more than need be no say the skipper 's voice they turn and come up the ladder and i run back a few step as far as the skylight i hear the old man speak as they come up how be it there be no lamp mr tulipson he say in a surprised tone i think there would be no need up here sir the second mate reply then he add something about save oil better have they i think i hear the skipper say very good sir answer the second and sing out to the time-keeper to bring up a couple of lamp then the two of they walk aft to where i stand by the skylight what be you do away from the wheel ask the old man in a stern voice i have collect my wit somewhat by now i will not go sir till there be a light i say the skipper stamp he foot angrily but the second mate step forward come come jessop he exclaim this will not do you know you would better get back to the wheel without further bother wait a minute say the skipper at this juncture what objection have you to go back to the wheel he ask i see something i say it be climb over the taffrail sir -- ah he say interrupt I with a quick gesture then abruptly : sit down sit down you be all in a shake man i flop down on to the skylight seat i be as he have say all in a shake and the binnacle lamp be wobble in my hand so that the light from it go dancing here and there across the deck now he go on just tell we what you see i tell they at length and while i be do so the time-keeper bring up the light and lash one up on the sheerpole in each rig shove one under the spanker boom the old man sing out as the boy finish lash up the other two be smart now i i sir say the ` prentice and hurry off now then remark the skipper when this have be do you need not be afraid to go back to the wheel there be a light over the stern and the second mate or myself will be up here all the time i stand up thank you sir i say and go aft i replace my lamp in the binnacle and take hold of the wheel yet time and again i glance behind and i be very thankful when a few minute later four bell go and i be relieve though the rest of the chap be forrard in the fo ` cas ` le i do not go there i shirk be question about my sudden appearance at the foot of the poop ladder and so i light my pipe and wander about the maindeck i do not feel particularly nervous as there be now two lantern in each rigging and a couple standing upon each of the spare top-mast under the bulwark yet a little after five bell it seem to I that i see a shadowy face peer over the rail a little abaft the fore lanyard i snatch up one of the lantern from off the spar and flash the light towards it whereupon there be nothing only on my mind more than my sight i fancy a queer knowledge remain of wet peery eye afterwards when i think about they i feel extra beastly i know then how brutal they have be inscrutable you know once more in that same watch i have a somewhat similar experience only in this instance it have vanish even before i have time to reach a light and then come eight bell and we watch below xv _ the great ghost ship _ when we be call again at a quarter to four the man who rouse we out have some queer information toppin 's go -- clean vanish he tell we as we begin to turn out i never be in such a damned hair-raisin ' hooker as this here it be not safe to go about the bloomin ' deck ` oo 's go ask plummer sit up suddenly and throw he leg over he bunk-board toppin one of the ` prentice reply the man we have be huntin ' all over the bloomin ' show we be still at it -- but we 'll never find he he end with a sort of gloomy assurance oh i dunno say quoin p ` rap ` e 's snoozin ' somewhere ` bout not he reply the man i tell you we have turn everythin ' upside down he be not aboard the bloomin ' ship where be he when they last see he i ask someone must know something you know keepin ' time up on the poop he reply the old man 's nearly shake the life out of the mate and the chap at the wheel and they say they do not know nothin ' how do you mean i inquire how do you mean nothing well he answer the youngster be there one minute and then the next thing they know he would go they have both swear black a ' blue that there be not a whisper he be just disappear off of the face of the bloomin ' earth i get down on to my chest and reach for my boot before i could speak again the man be say something fresh see here mate he go on if thing be goin ' on like this i would like to know where you a ' I 'll be befor ' long we 'll be in ` ell say plummer i dunno as i like to think ` bout it say quoin we 'll have to think about it reply the man we have get to think a bloomin ' lot about it i have talk to we side a ' they be game game for what i ask to go a ' talk straight to the bloomin ' capt he say wag he finger at I it be make track for the nearest bloomin ' port a ' do not you make no bloomin ' mistake i open my mouth to tell he that the probability be we should not be able to make it even if he could get the old man to see the matter from he point of view then i remember that the chap have no idea of the thing i have see and _ think out _ so instead i say : suppose he will not then we 'll have to bloomin ' well make he he reply and when you get there i say what then you would be jolly well lock up for mutiny i would sooner be lock up he say it do not kill you there be a murmur of agreement from the other and then a moment of silence in which i know the man be think jaskett 's voice break into it i never think at first as she be ` aunt -- he commence but plummer cut in across he speech we must not ` urt any one yer know he say that would mean ` angin ' a ' they be not be er bad crowd no assent everyone include the chap who have come to call we all the same he add it be get to be up hellum a ' shove she into the nearest bloomin ' port yes say everyone and then eight bell go and we clear out on deck presently after roll-call -- in which there have come a queer awkward little pause at toppin 's name -- tammy come over to I the rest of the man have go forrard and i guess they be talk over mad plan for force the skipper 's hand and make he put into port -- poor beggar i be lean over the port rail by the fore brace-lock stare down into the sea when tammy come to I for perhaps a minute he say nothing when at last he speak it be to say that the shadow vessel have not be there since daylight what i say in some surprise how do you know i wake up when they be search for toppin he reply i have not be asleep since i come here right away he begin to say something further but stop short yes i say encouragingly i do not know -- he begin and break off he catch my arm oh jessop he exclaim what be go to be the end of it all surely something can be do i say nothing i have a desperate feeling that there be very little we could do to help ourselves can not we do something he ask and shake my arm anything 's better than _ this _ we be be _ murder _ still i say nothing but stare moodily down into the water i could plan nothing though i would get mad feverish fit of think do you hear he say he be almost cry yes tammy i reply but i do not know i _ do not _ know you do not know he exclaim you do not know do you mean we be just to give in and be murder one after another we have do all we can i reply i do not know what else we can do unless we go below and lock ourselves in every night that would be better than this he say there 'll be no one to go below or anything else soon but what if it come on to blow i ask we would be have the stick blow out of she what if it come on to blow _ now _ he return no one would go aloft if it be dark you say yourself besides we could shorten she _ right _ down first i tell you in a few day there will not be a chap alive aboard this packet unless they jolly well do something do not shout i warn he you 'll have the old man hearing you but the young beggar be wind up and would take no notice i will shout he reply i want the old man to hear i have a good mind to go up and tell he he start on a fresh tack why do not the man do something he begin they ought to damn well make the old man put we into port they ought -- for goodness sake shut up you little fool i say what be the good of talk a lot of damned rot like that you 'll be get yourself into trouble i do not care he reply i be not go to be murder look here i say i tell you before that we should not be able to see the land even if we make it you have no proof he answer it be only you idea well i reply proof or no proof the skipper would only pile she up if he try to make the land with thing as they be now let he pile she up he answer let he jolly well pile she up that would be better than stay out here to be pull overboard or chuck down from aloft look here tammy -- i begin but just then the second mate sing out for he and he have to go when he come back i have start to walk to and from across the fore side of the mainmast he join I and after a minute he start he wild talk again look here tammy i say once more it be no use you talk like you have be do thing be as they be and it be no one 's fault and nobody can help it if you want to talk sensibly i 'll listen if not then go and gas to someone else with that i return to the port side and get up on the spar again intend to sit on the pinrail and have a bit of a talk with he before sit down i glance over into the sea the action have be almost mechanical yet after a few instant i be in a state of the most intense excitement and without withdraw my gaze i reach out and catch tammy 's arm to attract he attention my god i muttered look what be it he ask and bent over the rail beside I and this be what we see : a little distance below the surface there lay a pale-coloured slightly-domed disc it seem only a few foot down below it we see quite clearly after a few moment 's stare the shadow of a royal-yard and deeper the gear and standing-rigging of a great mast far down among the shadow i think presently that i could make out the immense indefinite stretch of vast deck my god whisper tammy and shut up but presently he give out a short exclamation as though a idea have come to he and get down off the spar and run forrard on to the fo ` cas ` le head he come run back after a short look into the sea to tell I that there be the truck of another great mast come up there a bit off the bow to within a few foot of the surface of the sea in the meantime you know i have be stare like mad down through the water at the huge shadowy mast just below I i have trace out bit by bit until now i could clearly see the jackstay run along the top of the royal mast and you know the royal itself be _ set _ but you know what be get at I more than anything be a feeling that there be movement down in the water there among the rigging i _ think _ i could actually see at time thing move and glint faintly and rapidly to and fro in the gear and once i be practically certain that something be on the royal-yard move in to the mast as though you know it might have come up the leech of the sail and this way i get a beastly feeling that there be thing swarm down there unconsciously i must have lean further and further out over the side stare and suddenly -- good lord how i yell -- i overbalanced i make a sweeping grab and catch the fore brace and with that i be back in a moment upon the spar in the same second almost it seem to I that the surface of the water above the submerge truck be break and i be sure _ now _ i see something a moment in the air against the ship 's side -- a sort of shadow in the air though i do not realize it at the time anyway the next instant tammy give out a awful scream and be head downward over the rail in a second i have a idea _ then _ that he be jump overboard i collar he by the waist of he britcher and one knee and then i have he down on the deck and sit plump on he for he be struggle and shout all the time and i be so breathless and shake and go to mush i could not have trust my hand to hold he you see i never think _ then _ it be anything but some influence at work on he and that he be try to get loose to go over the side but i know _ now _ that i see the shadow-man that have he only at the time i be so mixed up and with the one idea in my head i be not really able to notice anything properly but afterwards i comprehend a bit -lrb- you can understand can not you -rrb- what i have see at the time without take in and even now look back i know that the shadow be only like a faint-seen greyness in the daylight against the whiteness of the deck cling against tammy and there be i all breathless and sweating and quivery with my own tumble sit on the little screeching beggar and he fight like a mad thing so that i think i should never hold he and then i hear the second mate shout and there come run foot along the deck then many hand be pull and haul to get I off he bl -- y cowyard sing out someone hold he hold he i shout he 'll be overboard at that they seem to understand that i be not ill-treat the youngster for they stop manhandle I and allow I to rise while two of they take hold of tammy and keep he safe what be the matter with he the second mate be sing out what be happen he be go off he head i think i say what ask the second mate but before i could answer he tammy cease suddenly to struggle and flop down upon the deck ` e 's faint say plummer with some sympathy he look at I with a puzzle suspicious air what be ` appen what be ' e be doin ' take he aft into the berth order the second mate a bit abruptly it strike I that he wish to prevent question he must have tumble to the fact that we have see something about which it would be better not to tell the crowd plummer stoop to lift the boy no say the second mate not you plummer jessop you take he he turn to the rest of the man that will do he tell they and they go forrard mutter a little i lift the boy and carry he aft no need to take he into the berth say the second mate put he down on the after hatch i have send the other lad for some brandy then the brandy come we dose tammy and soon bring he round he sit up with a somewhat dazed air otherwise he seem quiet and sane enough what be up he ask he catch sight of the second mate have i be ill sir he exclaim you be right enough now youngster say the second mate you have be a bit off you would better go and lie down for a bit i be all right now sir reply tammy i do not think -- you do as you be tell interrupted the second do not always have to be tell twice if i want you i 'll send for you tammy stand up and make he way in rather a unsteady fashion into the berth i fancy he be glad enough to lie down now then jessop exclaim the second mate turn to I what be be the cause of all this out with it now smart i commence to tell he but almost directly he put up he hand hold on a minute he say there be the breeze he jump up the port ladder and sing out to the chap at the wheel then down again starboard fore brace he sing out he turn to I you 'll have to finish tell I afterwards he say i i sir i reply and go to join the other chap at the brace as soon as we be brace sharp up on the port tack he send some of the watch up to loose the sail then he sing out for I go on with you yarn now jessop he say i tell he about the great shadow vessel and i say something about tammy -- i mean about my not be sure _ now _ whether he _ have _ try to jump overboard because you see i begin to realize that i have see the shadow and i remember the stir of the water above the submerge truck but the second do not wait of course for any theory but be away like a shot to see for himself he run to the side and look down i follow and stand beside he yet now that the surface of the water be blur by the wind we could see nothing it be no good he remark after a minute you would better get away from the rail before any of the other see you just be take those halyard aft to the capstan from then until eight bell we be hard at work get the sail upon she and when at last eight bell go i make haste to swallow my breakfast and get a sleep at midday when we go on deck for the afternoon watch i run to the side but there be no sign of the great shadow ship all that watch the second mate keep I work at my paunch mat and tammy he put on to he sinnet tell I to keep a eye on the youngster but the boy be right enough as i scarcely doubt now you know though -- a most unusual thing -- he hardly open he lip the whole afternoon then at four o'clock we go below for tea at four bell when we come on deck again i find that the light breeze which have keep we go during the day have drop and we be only just move the sun be low down and the sky clear once or twice as i glance across to the horizon it seem to I that i catch again that odd quiver in the air that have precede the come of the mist and indeed on two separate occasion i see a thin whisp of haze drive up apparently out of the sea this be at some little distance on we port beam otherwise all be quiet and peaceful and though i stare into the water i could make out no vestige of that great shadow ship down in the sea it be some little time after six bell that the order come for all hand to shorten sail for the night we take in the royal and t ` gallant and then the three course it be shortly after this that a rumor go round the ship that there be to be no look-out that night after eight o'clock this naturally create a good deal of talk among the man especially as the yarn go that the fo ` cas ` le door be to be shut and fasten as soon as it be dark and that no one be to be allow on deck ` oo 's goin ' ter take ther wheel i hear plummer ask i s ` pose they 'll ` ave we take 'em as usual reply one of the man one of ther officer be bind ter be on ther poop so we 'll ` ave company apart from these remark there be a general opinion that -- if it be true -- it be a sensible act on the part of the skipper as one of the man say : it be not likely that there 'll be any of we missin ' in ther mornin ' if we stay in we bunk all ther bless night and soon after this eight bell go xvi _ the ghost pirate _ at the moment when eight bell actually go i be in the fo ` cas ` le talk to four of the other watch suddenly away aft i hear shout and then on the deck overhead come the loud thudding of someone pomp with a capstan-bar straightway i turn and make a run for the port doorway along with the four other man we rush out through the doorway on to the deck it be get dusk but that do not hide from I a terrible and extraordinary sight all along the port rail there be a queer undulating greyness that move downward inboard and spread over the deck as i look i find that i see more clearly in a most extraordinary way and suddenly all the move greyness resolve into hundred of strange man in the half-light they look unreal and impossible as though there have come upon we the inhabitant of some fantastic dream-world my god i think i be mad they swarm in upon we in a great wave of murderous living shadow from some of the man who must have be go aft for roll-call there rise into the evening air a loud awful shout aloft yell someone but as i look aloft i see that the horrible thing be swarm there in score and score jesus christ -- shriek a man 's voice cut short and my glance drop from aloft to find two of the man who have come out from the fo ` cas ` le with I roll upon the deck they be two indistinguishable mass that writhe here and there across the plank the brute fairly cover they from they come muffle little shriek and gasp and there i stand and with I be the other two man a man dart past we into the fo ` cas ` le with two gray man on he back and i hear they kill he the two man by I run suddenly across the fore hatch and up the starboard ladder on to the fo ` cas ` le head yet almost in the same instant i see several of the gray man disappear up the other ladder from the fo ` cas ` le head above i hear the two man commence to shout and this die away into a loud scuffling at that i turn to see whether i could get away i stare round hopelessly and then with two jump i be on the pigsty and from there upon the top of the deckhouse i throw myself flat and wait breathlessly all at once it seem to I that it be darker than it have be the previous moment and i raise my head very cautiously i see that the ship be envelop in great billow of mist and then not six foot from I i make out someone lie face downward it be tammy i feel safer now that we be hide by the mist and i crawl to he he give a quick gasp of terror when i touch he but when he see who it be he start to sob like a little kid hush i say for god 's sake be quiet but i need not have trouble for the shriek of the man be kill down on the deck all around we drown every other sound i knelt up and glance round and then aloft overhead i could make out dimly the spar and sail and now as i look i see that the t ` gallant and royal have be unloosed and be hang in the buntline almost in the same moment the terrible cry of the poor beggar about the deck cease and there succeed a awful silence in which i could distinctly hear tammy sobbing i reach out and shake he be quiet be quiet i whisper intensely they 'll hear we at my touch and whisper he struggle to become silent and then overhead i see the six yard be swiftly mast-headed scarcely be the sail set when i hear the swish and flick of gasket be cast adrift on the lower yard and realize that ghostly thing be at work there for a moment or so there be silence and i make my way cautiously to the after end of the house and peer over yet because of the mist i could see nothing then abruptly from behind I come a single wail of sudden pain and terror from tammy it end instantly in a sort of choke i stand up in the mist and run back to where i have leave the kid but he have go i stand dazed i feel like shriek out loud above I i hear the flap of the course be tumble off the yard down upon the deck there be the noise of a multitude work in a weird inhuman silence then come the squeal and rattle of block and brace aloft they be square the yard i remain standing i watch the yard square and then i see the sail fill suddenly a instant later the deck of the house upon which i stand become canted forrard the slope increase so that i could scarcely stand and i grab at one of the wire-winch i wonder in a stunned sort of way what be happen almost directly afterwards from the deck on the port side of the house there come a sudden loud human scream and immediately from different part of the deck there rise afresh some most horrible shout of agony from odd man this grow into a intense scream that shake my heart up and there come again a noise of desperate brief fighting then a breath of cold wind seem to play in the mist and i could see down the slope of the deck i look below I towards the bow the jibboom be plunge right into the water and as i stare the bow disappear into the sea the deck of the house become a wall to I and i be swing from the winch which be now above my head i watch the ocean lap over the edge of the fo ` cas ` le head and rush down on to the maindeck roar into the empty fo ` cas ` le and still all around I come cry of the lose sailor-men i hear something strike the corner of the house above I with a dull thud and then i see plummer plunge down into the flood beneath i remember that he have be at the wheel the next instant the water have leap to my foot there come a drear chorus of bubble scream a roar of water and i be go swiftly down into the darkness i let go of the winch and strike out madly try to hold my breath there be a loud singing in my ear it grow louder i open my mouth i feel i be die and then thank god i be at the surface breathing for the moment i be blind with the water and my agony of breathlessness then grow easier i brush the water from my eye and so not three hundred yard away i make out a large ship float almost motionless at first i could scarcely believe i see aright then as i realize that indeed there be yet a chance of live i start to swim towards you you know the rest -- and you think -- say the captain interrogatively and stop short no reply jessop i do not think i _ know none of we _ think _ it be a gospel fact people _ talk _ about queer thing happen at sea but this be not one of they this be one of the _ real _ thing you have all see queer thing perhaps more than i have it depend but they do not go down in the log these kind of thing never do this one will not at least not as it be really happen he nod he head slowly and go on address the captain more particularly i 'll bet he say deliberately that you 'll enter it in the log-book something like this : ` may l8th lat -- s long -- w 2 pm light wind from the south and east sight a full-rigged ship on the starboard bow overhaul she in the first dog-watch signal she but receive no response during the second dog-watch she steadily refuse to communicate about eight bell it be observe that she seem to be settle by the head and a minute later she founder suddenly bow foremost with all she crew put out a boat and pick up one of the man a ab by the name of jessop he be quite unable to give any explanation of the catastrophe ' and you two he make a gesture at the first and second mate will probably sign you name to it and so will i and perhaps one of you ab then when we get home they 'll print a report of it in the newspaper and people will talk about the unseaworthy ship maybe some of the expert will talk rot about rivet and defective plate and so forth he laugh cynically then he go on and you know when you come to think of it there be no one except we own self will ever know how it happen -- really the shellback do not count they be only ` beastly drunken brute of _ common sailor _ ' -- poor devil no one would think of take anything they say as anything more than a damned cuffer besides the beggar only tell these thing when they be half-boozed they would not then -lrb- for fear of be laugh at -rrb- only they be not responsible -- he break off and look round at we the skipper and the two mate nod they head in silent assent appendix _ the silent ship _ i be the third mate of the _ sangier _ the vessel that pick up jessop you know and he be ask we to write a short note of what we see from we side and sign it the old man 's set I on the job as he say i can put it better than he can well it be in the first dog-watch that we come up with she the _ mortzestus _ i mean but it be in the second dog-watch that it happen the mate and i be on the poop watch she you see we would signal she and she would not take any notice and that seem queer as we could not have be more than three or four hundred yard off she port beam and it be a fine evening so that we could almost have have a tea-fight if they would seem a pleasant crowd as it be we call they a set of sulky swine and leave it at that though we still keep we hoist up all the same you know we watch she a lot and i remember even then i think it queer how quiet she be we could not even hear she bell go and i speak to the mate about it and he say he would be notice the same thing then about six bell they shorten she right down to top-sail and i can tell you that make we stare more than ever as anyone can imagine and i remember we notice then especially that we could not hear a single sound from she even when the haul yard be let go and you know without the glass i see they old man singing out something but we do not get a sound of it and we _ should _ have be able to hear every word then just before eight bell the thing jessop 's tell we about happen both the mate and the old man say they could see man go up she side a bit indistinct you know because it be get dusk but the second mate and i half think we do and half think we do not but there be something queer we all know that and it look like a sort of move mist along she side i know i feel pretty funny but it be not the sort of thing of course to be too sure and serious about until you _ be _ sure after the mate and the captain have say they see the man board she we begin to hear sound from she very queer at first and rather like a phonograph make when it be get up speed then the sound come properly from she and we hear they shout and yell and you know i do not know even now just what i really think i be all so queer and mixed the next thing i remember there be a thick mist round the ship and then all the noise be shut off as if it be all the other side of a door but we could still see she mast and spar and sail above the misty stuff and both the captain and the mate say they could see man aloft and i think i could but the second mate be not sure all the same though the sail be all loose in about a minute it seem and the yard masthead we could not see the course above the mist but jessop say they be loose too and sheet home along with the upper sail then we see the yard square and i see the sail fill bang up with wind and yet you know ours be slatt the next thing be the one that hit I more than anything she mast take a cant forrard and then i see she stem come up out of the mist that be round she then all in a instant we could hear sound from the vessel again and i tell you the man do not seem to be shout but scream she stern go higher it be most extraordinary to look at and then she go plunk down head foremost right bang into the mist-stuff it be all right what jessop say and when we see he swimming -lrb- i be the one who spot he -rrb- we get out a boat quicker than a wind-jammer ever get out a boat before i should think the captain and the mate and the second and i be all go to sign this -lrb- sign -rrb- william nawston _ master _ jeg adam _ first mate _ ed brown _ second mate _ jack t evan _ third mate _ end of
