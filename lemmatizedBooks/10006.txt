translation to make the work of the great greek writer a part of the liberal education of he countryman a knowledge of greek at that time be a exceedingly rare accomplishment since the serious study of live literature be only just begin and the greek of homer have be almost forget even petrarch whose erudition be marvelous could not read a copy of the _ iliad _ that he possess boccaccio ask permission of the florentine government to establish a greek professorship in the university of florence and persuade a learn calabrian leonzio pilato who have a perfect knowledge of ancient greek to leave venice and accept the professorship at florence and lodge he in he own house together the calabrian and the author of _ la fiammetta _ and the _ decameron _ make a latin translation of the _ iliad _ which boccaccio transcribe with he own hand but he literary enthusiasm be not confine to he own work and that of the ancient he soul be fill with a generous ardor of admiration for dante

boccaccio survive he but one year die on the twenty-first of December 1375 he be bury in certaldo in the church of san michele e giacomo that one city should have produce three such man as the great triumvirate of the fourteenth century -- dante petrarch boccaccio -- and that one half-century should have witness they successive triumph be the greatest glory of florence and be one of the most notable fact in the history of genius we quote once more from symond : dante bring the universe into he _ divine comedy _ ` but the soul of man too be a universe ' and of this inner microcosm petrarch be the poet and genius it remain for boccaccio to treat of daily life with a art as distinct and dazzling as theirs from dante 's beatrice through petrarch 's laura to boccaccio 's la fiammetta -- from woman as a allegory of the noblest thought and purest stirring of the soul through woman as the symbol of all beauty worship at a distance to woman as man 's lover kindling and reciprocate the most ardent passion from mystic stately period to protean prose from verse build up into cathedral-like dignity through lyric light as arabesque and point with the steely touch of polished style to that free form of speech which take all mood and lend itself alike to low or lofty thing -- such be the rapid movement of italian genius within the brief space of fifty year so quickly do the renaissance emerge from the middle age and when the voice of that August trio be silence in the grave they echo ever widen and grow louder through the spacious time to come no translation into english of _ la fiammetta _ have be make since shakespeare 's time -- when a small edition be publish which be now so rare as to be practically unattainable -- until the appearance of the present scholarly and poetic rendering which place within the reach of all one of the world 's greatest masterpiece of literature dkr prologue _ beginneth the book call elegy of madonna fiammetta send by she to lady in love _ when the wretched perceive or feel that they woe arouse compassion they longing to give vent to they anguish be thereby increase and so since from long usance the cause of my anguish instead of grow less have become greater the wish have come to I noble lady -- in whose heart mayhap abide a love more fortunate than mine -- to win you pity if i may by tell the tale of my sorrow nor be it at all my intent that these my word should come to the ear of man nay rather would i so far as lie in my power withhold my complaint from they for such bitterness have the discovery of the unkindness of one man stir in I that imagine all other man to be like he methink i should be a witness of they mock laughter rather than of they pity tear you alone do i entreat to peruse my story know full well that you will feel with I and that you have a pious concern for other ' pang here you will not find grecian fable adorn with many lie nor trojan battle foul with blood and gore but amorous sentiment feed with torture desire here will appear before you very eye the dolorous tear the impetuous sigh the heart-breaking word the stormy thought which have harrow I with a ever-recurring goad and have tear away from I sleep and appetite and the pleasant time of old and my much-loved beauty when you behold these thing and behold they with the ardent feeling which lady be wont to have sure i be that

and that the time may pass more rapidly in speaking than in weep i will do my best to fulfil my promise briefly begin with that love which be more happy than last so that by compare that happiness with my present case you may learn that i be now more unhappy than any woman ever have be and afterward i will trace with mournful pen as best i can all the agony which be justly the source of my lamentation but first if the prayer of the wretched be hear if there be in heaven any deity whose holy mind can be touch with compassion for I afflict as i be bath in my own tear he i beseech to aid my despondent memory and support my tremble hand in its present task so may the torture which i have feel and still feel in my soul become fruitful and the memory will suggest the word for they and the hand more eager than apt for such duty will write they down chapter i _ wherein the lady describe who she be and by what sign she misfortune be foreshadow and at what time and where and in what manner and of whom she become enamored with the description of the ensue delight _ in the time when the newly-vestured earth appear more lovely than during all the rest of the year come i into the world begotten of noble parent and bear amid the unstinted gift of benignant fortune accurse be the day to I more hateful than any other on which i be bear oh how far more befitting would it have be have i never be bear or have i be carry from that luckless womb to my grave or have i possess a life not longer than that of the tooth sow by cadmus or have atropo cut the thread of my existence at the very hour when it have begin then in earliest childhood would have be entomb the limitless woe that be the melancholy occasion of that which i be write but what boot it to complain of this now i be here beyond doubt and it have please and even now please god that i should be here bear and rear then amid boundless affluence i learn under a venerable mistress whatever manners and refinement it beseem a demoiselle of high rank to know and as my person grow and develop with my increase year so also grow and develop my beauty alas even while a child on hearing that beauty acclaimed of many i glory therein and cultivate it by ingenious care and art and when i have bid farewell to childhood and have attain a riper age i soon discover that this my beauty -- ill-fated gift for one who desire to live virtuously -- have power to kindle amorous spark in youth of my own age and other noble person as well be instruct thereupon by nature and feeling that love can be quicken in young man by beauteous lady and by diver look and action the sense of which i do but dimly discern at the time do these youth endeavor in numberless way to kindle in my heart the fire wherewith they own heart glow -- fire that be destine not to warm but rather to consume I also in the future more than it ever have burn another woman and by many of these young man be i seek in marriage with most fervid and passionate entreaty but after i have choose among they one who be in every respect congenial to I this importunate crowd of suitor be now almost hopeless cease to trouble I with they look and attention i therefore be satisfy as be meet with such a husband live most happily so long as fervid love light by flame hitherto unfelt find no entrance into my young soul alas i have no wish unsatisfied nothing that could please I or any other lady ever be deny I even for a moment i be the sole delight the peculiar felicity of a youthful spouse and just as he love I so do i equally love he oh how much happier should i have be than all other woman if the love for he that be then in my heart have endure it be then while i be live in sweet content amid every kind of enjoyment that fortune who quickly change all thing earthly become envious of the very gift which she herself have bestow withdraw she protect hand at first uncertain in what manner she could succeed in poisoning my happiness she at length manage with subtle craft to make mine own very eye traitor and so guide I into the path that lead to disaster but the god be still propitious to I nay be even more concerned for my fate than i myself have see through she veil malice they wish to supply I with weapon have i but know how to avail I thereof wherewith i might fend my breast and not go unarmed to the battle wherein i be destine to fall yea on the very night that precede the day which be the beginning of all my woe they reveal to I the future in my sleep by means of a clear and distinct vision in such wise as follow : while lie on my spacious couch with all my limb relax in deepest slumber i seem to be fill with greater joy than i have ever feel before and wherefore i know not and the day whereon this happen be the brightest and loveliest of day i be stand alone in verdant grass when with the joy whereof i speak come the think to I that it might be well for I to repose in a meadow that appear to be shield from the fervid ray of the sun by the shadow cast by various tree newly garb in they glossy foliage but first gathering diver flower wherewith the whole sward be bejeweled i place they with my white hand in a corner of my robe and then sit down and choose flower after flower i wove therefrom a fair garland and adorn my head with it and be so adorn i arise and like unto proserpine at what time pluto ravish she from she mother i go along singing in this new springtime then be perchance weary i lay I down in a spot where the verdure be deepest and softest but just as the tender foot of eurydice be pierce by the conceal viper so meseemed that a hidden serpent come upon I as i lay stretch on the grass and pierce I under the left breast the bite of the sharp fang when it first enter seem to burn I but afterward feel somewhat reassure and yet afraid of something worse ensue i think i clasp the cold serpent to my bosom fancy that by communicate to it the warmth of that bosom i should thereby render it more kindly dispose in my regard in return for such a service but the viper make bolder and more obdurate by that very favor lay he hideous mouth on the wound he have give I and after a long space and after it have drunk much of my blood methought that despite my resistance it draw forth my soul and then leave my breast depart with it and at the very moment of the serpent 's departure the day lose its brightness and a thick shadow come behind I and cover I all over and the farther the serpent creep the more lower grow the heaven and it seem almost as if the reptile drag after it in its course the mass of thick black cloud that appear to follow in its wake not long afterward just as a white stone fling into deep water gradually vanish from the eye of the beholder so it too vanish from my sight then the heaven become darker and darker and i think that the sun have suddenly withdraw and night have surely return as it have erstwhile return to the _ greek _ because of the crime of atrcus next flash of lightning speed swiftly along the sky and peal of crash thunder appal the earth and I likewise and through all the wound make in my breast by the bite of the serpent remain with I still and full of viperous poison for no medicinal help be within my reach so that my entire body appear to have swollen in a most foul and disgusting manner whereupon i who before this seem to be without life or motion -- why i do not know -- feeling that the force of the venom be seek to reach my heart in diver subtle way now toss and roll upon the cool grass expect death at any moment but methought that when the hour of my doom arrive i be strike with terror at its approach and the anguish of my heart be so appalling while look forward to its come that my inert body be convulse with horror and so my deep slumber be suddenly break no sooner be i fully awake than be still alarm by the thing i have see i feel with my right hand for the wound in my breast search at the present moment for that which be already be prepare for my future misery finding that no wound be there i begin to feel quite safe and even merry and i make a mock of the folly of dream and of those who believe in they and so i render the work of the god useless ah wretched I if i mock they then i have good reason to believe in they afterward to my bitter sorrow and with the shed of useless tear good reason have i also to complain of the god who reveal they secret to mortal in such mystic guise that the thing that be to happen in the future can hardly be say to be reveal at all be then fully awake i raise my drowsy head and as soon as i see the light of the new-risen sun enter my chamber lay aside every other think directly i at once leave my couch that day too be a day of the utmost solemnity for almost everyone therefore attire myself carefully in glitter cloth of gold and adorning every part of my person with deft and cunning hand i make ready to go to the August festival apparele like unto the goddess see by pari in the vale of ida and while i be lose in admiration of myself just as the peacock be of he plumage imagine that the delight which i take in my own appearance would surely be share by all who see I a flower from my wreath fall on the ground near the curtain of my bed i know not wherefore -- perhaps pluck from my head by a celestial hand by I unseen but i careless of the occult sign by which the god forewarn mortal pick it up replace it on my head and as if nothing portentous have happen i pass out from my abode alas what clearer token of what be to befall I could the god have give I this should have serve to prefigure to I that my soul once free and sovereign of itself be on that day to lay aside its sovereignty and become a slave as it betide oh if my mind have not be distemper i should have surely know that to I that day would be the blackest and direst of day and i should have let it pass without ever cross the threshold of my home but although the god usually hold forth sign whereby those against whom they be incense may be warn they often deprive they of due understanding and thus while point out the path they ought to follow they at the same time sate they own anger my ill fortune then thrust I forth from my house vain and careless that i be and accompany by several lady i move with slow step to the sacred temple in which the solemn function require by the day be already celebrate ancient custom as well as my noble estate have reserve for I a prominent place among the other lady when i be seat my eye as be my habit of old quickly wander around the temple and i see that it be crowd with man and woman who be divide into separate group and no sooner be it observe that i be in the temple than -lrb- even while the sacred office be go on -rrb- that happen which have always happen at other time and not only do the man turn they eye to gaze upon I but the woman do the same as if venus or minerva have newly descend from the sky and would never again be see by they in that spot where i be seat oh how often i laugh within my own breast be enrapture with myself and take glory unto myself because of such thing just as if i be a real goddess and so nearly all the young gentleman leave off admire the other lady and take they station around I and straightway encompass I almost in the form of a complete circle and while speak in diver way of my beauty each finish he praise thereof with well-nigh the same sentence but i who by turn my eye in another direction show that my mind be intent on other care keep my ear attentive to they discourse and receive therefrom much delectable sweetness and as it seem to I that i be beholden to they for such pleasure i sometimes let my eye rest on they more kindly and benignantly and not once but many time do i perceive that some of they puff up with vain hope because of this boast foolishly of it to they companion while i then in this way look at a few and that sparingly i be myself look at by many and that exceedingly and while i believe that my beauty be dazzling other it come to pass that the beauty of another dazzle I to my great tribulation and now be already close on the dolorous moment which be fate to be the occasion either of a most assure death or of a life of such anguish that none before I have ever endure the like prompt by i know not what spirit i raise my eye with decent gravity and survey with penetrate look the crowd of young man who be stand near I and i discern more plainly than i see any of the other a youth who stand directly in front of I all alone lean against a marble column and be move thereto by irresistible fate i begin to take thought within my mind of he bearing and manners the which i have never before do in the case of anyone else i say then that accord to my judgment which be not at that time bias by love he be most beautiful in form most please in deportment and apparently of a honorable disposition the soft and silky lock that fall in graceful curl beside he cheek afford manifest proof of he youthfulness the look wherewith he eye I seem to beg for pity and yet it be mark by the wariness and circumspection usual between man and man sure i be that i have still strength enough to turn away my eye from he gaze at least for a time but no other occurrence have power to divert my attention from the thing already mention and upon which i have deeply pondered and the image of he form which be already in my mind remain there and this image i dwelt upon with silent delight affirm within myself that those thing be true which seem to I to be true and pleased that he should look at I i raise my eye betime to see whether he be still look at I but anon i gaze at he more steadily make no attempt to avoid amorous snare and when i have fix my eye on he more intently than be my wont methought i could read in he eye word which might be utter in this wise : o lady thou alone art mine only bliss certainly if i should say that this idea be not please to I i should surely lie for it draw forth a gentle sigh from my bosom accompany by these word : and thou art mine unless perchance the word be but the echo of he catch by my mind and remain within it but what avail it whether such word be speak or not the heart have good understanding within itself of that which be not express by the lip and keep too within itself that which if it have escape outside might mayhap have leave I still free and so from that time forward i give more absolute liberty to my foolish eye than ever they have possess before and they be well content withal and surely if the god who guide all thing to a definite issue have not deprive I of understand i could still have be mistress of myself but postpone every consideration to the last one that sway I i take delight in follow my unruly passion and have make myself meet all at once for such slavery i become its thrall for the fire that leap forth from he eye encounter the light in mine flash thereunto a most subtle ray it do not remain content therewith but by what hide way i know not penetrate directly into the deepest recess of my heart the which affright by the sudden advent of this flame recall to its center its exterior force and leave I as pale as death and also with the chill of death upon I but not for long do this continue rather it happen contrariwise and i feel my heart not only glow with sudden beat but its force speed back swiftly to they place bring with they a throbbing warmth that chase away my pallor and flush my cheek deeply and marvel wherefore this should betide i sigh heavily nor thereafter be there other think in my soul than how i might please he in like fashion he without change he place continue to scrutinize my feature but with the greatest caution and perhaps have have much practice in amorous warfare and know by what device the longed-for prey might be capture he show himself every moment more humble more desperate and more fraught with tender yearning alas how much guile do that seeming desperation hide which as the result have now show though it may have come from the heart never afterward return to the same and make manifest later that its revealment on the face be only a lure and a delusion and not to mention all he deed each of which be full of most artful deception he so work upon I by he own craft or else the fate will it should so happen that i straightway find myself enmesh in the snare of sudden and unthought-of love in a manner beyond all my power of tell and so i remain unto this very hour it be this one alone therefore most pitiful lady that my heart in it mad infatuation choose not only among so many high-born handsome and valiant youth then present but even among all of the same degree have they abode in my own parthenope as first and last and sole lord of my life it be this one alone that i loved and love more than any other it be this one alone that be destine to be the beginning and source of my by any pleasure although often tempt be at last vanquish have burn and now burn in the fire which then first catch I omit many thought that come into my mind and many thing that be tell I i will only say that intoxicate by a new passion i return with a soul enslave to that spot whence i have go forth in freedom when i be in my chamber alone and unoccupied inflamed with various wild wish fill with new sensation and throb with many anxiety all of which be concentrate on the image of the youth who please I i argue within myself that if i could not banish love from my luckless bosom i might at least be able to keep cautious and secret control of it therein and how hard it be to do such a thing no one can discover who do not make trial of the same surely do i believe that not even love himself can cause so great anguish as such a attempt be certain to produce furthermore i be arrest in my purpose by the fact that i have no acquaintance with he of whom i profess myself enamor to relate all the thought that be engender in I by this love and of what nature they be would take altogether too much time but some few i must perforce declare as well as certain thing that be begin to delight I more than usual i say then that everything else be neglect the only thing that be dear to I be the thought of my beloved and when it occur to my mind that by persevere in this course i might mayhap give occasion to some one to discover that which i wish to conceal i often upbraid myself for my folly but what avail it all my upbraiding have to give way to my inordinate yearning for he and dissolve uselessly into thin air for several day i long exceedingly to learn who be the youth i love toward whom my thought be ever clearly lead I and this i craftily learn the which fill I with great content in like manner the ornament for which i have before this in no way care as have but little need thereof begin to be dear to I think that the more i be adorn the better should i please wherefore i prize more than hitherto my garment gold pearl and my other precious thing until the present moment it have be my custom to frequent church garden festival and seaside resort without other wish than the companionship of young friend of my own sex now i seek the aforesaid place with a new desire believe that both to see and be see would bring I great delectation but in sooth the trust which i be wont to place in my beauty have desert I and now i never leave my chamber without first seek the faithful counsel of my mirror : and my hand newly instruct thereunto by i know not what cunning master discover each day some more elegant mode of adornment than the day before and deftly add artificial charm to my natural loveliness thereby cause I to outshine all the other lady in my surpassing splendor furthermore i begin to wish for the honor usually pay to I by lady because of they gracious courtesy though perhaps they be rather the guerdon of my noble birth be due to I therefor think that if i appear so magnificent to my beloved 's eye he would take the more delight in behold I avarice too which be inborn in woman flee from I so that i become free and openhanded and regarded my own possession almost as if they be not my own the sedateness that beseem a woman fall away from I somewhat and i grow bolder in my way and in addition to all this my eye which until that day look out on the world simply and naturally entirely change they manner of look and become so artful in they office that it be a marvel and many other alteration appear in I over and above these all of which i do not care to relate for besides that the report thereof would be too tedious i ween full well that you like I also have be or be in love and know what change take place in those who be in such sad case he be a most wary and circumspect youth whereunto my experience be able to bear witness frequently go very rarely and always in the most decorous manner to the place where i happen to be he use to observe I but ever with a cautious eye so that it seem as if he have plan as well as i to hide the tender flame that glow in the breast of both certainly if i deny that love although it have clutch every corner of my heart and take violent possession of every recess of my soul grow even more intense whenever it happen that my eye encounter he i should deny the truth he add further fuel to the fire that consume I and rekindle such as might be expire if mayhap there be any such but the beginning of all this be by no means so cheerful as the end be joyless as soon as i be deprive of the sight of this my beloved inasmuch as the eye be thus rob of they delight give woful occasion of lamentation to the heart the sigh whereof grow greater in quality as well as in quantity and desire as if seize my every feeling take I away from myself and as if i be not where i be i frequently give he who see I cause for amazement by afford numberless pretext for such happening be teach by love itself in addition to this the quiet of the night and the thought on which my fancy fed continuously by take I out of myself sometimes move I to action more frantic than passionate and to the employment of unusual word but it happen that while my excess of ornament heartfelt sigh lose rest strange action frantic movement and other effect of my recent love attract the notice of the other domestic of the household they especially strike with wonder a nurse of mine old in year and experienced and of sound judgment who though well aware of the flame that tortured my breast yet make show of not know thereof frequently chide I for my altered manners one day in particular finding I lie disconsolate on my couch see that my brow be charge with doleful thought and believe that we be not likely to be interrupt by other company she begin to speak as follow : my dearest daughter whom i love as my very self tell I i pray you what be the sorrow that have for some time past be harass you you who be wont to be so gay formerly you whom i have never see before with a mournful countenance seem to I now to be the prey of grief and to let no moment pass without a sigh then have at first feign to be asleep and not to have hear she i heave a deep sigh and my face at one time flushing at another turn pale i toss about on the couch seek what answer i should make though indeed in my agitation my tongue could hardly shape a perfect sentence but at length i answer : indeed dear nurse no fresh sorrow harass I nor do i feel that i be in any way different from what i be wont to be perhaps some trouble i may have but they be such as be incidental to all woman most certainly you be try to deceive I my child return the aged nurse and you seem not to reflect how serious a matter it be to attempt to lead person of experience to believe one thing because it be couch in word and to disbelieve the opposite although it be make plainly evident by deed there be no reason why you should hide from I a fact whereof i have have perfect knowledge since several day ago alas when i hear she speak thus provoke and sting by she word i say : if then thou wittest of all this wherefore dost thou question I all that thou hast to do now be to keep secret that which thou hast discover in good truth she reply i will conceal all that which it be not meet that another should know and may the earth open and engulf I in its bowels before i ever reveal aught that might turn to thy open shame therefore do thou live assure of this and guard thyself carefully from let another know that which i without either thyself or anyone else tell I have learn from observe thy look as for myself it be not now but long ere now that i have learn to keep hide that which should not be disclose therefore do thou continue to feel secure as to this matter and watch most carefully that thou lettest not another know that which i not wit it from thee or from another most surely have discover from thine own face and from its changeful seeming but if thou art still the victim of that folly by which i know thou hast be enslave if thou art as prone now as erewhile to indulge that feeling to which thou hast already give way then know i right well that i must leave thee to thy own device for bootless will be my teaching and my warning still although this cruel tyrant to whom in thy youthful simplicity be take by surprise thou hast yield thy freedom appear to have deprive thee of understand as well as of liberty i will put thee in mind of many thing and entreat thee to fling off and banish wicked thought from thy chaste bosom to quench that unholy fire and not to make thyself the thrall of unworthy hope now be the time to be strong in resistance for whoso make a stout fight in the begin root out a unhallowed affection and bear securely the palm of victory but whoso with long and wishful fancy foster it will try too late to resist a yoke that have be submit to almost unresistingly alas i reply how far easier it be to say such thing than to lead they to any good result albeit they be not easy of fulfilment she say yet be they possible and they be thing that it beseem you to do take thou think whether it would be fitting that for such a thing as this thou shouldst lose the luster of thy exalted parentage the great fame of thy virtue the flower of thy beauty the honor in which thou art now hold and above all the favor of the spouse whom thou hast loved and by whom thou art loved : certainly thou shouldst not wish for this nor do i believe thou wouldst wish it if thou didst but weigh the matter seriously in thine own mind wherefore in the name of god forbear and drive from thy heart the false delight promise by a guilty hope and with they the madness that have seize thee by this aged breast long harass by many care from which thou didst take thy first nutriment i humbly beseech thee to have the courage to aid thyself to have a concern for thine own honor and not to disdain my warning bethink thee that the very desire to be heal be itself often productive of health whereto i thus make answer : only too well do i know dear nurse the truth of that which thou sayest but a furious madness constrain I to follow the worse course vainly do my heart insatiable in its desire long for strength to enable it to adopt thy advice what reason enjoin be render of no avail by this soul-subduing passion my mind be wholly possess by love who rule every part thereof in virtue of he all-embracing deity and surely thou art aware that he power be absolute and ` twere useless to attempt to resist it have say these word i become almost unconscious and fall into she arm but she now more agitate than before in austere and rebuke tone say : yes forsooth well be i aware that you and a number of fond young woman inflamed and instigate thereunto by vain thought have discover love to be a god whereas a juster name for he would be that of demon and you and they call he the son of venus and say that he strength have come to he from the third heaven wish seemingly to offer necessity as a excuse for you foolishness oh be ever woman so mislead as thou truly thou must be bereft entirely of understand what a thing thou sayest love a deity love be a madness thrust forth from hell by some fury he speed across the earth in hasty flight and they whom he visit soon discover that he bring no deity with he but frenzy rather yet none will he visit except those abound overmuch in earthly felicity for they he know in they overweening conceit be ready to afford he lodgment and shelter this have be prove to we by many fact do we not see that venus the true the heavenly venus often dwell in the humblest cot she sole concern be the perpetuation of we race but this god whom some in they folly name love always hanker after thing unholy minister only to those whose fortune be prosperous this one recoil from those whose food and raiment suffice to meet the demand of nature use he best effort to win over the pampered and the splendidly attire and with they food and they habiliment he mix he poison and so gain the lordship of they wicked soul and for this reason he gladly seek a harborage in lofty palace and seldom or rather never enter the house of the lowly because this horrible plague always resort by choice to scene of elegance and refinement well know that such place be best fit for the achievement of he fell purpose it be easy for we to see that among the humble the affection be sane and well order but the rich on the other hand everywhere plume themselves on they riches and be insatiable in they pursuit of other thing as well as of wealth always show more eagerness therein than be become and they who can do much desire furthermore to have the power of do that which they must not do : among whom i feel that thou hast place thyself o most hapless of woman see that thou hast already enter and travel far on a path that will surely lead to guilt and misery after hearing which i say : be silent old woman and provoke not the wrath of the god by thy speech now that thou art incapacitate from love by age and reject by all the god thou railest against this one blaspheme he in whom thou didst erstwhile take delight if other lady far more puissant famous and wise than i have formerly call he by that name it be not in my power to give he a name anew by he be i now truly enslaved whatever be the cause of this and whether it be the occasion of my happiness or misery i be helpless the strength wherewith i once oppose he have be vanquish and have abandon I therefore either death or the youth for whom i languish can alone end my torture if thou art then as wise as i hold thee to be bestow such counsel and help on I as may lighten my anguish or at least abstain from exasperate it by censure that to which my soul unable to act differently be incline with all its energy thereupon she be angry and not without reason make no answer but mutter to herself pass out of the chamber and leave I alone when my dear nurse have depart without make further discourse and i be again alone i feel that i have act ill in despise she advice i revolve she saying within my restless breast and albeit my understanding be blind i perceive that what she have say be replete with wisdom and almost repenting of what i have utter and of the course which i have declare i purposed take i be waver in my mind and already begin to have thought of abandon that course which be sure to be in every way most harmful i be about to call she back to give I encouragement when a new and unforeseen event suddenly change my intention for a most beautiful lady come to my private chamber i know not whence present herself before my eye envelop in such dazzling light that scarcely could my sight endure the brightness thereof but while she stand still and silent before I the effulgent radiance that have almost blinded my vision after a time leave it unobscured and i be able so to portray she every aspect to my mind as she whole beauteous figure be impress on my memory i see that she be nude except for a thin and delicate drapery of purple which albeit in some part it cover the milk-white body yet no more conceal it from my ravished eye than do the transparent glass conceal the portrait beneath it she head the hair whereof as much surpass gold in its luster as gold surpass the yellowest tress to be find among mortal be garland with a wreath of green myrtle beneath whose shadow i beheld two eye of peerless splendor so enchanting that i could have gaze on they forever they flash forth such luminous beam that it be a marvel and all the rest of she countenance have such transcendent loveliness that the like never be see here below at first she speak no word perchance content that i should look upon she or perchance see I so content to look upon she then gradually through the translucent radiance she reveal more clearly every hide grace for she be aware that i could not believe such beauty possible except i beheld it with my eye and that even then word would fail I to picture it to mortal with my tongue at last when she observe that i have sate my eye with gaze on she and when she see that she coming hither be as wondrous to I as she loveliness with smile face and in a voice sweeter than can be conceive by mind like ours she thus address I : prithee young woman what art thou the most fickle of thy sex prepare to do in obedience to the late counsel of thy aged nurse knowest thou not that such counsel be far harder to follow than that very love which thou desirest to flee hast thou reflect on the dire and unendurable torment which compliance with they will entail on thee o most insensate one dost thou then who only a few hour ago wert my willing vassal now wish to break away from my gentle rule because forsooth of the word of a old woman who be no longer vassal of mine as if like she thou art now unwitting of what delight i be the source o most witless of woman forbear and reflect whether thou shouldst not find befitting happiness in that which make the happiness of heaven and earth all thing that phoebus behold during the bright day from what time he emerge from gange until he plunge with he tired steed into the hesperian wave to seek due repose after he wearisome pilgrimage all thing that be confine between cold arcturus and the red-hot pole all own the absolute and authentic lordship of my wingéd son and in heaven not only be he esteem a god like the other deity but he be so much more puissant than they all that not one remain who have not heretofore be vanquish by he dart he fly on golden plumage throughout he realm with such swiftness that he passage can hardly be discern visit they all in turn and bend he strong bow to the draw string he fit the arrow forge by I and temper in the fountain sacred to my divinity and when he elect anyone to he service as be more worthy than other that one he rule as it like he he kindle rage fire in the heart of the young fan the flame that be almost dead in the old awaken the fever of passion in the chaste bosom of virgin and instil a genial warmth into the breast of wife and widow equally he have even aforetime force the god work up to a frenzy by he blaze torch to forsake the heaven and dwell on earth under false appearance whereof the proof be many be not phoebus though victor over huge python and creator of the celestial strain that sound from the lyre of parnassus by he make the thrall now of daphne now of clymene and again of leucothea and of many other withal certainly this be so and finally hide he brightness under the form of a shepherd do not apollo tend the flock of admetus even jove himself who rule the sky by this god coerce mold he greatness into form inferior to he own sometimes in shape of a snow-white fowl he give voice to sound sweeter than those of the die swan and anon change to a young bull and fitting horn to he brow he bellow along the plain and humble he proud flank to the touch of a virgin 's knee and compelling he tired hoof to do the office of oar he breast the wave of he brother 's kingdom yet sink not in its depths but joyously bear away he prize i shall not discourse unto you of he pursuit of semele under he proper form or of alcmena in guise of amphitryon or of callisto under the semblance of diana or of danaë for whose sake he become a shower of gold see that in the tell thereof i should waste too much time nay even the savage god of war whose strength appal the giant repress he wrathful bluster be force to such submission by this my son and become gentle and loving and the forger of jupiter and artificer of he three-pronged thunderbolt though train to handle fire be smite by a shaft more potent than he himself have ever work nay i though i be he mother have not be able to fend off he arrow : witness the tear i have shed for the death of adoni but why weary myself and thee with the utterance of so many word there be no deity in heaven who have pass unscathed from he assault except perhaps diana only who may have escape he by flee to the wood though some there be who tell that she do not flee but rather conceal the wound if haply however thou in the hardness of thy unbelief rejectest the testimony of heaven and searchest rather for example of those in this nether world who have feel he power i affirm they to be so multitudinous that where to begin i know not yet this much may i tell thee truly : all who have confess he sway have be man of might and valor consider attentively in the first place that undaunted son of alcmena who lay aside he arrow and the formidable skin of the huge lion be fain to adorn he finger with green emerald and to smooth and adjust he bristle and rebellion hair nay that hand which aforetime have wield the terrific club and slay therewith antæus and drag the hound of hell from the lower world be now content to draw the woolen thread spin from omphale 's distaff and the shoulder whereon have rest the pillar of the heaven from which he have for a time free atla be now clasp in omphale 's arm and afterward to do she pleasure cover with a diaphanous raiment of purple need i relate what pari do in obedience to the great deity or helen or clytemnestra or ægisthus these be thing that be well know to all the world nor do i care to speak of achille or of scyllum of ariadne or leander of dido or of many other of whom the same tale could be tell be there need to tell it believe I when i affirm that this fire be holy and most potent as well thou hast hear that heaven and earth be subject to my son because of he lordship over god and man but what shall i say of the power that he exercise over irrational animal whether celestial or terrene it be through he that the turtle be fain to follow she mate it be through he that my pigeon have learn to caress he ringdove with fondest endearment and there be no creep or live creature that have ever at any time attempt to escape from he puissance : in the wood the timid stag make fierce by he touch become brave for sake of the coveted hind and by bellow and fight they prove how strong be the witchery of love the ferocious boar be make by love to froth at the mouth and sharpen they ivory tusk the african lion when love quicken they shake they mane in fury but leave the grove and forest i assert that even in the chilly water the numberless divinity of the sea and of the flow river be not safe from the bolt of my son neither can i for a moment believe that thou art ignorant of the testimony thereof which have be render by neptune glaucus alpheus and other too numerous to mention : not only be they unable to quench the flame with they dank water but they could not even moderate its fury which when it have make its might feel both on the earth and in the water continue its onward course and rest not until it have penetrate into the gloomy realm of di therefore heaven and earth and ocean and hell itself have have experience of the potency of he weapon and in order that thou mayest understand in a few word the power of the deity i tell thee that while everything succumb to nature and nothing can ever be emancipate from she dominion nature herself be but the servant of love when he command ancient hatred perish and angry mood be they old or new give place to he fire and lastly he sway have such far-reaching influence that even stepmother become gracious to they stepchild a thing which it be a marvel to behold therefore what seekest thou why dost thou hesitate why dost thou rashly avoid he when so many god when so many man when so many animal have be vanquish by he art ashamed to be vanquish by he also in good sooth thou weenest not what thou art do if thou fearest to be blame for thy obedience to he a blame so unmerited never can be thy portion greater sin than thou canst commit have be commit by thousand far greater than thou and these sin would plead as thy excuse shouldst thou pursue that course which other have pursue -- other who far excel thee thou wilt have sin but a little see that thou hadst far less power of resistance than those aforementioned but if my word move thee not and thou wouldst still wish to withstand the god bethink thee that thy power fall far short of that of jove and that in judgment thou canst not equal phoebus nor in wealth juno nor I in beauty and yet we all have be conquer thou art greatly deceive and i fear I that thou must perish in the end if thou persist in thy change purpose let that which have erstwhile suffice for the whole world suffice for thee nor try to render thyself cold-hearted by say : ' i have a husband and the holy law and the vow faith forbid I this ' for bootless be such reasoning against the puissance of this god he discard the law of other scornfully as think they of no account and ordain he own pasiphæ have a husband and phædra and i too even though i have love and it be these same husband who most frequently fall in love with other albeit they have wife of they own : witness jason and theseus and valiant hector and ulyss therefore to man we do no wrong if we apply to they the same law that they apply to other for to they no privilege have be grant which be not accord to we withal banish then thy foolish thought and in all security go on loving he whom thou hadst already begin to love in good sooth if thou refusest to own the power of mighty love it behoove thee to fly but whither canst thou fly knowest thou of any retreat where he will not follow and overtake thee he have in all place equal puissance go wheresoever thou wilt never canst thou pass across the border of he realm and within these realm vain it be for mortal to try to hide themselves when he would smite they but let it comfort thee to know young woman that no such odious passion shall trouble thee as erstwhile be the scourge of myrrha semiramis bybli canace and cleopatra nothing strange or new will be work by my son in thy regard he have as have the other god he own special law which thou art not the first to obey and shouldst not be the last to entertain hope therefrom if haply thou believest that thou art without companion in this foolish be thy belief let we pass by the other world which be fraught with such happening but observe attentively only thine own city what a infinite number of lady it can show who be in the same case with thyself and remember that what be do by so many can not be deem unseemly therefore be thou of we follow and return thanks to we beauty which thou hast so closely examine but return special thanks to we deity which have sunder thee from the rank of the simple and persuade thee to become acquaint with the delight that we gift bestow alas alas ye tender and compassionate lady if love have be propitious to you desire say what could i what should i answer to such and so great word utter by so great a goddess if not : be it do unto I accord to thy pleasure and so i affirm that as soon as she have close she lip have already harvest within my understand all she word and feeling that every word be charge with ample excuse for what i might do and know now how mighty she be and how resistless i resolve at once to submit to she guidance and instantly rise from my couch and kneel on the ground with humble heart i thus begin in abashed and tremulous accent : o peerless and eternal loveliness o divinest of deity o sole mistress of all my thought whose power be feel to be most invincible by those who dare to try to withstand it forgive the ill-timed obstinacy wherewith i in my great folly attempt to ward off from my breast the weapon of thy son who be then to I a unknown divinity now i repeat be it do unto I accord to thy pleasure and accord to thy promise withal surely my faith merit a due reward in time and space see that i take delight in thee more than do all other woman wish to see the number of thy subject increase forever and ever hardly have i make a end of speak these word when she move from the place where she be stand and come toward I then she face glowing with the most fervent expression of affection and sympathy she embrace I and touch my forehead with she divine lip next just as the false ascanius when pant in the arm of dido breathe on she mouth and thereby kindle the latent flame so do she breathe on my mouth and in that wise render the divine fire that slumber in my heart more uncontrollable than ever and this i feel at that very moment thereafter open a little she purple robe she show I clasp in she arm against she ravishing breast the very counterpart of the youth i love wrap in the transparent fold of a grecian mantle and reveal in the lineament of he countenance pang that be not unlike those i suffer o damsel she say rivet thy gaze on the youth before thee : we have not give thee for lover a lissa a geta or a birrium or anyone resemble they but a person in every way worthy of be love by every goddess in the heaven thee he love more than himself as we have ordain and thee will he ever love therefore do thou joyfully and securely abandon thyself to he love thy prayer have move we to pity as it be meet that prayer so deserving should and so be of good hope and fear not that thou shalt be without the reward due thee in the future and thereafter she suddenly vanish from my eye _ oimè _ wretch I i do not for a moment doubt now after consider the thing which follow that this one who appear unto I be not venus but rather tisiphone who doff from she head the horrid snake that serve it for hair and assume for the while the splendid form of the goddess of love in this manner lure I with deceitful counsel to that disaster which at length overwhelm I thus do juno but in different fashion veil the radiance of she deity and transform herself for the occasion into the exact likeness of she aged nurse persuade semele to she undoing woe be I my resolve to be so advise be the cause -- o hallowed modesty o chastity most sacred of all the virtue sole and most precious treasure of righteous woman -- be the cause i repeat wherefore i drive ye from my bosom yet do i venture to pray unto ye for pardon and surely the sinner who repent and persevere in repentance should in due season obtain you forgiveness although the goddess have disappear from my sight my whole soul nevertheless continue to crave she promise delight and albeit the ardor of the passion that vex my soul deprive I of every other feeling one piece of good fortune for what deserving of mine i know not remain to I out of so many that have be lose -- namely the power of know that seldom if ever have a smooth and happy end be grant to love if that love be divulge and blaze abroad and for this reason when influence by my highest thought i resolve although it be a most serious thing to do so not to set will above reason in carry this my desire unto a end and assuredly although i have often be most violently constrain by diver accident to follow certain course yet so much grace be concede to I that sustain by my own firmness i pass through these agony without reveal the pang that tortured I and in sooth i have still resolution enough to continue to follow out this my purpose so that although the thing i write be most true i have so disposed they that no one however keen he sagacity can ever discover who i be except he who be as well acquaint with these matter as i be indeed the occasion of they all and i implore he should this little book ever come into he hand in the name of that love which he once bear I to conceal that which if disclose would turn neither to he profit nor honor and albeit he have deprive I of himself and that through no fault of mine let he not take it upon himself to deprive I of that honor which i still possess although perchance undeservedly for should he do so he could never again give it back to I any more than he can now give I back himself have therefore form my plan in this wise i show the most long-suffering patience in manifest my keenest and most covetous yearning and i use my best effort but only in secret way and when opportunity be afford I to light in this young man 's soul the same flame wherewith my own soul glow and to make he as circumspect as myself withal nor in truth be this for I a task of great difficulty for inasmuch as the lineament of the face always bear most true witness to the quality of the heart it be not long before i become aware that my desire would have its full fruition i perceive that not only be he throb with amorous enthusiasm but that he be also imbue with most perfect discretion and this be exceedingly please to I he be at once wishful to preserve my honor in all its luster and at the same time to arrange convenient time and place for we meeting employ many ingenious stratagem which methink must have cost he much toil and trouble he use every subtle art to win the friendship of all who be relate to I and at last of my husband and not only do he enjoy they friendship but he possess it in such a supreme degree that no pleasure be agreeable to they unless he share it how much all this delighted I you will understand without its be needful to I to set it down in word and be there anyone so dull of wit as not to conclude that from the aforesaid friendship arise many opportunity for he and I of hold discourse together in public but already have he bethink himself of act in more subtle way and now he would speak to this one now to that one word whereby i be most eager for such enlightenment discover that whatever he say to these be fraught with figurative and hidden meaning intend to show forth he ardent affection for myself when he be sensible that i have a clear perception of the occult significance of he question and answer he go still further and by gesture and mobile change in the expression of he feature he would make know to I he thought and the various phase of he passion which be to I a source of much delectation and i strove so hard to comprehend it all and to make fitting response thereunto that neither could he shadow forth anything to I nor i to he that either of we do not at once understand nay not satisfied even with this he employ other symbol and metaphor and labor earnestly to discipline I in such manner of speech and to render I the more assure of he unalterable love he name I fiammetta and himself panfilo woe be I how often when warm with love and wine do we tell tale in the presence of we dearest friend of fiammetta and panfilo feign that they be greek of the day of old i at one time he at another and the tale be all of ourselves how we be first catch in the snare of love and of what tribulation we be long the victim give suitable name to the place and person connect with the story certainly i frequently laugh at it all be make merry by the simplicity of the bystander as well as by he astuteness and sagacity yet betime i dread that in the flush of he excitement he might thoughtlessly let he tongue wander in direction wherein it be not befitting it should venture but he be ever far wiser than i imagine guard himself craftily from any such blundering awkwardness _ oimè _ most compassionate lady what be there that love will not teach to he subject and what be there that he be not able to render they skilful in learn i who of all young woman be the most simple-minded and ordinarily with barely power to loose my tongue when among my companion concern the most trivial and ordinary affair now because of this my affection master so speedily all he mode of speech that in a brief space my aptness at feign and invent surpass that of any poet and there be few question put to I in response to which after meditate on they main point i could not make up a please tale : a thing in my opinion exceedingly difficult for a young woman to begin and still more difficult to finish and relate afterward but if my actual situation require it i might set down numerous detail which might perhaps seem to you of little or no moment as for instance the artful experiment whereby we test the fidelity of my favorite maid to whom and to whom alone we meditate entrust the secret of this hidden passion consider that should another share it we uneasiness lest it should not be keep would be most grievous furthermore it would weary you if i mention all the plan we adopt in order to meet diver situation plan that i do not believe be ever imagine by any before we and albeit i be now well aware that they all work for my ultimate destruction yet the remembrance of they do not displease I unless o lady my judgment be greatly at fault the strength of we mind be by no means small if it be but take in account how hard a thing it be for youthful person in love to resist long the rush of impetuous ardor without cross the bound set by reason : nay it be so great and of such quality that the most valiant of man by act in such wise would win high and worthy laud as a result thereof but my pen be now about to depict the final end to which love be guide and before i do so i would appeal to you pity and to those soft sentiment which make they dwelling in you tender breast and incline you thought to a like termination day succeed day and we wish drag along with they keep alive by torture anxiety the full bitterness whereof each of we experience although the one manifest this to the other in disguised language and the other show herself over-discreet to a excessive degree all of which you who know how lady who be beloved behave in such circumstance will easily understand well then he put full trust in the veil meaning of my word and choose the proper time and place come to a experience of that which i desire as much as he although i feign the contrary certainly if i be to say that this be the cause of the love i feel for he i should also have to confess that every time it come back to my memory it be the occasion to I of a sorrow like unto none other but i call god to witness nothing that have happen between we have the slightest influence upon the love i bear he nor have it now still i will not deny that we close intimacy be then and be now most dear to I and where be the woman so unwise as not to wish to have the object of she affection within reach rather than at a distance how much more intensely do love enthrall we when it be bring so near we that we and it be make almost inseparable i say then that after such a adventure never afore willed or even think of by I not once but many time do fortune and we adroit stratagem bring we good cheer and consolation not indeed screen entirely from danger for which i care less than for the passing of the flee wind but while the time be be spend in such joyous fashion -- and that it be joyous love who alone may bear witness thereof can truly say -- yet sometimes he come inspire I with not a little natural apprehension inasmuch as he be begin to be indiscreet in the manner of he come but how dear to he be my own apartment and with what gladness do it see he enter yet be he fill with more reverence for it than he ever have be for a sacred temple and this i could at all time easily discern woe be I what burning kiss what tender embrace what delicious moment we have there why do i take such pleasure in the mere word which i be now set down it be i say because i be force to express the gratitude i then feel to the holy goddess who be the promiser and bestower of love 's delight ah how often do i visit she altar and offer incense crown with a garland of she favorite foliage how often do i think scornfully of the counsel of my aged nurse nay furthermore be elate far more than all my other companion how often do i disparage they love say within myself : no one be love as i be loved no one love a youth as matchless as the youth i love no one realize such delight from love as i in short i count the world as nothing in comparison with my love it seem to I that my head touch the sky and that nothing be lack to the culmination of my ecstatic bliss betime the idea flash on my mind that i must disclose to other the occasion of my transport for surely i would reflect it would be a delight to other to hear of that which have bring such delight to I but thou o shame on the one side and thou o fear on the other do hold I back : the one threaten I with eternal infamy the other with loss of that which hostile fortune be soon afterward to tear from I in such wise then do i live for some time for it be then please to love that i should live in this manner and in good sooth so blithely and joyously be these day spend that i have little cause to envy any lady in the whole world never imagine that the delight wherewith my heart be fill to overflow be to nourish the root and plant of my future misery as i now know to my fruitless and never-ending sorrow end of the project gutenberg ebook of la fiammetta by giovannus boccaccio
