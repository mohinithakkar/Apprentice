on sept 14th _ -rrb- reminiscence of the siege of delhi 1857 chapter i ferozepore the actual mutiny of the bengal army break out at meerut on may 10 1857 event have happen in the lower province which foreshadow the come storm and one regiment of native infantry have be disband but no one not even those in high authority have the faintest suspicion that we rule in indium be imperil so strong indeed be the sense of security from present danger that the government with almost culpable neglect still confide to the care of the native army the large arsenal of delhus ferozepore and phillor in all of which immense quantity of ammunition and munitions of war be store there be not a single white regiment station at delhus not even a european guard the charge of the arsenal the largest in upper indium be entrust to a few officer and sergeant of artillery the same may be say of phillor in the punjab -- a small station where only native troops be quarter the fort of ferozepore near the left bank of the sutlej river be guard by 100 man detail from the sepoy regiment at that cantonment and with phillor constitute the only place from which ammunition could be draw for the large force european and native guard the newly-acquired province of the punjab she majesty 's 61st regiment of foot be station at ferozepore in may 1857 in that corps i hold a commission as lieutenant and during the absence of my captain on leave in kashmir be in temporary command of the grenadier company the regiment at this time muster nearly 1000 man half that number old and gallant veteran of from ten to twenty year ' service these have fight in many indian campaign and on the terrible day of chillianwallum in January 1849 when the khalsa army roll back in utter defeat a portion of lord gough 's force have under the leadership of sir colin campbell alter the fortune of the battle advance in line under a tremendous cannonade and without firing a shot they march as if on parade and in stern silence till within fifty yard of the sikh battery when with a shout which strike terror into the breast of they enemy they charge irresistibly and take the gun it be to man such as these that fortunately for the maintenance of we empire in the east england trust in the perilous day of 1857 as of my own regiment so it may be say of all then quarter in indium -- sturdy fine fellow of good physique of rare discipline and inure to the climate who in the word of the iron duke could march anywhere and fight anything the army then have not be improve out of existence reform if such they can be call be receive with considerable disfavor for what amelioration could be effect in the discipline and steady courage of those who have storm the height of the alma have stand the shock of the muscovite at inkerman and have not despair on the bloody field of ferozeshah and chillianwallum i may be excuse if i thus energetically offer my tribute of praise to that army and more especially to that regiment in which i pass my young day i recall the numberless act of devotion and courage the tender solicitude with which the veteran of the grenadier company look after the safety of they youthful commander during the campaign of 1857 and my pen falter and my eye grow dim with tear as memory bring before I my gallant comrade in the rank who fall before delhus or lose they life through disease and exposure i have be absent from my regiment during the whole of 1856 do duty at the murree convalescent depot and rejoin in march of the following year nothing occur for the next two month to break the monotony of life in a indian cantonment parade in the early morning racket and billiards during the day a drive or ride along the mall in the cool of the evening and the usual mess dinner -- these constitute the routine of we uneventful existence many of the officer lament the hard fate which have doom they to service in the east while the more fortunate regiment have be earn fame and quick promotion in the crimea and in the recent persian campaign we little think of what be in store for we or of the volcano which be smoulder under we foot the sign of incipient mutiny in the native army have be confine up to this time to the presidency of bengal and to the regiment quarter there with we at ferozepore there be little if any indication of the come outbreak true it be that some of we notice sullen look and strange demeanor among the sepoy of the two battalion they on occasion pass we officer without the customary salute and if my memory serve a complaint of this want of respect be forward to they colonel we billiard-marker too a high-caste brahmin who have serve on we side in the afghan campaign of 1839-42 in the capacity of a spy a man of cunning and intelligence warn we in unmistakable term of the increase disaffection among the sepoy of ferozepore and state he opinion that the spirit of mutiny be rife among they we laugh at he fear and dismiss from we mind all alarm vaunt we superiority in arm to the dusky soldiery of hindostan and in we heart foolishly regard they with lordly contempt thus pass in the usual quiet the first twelve day of the month of may 1857 the morning of may 13 see we as usual on parade then adjourn to the mess-house we spend a few hour over breakfast and billiards and before midday separate to pass the heat of the day reading lounge and sleep at we respective bungalow i occupy a large house some distance from the mess in company with a field-officer and the adjutant of my regiment the former about 1 p m be summon by a orderly to attend a meeting at the quarter of the brigadier -lrb- 1 -rrb- command the troops at ferozepore we pay no heed to this incident as it occur to we that the major 's advice and opinion be require on some matter of regimental or other routine vicar and i be in the habit since the hot weather begin of make ice every afternoon and have become from long practice quite proficient at the work at three o'clock we be in the midst of we occupation we whole thought and energy bent on the accomplishment of we task clothe in loose déshabillé seat on the floor of the sitting-room we work and watch the process of congelation presently a quick step be hear in the hall the door be throw open and the major rush in sink breathless into a chair the adjutant and i jump up and in we haste upset the utensil spilling on the floor the contents we have take so much trouble to prepare a minute or two pass and still no word from we friend who portly in shape and of a plethoric temperament seem overcome by some terrible excitement and fairly gasp for breath what on earth be the matter we ask slowly and as though utter with considerable difficulty the answer come : all the european in indium have be murder now this be rather a startling announcement and somewhat premature consider that we three at any rate be in the land of the living with no immediate prospect of come dissolution we look at each other at first serious and alarmed as become the gravity of the situation and utterly unable to comprehend what it all mean this phase of the affair however do not last long and soon change from grave to gay a merry twinkle appear in vicar ' eye to which my own respond and at last fully alive to the absurdity of the gallant officer 's remark we pent-up sense of the ridiculous be fairly awaken and we roar with laughter again and again this unlooked-for result of he dismal communication rouse the major who first rebuke we for we levity and after a interval occupy in the recovery of he scattered sens proceed to acquaint we with the true fact of what have happen at the brigadier 's quarter a despatch by telegraph have arrive that morning from meerut the largest cantonment in upper indium state that the regiment of native light cavalry at that place have mutiny in a body on the 10th instant and march for delhus this have be follow by a revolt of all the sepoy infantry and artillery a rising of the native in the city the bazaar and the surrounding country who almost unchecked have murder the european man and woman on whom they could lay they hand and besides have set fire to and loot many house in the station fortunately for the safety of the english in indium the miscreant fail to cut the telegraph-wire at meerut till too late and the news of the mutiny and outrage be as quickly as possible flash to every cantonment in the country the brigadier have therefore order the commanding and field officer of the different regiment station at ferozepore to meet he in consultation at he quarter intelligence so startling as that just receive require no small amount of judgment and deliberation in deal with the native soldier at this cantonment and some time elapse before the council decide as to what be best to be do under the circumstance finally it be resolve that a general parade of she majesty 's 61st foot and the battery of european artillery should be hold at four o'clock on the line in front of the barracks of the former corps the two regiment of native infantry be to assemble at the same time and with they english officer be order to march from they quarter take separate direction : the 45th to proceed into the country leave the fort of ferozepore on they right while the 57th be to march out of cantonment to the left rear of the line of the european infantry the commanding officer of these regiment be also instruct to keep they man if possible well in hand to allow no straggling and to halt in the country until further order after they have proceed three or four mile the remain regiment the 10th native light cavalry for some reason or other be consider staunch -lrb- and as event prove it remain so for a time -rrb- and it be therefore ordain that the trooper should parade mount and under arm in they own line ready for any emergency thus far we learn from the major and vicar whose duty as adjutant require he presence at the barracks at once don he uniform and mount he horse ride in all haste to give direction for the general parade shortly before four o'clock the major and i also leave the house and join the regiment which be draw up in open column of company in front of the line notice have previously be send to the married officer in the station direct they to make immediate arrangement for the transport of they wife and family to the barracks this order be obey without loss of time and before half-past four all the lady and child in the cantonment be safe under the protection of we soldier at the main guard the barracks of the european infantry at ferozepore be distant half a mile from the station and consist of ten or twelve large detach building one for each company arrange in echelon with some thirty pace between each in front of these be the parade-ground where we be draw up and before we a open plain 300 yard in width extend to the entrenched camp or as it be generally call the fort and arsenal of ferozepore the space around the fort be quite clear its position be directly opposite the center of the cantonment from which it be separate by some 200 yard from we situation on parade we have a direct and unbroken view of the locality i have endeavor to describe and hold this vantage-ground we should be enable to act as circumstance might require the regiment wheel into line more than 900 strong one hundred man under command of a field-officer be then detach with order to disarm the sepoy guard in the fort and to remain there on duty pend any attempt which might probably be make by the two native regiment to gain forcible possession of the arsenal the detachment march off and we watch we comrade cross the plain and enter without molestation the gate of the fort in anxious expectation we wait for the result when after a short interval shot be hear and we know that we man have engage the sepoy guard the firing be continuous while it last but soon die away a mount officer then ride out at the gate and gallop to where the colonel be stand report that the sepoy when order to lay down they arm refuse and that one of they take direct aim at the major -lrb- 2 -rrb- shoot he in the thigh leave a dangerous wound we man then pour a volley into the mutineer who fire in return but fortunately without cause any casualty on we side two sepoy have be kill and several wound while the remainder offering no further resistance be disarm and make prisoner meantime the regiment stand under arm in line and another company be send to reinforce the man in the fort amid great excitement more especially among the young soldier we wait to see what would follow when the sepoy battalion march from cantonment into the country appear in sight eagerly it be whisper amongst we will the rascal fight or remain loyal and obedient to the order of they officer the evening be draw on apace but at last about six o'clock the head of the column emerge from the house and garden of the station the 45th native infantry advance in almost a direct line to the fort while the 57th native infantry be incline to they right and follow the road lead to the rear of we line all eye be turn on the former regiment and its movement be ardently scan closer and closer they come to the fort till when only about fifty pace distant the column waver we could see the officer rush about among they man and in another instant the whole mass break into disorder and run pell-mell in hundred towards the ditch which surround the entrenchment this be of no depth with sloping side and easy to escalade and in less time than i take to write it the sepoy with a shout jump into the trench scramble up the parapet and disappear from we sight into the enclosure it be not long before we hear the sound of firing and shot come in quick succession madden we beyond control for we think of we man few in number and scatter over the fort oppose to some five or six hundred of these savage we have load with ball-cartridge soon after form on parade and the man now grasp they musket and cry and murmur be hear why do we not advance and all this couch in language more forcible than polite the order at last be give to fix bayonet and then come the welcome word : the line will advance every heart thrill with excitement all long to have a brush with the mutineer and help we comrade in the fort who be fight against such odds twenty pace only we advance and then by the brigadier 's command we colonel -lrb- 3 -rrb- give the order to halt the man be furious and could hardly be restrain from march forward when look towards the outer side of the fort we see some sepoy on the rampart evidently in a state of panic throw themselves into the ditch and mount the other side run helterhelterskelter into the country these be follow by number of other who all make off as fast as they leg would carry they and then we hear a true british cheer we man appear on the wall shoot at the fugitive bayonet and drive they over the glaci the fight have continue some twenty minute and be pretty severe while it last a few of we man be more or less hurt but of the sepoy many have be kill and wound about 100 also have lay down they arm and beg for mercy be take prisoner nothing could have be more culpable than the conduct of the brigadier in not advance a portion at any rate of my regiment to the fort at the time the sepoy break they rank and enter the entrenchment have he do so it be probable that not one of the mutineer of the 45th native infantry would have escape nor would the havoc which afterwards occur in the cantonment have take place but he be a old east indium company 's officer and have serve upward of forty year in the native army have to the last like many other at that eventful time implicit confidence in the loyalty of the sepoy he fear also the responsibility of let loose the english soldiery to wreak they vengeance on the mutineer know too well that with passion rouse and heart steel to pity by the murder and outrage commit at meerut and the late wounding of they field-officer we man would have give no quarter the brigadier be one of the very few officer in high command at the outbreak of the mutiny who be find want in the time of trial he no doubt be a hard task but have he show the smallest aptitude to meet the crisis there would have be no difficulty with the ample means at he disposal in disarm without bloodsh the whole native force at ferozepore and so crush the rebellion at that station night come and we still remain in line under arm without have move a foot from where we be halt conjecture be rife as to what would next happen officer and man be grieve no less than annoy at the state of inaction in which we have be keep and a uneasy feeling prevail that during the night the mutinous sepoy aid by the _ badmash _ or bad character who swarm in the bazaar and city of ferozepore would under cover of the darkness run riot over the cantonment without we be call on to interfere and so unhappily it come to pass the native cavalry at about eight o'clock march down to we line and draw up on the right of the regiment the european artillery be on we left flank soon after they arrival the arm be pile and the man fall out of the rank some to lie down on the ground other form in group and discuss the strange event of the day suddenly a light be see in the direction of the cantonment which quickly turn into a blaze of fire what new horror be this be we house to be gut and burn before we eye without any attempt to prevent such outrage the man at the first appearance of fire have spring to they foot and almost involuntarily seize they arm surely a detachment would be send to clear the cantonment of the incendiary even this be not do : the brigadier be absent or could not be find and we colonel intimate to some officer who speak to he on the subject that he could give no order without the chief 's consent so incredible though it may appear we stand and watch the fire which follow each other in quick succession till the whole cantonment seem in a blaze and the flame dart up in every direction light up the surrounding country we could hear distinctly the shout of the scoundrel and picture to ourselves the black wretch hold high carnival among the burning building and laugh at the white soldier who with arm in they hand remain motionless in they own line that night more than twenty house be burn to the ground the english church we afterwards hear be first fire then the roman catholic chapel we mess-house and nineteen other bungalow the sepoy mostly of the 45th native infantry attend by dozen of _ badmash _ march unchallenged through the station with light torch fix on long bamboo pole with which they set fire to the thatched roof of the various house all night long we lay by we arm watch the destruction of we property and thankful only that the wife and child of we officer and man be safe under we care and not expose to the fury of the wretch engage in they fiendish work even after this long lapse of year i can not think of that night without a feeling of shame here be 700 man mostly veteran of one of she majesty 's regiment doom to inaction through the blundering and stupid perverseness of a old sepoy brigadier the same unhappy event as those i have narrate occur at the outbreak of the mutiny in three other station in the bengal presidency the commander would not act against they trust sepoy who as in we case plunder outraged and destroy all and everything that come in they way _ may 14 _ -- the morning of may 14 dawn close and hot not a breath of wind stir the sun rise like a ball of fire and shortly afterwards we be startle by a explosion which shake the earth under we foot and sound like a heavy peal of thunder in the still morning air look in the direction of the report we see on the far right side of the cantonment a thick black column of smoke shoot up high into the atmosphere a quarter of a hour pass and then another detonation similar to the first sound in we ear on the left rear flank follow as before by a dense cloud of smoke we say to ourselves : will the arsenal next be blow up in the fort be store a immense quantity of powder and munitions of war and fear that perhaps some rebel might have find he way in for the purpose of devote he life to the destruction of the entrenchment and the annihilation of the european guard we remain anxiously expectant for some time no cause could be assign for the explosion we have hear but we be inform subsequently that by the order of we commander the magazine or bell of arm belong to the two native regiment have be blow up by a party of sapper in the fear that they might fall into the hand of the rebellious sepoy it be a futile precaution and a mere waste of ammunition for nothing could have be easier than to send the contents of the magazine under we escort to the arsenal at eight o'clock we be dismiss to barracks and leave the spot where we have stand in line inert and inactive since four o'clock the previous afternoon shortly after breakfast i be send for by the colonel to the orderly-room and inform that it be the wish of the brigadier that i should proceed with my company into the cantonment i be order to make strict search for and to take prisoner any sepoy or bad character that might be lurk about and to this end i be to patrol the station from one side to the other i be also to visit the commissariat quarter disarm the native guard use force if necessary and secure the treasure chest which contain some 20000 rupee it strike I that this duty might very well have be perform many hour before why have not a company be detail to patrol the cantonment the previous evening or at any rate at the first sign of incendiarism however i start without delay with ninety grenadier and march over a great part of the station extend the company in skirmish order whenever we pass through the numerous large garden orchard and enclosure not a soul be to be see and the place seem entirely desert the sepoy after they work of destruction must have leave during the night and be now probably well on they way to delhi while the _ badmash _ who have assist they have return quietly to they occupation in the bazaar of the city the cantonment present a complete scene of desolation the church and chapel be a heap of burnt-up and smoulder ruin we mess-house the same and numerous bungalow -- former residence of the officer -- be still on fire the heat from the burning ember be intense and as we pass slowly by we view with anger in we heart the lamentable result of the timidity and vacillation the irresolution and culpable neglect of one man lastly we visit the commissariat quarter at the far side of the station here there be no guard not even a native in charge strange inconsistency it turn out that some hour before we arrival the sepoy guard true in this respect to they trust have procure a cart take the treasure to the fort there hand it over to the officer at the gate and then start for delhus my duty be accomplish and i march the grenadier back to barracks then report the unsatisfactory result of my mission to the colonel and thoroughly tire and wear out from want of rest i throw myself on a bed and sleep soundly for some hour we be tell that afternoon that the 57th native infantry who have march to the rear of we barracks the evening before have remain quietly in the country during the night without one sepoy show any mutinous disposition in the early morning without molest they english officer about half the regiment signify they intention of march down-country while of the rest some 300 man return to they line at ferozepore and on be call upon to do so by the colonel lay down they arm it must be record to the credit of these regiment that no officer be hurt by they or even insult the sepoy quietly but firmly announce that they release themselves from the service of the east indium company and be about to become enrol as subject of the king of delhus then in several instance even salute they officer and show they every mark of respect they turn they face to the great focus of rebellion to swell the number of those who be about to fight against we in the mohammedan capital of hindostan the officer of these two corps be more fortunate than they comrade of other regiment throughout the land many of whom be shoot down by they own sepoy in cold blood under circumstance of signal barbarity they see they wife and child murder before they face while those who escape the fury of the sepoy wander in helpless flight through jungle and plain suffer incredible privation some few there be who reach a friendly station or be succour and hide by loyal native but the greater number fall by the hand of the wretch who in these time of outrage and anarchy swarm out of the low quarter of the city and sweep unchecked over the whole country in hundred and thousand the officer have take up they quarter in the barracks in one or the center building which be reserve entirely for they use here we endeavor to make ourselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstance the large apartment serve at once as mess-house sitting-room and bedroom for we all the colonel alone live apart while the married lady and they family for the present occupy the main guard bungalow pend arrangement for more suitable quarter the poor lady as be natural be in a state of great agitation and would not be comfort we do we best to quiet they fear tell they there be not the slightest danger as regard they safety that even be we attack by the rebel they need have no dread of the result for we be more than a match for double we number of sepoy still it pained we much to see they distress and we could only be thankful that come what might they be under the protection of british soldier on the evening of may 14 at sunset i be sit smoking and chat in the barrack-room with some of we officer when quite unexpectedly i be again call to the orderly-room and direct to march with the grenadier company on outlying picket to the left rear of the cantonment and close to the line of the disarm sepoy two gun of the light field battery under a subaltern be also place under my order and i take with I a young ensign to assist I in my duty the brigadier say he have receive intelligence that a attack by the mutineer be expect from the direction of lahore and i be tell to keep a sharp lookout in case the enemy make during the night a flank movement on the station i be also constantly to patrol the line of the native regiment to confine the sepoy to they hut and to take prisoner any who venture outside the short indian twilight be draw to a close when i arrive on the ground and without lose time i draw up the grenadier in line with the two gun a little in advance and on my left flank two sentry be post in front of the gun two on the right and left of my small detachment and two in the rear the plain extend before we for mile to the horizon bare and treeless without one intervene obstacle evening close and night come on -- a night dark as erebus though the star shine bright and luminous in the heaven all nature be silent as the grave and save for the tramp of the sentinel and the march away and return of the patrolling party for hour we hear no sound before leave barracks the picket have load the gun with grape and the old brown bess -lrb- there be no rifle in most of the indian regiment in those far-off day -rrb- with ball-cartridge i have also order the man to fix bayonet and we be thus fully prepare to give a warm reception to any sepoy who might attack we the arm be pile and in silence we lay on the ground presently about midnight one of the sentinel in front of the gun challenge : who come there there be no answer and the cry be repeat the sentry at the same moment firing off he musket the company spring to they arm and i call on the sentry in front to retreat under cover of the gun almost simultaneously and before the man could retire flash of fire appear on the plain and numerous shot come whistle over we head while clear and distinct a cry ring out and we know that one of the sentry have be hit close follow the first come several straggle shot but the rascal fire too high and we have no casualty i then order the man to fire a volley and the artillery officer at the same time sweep he front with grape from the two gun after these discharge all be still and we strain we eye in the darkness but could see nothing then take with I a sergeant and four man i proceed to where the sentry have make the first challenge we find the poor fellow lie face downward on the ground and raise he up saw that he be quite dead slowly and tenderly the body be bear to the picket and on examination by the light of a lantern we discover that he have receive a bullet over the region of the heart and that death therefore must have be instantaneous my heart sicken at the sight this be my first contact with the horror of war and the remembrance will remain with I to my die day the other sentinel be then question and from he we learn that peer through the darkness when the challenge be first give he have see figure pass in he front across the plain soon they halt and fire and then disappear probably have lie down to escape be hit by we man hear this i send out a small reconnoitr party which patrol the plain for some distance they return with the news that all be quiet and no human being be to be see two fresh sentry be place in front of the gun and the man lay down as before fully expect another attack _ may 15 _ -- all however pass off without further incident and at sunrise i march the picket to barracks and report myself to the brigadier he make no comment on the event of the night nor do he even ask for particulars as to the manner of the soldier 's death the mutineer he say be in scatter detachment still no doubt prowl about the outskirts of the cantonment and in the neighbouring village take advantage of every opportunity to harass and inflict loss on we soldier from this time forward for nearly a month with the single exception of one encounter with a body of mutineer which i shall relate hereafter no event of importance occur at ferozepore the chief danger have pass from we midst in the flight towards delhus of more than half of the two battalion of sepoy the disarmament of 300 of the 57th and the imprisonment of those who have be capture fight when attempt to take the arsenal everything be thus comparatively peaceful with no enemy in the vicinity the brigadier at last wake up to a sense of he duty and extraordinary measure be take by he command for the safety of the cantonment and line of ferozepore it be order that one company should be place each night on advanced outlying picket another on rear picket and a third to be station at the main guard to furnish sentry as a cordon round the whole extent of the barracks two company be to remain constantly in the fort in charge of a senior captain so that out of the ten company six be always on duty under the excitement which first prevail and the necessity of be prepare in case of a night attack from the rove band of rebellious soldiery who from all direction be make for the imperial city plunder and ravage on the route this duty be cheerfully undertake but as time go by and week succeed week without a shot be fire to relieve the monotony of we life the work become irksome in the extreme the regiment therefore fall into a regular groove of guard and picket duty we long to have a fight with the enemy and still be doom to remain in a state of masterly inactivity at the fort the work be most try and resolve itself into a course of manual labor there it be order that under the ammunition shed deep pit be to be dig in the ground this duty be perform entirely by the english soldier and continue for a fortnight in the hottest season of the year in the receptacle thus form all the barrel of powder as well as the small arm ammunition etc be packed and stow away the whole be cover with earth to the depth of several foot this be a very needful expedient for a stray spark might have blow up the vast store of munitions of war without which it would have be impossible to carry on future operation against the enemy no fire for any purpose be permit in the fort and greatest deprivation of all the man be not allow to smoke during the twenty-four hour they be on guard three or four day after the outbreak and when everything seem quiet in and around the cantonment two officer and myself take with we some native labourer carry spade and shovel proceed under order from we colonel to search for the silver plate bury under the ruin of we mess-house we find the brick wall stand but all inside the building be one mass of ash and still-smouldering ember we know the locality of the plate chest and set the coolie to work after infinite labor which last some hour we succeed in remove a vast heap of cinder and find portion of the silver a little lower down we come on more and here be see spoon melt almost out of shape by fire the large silver dish plate and cup -- many of the latter of priceless value for they have be acquire by the regiment during the peninsular war -- be lie one on top of the other just as they have be place in the chest but all ruin and disfigure half melted and blacken from the intense heat close by where they have fall off a table be the four massive silver candelabrum the gift of distinguished officer who have formerly serve in the corps these be twist out of all shape and beyond hope of repair of no value but for the bullion other article there be such as snuff-boxes drinking-horn and table ornament not one single piece of silver have escape the action of the fire it be a sorry sight to look on the total destruction of we beautiful mess furniture costly goods have be sacrifice which no money could replace not one single article belong to the officer have be save gather together all the silver we could find and lament the incompetence by which we have lose property amounting in value to # 2000 we place everything in a cart and convey it to the barracks many month afterwards the government direct a committee of officer to value the effect destroy by the mutineer to the end that remuneration might be grant to the regiment for loss sustain this committee after due consideration place the estimate at a very low figure -- viz # 1500 the parsimony of those in power refuse we full payment of this just debt intimate also that the demand be exorbitant and close all further action in the matter by send we a draft on the treasury for half the amount claim for the first week or ten day after the outbreak at ferozepore we know very little of what be occur down-country as well as throughout the punjab the province of the five river to we north in that newly-acquired territory there be twenty-six regiment of the native army while the sikh the warlike people who inhabit the land have meet we in deadly conflict only nine year before from the latter then as well as from the sepoy there be cause for great anxiety every precaution therefore be necessary to guard the ferozepore arsenal the largest next to delhi in upper indium the temper of the sikh be uncertain no one could foretell which side they would take in the come struggle we empire in hindostan -- during the month of may more especially -- tremble in the balance there be infinite cause for alarm for month afterwards even to the fall of delhus but at no time be we in such a strait as at that period when the loyalty or defection of the sikh regiment and people be a open question the genius of sir john lawrence the chief commissioner of the punjab ward off the danger that eminent man the savior of indium issue a proclamation call on the sikh to aid we in we trouble they come at once in hundred -- nay thousand -- to enlist on we side veteran of runjeet singh 's khalsa army the man who have withstand we on equal term in many sanguinary battle animated by intense hatred of the poorbeah sepoy enrol themselves in the rank of the british army and fight faithfully for we to the end of the war they help be we safety without these soldier and the assistance render by they chieftain delhi could never have be take while on the other hand have they rise and cast in they lot with the mutinous sepoy no power on earth could have save we from total annihilation the sikh be the beau-ideal of soldier tall and erect in bear wiry and well-knit and of great muscular development they whole appearance stamp they as man who look upon themselves as lord of the soil whom it would be difficult to conquer and without doubt the campaign of 1845-46 and 1848-49 be the hardest in which we have be engage in indium for 100 year they have dominate the land of the five river ever eager for war they turbulent spirit give they no rest it have be a belief that they would in the future acquire the sovereignty of hindostan and i know for certain that among the soldier for many year there have be a tradition that one day they would sack the imperial city of delhus the latter expectation be in a manner fulfil but not as a independent nation or under they own leader do they capture and plunder the mohammedan capital : they accomplish that feat as loyal subject of the british crown every now and then news reach we of the spread of the mutiny till from calcutta to peshawar there be few station where the native troops have not join in the rebellion cavalry infantry and artillery all have rise in revolt the wave of mutiny be surge to and fro throughout the land and as yet little have be do to stem the tide true a small force be be assemble at umballah which under the commander-in-chief be about to march to delhus but of the doings of that army we could learn no satisfactory tiding the closing day of the month of may pass wearily by and time hang heavily on we hand we feel the inevitable reaction from the first few day of excitement and also miss the comfort and ease to which we have be accustom in former hot season the barracks be close and stuffy and the officer in place of the luxury of they bungalow and they pleasant mess have to endure privation of every kind hot wind parch up the already arid ground blow fiercely every day at sunset the breeze usually die away and though the temperature lessen somewhat in degree we feel a choke sensation from the effect of the dry still atmosphere no officer sleep in the barrack-room we servant carry the bed outside and there lie down and gasp for breath we vainly court the sleep that would not come there be however a humorous side to this desolate picture which i must now relate as it show that notwithstanding the state of dejection to which we have be reduce there still lurk a spirit of fun and mischief among the officer for some time after the revolt we have night-attack on the brain nothing be speak of but the chance of we line be assault by wander body of mutinous sepoy the order-book each evening remind we of the danger inculcate strict vigilance on picket and on guard so long do this last without any attack be make that the shadowy expectation of what never occur become we bugbear a chimera which haunt we night and day at last in a happy hour it enter into the mind of one of we young lieutenant a irishman imbue with the spirit of fun and the jolliest fellow in the regiment that this illusion under which we be all labor might be make the subject for a frolic he communicate he idea to myself and some other of the junior officer and it be then and there decide that as the sepoy would not attack we we would create a little excitement and diversion by play for the nonce the role of mutineer the council of war then agree unanimously that a assault be to be make on the remain officer when asleep outside the barracks and that the weapon to be use should be bolster and pillow a certain night be fix on for the accomplishment of we purpose and the signal for the attack be to be give by the originator of the plot who would take upon himself to make sure that the enemy be off they guard wrap in the arm of morpheus everything have be arrange to we satisfaction and the eventful night come at ten o'clock light be put out and the assault party consist of six stalwart young subaltern lay down on they bed outside the barracks range here and there among those who be to play the part of the enemy and wait for the signal from we commander we opponent seem to take a unconscionable long time in go to sleep but at length in the small hour of the morning when all be quiet the alarm be sound in a low whistle jump up from we bed each man arm himself with a bolster in stern and solemn silence we force be marshal for the attack and then without any word of warn each one begin belabour with all he might the recumbent figure of the foe startle out of they sleep and in a half-dreamy state of unconsciousness it may be imagine with what strange feeling they receive this assault some more especially the older officer -lrb- for in we zeal we spare no one -rrb- seem perfectly bewildered and in the midst of the shower of blow which rain on they without intermission vow vengeance and threaten to put we under arrest we answer they that this be a night-attack and they must prepare for defense as no quarter would be give even the fat and portly major notwithstanding he rank feel the strength of we arm and almost bereft of breath between each blow command we to desist he might as well have speak to the wind : we blood be up and the spirit of fun have take possession so that i verily believe have the colonel or brigadier be lie there neither of they would have escape we onslaught the enemy be now fully arouse and not relish the fun of be buffet unmercifully in they bed without resistance they one and all turn out and seize they pillow join in the fight the attack begin with tactical judgment turn now into a confused mêlée friend and foe be mix up in one grand shindy and for many minute the battle continue without intermission blow fall fast and thick there be a rush about of half-clad figure sway bolster and each one intent on the same object -- namely that of overcome he antagonist for the time be so weird and yet so utterly ludicrous a sight surely never have be see before or since in indium at length from sheer exhaustion the combat come to a end and sit on we bed pant from fatigue and overcome by the heat of the night we discuss the incident of the fight some of the senior officer seem at first inclined to treat the attack as something more than a joke and threaten to report we to the colonel we point out to they that such a proceeding would be absurd for have they not also compromise themselves by join in the fray it be not long however before they be strike with the grand ridiculousness of this very strange episode and the question at issue as may naturally be suppose end in laughter peace be restore we wish each other good-night and thoroughly wear out by we exertion all sleep soundly till break of day the affair be keep quiet as far as possible but gradually get noised abroad among other regiment of she majesty 's infantry great amusement be cause by the recital nor for a long period afterwards be the comical night-attack at ferozepore forget the trial of the sepoy who have be take prisoner when resist the detachment send to disarm they in the fort and of those also who attack the arsenal on may 13 have be proceed for some time it be a general court-martial compose of thirteen officer preside over by a lieutenant-colonel of the prisoner take some 100 be single out as the ringleader the rest be put back for trial till a future occasion the evidence be most clear as to the heinous offence of mutiny and rebellion with regard to all these man and they be accordingly find guilty sentence be at once pronounce on fourteen of the sepoy and the punishment be death two man of low caste be to be hang while the remain twelve comprise mohammedan and high-caste hindoo be to expiate they crime by that most awful and ghastly penalty execution by be blow to piece from the mouth of cannon this terrible punishment have be but seldom inflict during british rule in indium the last instance occur in 1825 when a native regiment mutiny and refuse to cross the sea to take part in the first burmese war neither be it from the english that this special death penalty originate it have be for hundred of year the recognize punishment for mutiny and rebellion throughout hindostan and in numberless case be carry out by the mogul emperor with we at this period it be find necessary to strike terror into the heart of the rebel to prove to they that we be resolve at all hazard to crush the revolt and to give warn that to those who be take fight against we no mercy would be show on religious grounds also the infliction of the death penalty by blow away mutineer at the mouth of cannon be dread both by the hindoo and mohammedan the hindoo unless the corpse after death be burn to ash with all ceremony or else consign to the sacred stream of the gange can not partake of the glory of the future state nor dwell in bliss everlasting with the god of he mythology so with the mohammedan the koran enjoin that all true believer must be bury with the body in the natural state and only those be exempt who have lose limb in fight against the infidel the joy of paradise where ever-young and beautiful houri minister to the want and pleasure of the faithful be therefore not for those who meet a shameful death and be deny or unable to obtain burial in the orthodox manner thus it will be see the terror of future shame and dishonor result to both hindoo and mohammedan by the death we be about to inflict on they and it be for the awe inspire by the punishment that the military authority at this time think proper to carry it out in this unaccustomed manner _ June 13 _ -- the morning of June 13 be fix upon for the execution a gallows be erect on the plain to the north side of the fort face the native bazaar and at a distance of some 300 yard on this two sepoy be to be hang and at the same time they comrade in mutiny be to be blow away from gun we parade at daylight every man off duty and with the band playing march to the place of execution and draw up in line near the gallows and opposite the native quarter shortly after we arrival the european light field battery of six gun appear on the scene form up on we left flank and about twenty yard in front of the light company the morning be close and sultry not a cloud in the sky and not a breath of wind stir and i confess i feel sick with a suffocating sense of horror when i reflect on the terrible sight i be about to witness soon the fourteen mutineer under a strong escort of we man with fix bayonet be see move from the fort they advance over the plain at we rear and draw up to the left front of and at right angle to the battery of artillery i be stand at the extreme right of the line with the grenadier company and some distance from the gun but i have provide myself with a pair of strong glass and therefore see all that follow clearly and distinctly there be no unnecessary delay in the accomplishment of the tragedy two of the wretched creature be march off to the gallows and place with rope round they neck on a raise platform under the beam the order be give for the gun to be load and quick as think the european artilleryman place a quarter charge of powder in each piece the gun be 9-pounder the muzzle standing about 3 foot from the ground during these awful preparation i watch at interval the face of the condemn man but could detect no trace of fear or agitation in they demeanor the twelve stand two deep six in front and six in the rear calm and undismay without utter a word a officer come forward and by the brigadier 's order read the sentence of the court-martial and at its conclusion the six man in front under escort walk towards the battery there be a death-like silence over the scene at this time and overcome with horror my heart seem almost to cease beat arrive at the gun the culprit be hand over to the artilleryman who ready prepare with strong rope in they hand seize they victim each of these stand erect be bind to a cannon and tightly secure with the small of the back cover the muzzle and then all at once the silence which reign around be break by the oath and yell of those about to die these sound be not utter by man afraid of death for they show the most stoical indifference but be the long-suppressed utterance of die soul who in the bitterness of they heart curse those who have be instrumental in condemn they to this shameful end they one and all pour out malediction on we head and in they language one most rich in expletive they exhaust the whole vocabulary meanwhile the gunner stand with light port-fire wait for the word of command to fire the gun and launch the sepoy into eternity these be still yell and rain abuse some even look over they shoulder and watch without emotion the port-fire about to be apply to the touch-hole when the word fire sound from the officer in command and part of the tragedy be at a end a thick cloud of smoke issue from the muzzle of the cannon through which be distinctly see by several of we the black head of the victim throw many foot into the air while this tragic drama be enact the two sepoy to be hang be turn off the platform the artilleryman again load the gun the six remain prisoner cursing like they comrade be bind to they another discharge and then a execution the like of which i hope never to see again be complete all this time a sickening offensive smell pervade the air a stench which only those who have be present at scene such as these can realize -- the pungent odour of burnt human flesh the artilleryman have neglect put up back-board to they gun so that horrible to relate at each discharge the recoil throw back piece of burn flesh bespatter the man and cover they with blood and calcine remain a large concourse of native from the bazaar and city have assemble in front of the house face the gun at a distance as i say before of some 300 yard to watch the execution at the second discharge of the cannon and on look before I i notice the ground tear up and earth throw a slight distance into the air more than 200 pace away almost at the same time there be a commotion among the throng in front some run to and fro while other run off in the direction of the house i call the attention of a officer who be stand by my side to this strange and unaccountable phenomenon and say half joking : surely the scatter limb of the sepoy have not be carry so far he agree with I that such be impossible but how to account for the sight we have see be quite beyond we comprehension the drama come to a end about six o'clock and as be usual even after a funeral or a military execution the band strike up a air and we march back to barracks hope soon to drive from we mind the recollection of the awful scene we have witness two or three hour after we return news arrive that one native have be kill and two wound among the crowd which have stand in we front spectator of the recent execution how this happen have never be explain at this time a cantonment guard be mount consist of a company of european infantry half a troop of the 10th light cavalry and four gun and two of these gun load with grape be keep ready during the night the horse be harness etc half the cavalry also be hold in readiness saddle in fact every precaution be take to meet a attack as far as i can recollect there be but two execution by blow away from gun on any large scale by we during the mutiny one of they that at ferozepore -lrb- illustration : plan of the military station at ferozepore -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : brigadier-general inne -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : major redmond -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : colonel william jone cb -rrb- chapter ii on the march after the excitement of the late execution we be prepare to relapse into we usual state of inaction and monotony when on the morning of June 13 a courier arrive from lahore the headquarters of the executive government of the punjab he bring instruction and order from sir john lawrence to the brigadier command at ferozepore to the effect that a wing of she majesty 's 61st regiment be to proceed at once to reinforce the army under sir henry barnard now besiege the city of delhus that force on June 8 have fight a action with the mutineer at badli-ki-serai four mile from delhus drive they from they entrenched position and capture thirteen gun the siege of the mohammedan stronghold have begin on the next day but the small band of english sikh and goorkha which compose the force be quite inadequate to the task entrust to it and in truth could do nothing but act on the defensive against the horde of rebellious sepoy who outnumber they by four to one it may be conceive with what joy the order to advance be receive by the officer and man of my regiment we have at length a prospect of enter upon a regular campaign and the heart of all of we beat high at the chance of see active service against the enemy to the colonel command it be leave to select the five company compose a wing of the corps to march to delhi all of course be eager to go and we know there would be heart-burnings and regret amongst those leave behind the follow company be choose out of the ten : grenadier no 2 3 7 and the light company they be the strongest in point of number in the regiment and with the fewest man in hospital so that it could not be say that any favouritism in selection be show by the colonel the wing number all tell include officer and the band 450 man -- a timely reinforcement which together with the same number of she majesty 's 8th foot from jullundur would increase materially the army before delhus no time be lose in make preparation for the march we camp equipage be ready at hand a sufficient number of elephant camel and ox be easily procure from the commissariat authority and by eight o'clock that evening we be on we way in those day a european regiment on the line of march in indium present a striking scene each corps have its own quota of camp-follower numbering in every instance more than the regiment itself so that transport be require for fully 2000 soul and often when move along the road the baggage-train extend a mile in length the camp when pitch cover a large area of ground everything be regulate with the utmost order and the position of the motley group be define to a nicety we have be direct to take as small a kit as possible each officer be limit to two camel to carry he tent and personal effect we native servant accompany we on the line of march and i must here mention that during the long campaign on which we be about to enter there be not one single instance of desertion among these faithful and devoted follower everything be ready we parade a little before sunset on the evening of June 13 the terrible heat which prevail at this time of the year prevent we from march during the day-time moreover it be necessary to preserve the health of the soldier at this critical period when every european in indium be require to make head against the rebel so on every occasion when practicable the english regiment move over the country march at night rest under cover of they tent during the day -lrb- 1 -rrb- shortly after sunset we bid adieu -lrb- a eternal one alas for many of the gallant soul assemble -rrb- to the comrade we be leave behind the band strike up and we set off in high spirit on we long and arduous march of more than 350 mile the night as usual be close and sultry with a slight hot wind blow but the man step out briskly the soldier of the lead company presently strike up a well-known song the chorus of which be join in by the man in the rear we march slowly for it be necessary every now and then to halt so as to allow the long train of baggage to come up and it be nearly sunrise before we reach the first halting-ground the camp be pitch and we remain under cover all day start as before soon after sunset and thus pass the sixteen day which be occupy in reach delhus every precaution be take to prevent surprise as we be march to all intent and purpose through a enemy 's country and expect attack on we baggage from straggle body of mutineer _ June 18 _ -- at loodianah five march from ferozepore and which we reach on June 18 we be fortunate enough to find more comfortable quarter the man move into some of the building which have formerly be occupy by she majesty 's 50th regiment the officer live in the kacherrus here behind tatty and under punka and with iced drink we be able to keep pretty cool but sad to say soon after we arrival in the station that terrible scourge cholera break out in we rank and in a few hour six man succumb to this frightful malady on every succeed day man be attack and die so that unhappily up to July 1 we lose in all thirty gallant fellow this disease never leave we during the entire campaign upward of 250 soldier of my regiment fall victim to the destroyer nor be we entirely free from it till the end of the year many more be attack who recover but be debar through excessive weakness from serve in the rank and be invalide home _ June 23 _ -- on reach umballah we find the station all but desert nearly all the european troops have be send on to join the delhi force the church have be place in a state of defense all its wall loophole and around it have be construct a work consist of a wall and parapet with tower of brickwork arm with field-piece _ en barbette _ at the angle in it be quarter some of the 1st bengal fusilier lately bring down from dagshai about ninety of these march with we to delhi here also we be join by four officer of the -lrb- late -rrb- 57th native infantry who have receive order to join we wing eventually to fill up vacancy in the native corps on reach the scene of operation with these we be in all twenty-four officer -- rather a strong complement even for a whole regiment the conclude day of the march be try in the extreme weary and footsore and often parch with thirst we tramp along the hot and dusty road often for mile up to we ankle in deep sand we be so tired and overcome with want of rest that many of we actually fall fast asleep along the road and would be rudely awaken by fall against other who be in the same plight as ourselves at midnight we rest when coffee and refreshment be serve out to the officer and man the halt sound every hour and for five minute we throw ourselves down on the hard ground or on the hot sand and at once fall asleep wake up somewhat restore to continue we toilsome journey from jugraon onward we have rather long march and it be consider advisable to convey the man part of the way in hackery the arrangement be that they should march halfway then halt for coffee and refreshment and afterwards ride the remainder of the distance by this mean they be keep fresh for the work before they which we have every reason to believe would be anything but light at umballah i take the opportunity of call on my friend mr george barne the commissioner of the cis-sutlej state he have show I boundless hospitality and be like a father to I when i join my regiment as a lad at kussowlie a man of great intellectual attainment and sound judgment he be a honor to the bengal civil service there be no officer at that momentous period in whom sir john lawrence place more confidence he familiarity with the native character and the friendship bear towards he by the sikh chieftain enable he throughout the siege of delhus to keep open communication with the punjab and supply the force with store provision and ammunition he would without doubt have rise to the highest honor in he profession have he not be stricken with a fatal illness in 1859 when hold the responsible post of foreign secretary to the government of indium a few march from delhus we pass over the historic field of paniput where three sanguinary battle have be fight in different age each decide the fate of hindostan for the time be more than 100000 man have be slay in these action and we feel we be march over ground the dust of which be thickly permeate with the ash of human being here first we hear the sound of distant cannonade bear thus far to we ear by the stillness of the night -- a sound which tell we that we comrade before delhus be still hold they position against the enemy at length on July 1 just as the sun be rise we emerge from a forest of tree on to the plain over which the army under sir henry barnard have move on June 8 to attack the entrenchment of the mutineer at badli-ki-serai _ July _ 1 -- eagerly we cast we eye over the ground to we front and with pride in we heart think of that gallant little force which have advance across this plain on that eventful morn under a terrific fire from the enemy 's gun soon we reach the entrenchment which have be throw up by the rebel to bar the progress of we soldier and lie in all direction we see numerous skeleton of man and horse the bone already bleached to whiteness from the effect of the burning sun dead body of camel and ox be also strew about and the stench be sicken we be now about four mile from delhus and be meet by a squadron of the 6th carabineer send to escort we into camp they receive we with a shout of welcome and while we halt for a short time inquiry be make as to the incident of the siege we learn that we small army with the tenacity of a bulldog be hold its own on the ridge overlook the city that sortie by the rebel be of almost daily and nightly occurrence and that the loss on we side be increase with the carabineer in we front the march be continue the white tent of the besiege force appear in sight about eight o'clock then the band strike up cheer boy cheer and cross the canal by a bridge we enter the camp crowd of soldier european as well as native stalwart sikh and punjabee come down to welcome we on we arrival the road on each side be line with swarthy sun-burnt and already war-worn man they cheer we to the echo and in they joy rush amongst we rank shake hand with both officer and man -lrb- illustration : delhus from the mosque picket -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the heat even under such cover be intense averaging 115 ° fahr -rrb- chapter iii before delhus a situation have already be mark out for we encampment and direct by a officer we pass through the main portion of we line and halt at the bottom of the ridge on the extreme left of we position some time be occupy after the arrival of the baggage in pitch we camp but when all be conclude vicar and i start on foot to take we first view of the imperial city we walk a short distance to the right and along the foot of the ridge and then ascend make we way to the celebrated flagstaff tower we mount to the top : and shall i ever forget the sight which meet we gaze about a mile to we front and stretch to right and leave as far as the eye could reach appear the high wall and the bastion of delhus the intervene space below be cover with a thick forest of tree and garden form a dense mass of verdure in the midst of which and peep out here and there in picturesque confusion be the white wall and roof of numerous building tall and graceful minaret hindoo temple and mohammedan mosque symmetrical in shape and gorgeous in color appear intersperse in endless number among the densely-packed house inside the city they dome and spire shine with a brilliant radiance clear-cut against the sky above all in the far distance tower the jama masjid or great mosque its three huge dome of pure white marble with two high minaret dwarf into insignificance the building by which it be surround -- surely the noblest work of art ever build by man for the service of the creator to the left could be see the lofty castellated wall of the palace of the emperor the former seat of the great mogul -- that palace in which at that moment the degenerate descendant of timor and last representative of he race hold he court and in he pride of heart fondly hope that british rule be at a end beyond rise the ancient fortress of selimgarh its wall as well as those of the palace on the north side wash by the water of the jumna a long bridge of boat connect the fort with the opposite bank of the river here many hundred yard in width : and over this we could see with the aid of glass body of armed man move it be by this bridge that most of the reinforcement and all the supplies for the mutineer cross over to the city on the very day of we arrival the mutinous bareilly brigade of infantry and artillery numbering over 3000 man march across this bridge we advanced picket at the metcalfe house stable close to the jumna hear distinctly they band play cheer boy cheer the very same tune with which we have celebrate we entrance into camp that morning few city in the world have pass through such vicissitude as delhus tradition say it be the capital of a empire age before the great macedonian invade indium and its origin be lose in the mist of antiquity trace there be in every direction amid the interminable cluster of ruin and mound outside the present city of city still more vast the builder and inhabitant of which live before the dawn of history delhus have be take and sack time out of number its riches be beyond compare and for hundred of year it have be the prey not only of every conqueror who invade indium from the north-west but also of every race which during the perpetual war in hindostan happen for the time to be predominant tartar turk afghan persian mahratta and rajpoot each in turn in succeed age have be master of the city there have be indiscriminate massacre of the populace the last by nadir shah the king of persium in 1747 when 100000 soul be put to death by he order and booty to a fabulous amount be carry away still notwithstanding the vicissitude of fortune through which it have pass delhus be in 1857 one of the largest most beautiful and certainly the richest city in hindostan we know well that there be wealth untold within the wall and we heart be cheer even at this time when we think of the prize-money which would fall to we share at the capture of the rebellious city the wall surround delhus be seven mile in circumference flank at interval by strong bastion on which the enemy have mount the largest gun and mortar procure from the arsenal munitions of war they have in abundance -- enough to last they at the present rate of firing for nearly three year long we gaze fascinate at the scene before we a dead silence have reign for some time when we be awaken from we dream by the whiz and hissing of a shell fire by the enemy it fall close below the tower and burst without do any harm but some jet of smoke appear on the bastion of the city and shell and round-shot fire at the ridge along the crest of which a small body of we man be move the cannonade last for some time we own gun reply at interval we could plainly see the dark form of the rebel artilleryman strip to the waist sponge and firing with great rapidity they shot be chiefly direct at the three other building on the ridge -- namely the observatory -- the mosque as it be call -- and on the extreme right hindoo rao 's house from the flagstaff tower the ridge trend in a southerly direction towards those building approach gradually nearer and nearer to the city till at hindoo rao 's house it be distant about 1200 yard from the wall to the rear of this ridge and some distance below so that all view of delhus be quite shut out from it be the camp of the besiege army numbering at this period about 6000 man the tent be pitch at regular interval behind the ruin house of the old cantonment which at the outbreak on may 11 have be burnt and destroy by the sepoy a canal which supply we with water from the jumna run round the ridge past the suburb of kishenganj into the city and be cross by two bridge over which communication with the country to the north-west and lead to the punjab be keep open by the loyal sikh chieftain and they retainer we position on the ridge extend about a mile and a half the right and leave front flank defend by outlying advanced picket which i shall hereafter describe the city wall as before record be seven mile in circumference so that at this time and in fact almost to the end of the siege we with we small force in a manner only command a small part of the city the bridge of boat remain to the last in the possession of the enemy and be quite out of range even from we advanced approach while to the right and rear of the city the gate give full ingress to reinforce body of insurgent from the south whose entrance we be unable to prevent we investment if such it could be call be therefore only partial be confine to that portion of the city extend from the water battery near selimgarh fort to the ajmir gate which be just visible from the extreme right of the ridge this part be defend by i think four bastion name respectively the water kashmir mori and burn three gate besides the lahore give egress to the mutineer when make sortie the afterwards celebrated kashmir gate the kabul and the ajmir gate the hindoo rao 's house on the right of the ridge where it slope down into the plain be the key of we position and be defend with great bravery and unflinching tenacity throughout the whole siege by the sirmoor battalion of goorkha and portion of the 60th royal rifle and the guide corps incessant day and night attack be here make by the enemy who know that be that position turn we camp -- in fact we very existence as a besiege force -- would be imperil but no assault however strong and determine make any impression on the man of these gallant regiment lead by major reid the officer command the sirmoor battalion they lose in kill and wound a number far out of all proportion to that of any other corps before delhus and must in truth be reckon the hero of the siege the goorkha be recruit in the mountain district of the himalaya in the kingdom of nepal they be short and squat in figure never more than five foot three inch in height of dark complexion with deep-set eye and high cheek-bone denote they affinity to the turanian race good-humoured and of a cheerful disposition they have always be great favorite with the european soldier whose way and peculiarity they endeavor to imitate to a ludicrous extent in battle as i have often see they they seem in they proper element fierce and courageous shrink from no danger they carry besides the musket a short heavy curved knife call a _ kukri _ a formidable weapon of which the sepoy be in deadly terror as soldier they be second to none amenable to discipline and docile but very tiger when rouse they fight with unflinching spirit during the mutiny freely give up they life in the service of they european master and now that i have endeavor for the purpose of this narrative to explain we position and that of the enemy i shall proceed to recount as far as my recollection serve the main incident of the siege and more particularly those in which i personally take part the camp of my regiment be pitch as i have say on the extreme left of the besiege force on the rear slope of the ridge we be completely hide from any view of the city and but for the sound of the firing close by which seldom cease day or night might have fancy ourselves far away from delhi cholera still carry off its victim from we midst and the very night of we arrival i perform the melancholy duty of read the burial service over five gallant fellow of the grenadier company who have die that day from the fell disease the heat be insupportable the thermometer under the shade of my tent mark 112 ° f and to add to we misery there come upon we a plague of fly the like of which i verily believe have not be on the earth since mose in that manner bring down the wrath of god on the egyptian they literally darken the air descend in myriad and cover everything in we midst foul and loathsome they be and we know that they owe they existence to and fatten on the putrid corpse of dead man and animal which lay rot and unburied in every direction the air be taint with corruption and the heat be intense can it then be wonder that pestilence increase daily in the camp claim its victim from every regiment native as well as european about this time many spy be capture and execute in fact so many prisoner be take by the picket that it be order that for the future instead of be send under escort to the camp for trial they should be summarily deal with by the officer command picket on the evening of July 2 i be send in command of fifty man to relieve the picket at a place call the cow house this be a outshed belong to sir theophilus metcalfe 's mansion burn by the rebel on may 11 and midway between that building and the stable at each of which be station 150 man at the beginning of the siege we left advanced flank on the side of the river jumna be expose to constant attack by the enemy and the three picket mention above have be since that time station at those place each communicate with the other the one to the right be on a mound near the ruin of the house and some 1200 yard from the city the cowshed situated midway between this mound and the river and lastly the stable close to the bank all partially hide from view of the battery on the wall by garden and thick cluster of tree i station my man at the shed and place double row of sentry to my front along the edge of a deep _ nallah _ or ravine soon after this that gallant officer lieutenant hodson -lrb- on whose memory lately aspersion have be cast by a author who know nothing of the subject on which he have write -rrb- ride up to the picket and tell I that a sortie in force be expect that night and that i be to keep a sharp lookout to prevent surprise hodson besides command a regiment of native sikh cavalry of he own raising be head of the intelligence department he cover himself with glory during the siege be untiring in he exertion and well-nigh ubiquitous ride incessantly round the picket at night and be present at most of the engagement he be a perfect hindustanus scholar and it be report in camp though with what truth i can not say that he on several occasion enter delhus in disguise during the siege to gain information of the enemy 's intention this may have be exaggeration but it be nevertheless certain that through some source or other he make himself well acquaint with the doings and movement of the mutineer shortly after he leave the field-officer on duty appear who order I in case i should be attack to defend my post to the last extremity and in no case to fall back add that to my picket and to those on my right and leave the safety of the camp during the expect sortie together with the security of we left flank be entrust after darkness set in the enemy commence a furious cannonade in the direction of the three picket round shot whistle through the tree and shell burst around we the din and roar be deafening but firing as they do at random little damage be do nothing can be grander than the sight of live shell cleave the air on a dark night they seem like so many brilliant meteor rush through the heaven or like lightning-flash during a storm and this be my first experience of the sort no word can paint my awe and admiration we naturally expect a attack in force from the insurgent under cover of the cannonade but hour pass by in suspense and anxiety and none be attempt the firing be continue all night -- sleep be impossible -- and cease only at daybreak when the relief arrive and i march the picket back to we camp _ July 3 _ -- that day the monsoon -- the indian wet season -- set in and rain descend in sheet of water for many hour in the afternoon it be report that a large force of mutineer be move out of the city by the kabul and ajmir gate into the suburb to the right front of we position and the alarm sound most of the troops in camp turn out and assemble on the road to the rear of the canal here we be halt for some time it be uncertain what direction have be take by the enemy at sunset two dooly escort by man of the 5th punjab cavalry be see on the road come towards we they contain the body of a european sergeant and a man of the road department who have be surprise and cut to piece by some of the rebel cavalry the escort also report that a body of insurgent numbering many thousand man have be see move towards alipore one march in we rear they object it be suppose be to cut off supplies and intercept treasure it be too late to start in pursuit of the enemy we be dismiss to we quarter be warn to hold ourselves in readiness to turn out at a moment 's notice _ July 4 _ -- that night the sound of the enemy 's gun to we rear be hear in the camp and soon after 2 a m we parade and join a force destine to overtake or cut off the mutineer on they return to delhi the little army consist of 1500 man cavalry artillery and infantry march at once towards alipore after we have proceed three mile and just at daybreak news be bring that the enemy after plunder the town be retreat to the city laden with booty major coke who be in command then change we direction to the left and we advance for about two mile over swampy ground to a canal the cavalry be in front then the infantry the battery of horse artillery bring up the rear when near the canal which be shaded on each side by tree the major advanced to reconnoitre and on he return the order be give gun to the front the horse artillery gallop past we and we then hear that the enemy be in sight on the other side of the canal cross a bridge and pass through tree and jungle the whole force debouch on a open plain and form in order of battle the first line consist of the artillery in the center flank on each side by the cavalry -- cavalry -- portion of the 9th lancer the carabineer and that fine regiment the guide corps coke 's corps of punjabee and my regiment form the second line it be a pretty sight to see this miniature army advance in perfect order towards the enemy the plain extend for a mile quite open and without tree bound at that distance by a village in which the insurgent gun be post cloud of horseman apparently without any formation hover on each side of the village and a large force of infantry be stand in line somewhat in advance we gun come into action at a distance of about 1000 yard from the village and be soon answer by those of the enemy they shot striking unpleasantly close to we line and ricochetting over we head still we advance hope that the rebel would stand till we come to close quarter at 500 yard the fire from we artillery seem to prove too hot for they and presently to we infinite disgust we see they infantry move off to the left follow shortly after by the cavalry then they gun cease firing and be also quickly withdraw the carabineer and guide be send in pursuit and cut up some straggler but the insurgent stampede at a great pace and succeed in carry off all they gun a few sepoy be find hide in the village hut and be kill by we man the alipore plunder be recover besides some ammunition and camp equipment and rather dissatisfy with the result of the action we move slowly back across the plain the regiment be command on this occasion by we senior captain a officer of some thirty-five year ' service he be without exception the greatest oddity for a soldier that we army have ever see five foot two inch in height with a enormous head short hunchback body long arm and thin shrivel leg he whole appearance remind one of dickens ' celebrated character quilp in the old curiosity shop enter the service in the good old time when there be no examination by a medical man he have through some back-door influence obtain a commission in the army all he service have be pass abroad exchange from one regiment to another for it would have be utterly impossible for he to have retain he commission in england march he be unable to keep step with the man and on horseback he present the most ludicrous appearance be quite unable to ride and look more like a monkey than a human be on we first advance across the plain the little captain be ride in we front vainly endeavor to make he horse move faster and striking he every now and then on the flank with he sword i be on the right of the line and together with the man could not keep from laugh when a friend of mine -- a tall officer of one of the native infantry regiment -- ride to my side and ask I who that be lead the regiment i answer he be we commanding officer the sun shone with intense heat on we march back across the plain and the european soldier begin to feel its effect many be strike down with apoplexy about midday the infantry halt at the canal the gun and most of the cavalry return to camp as it be suppose there would be no more work for they to do we lay down in the welcome shade of the tree on the bank enjoy we breakfast which have be bring to we by we native servant and in company with a officer of the 9th lancer i be discuss a bottle of ale the sweetest draught i think i have ever taste the arm be pile in we front and at interval we watch as they cross the canal a troop of elephant which have be send out to bring the sick and wound into camp all at once from we left front and without any warn shot come whistle through the tree and jungle and some man lie on the ground be hit the regiment at once fall in and change front to the left move in the direction from which the shot be come frightened at the sound of the firing the elephant be seize with a panic and make off across the canal trumpet with they trunk high above they head they flounder through the water to the opposite side they driver vainly attempt to stop they flight we see they disappear through the tree and learn afterwards that they never stop till close to they own quarter at the camp meanwhile the shot come thick and fast and we advance in line till we come to a comparatively open space and in sight of the enemy -- a large body of infantry outnumber we by four to one they be at no great distance from we and a sharp musketry fire be keep up from both side cause heavy loss see that no object be to be gain with we small force by encounter one so vastly superior major coke deem it prudent to retire and retreat firing we cross the bridge and line the bank on each side the enemy follow they man form opposite to we and keep up a steady fire at a distance of from 100 to 150 yard i be on the right of the line with the grenadier when half a hour later i be direct by the adjutant to march my man to the left of the bridge to reinforce the light company who be be hard press by the insurgent some of whom be wade through the canal with the evident intention of turn we left flank we creep along under the bank and be receive with joy by we comrade one of they i well remember welcome we in most forcible language and intimate that they would soon have be send to -- if we have not come the file-firing here be continuous a perfect hail of bullet and it be dangerous to show one 's head over the bank shout and taunt we the rebel come up close to the opposite side and be strike down in number by we man who rest they musket on the bank and take sure aim still the contest be most unequal the enemy be wade in force through the water on we left and the day would have go hard with we from they overwhelming numerical superiority when just at this critical moment the gallop of horse and the noise of wheel be hear in we rear six horse artillery gun lead by major tomb -- one of the most gallant officer in camp -- come thunder along the road they pass with a cheer cross the bridge at full speed wheel to they left unlimbered as quick as lightning and open fire on the rebel take completely by surprise these make no stand and flee pell-mell towards delhus leave altogether 200 dead on the ground it be now nearly five o'clock and we be distant four mile from camp many of we man have die from apoplexy and sunstroke they face turn quite black in a few minute -- a horrible sight these with the kill and the sick and wound be place on the back of a fresh lot of elephant which have just arrive and scarcely able to drag one leg after the other we turn we face towards the camp reach we own quarter soon after sunset this be a terrible and try day for all engage and more especially for the european infantry we have be under arm for seventeen hour most of the time expose to the pitiless ray of a indian sun under fire for a considerable period and with the exception of the slight halt for breakfast on we foot all the time when near camp we be meet by the general sir henry barnard who address we with some kindly word and little do we think that that be the last occasion we should see the gallant old soldier the follow morning he be attack with cholera and expire in the afternoon deeply regret by the whole army no man could possibly have be place in a more try situation than he who have just give up he life in the service of he country call on to command a army to which be entrust the safety of british rule in indium the care and anxiety of the task together with he unremitting attention to he duty and constant exposure to the sun make he peculiarly susceptible to the disease from which he die he have serve with distinction in the crimean campaign and have only land in indium to take command of a division in the April of this year _ July 5 _ -- from July 5 to 8 nothing of note occur the enemy keep up as usual a constant fire upon the ridge and outlying picket but no attempt at a sortie be make i visit the flagstaff tower each day when off duty seemingly never tire of gaze at the glorious panorama spread out before I and watch the battery deliver they unceasing fire with the exception of two 24-pound cannon take from the enemy for which we have no shot the heaviest gun on the ridge be 18-pounder and a few small mortar have possession of the great arsenal the insurgent mount on the bastion of delhus 32-and 24-pounder gun and 13-inch mortar they train artilleryman acquit themselves right valiantly and make excellent practice they be almost to a man kill at they gun during the siege and towards the end the difference in firing be fully perceptible when the infantry fill they place and work the gun have no round-shot for the two 24-pounder we be reduce to firing back on the city the shot of the same calibre hurl against we and a reward of half a rupee per shot be pay by the commissariat to any camp-follower bringing in the missile on one occasion i see a party of native servant carry on they head cook provision for the man on picket wend they way up the slope from the camp two round-shot fire by the enemy strike the top of the ridge and roll down the declivity here be a prize worth contend for and the cook deposit the dish on the ground run in all haste to seize the treasure i watch the race with interest and anticipate some fun know that in they eagerness they would forget that the shot have not have time to cool two man in advance of the rest pick up the ball and utter a cry drop they quickly rub and blow they hand the remainder stand patiently wait and then after a time spend evidently in deliberation two man place the shot on they head and all in a body move off towards the commissariat quarter to receive and divide the reward _ July 7 _ -- on the morning of July 7 i accompany a detachment of 150 man under command of a captain to relieve the picket at the mound close to the ruin of sir theophilus metcalfe 's house this mansion build by the present baronet 's father be situate about 1200 yard from the wall of the city and surround by tree and garden at the outbreak of may 11 it have be plunder and burn by the mutinous sepoy and _ badmash _ who also in like manner have destroy every house belong to the european in the suburb of delhus and the adjoining cantonment of the murder that then take place i shall have something to say hereafter when write the history of a young school-fellow whose sister be kill by the insurgent from we position on picket we could see a short distance in front the ground have be partially clear of tree and undergrowth a chain of double sentry be post and the utmost vigilance observe we could hear the battery open on the ridge while occasionally as if to harass the picket a 13-inch shell would burst either in we front or in we rear the night pass quickly and at daybreak when visit the sentry i hear distinctly the bugle of the rebel sound the reveille succeed by other familiar call it seem strange to hear we own bugle-call sound by man who be now we enemy and not only be this the case but also the insurgent for some time wear the scarlet uniform of the british soldier and invariably to the end of the war give the english word of command they have be teach in we service we be relieve from picket on the morning of the 8th and return to we camp remain quiet during the day execution by hang take place every day but after the first horrible experience nothing would induce I to be a spectator the rain which have begin on the 3rd continue almost without intermission we camp become a quagmire and the muggy moist atmosphere increase the ravages of cholera amongst we unfortunate soldier _ July 9 _ -- at sunrise on the 9th a terrific cannonade wake we out of we sleep but the main camp be some distance from the right of the ridge we for a long time hear no tiding of what be go on at 8 a m the bugle of the regiment on the right sound the alarm follow at once by the assembly some 200 man of my regiment all that remain off duty parade in front of the tent and receive order to march to the center rear of the camp in rear of the quarter of the general in command here we be join by some company of the 8th regiment and a battalion of sikh and continue we march we halt near the tent of tomb ' battery of horse artillery lie around and even among the tent-rope be dead body of the enemy 's cavalry and a little way beyond close to the graveyard some man of the 75th be firing into the branch of the tree which surround the enclosure every now and then the body of a rebel would fall on the ground at they foot the soldier laugh and chat together and make as much sport out of the novel business as though they be shoot at bird in the branch of a tree how the native cavalry come there be at first inexplicable to we but we be inform afterwards that a body of irregular horseman dress in white the same uniform as that worn by the 9th irregular on we side have with the greatest daring a hour before dash across the canal bridge and charge the picket of the carabineer make also for the two gun of tomb ' battery the former mostly young soldier have turn and flee all save they officer and one sergeant who nobly stand they ground lieutenant hill who command the two gun on picket also alone charge the horseman cut down one or two of the sowar meantime the gun be unlimbered but before they have time to fire the enemy be upon they hill be strike down badly wound and be on the point of be despatch by a sowar when major tomb hear the noise rush out of he tent and see the plight he subaltern be in fire he revolver at thirty yard and kill the sowar the camp be now fairly alarm the gun of olphert ' battery open on the enemy and some man of the 75th appear on the scene the rebel be shoot down in every direction thirty-five be kill and the rest escape by the bridge a few climb into the tree and be shoot down as i have say before this attack by the enemy 's cavalry be a fitting prelude to the event of the memorable sortie of that day at early morn under cover of a unceasing cannonade from the city battery on to the right of we position the insurgent in great force and of all arm stream out from the gate make in the direction of the suburb of kishenganj they evident intention be to turn we right flank and make for we camp see that the enemy be increase in number and come on with great determination the alarm have sound and detachment from most of the regiment with horse artillery and a few cavalry under the command of brigadier-general chamberlain march towards the right rear of the camp take the road to the suburb of kishenganj we cross the canal at about 10 a m and move in column for some little distance come in sight of advanced body of the enemy chiefly infantry with cavalry and field artillery on each flank we form in line send out skirmisher the gun open fire -- the country here be pretty open -- and the action begin soon we drive back the rebel who continue retreat in excellent order turn at interval and discharge they musket while every now and then they gun be face about and unlimber and round-shot and grape send among we rank as we advance the vegetation become thicker and we be confront at time by high hedge of prickly-pear and cactus grow so close together that it be impossible to make we way through this occasion several détours the sepoy line the hedge and firing at we through loophole and opening cursing the _ gore log _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and daring we to come on the rain which have keep off during the morning now descend in a steady downpour soak through we thin cotton clothing and in a few minute drenching we to the skin pass the obstacle on each flank the force again form in as good order as the inequality of the ground would permit and continue its advance all the time under a heavy fire of artillery and musketry we catch glimpse of the enemy retreat towards the kishenganj seraus but the vegetation be so dense in the numerous garden and the view so obstruct by stone wall and ruin building that it be with great difficulty that we make any progress nor have the advantage of so much cover do the enemy suffer much loss from we musketry fire many of we man fall at this period of the fight despise the enemy and refuse to take cover we soldier would stand out expose and deliver they fire offer a sure aim to the enemy 's marksman it be a continual rush from one point to another halt and firing at interval the rebel all the time slowly retreat we horse artillery at this juncture could only act on occasion the ground be so broken that the gun be often bring to a standstill all this time the battery on the ridge which from they high position could see what be go on send shell and round-shot at every opportunity over we head disperse the mutineer when group together in any large number and deal death amongst they we see they lie in heap of twenty and thirty as we advance and the fire be so hot and the practice so excellent that the enemy evacuate the garden and flee towards the suburb of kishenganj here the country be more open so re-forming we scatter line with skirmisher in advance we drive the rebel before we the horse artillery play on they in the open and bring down score cross the canal -lrb- which here bar we progress -rrb- by a bridge we enter into a wide lane to the leave the high bank of the canal be on one side and the wall of a large caravanserai on the other the insurgent be post at the far end of the lane where it open out at the gate of the seraus and receive we as we advance at the double with a rattle fire of musketry some climb to the top of the bank while other fire down at we from the wall it be a perfect _ feu d'enfer _ and the loss on we side become so heavy that a temporary check be the result and it be only with great trouble that the man could be urge on see a disposition to waver colonel w jone the brigadier under chamberlain with great bravery place himself in front on foot and call on the soldier now a confused mass of sikh goorkha and european to charge and dislodge the enemy from the end of the lane he be answer with a ring cheer the man break into a run and without firing a shot charge the sepoy who wait till we be within fifty yard and then as usual turn and flee some enter the caravanserai by the large gate which they attempt to shut but we be too quick for they and follow close on they heel a hard fight begin in the enclosure other of the enemy run onward in the direction of the city chase by portion of we force who pursue they a long distance and after a desperate resistance kill many who in they flight have take refuge in the serai and building the party i be with in the great caravanserai range the place like demon the english soldier put to death every sepoy they could find they aspect be certainly inhuman -- eye flash with passion and revenge face wet and blacken from powder through bite cartridge it would have be useless to attempt to check they in they work of slaughter twenty or more of the insurgent fly for life from they pitiless foe make for a small building standing in the center of the seraus they be follow by we man who enter after they at the door the house have four window one on each side about three foot from the ground and i run to one and look in the wretched fugitive have throw down they arm and crouch on the floor with they back to the wall beg with out-stretched hand for mercy call out in they language _ dohai dohaus _ word i well know the meaning of and which i have often hear under similar circumstance i know however that no quarter would be give and in a short time every rebel lay in the agony of death most of the force as i have relate have continue chase the enemy so that for some time we be alone and few in number in the seraus it be nearly five o'clock and we think that as far as we be concern the action be over it be not so however shout and yell be hear outside and run to see we find a fresh force of the mutineer assemble outside the gate there be nothing for it but to make a rush and fight we way through so with fix bayonet we charge through they meet soon afterwards the remainder of the force on its way back join with these we drive the enemy again before we till we come within 700 yard of the city wall there lose sight of we foe they gun fire into we but the insurgent infantry seem now to have have sufficient fight for one day and not one man be to be see we work be accomplish and the order be give to retire slowly we wend we way back to camp arrive there about sunset have be continuously under fire for nearly seven hour the loss on this day exceed that of any since the siege begin out of we small force engage 221 man be kill and wound it be compute that of the enemy more than 500 be kill and probably twice that number wound the dead body lie thick together at every stage of we advance but the wound man in almost every instance be carry off by they comrade the camp of we regiment on the extreme left of the line have become a mere swamp and mud hole from the long-continued rain and also be at too great a distance from the main body of the army we be direct to change to a position close to the bank of the canal near the general 's headquarters and on the left of the 8th regiment the move be make i think on July 11 and here we remain till the end of the siege at about this period too i be most agreeably surprise by a visit from a old school-fellow name c -- d he have enter the bengal civil service a few year before and at the break out of the disturbance be assistant collector at goorgaon seventeen mile from delhus on the death of they mother in ireland a only sister a young girl of eighteen year of age come out to indium to take up she residence with he c -- d escort he sister to delhi on may 10 she have receive a invitation to stay with the chaplain and he wife who have quarter in the palace he return to goorgaon little thinking he would never see she again the next morning on the arrival of the insurgent cavalry from meerut and the subsequent mutiny of the native infantry regiment and artillery in the cantonment the massacre of the european in delhus begin i forbear enter into all the detail of this dreadful butchery suffice it to say that the chaplain mr jenning he wife miss c -- d and nearly all the white people both in the palace and the city be murder the editor of the _ delhus gazette _ and he family be tortured to death by have they throat cut with piece of broken bottle but there be conflict account as to how the jennings and miss c -- d meet they end from what i gather after the siege from some delhus native it be report that the lady be strip naked at the palace tie in that condition to the wheel of gun-carriage drag up the chandnus chauk or silver street of delhus and there in the presence of the king 's son cut to piece it be not till the follow evening may 12 that c -- d hear of the mutiny and fear death from the populace of goorgaon who have also rise in revolt he disguise himself as best he could and ride off into the country after endure great privation and the danger of be take by predatory band he at last reach meerut and thence accompany the force to delhi from what he hint i feel sure he have it on he mind that he sister before be murder be outrage by the rebel however this may be my old school-fellow have become a change be all he passion be arouse to they fullest extent and he think of nothing but revenge arm with sword revolver and rifle he have be present at almost every engagement with the mutineer since leave meerut he be know to most of the regiment in camp and would attach himself to one or the other on the occasion of a fight deal death with he rifle and give no quarter care nothing for he own life so long as he succeed in glut he vengeance on the murderer of he sister he expose himself most recklessly throughout the siege and never receive a wound on the day of the final assault i meet he in one of the street after we have gain entrance into the city he shake my hand say that he have put to death all he have come across not except woman and child and from he excited manner and the appearance of he dress -- which be cover with blood-stain -- i quite believe he tell I the truth one would imagine he must have tire of slaughter during those six day ' fighting in the city but it be not so i dine with he at the palace the night delhus be take when he tell I he intend accompany a small force the next morning to attack a village close by all my remonstrance at this be of no avail he vow to I he would never stay he hand while he have a opportunity of wreak he vengeance poor fellow that be he last fight advance in front of the soldier he meet he death from a bullet in the heart when assault the village there be other officer of the army in camp who have lose wife and relation at delhus and meerut and who behave in the same manner as c -- d one in particular whose wife i have know well be a object of pity to the whole camp she be the first woman who be murder during the outrage at meerut and she death take place under circumstance of such shocking barbarity that they can not be record in these page truly these be fearful time when christian man and gallant soldier madden by the foul murder of those nearest and dearest to they steel they heart to pity and swear vengeance against the murderer and much the same feeling though not to such a extent pervade the breast of all who be engage in the suppression of the mutiny every soldier fighting in we rank know that a day of reckoning would come for the atrocity which have be commit and with unrelenting spirit dedicate himself to the accomplishment of that purpose moreover it be on we part a fight for existence a war of extermination in which no prisoner be take and no mercy show -- in short one of the most cruel and vindictive war that the world have see from July 10 to 14 there be comparative quiet in the camp the cannonade continue on each side but no sortie be make by the enemy _ July 12 _ -- on the morning of the 12th i be detail for picket duty at the sabzus mandus garden to the right front of hindoo rao 's house the picket consist of 100 man under the command of a captain since the opening of the siege this have be the scene of many sanguinary encounter with the enemy who put forth all they strength in endeavor to drive in the picket and so turn we right flank at hindoo rao 's house the view at first be almost completely close in but by the end of July the unremitting labor of the engineer have clear away the tree wall and building in front of the picket for some distance and the earth-works connect it with the ridge at hindoo rao 's house be also complete i can remember no event of interest as occur on July 12 few shot be fire at we and on be relieve the next morning we return to camp wonder at the unusual inactivity of the enemy _ July 14 _ -- they be however only prepare for another sortie on a grand scale and on the morning of the 14th the bugle again sound the alarm and the assembly the insurgent pour out of the kabul and lahore gate in great number make as usual for the sabzus mandus garden and the right of the ridge they keep up a constant fire of musketry and field-artillery and though we battery sweep they mass with shell and round-shot they still continue the attack press close to the picket and hindoo rao 's house -lrb- illustration : the small picket sabzus mandus from the south-east -rrb- shortly after midday a column of some 1500 man be assemble to dislodge and drive they back to the city we take the road as on the 9th and soon become engage with the enemy in the sabzus mandus garden the struggle be long and fierce a perpetual interchange of musketry and artillery we loss especially in officer be very severe the city battery also send grape and canister amongst we from they large gun and howitzer inflict mortal wound even at the great distance of 1100 yard when drive the rebel before we past the suburb of kishenganj lieutenant gabbett and i in the confusion of the rush become separate from the few man of we regiment who be engage on that day and find ourselves -- we be the only officer present -- with about fifty soldier of different corps for more than half a hour we be completely isolate from the main body and be occupy in several little fight on we own account advance we scarcely know where and in we excitement fully engage in chase the foe we all at once come most unexpectedly on to a broad road with open ground on each side there to we front and scarcely 500 yard distant we see a gate with embattled tower the high wall of the city and a bastion we be soon descry by the enemy who depress they gun and fire at we with grape fortunately without hit any of we party we be in a complete dilemma under fire of the battery cut off from we force and liable at any moment to be surround so deeming discretion the better part of valor we turn about and run with all speed to the rear come upon a troop of horse artillery which be halt amongst some garden soon the main body of we force return from the pursuit of the rebel whom they have drive to within 600 yard of the city wall and join we own detachment who have give we up as lose we return to camp about sundown again we have to lament the loss of many fine officer and soldier nearly 200 man have be kill and wound -- a sad diminution of we little army which have it long continue would have entirely decimate the delhi field force the enemy however have suffer most severely they loss amount to quite 1000 man and the next morning they be see for hour cart the dead body into the city unusual bravery be show by the rebel on this day : they stand fairly in the open and also attack the picket with great pertinacity assault one call the sammy house for hour and leave eighty dead body in its front all kill by the infantry of the guide who most gallantly hold the picket against overwhelming number cholera all this time rage in the force and carry off its victim daily my own regiment and the 8th be the principal sufferer it be melancholy to enter the hospital to see the agony and hear the groan of the man many of they with they die breath lament the hard fate which have stretch they on a sick-bed and prevent they from do they duty in the rank against the enemy fever and ague too be very prevalent and hospital gangrene break out which attain such virulence that many wound die from its effect while of amputation i believe not one recover during the whole siege we be also in the midst of the indian monsoon the most unhealthy season of the year when rain descend in torrent almost every day a hot muggy atmosphere increase the sickness and add to the eternal plague of fly a plague the most nauseating it have ever be my lot to experience when off duty it be the custom of some of the officer to pass the time fishing in the canal at we rear here seat on camp-stool bring out by we servant we amuse ourselves for hour hold lottery as to who would catch the first fish the prize be a bottle of beer to see we on these occasion full of merriment one would scarcely have realize the fact that the man employ in this peaceful occupation be part of a army engage in almost continual warfare and fight for very existence laughter and joke fill the air and chaff reign supreme while ever and anon we be rudely recall to a sense of the danger around we by the report of a shell burst over the ridge or the presence of a orderly who summon one of the party to proceed on picket or on some perilous duty at the front with regard to provision we be plentifully supply with regular meal a sufficiency of good food and drinkable we lot in this respect be far more enjoyable than that of the usual run of campaigner a large flock of fat sheep accompany we on the march down from ferozepore and i shall never forget the agony of mind of one of we gourmand when one day it be report that the sheep have all be carry off by the enemy when grazing in the rear of the canal i have also purchase 100 dozen of ale at umballah for the use of the mess and this be noised abroad in the camp we be visit by several thirsty soul from other regiment who less fortunate than ourselves have neglect furnish themselves with this tempting beverage it be a pleasure to we to minister to they want though i need hardly say that the stock last but a short time from the numerous call make on it _ July 17 _ -- general reed who have take command of the army on the death of sir henry barnard resign he position on July 17 in consequence of sickness and the infirmity of old age he be succeed by general wilson of the artillery a officer who have already greatly distinguish himself and under whom the siege be eventually bring to a successful conclusion _ July 18 _ -- for three day after the last sortie the enemy be singularly quiet quarrel amongst themselves as it be report and dispute as to what portion of they army be to lead the next sortie however on July 18 they again make another attempt upon the sabzus mandus and the ridge at hindoo rao 's the force send to dislodge they be under command of colonel jone of the 60th rifle who make he arrangement with singular judgment and tact and insist on a regular formation be keep by the troops instead of the desultory style of action in vogue during previous sortie there be however some very hard fighting in the garden and serai where we be receive by a storm of bullet but the man be persuade to keep well under cover the loss be not very serious the casualty amount in all to about ninety officer and man -lrb- 2 -rrb- the enemy as usual suffer severely more especially from the fire of we field-gun which mow they down when collect in group of two and three hundred together -lrb- illustration : from the small picket sabzus mandus look towards kishenganj -rrb- i be amuse on this day as well as on previous sortie by see the eagerness with which the soldier european sikh and goorkha rifle the body of the slay sepoy these last have plunder the city inhabitant of all they could find in money and jewel and have no place of safety -lrb- from the anarchy which prevail in delhus -rrb- in which to deposit they loot they one and all invariably carry they treasure about with they conceal in the kammerbund fold of muslin or linen roll round the waist on the fall of a mutineer a rush would be make by the man to secure the coveted loot a race take place sometimes between a european and one of we native soldier as to who should first reach the body the kammerbund be quickly tear off and the money snatch up a wrangle often ensue among the man as to the division of the booty in this manner many soldier succeed to my knowledge in secure large sum of money one in particular a grenadier of my regiment after kill a sepoy rifle the body and return in great glee to where i be stand show I twenty gold mohur worth # 32 sterling it be a most reprehensible practice but almost impossible entirely to prevent for in the loose order of fight which generally prevail the man do not break from they rank to accomplish they purpose but often in isolate group of two and three be separate at time a short distance from the rest of the combatant the general we hear be loud in he praise of the manner in which colonel jone conduct the operation on this day after the action also he withdraw he man in perfect order allow no straggling -- a great contrast to we former usual style when return to camp after the repulse of a sortie this be the last action of any consequence fight in the open at the sabzus mandus garden the ground in front of the picket be soon after clear and during future attack we man remain behind the breastwork and entrenchment which have be throw up and by a steady fire soon drive back any rebel who be foolhardy enough to come within range it speak well for the prowess of the mutineer and prove that we have no contemptible foe to deal with that so many sortie and attack be make by they during the siege they amount in all to thirty-six -- all of these be regularly organize action and assault -- besides innumerable other on isolate picket and advance post they seldom come to close quarter with we man and then only when surprised but nothing could exceed they persistent courage in fight almost every day and though beat on every occasion with frightful loss return over and over again to renew the combat _ July 19 _ -- the succeed day from July 19 to 23 be day of quiet with the exception of the usual artillery duel we take we turn at picket duty with the other regiment one day at the metcalfe house and stable and on another at the sabzus mandus _ July 23 _ -- on the morning of the 23rd the insurgent for the first time since the previous month make a sortie on we left emerge from the kashmir gate with infantry and field-gun with the latter they occupy ludlow castle a ruin house midway between the flagstaff tower and the kashmir gate then they open fire on the left of the ridge and move about continually amongst the tree and building be well sheltered from we battery which be unable to make good practice the rebel also show at the metcalfe picket attack at the same time with they infantry and become embolden by receive no opposition from we the greater part of they force advance nearer and nearer to the ridge till they be see distinctly from the mosque battery to punish they temerity a force of all arm be send out from camp under brigadier shower with the intention of attack they right flank we move up a deep gorge and come on they by surprise force they to remove they gun which quickly limber up and make for the city there be a great deal of skirmishing in the garden and ruin house before the infantry follow the example of they comrade but the fight be not nearly so severe as during the sortie on the right nor do the enemy suffer any very great loss on we side we have in all fifty officer and man kill and wound -lrb- 3 -rrb- again for some day the enemy make no movement and the weather also hold up for a time some sport be inaugurate in the camp the man might be see amusing themselves at various game while the officer actually get up a impromptu horse-race this however be not to last long and on July 31 we be again on the alert from the report that several thousand of rebel with thirteen gun and mortar be make for the open country to the right rear of we camp a force under major coke be send out to watch they movement and also to convoy a large store of treasure and ammunition come down to we from the punjab the convoy arrive safe on the morning of August 1 and the rain fall heavily on that day make the ground impassable for gun the insurgent force which have move to we rear break up they camp and retire towards delhus the 1st of August be the anniversary of a great mohammedan festival call the bakra id and for some time there have be rumor of a grand sortie in honor of the event morning and afternoon pass and we begin to think the enemy have give up they purpose when about sunset firing begin at the right picket the mutineer return from we rear have meet a equal number which have sally from the city at the suburb of kishenganj and the force join together move forward and attack the whole right of the ridge and the picket in that quarter loudly the bugle sound the alarm all over the camp and in a very short time every available man be muster and the troops be hurry forward to reinforce the breastwork at hindoo rao 's house and on each side there have be only one actual night-attack since the beginning of the siege and that take place to the rear it therefore naturally occur to the officer in command that this assault by the enemy with such vast number would require all we effort to prevent be turn thus imperil the safety of the camp the action have commence in earnest when we arrive on the ridge and the brave defender of hindoo rao 's house be hold they own against enormous odds mass of infantry with field-gun swarm in we front yell and shout like demon while keep up a steady fire darkness come on -- a lovely night calm and clear without a cloud in the sky the battery on both side keep up a terrific cannonade and we man effectually conceal behind the earth-works pour incessant volley of musketry into the enemy the roar and din exceed anything i have ever hear before and form one continuous roll while all around the air be illumine by a thousand bright flash of fire expose to we view the movement of the rebel they have also throw up breastwork at no great distance to we front from behind which they sally at interval return however quickly under cover when we fire become too hot for they and in this manner without a moment 's intermission the combat continue all night long with no advantage to the assailant and with few casualty on we side -lrb- 4 -rrb- _ August 2 _ -- morning break without any cessation in the firing and it be not till ten o'clock that the rebel see how futile be all effort begin to retire some few still keep up the firing but at 2 p m all be quiet and we sadly harass soldier be enable to obtain some rest after seventeen hour ' fight nothing could have surpass the steadiness of the man and the cool manner in which they meet the attack of the enemy remain well under cover and only show themselves when the rebel come close up we casualty during those long hour only amount to fifty kill and wound thus prove the judgment of the general in order the man to remain behind the earthwork and not to advance in pursuit unless absolutely necessary two hundred dead body be count in front of the entrenchment and doubtless during the darkness many more be carry off by the enemy after the severe lesson they have receive the rebel remain inactive for some day very few shot even be fire from the wall we learn that the late grand attack have be make by the neemuch and part of the gwalior and kotah insurgent who have mutiny at those place not long before this account for the stubbornness of the assault it be the custom when reinforcement arrive to send they out at once to try they mettle with the besieger the fruit of general wilson 's accession to the command of the army and the stringent order issue by he for the maintenance of order and discipline both in camp and on picket become more and more apparent every day all duty be now regulate and carry out with the utmost precision each regiment know its allotted place in case of a sortie and the officer on picket have to furnish report during they term of duty thereby make they more attentive to the discipline and care of they man in the matter of uniform also a great and desirable change be make many corps have become quite regardless of appearance entirely discard all pretension to uniformity and adopt the most nondescript dress one in particular a most gallant regiment of european which have serve almost from the beginning of the siege be know by the sobriquet of the dirty shirt from they habit of fight in they shirt with sleeve turn up without jacket or coat and they nether extremity clothe in soil blue dungaree trousers the army in general wear a cotton dress dye with _ khaki ring _ or dust color which at a distance could with difficulty be see and be far preferable to white or to the scarlet of the british uniform the enemy on the contrary appear entirely in white have soon discard the dress of they former master and it be a pretty sight to see they turn out of the gate on the occasion of a sortie they arm glitter pennon fly and they whole appearance present a gay contrast to the dull dingy dress of they foe _ August 5 _ -- on August 5 a attempt be make by we engineer to blow up the bridge of boat across the jumna and some of we go to the top of the flagstaff tower to see the result two raft fill with barrel of powder and with a slow match in each be send down the river start from a point nearly a mile up the stream we see they descend carry down slowly by the flood one blow up half a mile from the bridge the other continue its course and be descry by some mutineer on the opposite bank who send off man to the raft on _ massak _ -lrb- inflated sheep-skin -rrb- it be a perilous deed for the man but without any delay they make they way to the raft put out the fuse and tow the engine of destruction to shore a most ignominious failure and the attempt be never repeat the bridge remain intact to the last _ August 6 _ -- at 7 a m on August 6 the alarm again sound and we remain accoutred in camp for some hour but be not call to the front on that day a large party of the enemy 's cavalry -- more it must be suppose in a spirit of bravado than anything else -- charge up the road towards the flagstaff tower wave they sword and shout din din a battery be bring to bear on they and this with a volley or two of musketry soon send they to the right about gallop off and disappear amongst the tree after leave some dead on the ground the enemy 's infantry also harass the picket on the right flank cause some casualty and they artillery fire be keep up all day the gun in the new kishenganj battery almost enfilade the right of we position no effort on we part could silence the fire from this place and it remain intact a constant source of annoyance to the end of the siege the numerous cavalry of the enemy might have cause we a vast amount of trouble have they be properly lead or behave even as well as the infantry and artillery but there seem to be little dash or spirit amongst they and though they make a brave show emerge from the gate in company with the rest of they force wave sword and brandish spear they take care to keep at a respectful distance from we fire they only exploit as far as i can remember be that on July 9 when 100 horseman charge into the rear of we camp from the 8th to the 11th there be constant attack on all the picket and the artillery fire on both side be almost uncease the enemy bring out some gun by the kashmir gate and shell the metcalfe picket they skirmisher advance close to we defence with shout and harass the man day and night though with small loss on we side they also make the approach to the picket for relief so perilous that at early morn of the 12th a large force under brigadier shower be detail to drive the rebel into the city my regiment furnish twenty man under a officer -lrb- 5 -rrb- on this occasion _ August 12 _ -- we attack they at dawn take they completely by surprise and capture all they gun four in number the 1st fusilier and coke 's rifle behave most gallantly and bear the brunt of the fight lose half the number of those kill and wound -- namely 110 the enemy 's casualty amount to upward of 300 and they leave many wound on the ground who be shoot and bayonet without mercy this signal chastisement have the effect of cow they for a time and the picket on the leave be unmolested for the future save by occasional shot from the city battery _ August 14 _ -- August 14 be quiet the enemy give we a respite and scarcely firing a gun though they must have know of the welcome reinforcement we have receive that morning these consist of nearly 3000 man of which number more than 1100 be european this force under command of general nicholson comprise the 52nd regiment we left wing from ferozepore some mooltani horse 1200 sikh and punjabee and a battery of european artillery the reinforcement bring up the delhi field force to more than 8000 effective while of sick and wound we have the frightful number of nearly 2000 in camp many more have be send away to umballah but what add most to we strength be the presence amongst we of the hero john nicholson he who have be since designate as the foremost man in indium young in year he have already do good service in the punjab war and be note not only for he striking military talent but also for the aptitude he display in bring into subjection and ruling with a firm hand the lawless tribe on we north-west frontier many story be tell of he prowess and skill and he ingratiate himself so strongly amongst a certain race that he receive he apotheosis at they hand and year afterwards be and perhaps to this day be worship by these rude mountaineer under the title of nikul seyn spare in form but of great stature he whole appearance and mien stamp he as a king of man calm and self-confident full of resource and daring no difficulty could daunt he he be a bear soldier the idol of the man the pride of the whole army he indomitable spirit seem at once to infuse fresh vigor into the force and from the time of he arrival to the day of the assault nicholson 's name be in everyone 's mouth and each soldier know that vigorous measure would be take to insure ultimate success we be free from attack for some day and the only event of importance be a raid make by the enemy 's horseman in the direction of rohtak they be follow by that great irregular leader hodson who succeed with small loss in cut up some thirty of they number he own newly-raised regiment and the guide cavalry behave admirably _ August 19 _ -- on August 19 a noteworthy incident occur at the sabzus mandus picket a woman dress in the native costume and attend by a afghan walk up to the sentry at that post and on approach the man throw herself on she knee thank god in english that she be under the protection of british soldier the honest fellow be greatly take aback and wonder who this could be dress in native costume speak to they in they own language she be bring before the officer command the picket when it transpire that she be a eurasian name seeson the wife of a european road sergeant during the outbreak on may 11 at delhus she child have be slay before she eye and she herself badly wound escape however from the murderer in a most providential manner and finding shelter in the house of a friendly native who have succour she ever since by the aid of the afghan and disguise as a _ ayah _ or nurse she have pass through the gate of the city that morning eventually find she way to the picket we have one lady in camp the wife of a officer of native infantry and to she kindly charge the poor creature be consign live to the end of the siege in mr tytler 's tent and be a object of curiosity as well as of pity to the whole force the enemy lately have cause great annoyance by firing at the ridge 32-pound rocket a large store of which they have find in the magazine and as they be unused to discharge these dangerous missile the rocket at first by they rebound inflict more damage on the rebel than on we but gain experience through long practice they every evening and during part of the night fire they at the ridge one or two fall right amongst the tent in camp -lrb- 6 -rrb- a battery also be erect about this time on the opposite bank of the jumna at a distance of some 2000 yard from the metcalfe picket and this be serve so well that not only be the outpost in considerable danger from the fire but the camp of one of we native regiment on the extreme left and below the flagstaff tower be shift in consequence of the enemy 's shell fall in they midst it will thus be see that the rebel put forth they whole strength and use every means at they disposal to harass and annoy we like a swarm of hornet they attack we in every direction first in one quarter and then in another but no effort of theirs affect in the smallest degree the bulldog grip of the british army on the rebellious city report be rife that the king have send to propose term to the general and that the answer be a cannonade direct on the wall by all we battery also that they ammunition be fall short but these with other silly rumor be merely the gossip of the camp and be not credit by the bulk of the army _ August _ 24 -- again a very large body of mutineer numbering it be say 9000 man with thirteen gun leave the city on August 24 they be see from the ridge for hour troop out of the lahore and ajmir gate and proceed far to we right rear they intention no doubt be to cut off the large siege-train and munitions of war on they way down to we from the arsenal at ferozepore _ August _ 25 -- a force be at once detail under command of the gallant nicholson to intercept the enemy and if possible to bring they to battle long before daylight on the morning of August 25 we parade cavalry infantry and three battery of horse artillery or eighteen gun numbering in all nearly 2500 man at six o'clock the march begin and leave the grand trunk road a short distance from the rear of we camp we make across country to a town name nangloous distant six mile the man be in high spirit notwithstanding the difficulty we have to encounter in traverse a route wellnigh impassable from the recent rain and ankle-deep in mud two broad swamp also have to be cross the soldier wade waist-high in the water and carry they ammunition-pouch on they head three hour and more be pass before we arrive at the village and here information reach the general that the enemy be post twelve mile distant at a place name najafgarh the march be at once resume and flounder in the mud the artillery horse especially with great labor drag the gun through the morass which extend nearly all the way we arrive at about four o'clock on the bank of a canal in full view of the enemy 's position this have be choose with great judgment and present a formidable appearance stretch about a mile and a half from the canal bridge on the extreme right to a large seraus on the leave in the town of najafgarh nine gun be post between the bridge and the seraus with four more in the latter building all protect by entrenchment with parapet and embrasure the troops cross the canal by a ford and form up in line of battle on the opposite side face the town of najafgarh and about 900 yard from the seraus the infantry in two line ourselves and the 1st bengal fusilier in front with artillery and cavalry on each flank when we be halt nicholson come to the front and address the regiment of european infantry speak a few soul-stirring word call on we to reserve we fire till close to the enemy 's battery and then to charge with fix bayonet he be answer with a cheer and the line advance across the plain steady and unbroken as though on parade the enemy have open fire and be answer by we gun the infantry march with sloped arm at the quick step till within 100 yard when we deliver a volley then the war-cry of the british soldier be hear and the two regiment come to the charge and run at the double towards the seraus lieutenant gabbett of my regiment be the first man to reach the entrenchment and pass through a embrasure receive a bayonet thrust in the left breast which stretch he on the ground the man follow clearing everything before they capture the four gun in the seraus bayonet the rebel and firing at those who have take to flight at we approach then change front the whole force sweep along the entrenchment to the bridge make a clean sweep of the enemy who turn and flee leave the remain nine gun in we hand we horse artillery under major tomb -- never better serve than in this action -- mow down the fugitive in hundred and continue follow and firing on they till darkness set in the cavalry also -- a squadron of the gallant 9th lancer with the guide and punjabee -- do they share of work while the european infantry be nobly support by the corps of punjab rifle who clear the town of the sepoy the battle have last a very short time and after dark we bivouac on the wet ground in the pour rain completely exhaust from we long march and subsequent fighting and faint from want of food none of which pass we lip for more than sixteen hour -lrb- illustration : note -- major rainby command the 61st regiment in this engagement -rrb- -lrb- from lord robert ' forty-one year in indium by kind permission -rrb- still the day 's work be not over a village to the rear be find to be occupy by the enemy and the punjab rifle be order to take it they meet with a most obstinate resistance they young commander lumsden be kill the general then send part of my regiment to dislodge the rebel but we meet with only partial success and have one officer name elkington mortally wound the enemy evacuate the place during the night we pass the night of the 25th in the greatest discomfort hungry and wet through we lay on the ground snatch sleep at interval poor gabbett die of internal hemorrhage soon after he receive he wound and he death deprive the regiment of one of its best and bravest officer and I of a true friend he have share my tent on the march down and during the whole campaign a cheery good-hearted fellow and one who have earn the respect of officer and the love of he man the general be particularly strike with he bravery and with feeling heart write a letter to gabbett 's mother say he would have recommend she son for the victorium cross have he survive the action young elkington also receive he death-wound at the night-attack on the village he be quite a striple be only eighteen year old and have join the regiment but a few month before he be one of those strange case of a presentiment of death many of which have be well authenticate in we army on look over he effect it be find that he have write letter to he nearest relation on the night before march to najafgarh and he have also carefully make up small parcel of he valuable and trinket with direction on they to whom they be to be deliver in case of he be kill next day it be notice too that he be unusually quiet and reserved never speak a word to anyone on the march though when the action begin he behave like a gallant soldier give up he young life in the service of he country _ August _ 26 -- on the morning of August 26 we march back to camp arrive there before sundown and be play in by the band of the two regiment while many soldier native as well as european line the road and give we a hearty cheer we casualty at the action of najafgarh amount to twenty-five officer and man kill and seventy wound the enemy leave great number of dead in the entrenchment and on the plain they loss be compute at 500 kill and wound but this i fancy be much below the mark for we artillery fire be very destructive and the cavalry committed great havoc amongst the host of fugitive the battle of the 25th be the most brilliant and decisive since that of badli-ki-seraus on June 8 all the gun thirteen in number be capture and the enemy 's camp ammunition store camel and bullock be take would that we have meet the insurgent oftener in the open in this manner but the rascal be too wary and have too great a dread of we troops to face they in a pitched encounter during the absence of nicholson 's small force the enemy have attack all the picket and keep up a heavy cannonade from the wall cause we a loss of thirty-five man it be they impression that the camp have be leave almost bare and defenceless by the withdrawal of so large a force but they be quickly undeceived and be meet at each point of assault by a galling fire from we man for many night after August 26 we right picket be constantly harass by the rebel who also shell hindoo rao 's house from the city and kishenganj battery we sapper too find it not only difficult but dangerous to work in the advanced trench below the ridge be always meet by a murderous musketry from the enemy 's sharpshooter who fire down behind breastwork it be resolve therefore on August 30 to drive they out from they cover and on two or more occasion this be perform by the goorkha and the 60th rifle who as usual fight together and support each other take the breastwork in gallant style we engineer be then enable to continue they operation in the trench preparatory to make approach towards the city wall and construct the battery for the siege-train now daily expect the flagstaff tower as i have already mention in a former part of my narrative be the chief rendezvous of officer when not on duty about this time i go to the top of the tower in company with one of my regiment when a amusing incident occur we be watch the battery play on each side when a tall afghan arm to the tooth appear at the top of the step and be about to set foot on the enclosed space under the flagstaff a sentry be always station there and on this occasion it happen to be a sturdy little goorkha one of the kumaon battalion on the approach of the afghan he immediately come to the charge and warn he that none but european officer be allow on the top of the tower the afghan laugh and then look with contempt at the diminutive sentry a dwarf in comparison with himself he attempt to push aside the bayonet lose all patience the goorkha at this throw down he musket and draw he _ kukri _ the favorite weapon of he race he rush at the afghan with up-lifted blade this be too much for we valiant hero who quickly turn tail and disappear down the circular staircase the goorkha follow he at a short distance on he return he pick up the musket and see we laugh the frown on he face turn into the most ludicrous expression of good-humour i have ever see and he burst out into a fit of laughter which last some minute he tell we that he and the other goorkha of he regiment think nothing of the bravery of the afghan soldier some 100 of whom be on we side at delhus and he speak truly these man all cavalry superbly mount dress in chain armor and carry arm of every description have be send down ostensibly as a reinforcement to we by they ameer dost mohamm khan of kabul but really as spy to watch we movement and report the state of affair to they chief they make a great display about the camp but i never hear of they meeting the enemy in action during they stay before delhus the last two day of August we have several man kill and wound in the force and one of we officer who share my tent after poor gabbett 's death receive a severe contusion from the bursting of a shell nearly three month have now elapse since the siege of delhus begin we be to all appearance no nearer to the desire end and have scarcely gain one foot of ground nearer to the wall of the city moreover there be alarm in the punjab owe to a report disaffection among the sikh population who it be say be begin openly to assert that the british army be unable to take delhus to check this feel the chief commissioner have urge general wilson to lose no time in make preparation for the assault of the city and thus we expectation beat high at the near approach of the powerful siege-train on its way down from ferozepore though we know there be still before we trial and danger to which we former experience would be as nothing the weather have now somewhat clear but the heat be overpower average 98 ° in the shade of my tent every day cholera too rage as before the principal sufferer be ourselves and the 8th and 52nd regiment to cheer the soldier the band play in camp of a evening while some officer and man engage in sport of various kind but the angel of death be hover over my poor regiment and few of we have the heart to join in pastime while we comrade lay stricken and die of disease in hospital _ September 1 _ -- a portion of my corps be on duty at the metcalfe stable picket on September 1 when a lamentable loss be experienced unparalleled in the annals of the siege the enemy 's battery across the river have never cease shell these picket though up to this day it have not cause much damage to the defender shortly after sunrise the man be assemble outside receive they grog which be serve out to they every morning at a early hour some 100 man and officer beside sikh and native attendant be group around when a loud hissing sound be hear and a shrapnel shell fire from the enemy 's battery at the long range of 2000 yard explode a few foot in front the bullet scatter around and the scene which follow it be almost impossible for I to depict many throw themselves flat on the ground fall one on top of the other while groan and cry be hear one soldier fall mortally wound by my side and on look around to count up we loss we find that two of my regiment have be kill outright besides six other severely wound two sikh and a _ bhisti _ or water-carrier also meet they death and two doolie-bearer be wound -- thirteen man in all one very stout old officer be in the act of have he morning bath when the shell explode the _ bhistus _ standing at he side and pour over he when squat on a tent-mallet he _ massuck _ of water he roll over and over on the ground present such a ludicrous appearance in he wet nude state and cover with earth that notwithstanding the awful surroundings of the scene i and other could not forbear laugh the shot have be quite a chance one but it prove how deadly be the effect of a shrapnel shell explode as this have do only a few foot in front of a large body of man _ September 2 and 3 _ -- the battery continue exchange shot during September 2 and 3 but there be no attack of any consequence on the picket and we have on those day only three man wound on the right of we position on the morning of the 4th the long-looked-for siege-train reach camp it consist of twenty-four heavy gun and mortar and a plentiful supply of ammunition and store reinforcement also reach we amount to about 400 european infantry and the belooch battalion the last a most savage-looking lot of man who however do good service and fight well besides these a party of sikh horseman in the service of the rajah of jhind -- a noble-looking man who with he retainer have keep open we communication with the punjab during the whole siege -- join the army beg as a favor that they might join in the danger of the come assault on the city _ September 7 _ -- September 7 also see the arrival of wilde 's regiment of punjabi 700 strong follow the same day by the kashmir contingent of 2200 man and four gun send to we assistance by the ruler of that country i be sit in my tent with the bandmaster of my regiment a german name sauer when we be salute with the sound of distant music the most discordant i have ever hear the bandmaster jump up from he seat exclaim : mein gott vat be dat no regiment in camp can play such vile music and close he ear immediately rush out of the tent the kashmir troops be march into camp accompany by general wilson and he staff who have go out to meet they they band play some english air drum beat and color fly there be no fault to be find in the appearance of the soldier who be mostly sikh and hill man of good physique but they ludicrous style of march the strange outlandish uniform of the man and the shrill discord of they band create great amusement among the assemble european who have never see such a travesty on soldier before they encamp on we right flank but be not employ on active service till the day of assault on September 14 on the arrival of the siege-train no time be lose in make approach and parallel and erect battery for the bombardment of delhus the trench-work have already be begin and what with cover and work party both of european and native soldier and the usual picket duty the greater part of the army be continually employ in this arduous work every night and a portion of each day nothing could surpass the zeal and willing aptitude of the man who labor unceasingly digging trench and fill sand-bag all the time and more especially at night expose to a galling fire of musketry and shell the engineer under they able leader be unremitting in they duty and the young officer of that corps cover themselves with glory both in these preliminary operation and at the actual assault no 1 battery to we right front consist of ten heavy gun and mortar be trace on the evening of September 7 about 700 yard from the morus bastion no 2 to the left front near ludlow castle and only 600 yard from the wall be complete on the 10th and contain nineteen piece of artillery no 4 for ten heavy mortar and near no 2 at the koodsium bagh be complete in front of the kashmir bastion also on that day and lastly no 3 on the extreme leave with six gun at the short distance of 180 yard from the water bastion be unmask behind the custom-house which be blow up after the completion of the battery thus in four day and night after incredible exertion on the part of the work party forty-five heavy gun and mortar be in position strongly entrenched and ready to silence the fire from the enemy 's bastion and to make breach in the wall for the assault column the rebel during all this time ply the cover and work party with shot and shell bring out field-gun which enfilade the ludlow castle and koodsium bagh battery and keep up a sharp musketry fire from a advanced trench they have dig in front of the wall at the two latter place where the man of my regiment be employ the fire be very galling at time the gun from the distant selimgarh fort water and kashmir bastion all concentrate they shot at those battery whilst in process of erection the night fortunately be clear and we have plenty of light to assist we in we work the man be cheerful and active never rest for a moment in they labor and receive in the field force order the praise of the general in command we wonder how it be that the enemy allow we to occupy the advanced position at ludlow castle and the koodsium bagh without even so much as a struggle but it be account for by the supposition that they imagine we attack would be make from the right of we position where all the great conflict have take place there they be in strength and it be we weakest point whereas on the side near the jumna we be protect from be turn by have the river on we flank better cover for operation and moreover battery to silence which be less powerful and more difficult of concentration than those which face we on we right from the city wall and from the suburb of kishenganj -lrb- footnote 1 : white people -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : lieutenant pattoun be wound in the ankle on this occasion and a sergeant of the 61st be shoot through the head -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : colonel seton 35th native infantry be wound in the stomach in this affair -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 :

on September 7 1857 all reinforcement that could possibly arrive have reach we with the siege-train and the effective force now available for operation before delhus consist of the follow troops : european artillery 580 cavalry 514 infantry 2672 ----- 3766 native artillery 770 cavalry 1313 infantry 3417 engineer sapper miner etc 722 ----- 6222 ----- grand total 9988 to the above must be add the kashmir contingent of 2200 man with four gun and the cavalry of the jhind rajah perhaps 400 more make the full amount of troops employ at the siege 12588 the seven regiment of european infantry be sadly reduce in number be mere skeleton the strongest mustering 409 effective rank and file and the weakest only 242 there be also nearly 3000 man in hospital european and native from the most reliable source the enemy at this period number 40000 man all trained soldier of the former regular army besides undisciplined armed horde of fanatic and rabble of the city and surround country -- a formidable disproportion to we scanty force when it be recollect that they be protect by strong fortification mount upward of fifty gun with a unlimited supply of artillery and munitions of war and that with they vast number they have ample opportunity of harass we right flank and rear and cut off communication up-country nevertheless political consideration demand that we should take the offensive and deal such a blow as would convince the rebel as well as those whose loyalty be waver that the british arm be irresistible moreover there be no likelihood of we force be increase so on September 7 general wilson issue the follow address to he troops : the force assemble before delhus have have much hardship to undergo since its arrival in this camp all of which have be most cheerfully bear by officer and man the time be now draw near when the major-general command the force trust that its labor will be over and it will be reward by the capture of the city for all its past exertion and for a cheerful endurance of still greater fatigue and exposure the troops will be require to aid and assist the engineer in the erection of the battery and trench and in daily exposure to the sun as cover party the artillery will have even harder work than they yet have have and which they have so well and cheerfully perform hitherto : this however will be for a short period only and when order to the assault the major-general feel assure british pluck and determination will carry everything before they and that the bloodthirsty and murderous mutineer against whom they be fight will be drive headlong out of they stronghold or be exterminate but to enable they to do this he warn the troops of the absolute necessity of they keep together and not straggle from they column by this can success only be secure major-general wilson need hardly remind the troops of the cruel murder commit on they officer and comrade as well as they wife and child to move they in the deadly struggle no quarter should be give to the mutineer at the same time for the sake of humanity and the honor of the country they belong to he call upon they to spare all woman and child that may come in they way it be so imperative not only for they safety but for the success of the assault that man should not straggle from they column that the major-general feel it he duty to direct all command officer to impress this strictly upon they man and he be confident that after this warn the man 's good sense and discipline will induce they to obey they officer and keep steady to they duty it be to be explain to every regiment that indiscriminate plunder will not be allow that prize agent have be appoint by whom all capture property will be collect and sell to be divide accord to the rule and regulation on this head fairly among all man engage and that any man find guilty of have conceal capture property will be make to restore it and will forfeit all claim to the general prize he will also be likely to be make over to the provost-marshal to be summarily deal with the major-general call upon the officer of the force to lend they zealous and efficient co-operation in the erection of the work of the siege now about to be commence he look especially to the regimental officer of all grade to impress upon they man that to work in the trench during a siege be as necessary and honorable as to fight in the rank during a battle he will hold all officer responsible for they utmost be do to carry out the direction of the engineer and he confidently trust that all will exhibit a healthy and hearty spirit of emulation and zeal from which he have no doubt that the happiest result will follow in the brilliant termination of all they labor _ September 7 _ -- from the night of September 7 to the day of assault all the artilleryman in the force european as well as native be constantly employ in the battery and trench day and night officer and man work with unflagging energy in the advanced battery with no relief and no cessation from they toil few in number wear out by the excessive fatigue of a three month ' campaign and enervate by continuous work in the deadliest season of the year these gallant european artilleryman earn during those last day of the siege by they zeal and devotion the heartfelt thanks of the whole army the old bengal artillery have a splendid roll of service extend for upward of 100 year still in the annals of that distinguished regiment there be no brighter record than they achievement before delhus in 1857 the corps have be merge into the royal artillery but the ancient name still live in the memory of those who be witness of they deed and they imperishable renown add greater lustre to the proud motto _ ubique _ bear by the regiment to which they be affiliate many officer and man of the cavalry and infantry volunteer for service in the battery when call on by the general they acquit themselves well be of great use to the gunner in lighten the arduous duty and be compliment in order for the valuable aid they have afford to they companion in arm -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ September 11 _ -- the advanced battery be all complete by the evening of September 11 when the actual bombardment of the city begin for three day and night previous no 1 battery on the extreme right be severely pound from the morus bastion and kishenganj but when the gun get into full play the fire from the former grow gradually weaker and weaker till it be completely overpower no 2 and 4 battery be nearer to the wall suffer much from the enemy and the loss be very severe both among the artillery and the cover and work body of infantry _ September 11 _ -- at length on September 11 the whole of we battery open fire simultaneously on the city bastion and wall the kashmir bastion be soon silence the rampart and adjacent curtain knock to fragment and a large breach open in the wall on the extreme left at the custom-house we battery as before related be only 180 yard from the city and the crush fire from this when in full play smash to piece the water bastion overturn the gun and make a breach in the curtain so wide and practicable that it could be ascend with ease fifty gun and mortar be now pour shot and shell without a moment 's interval on the doomed city the din and roar be deafening day and night salvo of artillery be hear roll follow roll in endless succession and striking terror in the heart of those who know and feel that the day of retribution be at hand still though they battery on the bastion have be wellnigh silence the rebel stick well to they field-gun in the open space before the wall they send a storm of rocket from one of the martello tower and fire a stream of musketry from the rampart and advance trench kishenganj too make its voice hear harass we right and sweep the sabzus mandus and hindoo rao 's with its incessant fire during the bombardment we casualty amount to nearly 350 man the enemy cause great loss at no 2 battery through the fire of a 3-pounder serve from a hole break in the curtain-wall this gun be admirably direct and could not be silence notwithstanding all we effort one officer look over the parapet to see the effect of he fire be strike by a shot from the hole in the wall he head be take completely off the mutilate trunk fall back amongst the man at the gun -- a ghastly and terrible sight which fill we who be present with horror during the whole of the bombardment portion of my regiment be on duty in the battery and trench work at the repair of the parapet and embrasure occasionally damage by the enemy 's shot and also take they share of duty with the advanced and cover party these be harass and dangerous service involve great vigilance we be almost always under fire from the enemy but with the utmost cheerfulness and even i may say good-humour the whole of the infantry do all in they power to lighten the work of the overtasked artilleryman : comrade we be all strive for the accomplishment of one purpose -- that of bring swift and sure destruction on the rebel who have for so long a period successfully resist we arm so cool and collect have the man become that even in the midst of fire from the advanced trench and while keep up on we side a brisk fusillade the soldier smoke they pipe rude joke be bandy from one to the other and laughter be hear when off duty i and other take we station for hour on the ridge and sometimes on the top of the flagstaff tower thence with eager eye we watch the battery cannonade the wall and mark the effect of the round-shot on the rampart and bastion few of the enemy could be see but every now and then some would show themselves disappear when a well-directed shot strike in too close proximity cavalry and infantry at time issue from the gate but from they hurry movement it seem evident that they be ill at ease and after a short time they return into the city at night the scene be as may be suppose grand in the extreme the space below be light up by continuous flash and burst of flame throw a flood of light among the thick forest of tree and garden while shell would burst high over the city illuminate the spire and dome and bring into prominence every object around there be not only the roll of the heavy gun and mortar but the sharp rattle of musketry and the hiss of the huge rocket as it cut through the air with its brilliant light sound in we ear _ September 12 _ -- on the 12th the enemy make frequent sortie from the lahore and ajmir gate with body of cavalry and foot while a party of horseman cross the canal and make for the right rear of the camp the latter be see by the guide and some punjabi cavalry who lead by probyn and watson advance to meet the enemy there be a short but sharp encounter at close quarter in which thirty rebel be kill the remainder fly at full speed towards the city the sortie from the gate turn out comparatively harmless and seem mean only as demonstration to draw out we troops from the cover of the advanced trench see that the attempt be futile and result only in loss to themselves the enemy retreat in confusion they flight be accelerate by shell and round-shot from no 1 battery and musketry from we outlying post a serious loss befall the army on this day in the death of captain robert fagan of the bengal artillery this officer whose heroism make he name conspicuous even among the many gallant spirit of the delhi field force be kill in no 3 advanced battery a post he have occupy since September 8 and which be more than any other expose to the enemy 's fire he have serve throughout the siege and be beloved by he man win the heart of all not only by he undaunted behavior and cool courage but also by he kind-hearted and amiable disposition the approach day of assault be now the subject of conversation among officer and man for the end be at hand on September 12 a council of war meet in general wilson 's tent at which all the superior officer of the army be present all the arrangement for attack be perfect and the position of every brigade and corps be fix and decide though the day and hour of assault be know to no one not even to the general in command _ September 13 _ -- there be no rest for we on the 13th the last Sunday we be destine to pass before the wall of delhus the fire of we heavy cannon increase in violence every hour and the silence of the enemy 's battery assure we of the efficacy of the bombardment and the speedy approach of the time when we column would move to the assault on the city that night soon after darkness have set in four officer of the engineer proceed to examine the two large breach in the wall make by the battery it be a hazardous duty expose they to peril of they life but these brave young fellow execute they task in safety and unobserved by the enemy few of whom seem to be keep watch on the rampart return to report the perfect practicability of the breach for escalade then the general issue he order for the final assault and long before midnight each regiment in camp know its allotted place in the come attack on the city five storm column be form the position and detail of each be as under : no 1 under brigadier general nicholson consist of the 75th regiment 1st bengal fusilier and punjab infantry to storm the breach at the kashmir

should be blow in by the engineer no 5 or the reserve under brigadier longfield -lrb- hm 8th regiment -rrb- to follow no 3 by that gate into the city be compose of the 61st the belooch battalion 4th punjab infantry and the jhind troops -- altogether 1300 man with 200 of hm 60th rifle -- to cover the advance of nicholson 's column and to form a reserve the whole of the above-named column be under the immediate command of general nicholson on whom devolve all arrangement for carry out the assault on delhus no 4 column under major reid the officer in command at hindoo rao 's house be form of part of the 60th rifle the sirmoor battalion of goorkha detachment from european regiment and the kashmir contingent this column be to attack the fortify suburb of kishenganj and enter the city by the lahore gate meeting no 1 and 2 column at that place the cavalry brigade under colonel grant compose of the 9th lancer part of the 6th carabineer with sikh and punjab cavalry and some horse artillery take up they position on the right of no 1 advance battery face the morus gate and within range of kishenganj they object be to oppose any attempt to take the storm column in flank to watch the movement of the enemy and to guard the camp from surprise to the convalescent and a small force of cavalry and artillery the protection of the camp be confide -- a very insufficient guard when it be consider that the enemy might well out of they vast number have detach part of they horseman and infantry to harass if not imperil its safety and that of the many sick and wound as will hereafter be see great danger result from the arrangement make in this respect and have the enemy after we unsuccessful attack on kishenganj on the 14th but show a spirit of pluck and daring it be not too much to affirm that the camp might have fall into they hand and we success in the city have thereby be render almost nugatory the night of the 13th be pass by we in a cheerful mood everyone hopeful and confident of what the morrow would bring forth there be a character of determination among the officer and man a cool deliberate conviction that under providence success would crown we arm and that vengeance would be do on those who have forfeit they life by the cruel massacre of we defenceless woman and child sleep visit the eye of few in camp during the short hour of preparation for the assault fully equip to turn out at a moment 's notice we lay down on we bed wait for the signal to fall in this come at about three o'clock on the morning of September 14 -- a auspicious day it be the third anniversary of the battle of the alma _ September _ 14 -- the troops fall in on they respective line and assemble at the slope of the ridge the four column of attack march in silence to the flagstaff tower thence pick up the man on picket who be all withdraw from the outlying post the force move by the road to the neighborhood of ludlow castle and close to no 2 advanced battery we movement be entirely conceal from the enemy the darkness which prevail and the ample cover from tree garden and house mask the march of the column while the breach battery which have keep up they fire all night long still continue the bombardment nor do they cease till the actual moment when the column be set in motion and take they way to the city just before sunrise all the disposition be complete the gallant nicholson under whose order we be move from point to point to perfect he arrangement we artillery fire cease as if by magic and a stillness which contrast ominously with the former roar and din must have convince the rebel that something unusual be about to take place the 60th rifle with a cheer advance to the front and open out as skirmisher to the right and left of the koodsium bagh then follow no 1 and 2 column which in compact order issue from they cover make for the two breach to be assault i be with my regiment in no 5 column and with breathless interest each heart aflame with excitement we watch we comrade march to the attack presently the order for no 3 column to move forward be give and at a short interval we own follow meanwhile the enemy have descry we movement and the rampart and wall and also the top of the breach be alive with man who pour in a galling fire on we troops soon they reach the outer edge of the moat and amidst a perfect hailstorm of bullet cause great havoc among we man the scaling-ladder be let down the ditch here 20 foot deep and 25 foot broad offer a serious obstacle to the quick advance of the assault column the man fall fast under the withering fire and some delay ensue before the ladder could be properly adjust however nothing daunt the opposite side be scale and mount the escarp the assailant with shout and cheer that could be hear above the din of battle rush up the two breach without wait for the charge of the british bayonet the greater part of the rebel desert the wall and bastion and run pell-mell into the city follow by we man some few stand manfully and endeavor to check the flight of the rest but they be soon shoot or bayonet and the two column halt inside the wall almost simultaneously with the entrance of we troops into the city the kashmir gate be blow in and no 3 column follow by no 5 advance along the covered way and pass into the city we have only be meet by desultory fire from the enemy which cause few casualty during we march to the gate the man be in high spirit and long to come to close quarter the episode of the blow in of the kashmir gate of delhus be too well know to require description here -lrb- 2 -rrb- suffice it to say that the deed be a act of heroism almost without a parallel in the annals of the british army in broad daylight a small band of hero advance to almost certain death but with a determination and valor seldom hear of after repeat attempt to lay the powder-bag and apply the match and lose nearly all they number kill and wound the gate be blow in give free passage to the assault column all the troops be now assemble at the main guard in a open space close to the kashmir gate and here as well as the firing from the enemy would permit the force re-formed under the order of general nicholson no 1 and 2 column unite and under command of that officer move to they right advance along the wall in that direction and clearing everything in they way no 3 column now march into the heart of the city be guide by sir theophilus metcalfe and by a circuitous route make its way towards the jama musjid soon we lose sight of this force and then we own work begin advance from we first place at the main guard no 5 column push forward to the college garden march through narrow street and lane with high house on each side but how can i describe that terrible street-fighting which last without intermission the whole day from every window and door from loophole in the building and from the top of the house a storm of musketry salute we on every side while every now and then when pass the corner of a street field-gun load with grape discharge they contents into the column officer and man fall fast but this only serve to exasperate the remainder who almost without a check reach the college and after some severe skirmishing clear the garden and house of the rebel and bayonet all who be find there leave a detachment to occupy this post we pass through more street and lane ever expose to the same terrific fire and after great trouble succeed in take possession of colonel skinner 's house and a large building know as the palace of ahmed ali khan it be now midday and at the latter place we be join by no 3 column which make its way to the jama musjid meet with such a strenuous resistance that after lose many man and be without powder with which to blow up the gate of the mosque it be force to retire the street we hear be alive with man on they line of route and the column have be expose to incessant fire without any good result from they undaunted effort there be work enough and to spare to clear the street and house in front and on each side of the kashmir gate and from the time the two column join force till night set in a continuous fight be maintain the system of attack in which we be engage allow of no formation be retain isolate group of man european and native lead sometimes by officer and often without any leader roam through the narrow street enter house from which the fire be more than usually severe and put to death without mercy all who be find inside on one occasion a party of sepoy and armed rabble emerge from a house in we front and be see by we man who immediately open fire soon they be follow by a troop of woman yell and scream keep these as a cover for they retreat the rebel get clear away the soldier have desist from firing the moment the woman appear this be a ruse which i hear from other be often adopt by the mutineer who seem to know intuitively that they woman and child be safe from the fire of we man the deed of individual daring perform during September 14 be numberless and i be witness of many feat of arm and cool courage by the rank and file and non-commissioned officer of the different regiment a private of my corps a huge grenadier irishman name moylan save the life of a officer under circumstance which fully entitle he to the coveted distinction of the victorium cross in one of the numerous encounter which take place this officer lead on a few man turn sharply round the corner of a street and be meet by a force of sepoy come from the opposite direction a shot strike he and he be fell to the ground from the blow of a sword and would have be quickly despatch have not moylan rush to he rescue discharge he musket he shoot one of the assailant and charge with the bayonet this be break off and then with firelock club he stand over the prostrate officer deal such fearful blow with the weapon -- fell he foe in every direction -- that the sepoy take to they heel and moylan pick up the wounded officer bring he to a place of safety he be make a sergeant on the spot by the colonel but all effort to obtain the cross for this gallant fellow be unavailing in those day the distinction be but seldom give probably so many name be submit for the general 's consideration that only a few could be approve and the application for moylan be pass by but though in the latter 's case the victorium cross be not give it be award to a surgeon -lrb- name reade -rrb- of my regiment on that day he be ever to be find in the thick of the fight minister to the wound and cheer on the man while engage in he professional duty a number of sepoy pour a deadly fire from the far end of a street into the group of wound of which he be the central figure this be too much for the surgeon who draw he sword call on some man of the regiment close by and lead they in gallant style against the enemy whom he disperse with great loss kill two sepoy with he own hand not only on this occasion but on several other the surgeon 's bravery be most conspicuous no one grudging he the distinction he have so gallantly win there be nothing so destructive of the morale and discipline of soldier as street-fighting nor can control be maintain except by man of extraordinary resolution the veteran of the european regiment compose the delhus army on the day of assault fully justify they reputation cool and determine they keep in check the impulsive valor of the young soldier and assist they officer on various occasion when it become almost impossible to control they ardor till late at night the fight never cease the weary and famished soldier exhaust and wear out from fatigue and exposure and without a moment 's rest carry out the work of clear the street and house expose all the time to a fire of musketry come chiefly from unseen foe many lose they life in the house where entangled in the labyrinth of roof courtyard and passage they be shoot down by the inmate and be find in several instance day after with they throat cut and otherwise mutilate the hope of find plunder in these place also lead many to they doom and account for the large list of miss soldier whose name appear in the day 's casualty and now i must pass from we force to record the doings of no 1 and 2 column under general nicholson these for a long distance have carry all before they take possession of the rampart and bastion as far as the kabul gate and effectually clear the street lead to the heart of the city expose to a pitiless fire of grape and musketry through they whole advance they loss be very heavy but still press forward barrier after barrier be take the gun on each bastion after its capture be at once turn on the city they goal be the burn bastion and the lahore gate and all that man could do with they diminish number be try at those point without effect the rebel be in enormous force at these position field-gun and howitzer pour grape and canister into the assault column and musketry rain on they from the adjoining house time after time attack be make till the sadly harass soldier completely wear out be force to retire to the kabul gate and the bastion and rampart they have already gain it be in one of these unsuccessful attempt to carry the lahore gate that nicholson fall mortally wound ever eager and impetuous he dauntless soul lead he into the thick of the combat spurn danger and unmindful of he valuable life he be in the front in the act of encouraging and lead on he man when the fatal shot lay low a spirit whose equal there be not to be find in indium he linger for some day in great torment expire on September 23 mourn by everyone in the force from the general in command to the private soldier all of whom know he worth and feel that in the then momentous crisis he absence from amongst we could ill be bear no eulogy can add to he renown through he effort more than those of any other delhus fall and he leave he unconquered spirit as a heritage for the work still to be accomplish in the pacification of indium he name itself be a tower of strength in the army peerless amongst the brave man of he time to what brilliant destiny might he not have succeed have he young life -lrb- he be but thirty-four year old -rrb- be prolong i must now revert to no 4 column under major reid and the attack on the strong fortified suburb of kishenganj about 100 man of my regiment be engage in this affair and from the lip of we officer i have a full account of the fight and the subsequent retreat -lrb- 3 -rrb- the morning have dawn and major reid wait to hear the signal to commence operation -- the blow in of the kashmir gate he force numbering about 1000 man besides the kashmir troops be form up on the grand trunk road opposite the sabzus mandus picket and at the foot of the ridge now the sun have rise and still he watch for the signal when shot in quick succession be hear on the right of the column and it become know that the kashmir contingent without wait for order have become engage with the enemy some man of the 60th rifle be throw out as skirmisher and major reid move with he force in the direction of kishenganj soon they be stop by strong breastwork throw up by the enemy and bar the road to the suburb the rebel be conceal behind these in great force and pour a heavy fire on we troops when only fifty yard distant a rush be make for the earthwork which be take in gallant style but the want of field-gun be here feel and the enemy retire a short distance amongst the garden from which they continue to harass we troops the kishenganj battery also open fire and we position become critical in the extreme from the increase number of the foe who be constantly reinforce and defy all endeavor to drive they from they cover while the struggle be thus rage on the leave the kashmir troops on the extreme right flank have become involve with a large force of the enemy of all arm who no doubt despise the martial quality of these half-disciplined levy attack they on all side with great vigor we ally make no stand and soon become completely disorganize fly at length in headlong rout with the loss of all they gun no record be keep of they casualty but they must have be very severe for the future they remain unemployed in they camp bewail the loss of they four gun and be never again engage with the enemy two or three day after the capture of delhus i be wander with some other through the street of the city when we come upon a officer and four man of the contingent who accost we ask if we have hear or see anything of they lose gun they seem in great grief fear the wrath of the maharajah of kashmir when they should arrive home leave the gun behind with difficulty restrain a laugh we assure they that we could give no information on the subject and counsel they to search among the gun on the bastion near the lahore and ajmir gate they succeed eventually in find two the other probably be bear off as trophy by the sepoy during the evacuation of delhus the contingent soon afterwards leave for kashmir but how they be receive by the maharajah we never hear though probably condign punishment be mete out to those who have actual charge of the gun the defeat of the kashmir troops have a most disastrous effect on the issue of the attack on kishenganj reinforce in great number as i have relate the enemy maintain they ground and we man could make no impression on they chiefly from the want of field-gun major reid moreover be wound at a early stage of the action and be carry off the field he absence be soon feel in the altered disposition of the force and the want of a leader to carry out the plan form by he the breastwork which have be take could not be hold for want of support and some confusion result the enemy 's artillery from kishenganj and musketry from the garden cause great destruction many gallant attempt be make to drive off the rebel but all be unavailing and at length after lose one-third of its number the column fall back in good order to its original starting-point near the sabzus mandus and kishenganj remain in the hand of the enemy have that position be take and no 4 column accord to instruction push on to the lahore gate no good as it turn out would have be effect nicholson 's column as related have be force to retire the gate would have remain closed and possibly the undertaking would have result in a more serious collapse than the ineffectual attempt on kishenganj the presence of a large unconquered force on we right flank also place the camp in imminent danger it be know -- from information receive from spy -- that it be the enemy 's intention after we failure to dislodge they from the suburb to make a attack on the almost unprotected camp the danger fortunately pass off the rebel probably have little heart to join in operation to we rear when they hear the news of the signal success of we column in the city still they presence at kishenganj be a standing menace nor be we completely at ease with regard to the safety of the camp till the 20th when the city be find to be evacuate by the enemy and we troops immediately take possession lastly i must narrate the doings of the cavalry brigade this force with horse artillery be station near no 1 advance battery under the command of brigadier hope-grant they duty be to guard we right flank from be turn during the assault on the city here they remain keep a watchful lookout for some hour till order come for the brigade to move towards the wall of delhus they halt opposite the kabul gate at a distance of 400 yard and be at once expose to the fire from the bastion and to musketry from the garden outside the suburb of taliwarra and kishenganj we horse artillery make good practice drive the enemy from they cover and spike two gun but the expose situation cause great loss in the cavalry and they move still further to they front halt amidst some tree the enemy now sally from the garden as though with the intention of drive the cavalry in the direction of the kashmir gate the circumstance be most critical when a body of guide infantry come up at the time throw themselves on the rebel maintain they place with great resolution till help arrive with a part of the belooch battalion and the enemy be force to retire too much praise can not be give to the 9th lancer and horse artillery for they conduct on this occasion expose for hour to cannonade and musketry unable to act from the nature of the ground they never flinch from they post form a living target to the fire of the rebel the same may be say of the sikh and punjabi cavalry who display a coolness and intrepidity scarcely if at all less meritorious than that of they european comrade we casualty be very severe the 9th lancer alone lose upward of twenty man kill and wound and now that i have describe the operation of each column and portion of the delhus army during September 14 it will be necessary to record the advantage we have gain from the water bastion to the kabul gate a distance of more than a mile and constitute the northern face of the fortification of delhus be in we possession with all the intervene bastion rampart and wall some progress have be make into the city opposite and to the right and left of the kashmir gate and along the line of wall the college and its grounds colonel skinner 's house that of ahmed alus khan and many other smaller building be hold by the infantry the enemy 's gun on the bastion have be turn on to the city and a constant fire be keep up the street and lane be clear in front and advance post occupy by we man these advantage have not be gain without a severe struggle and a terrible roll of kill and wound be the consequence we casualty on September 14 amount to upward of 1200 officer and man kill wound and miss -- a loss out of all proportion to the small number of man engage and when the relative force be consider far exceed that which be suffer by the british army during the assault on the redan on September 8 1855 the deadly and destructive nature of street-fighting be here apparent and the long-sustained contest last more than twelve hour swell the total loss to the excessive amount record in my regiment alone 100 man be place _ hors de combat _ thirty-three be kill but the other european regiment suffer still more in proportion and especially so those which take part in the actual assault on the breach the native troops fight with the most determine bravery sikh punjabi and goorkha side by side with they english comrade press into the forefront of the strife help in the most material manner towards the day 's success it be impossible to ascertain the loss sustain by the enemy dead body lay thick in the street and open space and number be kill in the house but the greater part of those who fall be no doubt carry off by the rebel in the ardor of the fight many non-combatant also lose they life we man mad and excited make no distinction there be no more terrible spectacle than a city take by storm all the pent-up passion of man be here let loose without restraint rouse to a pitch of fury from long-continued resistance and eager to take vengeance on the murderer of woman and child the man in they pitiless rage show no mercy the dark day of badajoz and san sebastian be renew on a small scale at delhus and during the assault see the impetuous fury of we man i could not help recall to my mind the harrowing detail of the old peninsular war here reproduce before my eye with the exception of a small amount of looting the man be too much occupy with fighting and vengeance to take note of the means of temptation which lay within they reach in the untold quantity of spirit in the store of the city strong drink be now and have in all age be the bane of the british soldier -- a propensity he can not resist in time of peace and which be tenfold aggravate when excite by fight and when the wherewithal to indulge it lie spread before he as be the case at delhus when and by whom begin i can not say but early in the morning of the 15th the store have be break into and the man revel in unlimited supplies of drink of every kind it be a sad circumstance to chronicle and the drunkenness which ensue might have result in serious consequence to the army have the enemy take advantage of the sorry position we be in vain be the attempt make at first to put a stop to the dissipation and not till order go forth from the general to destroy all the liquor that could be find do the orgy cease and the man return crestfallen and ashamed to a sense of they duty the work of destruction be carry out chiefly by the sikh and punjabi and the waste drink run in stream through the conduit of the city _ September 15 _ -- this untoward event considerably hamper the operation on September 15 and but small progress be make that day towards drive the rebel out of delhus the artillery and engineer work hard at the completion of the battery on the capture bastion on which be mount we own and the enemy 's heavy gun and one for mortar be erect in the college grounds which shell the palace and the fort of selimgarh a few house be take in advance of we position but no further movement on any large scale be attempt owe to the demoralized state of a great portion of the european infantry and further to a desire that the troops should obtain some rest after the unparalleled fatigue and exposure of the previous day report also spread through the force that the general feeling he strength and mean inadequate to hold even the portion of the city in we possession meditate a evacuation of the place and a retirement to the old camp to await reinforcement every consideration must be make for one place in he critical position and he no doubt in he own mind feel justified in propose the step which have it be carry out would in all probability have end in the fall of british rule in indium in a extraordinary situation extraordinary resolution be need be the say of the great napoleon and to no crisis in we history be this dictum more applicable than that at delhus in September 1857 mutiny and rebellion spread they hydra head over the land disaffection be rife in the punjab we only source of supply for operation in the field and nought could stay the alarming symptom save the complete capture and retention of the great stronghold of rebellion it have also be a well-known maxim lay down and carry out by clive wellesley lake and all the great commander who have make we name famous in hindostan never to retire before a eastern foe no matter how great the disparity of number and history tell we that we success be due mainly to this rule while the few reverse we have suffer result from a timid policy carry out by man whose heart fail they in the hour of trial happily for the delhus army and more especially for the english name the counsel of the general in command be overrule by the chief officer in the force and even the gallant nicholson from he death-bed denounce in language which those who hear it will never forget the step contemplate by he superior officer towards the evening of the 15th the enemy become embolden by we inactivity attack the advanced post along we whole line and keep up a sharp musketry fire more especially on the college compound while the heavy gun at selimgarh and some at the magazine shell those garden and house adjacent -- even as far as the kashmir gate -- occupy by we troops at 5 p m a battery of heavy gun play on the defence of the magazine soon crumble the wall to piece and open out a large breach for assault _ September 16 _ -- my regiment the 4th punjab rifle and a wing of the belooch battalion be detail as a storm party and muster at a early hour on the morning of the 16th we march to the attack on the magazine -lrb- 4 -rrb- this enclosure -- a large walled area close to the palace -- be surround by a high curtained wall with tower the interior space be occupy by building and contain a park of artillery and munitions of war we meet with no resistance on we way and on approach the breach see only a few defender on the rampart who open a fire which however cause little damage a rush be at once make the man gain the top of the bridge without difficulty and bayonet some sepoy and firing on the remainder who flee through the enclosure and be drive out at the gate on the opposite side we have only about a dozen man kill and wound but of the enemy more than 100 lose they life be drag out of the building where they have take refuge and quickly put to death two hundred and thirty-two gun fall into we hand besides pile of shot and shell in fact so vast be the amount that although the enemy have be firing from they battery for more than three month make a lavish use of the store at they command scarcely any impression seem to have be make on it that day and the follow night we position in the capture magazine be anything but pleasant the rebel continually harass we with shell fire from the chandnus chauk and near the palace some more venturesome than the rest climb on ladder to the top of the wall ply we with musketry and hand-grenade while other during the night mount the high tree overhang the enclosure and with long light bamboo try to set fire to the thatched building and blow up a small magazine these attempt keep we constantly on the alert and it be with great difficulty that we prevent damage be do fight continue during the day among the other portion of the force and no 1 and 2 column make further advance among the street the gun and mortar from the bastion throw shot and shell far into the crowded part of the city house in command situation be take and make secure from assault by defence of sand-bag great judgment be show in these operation and the loss in consequence be comparatively few but the enemy as yet give no sign of retreat from delhus and we leader feel that great exertion would still be necessary before the city fall entirely into we hand _ September 17 _ -- during the 17th and 18th a constant fire of shell from upward of twenty mortar be direct from the magazine and college grounds on the selimgarh fort and the palace those from the bastion still firing into a large portion of the city skirmishing go on at the advanced post and a regular unbroken line of communication be establish from one end of we picket to the other _ September 18 _ -- on the 18th my regiment move from the magazine and take up its quarter in the protestant church close to the main guard and kashmir gate and at no great distance from the northern wall of the city this church have be build by the gallant and philanthropic colonel alexander skinner cb a eurasian and a irregular cavalry commander of some eminence during the war in the beginning of the century he also erect at he own expense a hindoo temple and a mohammedan mosque give as he reason that all religion be alike and that in he opinion each one be entitle to as much consideration as the other this church in which we be now quarter have be sadly desecrate by the rebel and fanatic of the city they have in they religious zeal tear down the pulpit and reading-desk deface emblem break up the pew and the bench and shatter all the pane of glass while here and there inside the building be remains of they cooking-place with broken fragment of utensil the wall too have suffer much from the effect of we bombardment from September 11 to 14 the church be in the line of fire direct on the bastion many no doubt would consider it a sacrilege to quarter english troops in this sacred edifice but the exigency of war require its use for this purpose and of all the building occupy by we during we stay in delhus the church be find to be cleanest and best ventilate free from the noisome smell and close atmosphere of the native house the close of the 18th saw we outpost extend hard by the chandnus chauk -- the main street of the city -- the bank major abbott 's and khan mohammed 's house have first be seize by we man who suffer severely from the field-gun and musketry of the rebel there be also another unsuccessful attack make on the burn bastion and lahore gate by the right column in which the 75th lose one officer and many man kill the arrangement for attack seem to have be bad and ill-advised the soldier feel the want of the guide genius of nicholson and during a advance through a narrow lane be literally mow down by grape from the enemy 's field-gun the weather which since the 14th have be fine break up on the night of the 18th and be succeed by a terrific storm of rain which fall in torrent like a deluge that night it be report that the rebel in great number be evacuate the city by the south side the bareilly and neemuch brigade make off in the direction of gwalior certain it be that from this period sign of wane strength appear among the enemy and fewer attempt at assault be make on we outpost those on the leave near the palace which be well protect by breastwork be only expose to a very desultory fire of musketry during the forenoon of the 18th there be i think a partial eclipse of the sun which last three hour the unusual darkness which prevail astonished we beyond measure -lrb- we mind be take up with event more startling than astronomical phenomenon -rrb- till reference to a almanac explain the mystery the eclipse have we be tell a alarming effect on the mutineer who attribute the phenomenon to some supernatural agency the darkness no doubt work on they superstitious fear and hasten they flight from the city on which the wrath of the almighty have descend _ September 19 _ -- on the 19th operation in front of the palace gate be continue a heavy fire be keep up against that place while the 60th rifle and other perch on the top of house take unerring aim at the rebel cluster in the open space the same evening also the exertion of the right column be reward by the capture of the burn bastion with little loss on we side it be now quite evident that the baffled insurgent be retire from delhus in great number mostly by the south side few cross the bridge of boat by day owe to it be command by we gun but on the night of the 19th when sit in the church compound watch the shell explode over the palace and selimgarh we hear distinctly through the interval of firing a distant confused hum of voice like the murmur of a great multitude the sound come from the direction of the river and be cause by multitude of human being who escape by the bridge of boat to the opposite side be desert the city which be so soon to fall into we hand _ September 20 _ -- after some sharp fighting and early on the morning of September 20 the lahore gate and garstin bastion which during former assault have cost we the life of so many man be take the column push on along the wall to the ajmir gate which also fall into we hand there be few defender at these place the mass of sepoy have evidently flee into the country and the troops march through the street almost without opposition there now remain but the palace selimgarh and the jama masjid and these be all occupy by we troops on that day the former seem almost desert a occasional shot from the high wall direct on we defence in the chandnus chauk be the only sign of animation in that quarter powder-bag be bring up and attach to the great gate which be quickly blow in and the 60th rifle with some goorkha rush into the enclosure a score or two of armed fanatic offer some resistance but they be soon shoot down or bayonet and a few wounded sepoy find in the building be put to death pass through the palace selimgarh be enter and this the last fortified position belong to the enemy be take possession of without a struggle meanwhile a force of cavalry under hodson move round outside the city wall and find a large camp of the enemy near the delhus gate this be desert save by some sick and wounded sepoy who be put to the sword and the horseman ride through the gate make they way into the heart of the city and take possession of the jama masjid without strike a blow delhus have at length fall into we hand and the toil and danger of more than three month be at a end the principal building be occupy by we troops and guard be place at each gate with order to prevent the ingress or egress of any suspicious-looking character while party of armed man patrol the street of the city from end to end that night we move back to we old quarter at ahmed ali khan 's house the 52nd take we place at the church the first-named building be a vast structure belong to a rich native and have be furnish in a style of oriental magnificence but now nothing but the bare wall and floor be to be see the place have be ransack of its treasure and completely gut since we last occupancy from September 15 to 20 when delhus fall the force lose in kill and wound about 200 officer and man make the total casualty 1400 include those of the day of assault from may 30 to September 13 inclusive 2490 officer and man be kill and wound the grand total be close on 4000 add to these fully 1200 who perish by cholera and other disease and it will be see at what a fearful cost of life to the small force engage the victory be win truly the capture of delhus be a feat of arm without a parallel in we indian annals the bravery of the man they indomitable pluck and resolution the siege carry on with dogged pertinacity and without a murmur proclaim to the world that british soldier in those stormy time when the fate of a empire be at issue have fully maintain the reputation of they ancestor and earn the gratitude of they country to I after the long interval of year the incident of the siege with its continual strife and ever-recurring danger come back to I as in a dream often in fancy have my mind wander back to those day of turmoil and excitement when man 's heart be agitate to they profoundest depths and we cause appear wellnigh hopeless then it be that a small body of man in a far-away part of north-west indium entirely separate from the rest of the world a few thousand amongst million of a alien race rally round they country 's banner and despair not though mutiny and rebellion range through the land with steadfast purpose and with heart that know no fear the delhus army hold its own for month against a overwhelming force of cruel and remorseless rebel imperfectly equip and with little knowledge of the danger to be surmount and the difficulty arise on every side each man of that force feel himself a host and devoted he energy -- nay he very life -- to meet the crisis none but those who be there can for one moment realize through what suffering and hardship the troops pass during the three month the siege of delhus last day after day under a burning sun or through the deadly time of the rainy season with pestilence in they midst distressing account from all part of the country and no hope of relief save through they own unaided exertion the soldier of the army before delhus fight with a courage and constancy which no difficulty could daunt and no trial however severe could overcome in the end these man wear out by exposure and diminish in number storm a strong fortified city defend by a vastly superior force and for six day carry on a constant fight in the street till the enemy be drive out of they stronghold and delhus be win it must also be remember that the feat be accomplish without the help of a single soldier from home reinforcement have arrive in the country but they be hundred of mile distant when the news reach they of the capture of delhus : and it be not too much to say that the success which follow the subsequent operation down-country be due mainly to the fact that all danger from the north-west have virtually cease and the mutiny have already receive a crush blow from the capture of the great city of rebellion -lrb- footnote 1 : lieutenant boileau 61st regiment serve in the battery till the end of the siege -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : be not the name of the engineer

course of service in indium scarcely any notice be take of they arrival there be no marching past before she majesty at windsor or elsewhere no public distribution of medal and reward no banquet give to the lead officer of the force and no record publish of the arduous duty in which they have be engage those time be change and the country have now rush into the opposite extreme of fulsome adulation make a laughing-stock of the army and cover with glory the conqueror in a ten day ' war wage against the wretched fellaheen soldier of egypt five year pass away after 1857 -lrb- and how many poor fellow have die in the meantime -rrb- before a mean and niggardly government distribute to the remnant of the delhus army the first instalment of prize-money and three year more elapse before the

quietest manner possible none but the officer and man of the regiment be present bear on a large tray into the midst of a square the medal be hand by a sergeant to each one entitle to the long-withheld decoration the adjutant meanwhile read out the name of the recipient there be no fuss or ceremony but i recollect that those present could not help contrast the scene with the grand parade and the presence of the queen when some of the crimean officer and man receive the numerous decoration so lavishly bestow for that campaign -lrb- 1 -rrb- the city be entirely in we possession by noon of September 20 and shortly after that hour i proceed on horseback with order from the colonel to withdraw all the advanced picket of my regiment to headquarters at ahmed ali khan 's house these be station in different part of the city and it be with no small difficulty that i threaded my way through the street and interminable narrow lane which be all block up with heap of broken furniture and rubbish that have be throw out of the house by we troops and form in place a almost impassable barrier not a soul be to be see all be still as death save now and then the sound of a musket-shot in the far-off quarter of the town my duty accomplish i start in the afternoon with two of we officer to view a portion of the city we make we way first in the direction of the palace pass down the chandnus chauk -lrb- silver street -rrb- and enter the great gate of the former imperial residence of the mogul emperor here a guard of the 60th rifle keep watch and ward with some of the jovial little goorkha of the kumaon battalion from the first we learn particulars of the easy capture of the palace that morning and be show the body of the fanatic who have dispute the entrance and have be kill in the enclosure none of they be sepoy but belong to that class of man call ghazus or champion of the faith man generally intoxicate with bhang who be to be find in every mohammedan army -- fierce madman devotee to death in the cause of religion pass on we wander through the court wonder at the vast size of this castellated palace with its towering embattled wall till we come to the dewan-i-kha and further on to the dewan-i-aum or hall of audience this last a large building of white marble on the battlements overhang the river jumna be now the headquarters of the general and he staff and where formerly the descendant of the great warrior tamerlane hold they court british officer have take up they abode and infidel desecrate those hall where only true believer have assemble for hundred of year pass thence through a gateway and over a swing bridge we enter the old fort of selimgarh build like the palace on the bank of the river its battlements as well as those of the latter place on its eastern side be wash by the water of the jumna several heavy gun and mortar be mount on the wall of the fort and we notice one old cannon of immense size for throw stone ball but which be crack at the muzzle and evidently have not be use for century the fort be full of large and commodious building use afterwards for hospital by we troops the place itself from its commanding situation open and separate from the rest of the city be the healthiest place that could be find there be a lovely view of the country on the left bank of the jumna while to the north and south we follow the winding of the broad river till lose to view in the far distance descend from selimgarh we take we stand on the bridge of boat now desert in its whole length but over which during the day of the siege thousand of mutineer have march to swell the rebel force in delhus thence we skirt along the bank of the river outside the wall view on we way the house of the european resident build in charming situation close to the water 's edge these have be all entirely destroy gut and burnt nothing but the bare wall be leave standing and the interior fill with heap of ash we think of the wretched fate of the former inmate of these house most of whom have be mercilessly kill by the city rabble urge on in they fiendish work by the native soldier of the regular army the mutineer of the 3rd light cavalry from meerut have enter delhus on may 11 cross the jumna by the bridge of boat and be join by the city scoundrel first wreak they vengeance on the european resident who live close by and who without any previous warning of the terrible fate in store for they fall easy victim to the murderer it make we blood run cold when visit the ruin of these house to think of the dastardly crime which have be commit in and around the spot on which we be stand defenceless and unarmed helpless in the hand of these human tiger we unfortunate man woman and child be immolate without mercy turn back we enter the city by the calcutta gate and walk along the rampart by the riverside past the wall of the magazine till we reach the water bastion here the destructive effect of we battery during the bombardment be most apparent fire at the distance of only 180 yard the gun have smash the wall and rampart to piece huge fragment have roll down into the ditch and the cannon in the battery be completely dismount from the carriage lie in confusion one on top of the other at the kashmir gate there be a heap of goods -lrb- consist principally of clothes and rubbish -rrb- many foot high which have be loot from the house around the guard at the gate have order to allow no one to pass out with a bundle of any kind and the consequence be a accumulation of material chiefly worthless which cover many square yard of ground i have omit all record of the plunder which up to this time and for long afterwards take place all over the city where we troops have penetrate this account i have reserve for the last chapter where full detail of the loot of delhus and the amount of prize-money accrue to the force will be find _ September 21 _ -- during the 21st i in company with other officer wander over the heart of the city continue we perambulation south of the chandnus chauk and penetrate into street beyond where the six day ' fighting have take place the night before we have hear occasional shot fire at no great distance and these be continue during the day and for some time afterwards looting be go on to a great extent both european and native soldier engage in the work and though strict order have be issue to prevent such licence it be find impossible to check the evil the shot emanate from these man who of course go about well armed and brook no interference when in the act of secure booty altercation of a serious nature have take place between the european and sikh soldier end sometimes in blow and often in bloodsh when the two party meet in a house or be busy employ in divide the spoil however in time when most of the native troops have leave delhus and the european regiment be quarter in walled enclosure with a guard at the gate to prevent egress the looting on the part of the private soldier cease and the prize agent be enable to gather in the enormous wealth of the city without any trouble the portion of the town we pass through on that day have be pillage to the fullest extent not content with ransack the interior of each house the soldier have break up every article of furniture and with wanton destruction have throw everything portable out of the window each street be fill with a mass of debris consist of household effect of every kind all lie in inextricable confusion one on top of the other form barricade -- from end to end of a street -- many foot high we enter several of the large house belong to the wealthier class of native and find every one in the same condition turn inside out they ornament tear to piece costly article too heavy to remove batter into fragment and a general air of desolation pervade each building much of this wholesale destruction be no doubt attributable to the action of the sepoy and rabble of the city who during the siege and in the state of anarchy which prevail during that period have loot to they heart ' content levy blackmail on the richer inhabitant and pursue they evil course without let or hindrance still that which have escape the plunder and devastate hand of the sepoy be most effectually ruin by we man not a single house or building remain intact and the damage do must have amount to thousand of pound we be quite alone in most street desert and silent they resemble a city of the dead on which some awful catastrophe have fall it be difficult to realize that we be pass through what have be only a few day before the abode of thousand of people what have become of they and by what magic influence have all disappear not till day afterwards be the mystery solve the _ tai-khanas _ or underground room of house scatter all over the city be find to be fill with human being -- those who by age or infirmity have be unable to join in the general exodus which have take place during the last day of the siege hundred of old man woman and child be find huddle together half starve in these place the most wretched-looking object i ever see there be no means of feed they in the city where they presence also would have raise a plague and many would have die so by the order of the general they be turn out of the gate of delhus and escort into the country it be a melancholy sight see they troop out of the town hundred pass through the lahore gate every day for a whole week we be tell that provision have be collect for they use at a place some mile distant and it be to be hope the poor creature be save from starvation but we have we doubt on the subject and know how callous with regard to human suffer the authority have become i fear that many perish from want and exposure there be other object also which raise feeling of pity in we mind during we walk through the street we catch sight of dozen of cat and tame monkey on the roof of the house look at we with most woe-begone countenance the latter chatter with fear these as well as bird of every description leave behind in cage by they owner on they flight literally starve to death in the house and street of the city there be no food for such as these and it be lamentable to think of the torture and suffer the poor pet creature endure till death put a end to they misery dead body of sepoy and city inhabitant lay scatter in every direction poisoning the air for many day and raise a stench which be unbearable these in time be almost all clear away by the native scavenger but in some distant street corpse lay rot in the sun for week and during my ride on duty when station at the ajmir gate i often come across a dead body which have escape search on the afternoon of the 21st a most important capture be effect by hodson shah bahadoor shah the old king of delhus be take by that officer near the city while endeavor to escape down-country hodson with he accustomed daring and

condition in which he be place on another bed three foot from the king sit the officer on guard while two stalwart european sentry with fix bayonet stand on either side the order give be that on any attempt at a rescue the officer be immediately to shoot the king with he own hand -lrb- illustration : king of delhus as a prisoner in 1857 -rrb- -lrb- from a photograph take from a pencil sketch by

transport beyond the sea die in british burmah before he could be remove to the andaman island where in accordance with he sentence he be to have remain in imprisonment for the term of he natural life the vicissitude of fortune numberless as be the instance among man of royal birth can scarcely show anything more suggestive of the transitoriness of earthly pomp and grandeur than the case of the last king of delhus spring from the line of the great conqueror tamerlane the lineal descendant of the magnanimous akbar and of shah jehan the magnificent he end he day as a common felon far from the country of he ancestor unwept for and unhonoured _ September 22 _ -- lieutenant hodson also on the 22nd take prisoner at a place some mile from delhus the two eldest son and the grandson of the king these man more especially the eldest who be commander-in-chief of the rebel army have be deeply implicate in the murder of may 11 have urge on the sepoy and populace in they cruel deed and be present at the terrible massacre of we people which take place in the chandnus chauk on that day hodson 's order be precise as to the fate of these blood-thirsty ruffian and though he name have be vilify and he reputation tarnish by so-called humanitarian for the course he adopt in rid the world of the miscreant he be uphold in the deed by the whole delhus army man in every respect better qualify to form a judgment in this particular than the sentimental being at home who denounce with horror this perfectly justifiable act of speedy and condign punishment the three prince be place in a _ gharee _ or native carriage and guard by hodson 's native trooper be conduct towards the city before they enter the carriage be stop and hodson speak to he man of the crime commit by the prisoner then dismount from he horse and open the door of the _ gharee _ he fire two shot from a colt 's revolver into each of they heart after be drive to the kotwalus or chief magistrate 's house in the center of the chandnus chauk on the very spot where we country man and woman have suffer death the three body be strip save a rag around the loin and lay naked on the stone slab outside the building here i see they that same afternoon nor can it be say that i or the other who view the lifeless remains feel any pity in we heart for the wretch on whom have fall a most righteous retribution for they crime the eldest be a strong well-knit man in the prime of life the next somewhat younger while the third be quite a youth not more than twenty year of age each of the prince have two small bullet-hole over the region of the heart the flesh singe by gunpowder as the shot be fire close a cloth cover part of the loin but they be otherwise quite naked there be a guard i think of coke 's rifle station at the kotwalus and there the body remain expose for three day and be then bury in dishonoured grave on the 22nd the regiment or what be leave of it comprise about 180 effective rank and file move from ahm alus khan 's house to the ajmir gate at the extreme south-western side of the city a distance of a mile and a half from we former residence here we put up in a large seraus with open courtyard in the center shaded by high tree the small room on each side of the building be turn into quarter for the man the officer take up they abode in a mosque at the far end the change be far from agreeable fly and mosquito swarm around we the ditch outside the wall be fill with pool of stagnant water and a horrible stench impregnate the air increase the sickness among the already enfeebled soldier and still further reduce we scanty number _ September 23 _ -- the next day i start with d -- of my regiment to view the jama masjid or great mosque nothing can exceed the rich though chaste beauty of this glorious structure the building stand in a large walled enclosure high broad step lead up to the mosque with its three dome of pure white marble and floor of the same material all inlay with figure we ascend one of the minaret about 120 foot high obtain a grand view of the imperial city and the surrounding country to the south extend the ruin of ferozebad or ancient delhus to the east lay the river jumna and to the west and north stretch a forest of tree and garden among which be see the suburb of the city the now historic ridge in the far distance hide the whole camp from we view from we elevated position a just estimate could be form of the great size of delhus : the city lay spread out below with its vast area of street its palace mosque and temple all silent and desert in striking contrast to the din and turmoil of a few day back major coke 's corps of punjab rifle be quarter in the masjid -- a luxurious place of residence -- but there be no worshipper to be find in the sacred building and only armed man of a infidel creed be to be see a report spread at this time that it have be decide to blow up the mosque i can not vouch for the truth of this statement and can only attribute the rumor to a belief that a large ransom would be pay by the mohammedan population of indium for the preservation of they temple have the authority really intend to carry out the project its destruction would have be a act of vandalism quite at variance with the character of the british nation and one which would have bring down on we the wrath and contempt of the whole civilized world from the jama masjid we wander through narrow lane and back-slum -- the former resort of the worst character in the city -- to the delhus and turkoman gate the street as in other part be strew with property from the wreck house and wellnigh impassable we see party of european and native soldier all eager in the pursuit of plunder go from house to house or diving down court and alley when they see we approach interference or remonstrance with these man would have be useless if not dangerous in they excited state they be no respecter of person and we deem it the better judgment to take no notice of they action dead body lay in almost every street rot in the burning sun and the effluvium be sickening so that we be glad to make we way back to the ajmir gate to a less poisonous atmosphere a movable column of 2500 man of all arm start on the morning of the 23rd in pursuit of the rebel take the direction to cawnpore my regiment have be detail for this service and though numerically weak and suffer from sickness the officer and man hail with pleasure the approach departure from delhus but unfortunately for we the colonel in command report we sick and unfit to march we be all to a man furious at this everyone fit for duty be willing heart and soul to be send wherever the exigency of the war require and more especially look forward with delight to the prospect of serve under sir colin campbell in whose brigade the regiment have fight in the punjab campaign of 1848-49 still the decision of the responsible officer be not to be dispute and so the regiment be keep at delhus on the 25th i mount guard with fifty man at the lahore gate the order be on no account to allow soldier either european or native nor camp-follower without pass to enter or leave the city my post be constantly at the gate where i examine pass and while thus occupy some thirty trooper of the mooltani horse -- wild truculent-looking fellow arm to the tooth -- ride up demand entrance i explain to they what my order be and refuse admission whereupon they commence talk among themselves and presently have the audacity to move towards the sentry with the intention of force they way i be exasperate beyond measure and turn out the guard at the same time tell the mooltani that if they do not at once retire i would fire upon they without more ado they then at once change they threatening attitude contented themselves with swearing at the _ gore log _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- and ride away say that now nicholson be dead no one care for they and they would return to they home these man have be newly raise be scarcely under proper discipline and be certainly horrible-looking bandit and cut-throat -- very different from the sikh and punjabi horseman who be in manner and discipline all that could be desire i know that the mooltani only desire entrance into the city to participate in the looting which be still go on and have they be allow to indulge in a work for which by they evil countenance they seem well adapt collision would have take place between they and the english soldier and other and bloodshed would have be the result shortly after the mooltani horseman ride away i see a party of goorkha come towards the gate they be stroll along quite unconcernedly laughing and chat together with they hand in they pocket and quite unarmed not even carry they favorite _ kukri _ come to where i be stand just outside the gate they laughingly ask I to allow they to take a stroll down the chandnus chauk and through a part of the city for a short time my order be imperative and i tell they so whereat they say they belong to the sirmoor battalion -- the gallant regiment which in conjunction with the 60th rifle have defend the right of we position throughout the siege the corps be still station at they old quarter at hindoo rao 's house and not one of they up to this time have enter delhi naturally they say they wish to see the city promise most faithfully that they would refrain from looting and return to the lahore gate in a hour 's time i find i could not resist the importunity of these brave little fellow and trust to they honor at last consent though contrary to order to grant they admission we watch they walk along the chandnus chauk stare in wonder at all they see till lose in the distance punctual to the time mention the goorkha return and thank I for my courtesy make they way to they old quarter on the ridge during my tour on duty on this occasion at the lahore gate upward of 500 of the delhi populace be turn out of the city they extend in a long string up the chandnus chauk decrepit old man and woman with group of young child it be a pitiable sight draw forth exclamation of sympathy even from the rough soldier on guard it have be bring to the notice of the general that some of the former inhabitant of delhus include sepoy be in the habit of enter the city for the purpose of carry away valuable be draw up by rope hold by confederate on the wall and that many have also escape in the darkness by the same means several capture have already be make a strict watch be order to be keep at the several gate and patrolling party to march at interval outside the wall the day i be on guard at the lahore gate hodson ride up to I from the outside and say he have see some native on the wall close by evidently attempt to escape into the country i immediately send round a corporal and four soldier in the direction indicate who presently return with six native -- carry bundle -- whom they have make prisoner all man thus capture be send to the governor of the city at the kotwallus who dispose of they as he think fit have the power of life and death in these matter the governor have the repute of be over-indulgent with regard to the disposal of the captive be consider too merciful in he treatment of man who for aught he know have forfeit they life in join the armed rebellion against we authority a striking instance of the feeling which animated officer and man in the troublous time take place some time afterwards at delhus a officer of my regiment be on guard at the ajmir gate and on one occasion send to the governor some man whom he have capture while they be in the act of escape from the city these man be release but on a second occasion three man be take and the officer deem it useless to forward they for punishment to the usual authority call out a file of he soldier place the prisoner in the ditch outside the ajmir gate shoot they and then digging a hole bury they at the place of execution for a long period after the capture of delhus execution by hang be of common occurrence in the city and the hand of the old provost-sergeant be full disguised sepoy and inhabitant take with arm in they possession have short shrift and be at once consign to the gallows a batch of ten one day suffer death opposite the kotwalus in the beginning of October two more reputed son of the old king be shoot by sentence of court-martial they have command regiment of the rebel army and be foremost in the revolt even join in the massacre of we people the 60th rifle and some goorkha form the firing party and take strange to say such bad aim that the provost-sergeant have to finish the work by shoot each culprit with a pistol nothing could have be more ill-favoured and dirty than the wretched victim but they meet they fate in silence and with the most dogged composure _ September 28 _ -- accompany by we adjutant and some other officer i ride out to taliwarra and kishenganj on September 28 these suburb be a mass of ruin but enough be leave intact to show the immense strength of the enemy 's position at the former place battery have be erect at every available spot strongly fortify and entrench and one in particular which have rake the right of we position be perfect in every detail and be guard by a ditch or rather _ nallah _ forty foot deep we pass through the large caravanserai the scene of the conflict during the memorable sortie of July 9 and when in the course of we inspection in the enclosure a ludicrous event occur a officer who have be shoot through the leg on that day recognize the place where he have receive he wound dismount from he horse and stand on the very spot he be in the act of explain event and describe he sensation when shoot when suddenly he make a jump in the air utter a cry of pain and commence rub he leg first one and then the other we burst into laughter at the antic of we friend who we imagine have be seize with a fit of madness quite at variance with he usual quiet demeanor and jokingly ask he what be the matter still writhe with pain and engage in he involuntary saltatory exercise he point to a swarm of wasp which rouse from they nest on which he have be stand cover he lower extremity and have make they way inside he pantaloons sting he on both leg and crawl up he body the pain must have be intense and fully account for he gymnastics and frantic effort to crush the insect it be some day before he recover from the wound he have receive far more painful -- as he aver -- than the enemy 's bullet i intimate at the time to my friend that the wasp probably be the ghost of the sepoy who have be kill in the seraus they body by the transmigration of soul have take the shape of these malignant insect in order to wreak vengeance on they destroyer he however do not seem to relish my interpretation of this very singular event and in fact be incline to resent what he call my ill-timed jesting but the story spread and we poor friend become for some time afterwards the butt and laughing-stock of the regiment from kishenganj we ride through the sabzus mandus garden visit we old picket there and at the crow 's nest and then proceed up the slope of the ridge to hindoo rao 's house this be still garrison by the sirmoor battalion of goorkha some of whom escort we round the place point out the different position they have so gallantly defend the house be knock to piece the wall show evidence of the enemy 's fire and reveal to we the truth of the say in camp that these hardy little fellow with the 60th rifle during more than three month have be constantly expose night and day to shot and shell there not be a single part of they quarter where complete shelter could be find the observatory close to hindoo rao 's house have also feel the effect of the enemy 's shot while midway between the observatory and the flagstaff tower the mosque -- the only other building on the ridge -- be also in ruin we battery nine in number lay in a comparatively small compass extend about three-quarter of a mile from the crow 's nest in the right rear to wilson 's battery opposite the observatory the rest of the ridge be unprotected by gun in position it be at so great a distance from the city and also free from the enemy 's attack the only danger and annoyance arise from occasional shell which reach the camp and explode amongst the tent from round-shot and from rocket fire pass by the flagstaff tower we ride through the old camp now desolate and silent visit the grave of we poor fellow at the cemetery and then retrace we step enter delhus by the kashmir gate and return to we quarter cholera still continue its ravages among the small number of troops leave in delhus the reaction from a life of strife and excitement to the dull existence we be now lead have its effect on the man and we each day lament more and more that we have not go with the movable column leave the noisome smell the increase sickness and the monotony of delhus behind two thousand sick and wound have be move into the fort of selimgarh where the pure air and open situation of the place soon make a marked change in the number of invalid : but disease be rife among the regiment quarter in the city and convalescent from selimgarh be soon replace by man suffer from cholera and fever ague in the beginning of October to we intense delight we move from the ajmir gate that sink of corruption and take up we quarter in the magazine the officer here occupy a fine roomy building of two story while the man be house in comfortable shed round the enclosure we still furnished guard at the ajmir and lahore gate the term of duty through paucity of man for relief extend over three day the officer on guard at the former gate visit detachment and sentry at the delhus and turkoman gate a distance of a mile and a half through street in which dead body in the last stage of decomposition be still lie while one day engage on this duty i pass a carcass on which some pariah dog be make a meal disgust at the sight and weak in stomach from the putrid air i return to my tent at the ajmir gate at the time when my servant arrive with my dinner from the magazine i ask he what he have bring I and be answer liver and bacon the nauseating sight i have just witness recur to my memory vision of diseased and putrid liver rise before my view and unable to control myself i be seize with a fit of sickness which prostrate I for some time after nothing of importance occur during the month of October we settle into a very quiet life at the magazine vary by eternal guard-mounting at the different gate of the city and regimental drill my health have be fail for some time and now that there seem no immediate prospect of employment on active service i gladly acquiesce in the doctor 's advice that i should proceed to umballah on sick leave _ November 8 _ -- accordingly i leave delhus on November 8 my destination be

exquisite sense of humor as well as of bitter satire write upon the wall of the palace where he regiment be quarter the follow appropriate sentence : delhus take and indium save for 36 rupee 10 anna it be say that the governor-general demand the name of this waggish soldier with the intention that he might receive punishment for he daring effrontery but it be needless to say that the author of the joke remain unknown save to a few of he comrade and the great ruler of hindostan be force to rest content and ponder over the hidden sarcasm and bitter irony address to one in he exalted position the army be further promise by the government 5 per cent on the whole amount of the prize-money till the amount should be pay this during the many year which elapse before the money be distribute would have reach a large sum but faith be break and the sum repudiate -- another instance of want of gratitude to soldier who look to maintain they country 's honor in time of war be in peace and when danger be at a end soon forget so prolonged also be the delay in payment of the prize-money that i recollect the time in reference to this subject about 1860 or 1861 have a leading article in its column recommend the delhus army to bring a action against the government for the payment of the prize such action of course would have be without precedent but it show the feeling of many in the country when the lead journal think right to draw attention to the subject with a view to the adjustment of the army 's rightful claim to return to general wilson 's order of September 7 notice be circulate throughout the camp in every brigade and regiment call on the troops to elect prize agent for gathering and receive prize after the capture of the city these prize agent therefore be select by the army one for the general and field officer the second for the queen 's service of all rank below that of major and the third for the company 's army the officer appoint include captain fagan and after he death doctor inne sir edward campbell of the 60th rifle and captain wriford of the 1st bengal fusilier be all most popular man and consider in every way fit for the very important duty they have to perform on September 14 the day of assault till the 20th when delhus be completely in we possession much looting take place in the city we troops both european and native and especially the sikh enter house during those day and manage to secrete about they person article of value to my certain knowledge also many soldier of the english regiment get possession of jewellery and gold ornament take from the body of the slay sepoy and city inhabitant and i be show by man of my regiment string of pearl and gold mohur which have fall into they hand on the day of assault we be much amuse during a slight cessation of the conflict by one of we man rush up to a group of officer in a state of great excitement with the news that there be a buggy with two horse stand at the corner of a street close by he offer the prize to anyone who would give he a bottle of rum but in the then state of affair no one feel inclined to burden himself with such a luxury and the poor fellow go away much disappointed whether he succeed in dispose of the prize i do not know but when thing quiet down and the regiment be station in comfortable quarter one of we officer note for he constant impecuniosity appear one day drive a buggy and two horse the acquisition of which always remain a secret nor would he on be question throw any light on the matter that many of the private soldier of my regiment succeed in acquire a great quantity of valuable plunder be fully demonstrate soon after we arrival in england a unusual number of non-commissioned officer and man buy they discharge have during three year keep possession of the plunder acquire at delhus await a favourable opportunity for the sale of the article many jeweller ' shop in the town in which we be quarter expose for sale in the window ornament and trinket of unmistakable eastern workmanship which on inquiry we be tell have be buy from the man it would have be contrary to human nature and utterly at variance with the predatory instinct have the soldier fail to take advantage of the facility for plunder which surround they on every side nor could it be expect that a man after possess himself of valuable would at once or on the first favourable opportunity deliver up he booty to the properly-constituted authority this much may be concede and it will therefore not be a subject of wonder that all rank of the delhus force with but few exception avail themselves of the prize within they reach and appropriate to they own use much treasure which ought to have go towards swell the general fund one officer in command of a native regiment quarter he corps in a house which formerly belong to one of the richest prince in the city of delhus the place be full of riches of every kind and it be the popular belief at the time throughout the army that the officer in question succeed in obtain two lakh of rupee rumor also say that a court of inquiry would be hold to investigate the truth or otherwise of this report but if such have be contemplate it fall to the ground nor be any attempt make to induce the officer to disgorge he plunder i pay a visit to this mansion some time afterwards and can vouch for the thorough ransack the place have receive every room in the house have be pillage excavation have be make in the floor and empty box lay in every direction other case similar to that just mention be know to we at the time in which sum of money be appropriate only a little smaller in amount while of those which reach the value of # 100 they name be legion many man also there be who at first sway by moral scruple as well as feeling reluctant to disobey the order which have be issue refrain from looting on they own account but when they see that officer even of the higher rank take possession of plunder these scruple be cast to the wind -- it be every man for himself and the d -- l take the hindmost and a general desire be evince for each to enrich himself with the prize lie at he foot often when wander through the city in pursuit of plunder i in company with other come across officer engage in the same quest as ourselves these rencontre be most amusing give rise to mutual interrogation and many joke each party affirm that looting be not the object of they perambulation but that they be only inspect the house out of a feeling of curiosity up to this time i have not succeed in find any article of value nor have i the remotest idea that my acquaintance with a certain officer in the employ of the prize agent would put I in the way of acquire a fair amount of the loot of delhus a few silver ornament and a small bag of sicca rupee be all that i have so far obtain and i naturally feel desirous of increase my store more especially when it be well know that many officer more fortunate and less scrupulous have already make themselves master of large quantity of valuable plunder the accumulation of prize by the agent begin shortly after delhus be take at first the article obtain be of little worth comprise chiefly wear apparel of every description and household goods soon however more costly effect be find by the searcher and in a very short time the room of the prize agent be fill with treasure of every kind -- jewellery and precious stone diamond ruby emerald and pearl without number from those as large as hen 's egg to the small species use for necklace gold ornament chain of the most beautiful workmanship bracelet and bangle all of solid metal there be heap also of the small thick native coin know as gold mohur thousand of which be accumulate by the prize agent and help most materially to swell the amount i visit one room the long table in which literally groan with the riches of ormuz and of ind -- a dazzling sight to the eye and one calculate to raise the spirit of greed in my breast to possess myself of some of the treasure so temptingly expose to view when quiet return and the inhabitant of the city begin to flock back to they former home whole street in which no doubt treasure have be conceal and have escape the search of the prize agent be sell to the people for sum range from 5000 to 50000 rupee all this help to increase the prize to a sum which be variously estimate at from half to three-quarter of a million sterling and even then it be assert that only a portion of the vast wealth of delhus have be find as far as i know the government when distribute the prize-money in two installment -- in 1862 and again in 1865 -- give no account of the total amount which have be collect the private soldier 's share be reckon as the unit value about # 17 increase accord to the pay of the different rank -- the ensign five share lieutenant six and a half captain eleven and a half and so in proportion among the higher grade of officer while that of the commander-in-chief amount to one-sixteenth of the whole -- a immense sum there be of course many exaggeration as to how much each rank would receive as its share and there be many heart-burning also when the true amount become know the sum have dwindle down to less than one-third of what we expect and not a few express openly they conviction that some tamper have take place with regard to the distribution this can hardly be believe though it have always be a notorious fact that the government be incline to treat the claim of those who fight they battle with neglect and in one particular at least by repudiate the 5 per cent promise till the delhus prize-money be pay they act up to they usual unjust policy and give occasion for the complaint which be raise at the time i will now proceed to give a account of my experience when act as a assistant to a officer who be accredit by the prize agent with a permit to search for plunder this officer a old friend of mine ask I to accompany he on he expedition say also that he have no objection to my help myself in moderation to part of the loot which we might happen to find carry with we the necessary tool such as hammer spade and pickax we each day start -- accompany by two coolie -- on we plunder excursion for some day we be very unsuccessful and for nearly a week only manage to gather together and transmit to the agent article of little value but soon gain experience from continue practice and take note of the different house in which there be a likelihood of find prize we settle down to a systematic course of search which in the end prove highly remunerative scarcely anything of value be find lie about the different room these have be already gut and the contents destroy by the soldier both european and native who since the day of assault have roam about the city at the time we begin we search all be comparatively quiet and during we operation such be the vast extent of the city and so numerous the building that only on two or three occasion be we interrupt by party engage in the same quest as ourselves my companion be a good hindustanus scholar and take advantage of he proficiency in the language he make a point of interview several native of the city who in the capacity of workman in different trade be allow in delhus and be employ in they several occupation from one of these a mason and builder n -- receive information that a large quantity of treasure be conceal in the house of a former rich resident this man have help to secrete the hoard and on the promise of a small reward be willing to help we in unearth the booty one morning in the beginning of October attend by the mason and carry the necessary implement we be take to the house in question this be a large building with a courtyard in the center the room of which show the remains of luxury and wealth but as usual have be despoil by the plunderer of we army every article be scatter about in dire confusion there be pile of clothing and bedding rich and ornamental stuff be tear to piece and the household furniture break up be strew about the courtyard we guide take we to a small room about 80 foot square -- in fact it be the closet of the establishment -- the wall of which be whitewash the floor be cover with a hard cement here we be tell the treasure be conceal under the flooring of the room and we lose no time in commence operation the mason assist we pick through the cement we come on a large flagstone which we lift out of the cavity then we dig a hole about 3 foot square and the same depth in the loose earth disclose the mouth of a large earthenware _ gharra _ or jar loosen the soil all around we attempt to raise the jar out of the ground but all we effort be unavailing -- its great weight prevent we from lift it one inch out of the bed then tremble with excitement for we feel sure that a rich display would greet we eye we begin slowly to remove each article from the _ gharra _ and place it on the floor of the room a heavy bag lie at the mouth of the jar be first take out and on open it and afterwards count its contents we find that it contain 700 native gold mohur worth nearly # 1200 then come dozen of gold bangle or anklet of pure metal such as those worn by dancing-girls we be fairly bewildered at the sight we hand tremble and we eye ablaze with excitement for such a amount of pure gold as that already discover we have never see before but the treasure be not yet half exhaust the jar seem a perfect mine of wealth -- gold chain plain and of filigree workmanship each worth from # 10 to # 30 ornament of the same metal of every sort of design and execute in a style for which the delhus jeweller be celebrate all over indium then come small silver casket fill with pearl together to the number of more than 200 each worth from # 3 to # 4 pierce for string other contain small diamond ruby and emerald and the greatest prize of all -- recline in a casket by itself -- a large diamond which be sell afterwards by the prize agent for # 1000 there be many other article of value besides those i have mention -- gold ring and tiara inlay with precious stone nose-ring of the kind worn by woman through the nostril earring bracelet and necklace of small pearl without number all these various article we spread out on the floor of the room examine each again and again and with avaricious thought intent lament that we be not allow to appropriate what would have be to we a fortune truly such a temptation to enrich themselves without fear of detection be never till this occasion set before two impecunious subaltern of the british army here spread out before we lay loot to the value of thousand of pound all we own be we to follow the example of some who have already feathered they nest with much larger amount defy those in authority to take the plunder from they however such a course could not be entertain for one moment and moreover be we to possess ourselves of all the contents of the jar there be no secure place of concealment to be find and unpleasant inquiry and prying eye would soon have reveal to the world we abduction of the booty it be impossible to do more than guess at the value of the plunder acquire on this day my friend receive a reward for the find as for myself i will leave it to my reader whether it be possible for weak human nature to resist the temptation of carry away some few memento from this miscellaneous collection of treasure-trove to tell the truth i must confess that in after time my only regret be that i have foolishly let slip a opportunity of enrich myself which could never recur we agree -- and in this we be bear out by the prize agent -- that # 7000 be the lowest sum at which to compute the loot we have find it be my invariable custom to wear as a kammerband or girdle fold of muslin round my waist for the protection of the liver and spleen and in this i place the article i carry away my friend procure a small cart in which he deposit the loot and drive to the house of one of the agent while i encumber as i be with difficulty mount my horse and ride towards the magazine i could not but feel nervous and abashed when think of the riches conceal about my person at last work myself up to such a pitch of excitement that i imagine all i meet be cognizant of my good fortune and on enter the gate of the magazine i fancied i hear one of we man say to he comrade well that fellow at any rate have plenty of loot about he we next great find though by no means so lucrative as the first bring a large accession to the prize fund it occur to I through call to recollection the story of the treasure conceal in the hindoo idol at somnath which be break open by sultan mahmoud in the eleventh century that possibly the same kind of receptacle might disclose a like prize though on a smaller scale among the numerous temple scatter through the city of delhus act on this idea we one day enter a small hindoo temple situate not far from the chandnus chauk the shrine be gaudily decorate but after a prolonged search we find nothing of any value a hideous idol stand on a raise structure in the center of the building and be soon demolish in iconoclastic style with we hammer the base of the idol be form of _ chunam _ -lrb- a kind of cement -rrb- and into this we dig with we small pickax soon a ring sound from a blow disclose a large silver casket imbed in the _ chunam _ and this after some little trouble we extricate from its position force the casket open we sight be regale by a brilliant show of jewel and gold -- diamond ruby and emerald -- two of the latter species be uncut but of great size pearl larger than any we have yet see and gold ornament of every description chain bracelet bangle and a few gold mohur we be quite alone in the temple and after feast we eye on the treasure and select a few object for we own benefit n -- take the casket to the prize agent tell he where we have find it and recommend a search in such locality which recommendation no doubt be carry into effect among other hindoo temple in the city when first enter a house during we search we at once make ourselves acquaint with the creed of its former inhabitant in this there be no difficulty -- koran lie about the floor denote that the occupant have be mussulman while many indication such as idol a different arrangement of the furniture and other sign with which we become conversant prove the influence of the rival hindoo race there be a very cogent reason for this investigation on we part -- the mohammedan invariably in secrete they valuable place they in the ground under the floor of they house the hindoo on the other hand always hide they in receptacle in the wall of the building arm with this knowledge we use to sound either the floor or the wall of each house accord as the place belong to one or the other creed nor in one single instance as far as i can remember be we at fault in we diagnosis a favorite hiding-place for valuable be behind the staircase the treasure be conceal in a sort of vault build around with brick and cement on one occasion in the house of a money-changer we demolish a secret place of this kind and discover four large bag fill with some heavy metal feeling convince we should find that the bag contain at the least rupee we open one and to we infinite disgust see that the contents consist of copper piece call pice of which there be many thousand the bag however be take to the prize agent but i need scarcely say we hand on that day at least be not soil by appropriate a portion of the plunder on several occasion we succeed in find large store of money chiefly sicca or native rupee while in the house of hindoo in portion of the wall which sound hollow under the blow of the hammer we after make a hole sufficiently large for the passage of a hand constantly bring to light large store of silver ornament consist of chain bracelet etc amounting in the aggregate to a barrowful few house there be that do not furnish after a diligent search either in the floor or wall some article of value but on only one occasion after the successful venture in the two first case be the amount of loot in any way comparable to that which we obtain on those day in a very secluded part of the city in a large house surround by wretched tenement inhabit by the lowest class we open a door and to we amazement enter a room furnish in the european fashion this also have not escape the marauding and destructive hand of party of plunderer the furniture be smash and the contents of the room strew about the floor there be english chair curtain ottoman cover with antimacassar sofa and broken mirror and in the corner a small piano ruin and destroy the house have evidently belong to some rich native but who have be the occupant of this boudoir for such it be -- a miniature drawing-room fill with european luxury not except book and copy of music article of a lady 's apparel also lay about tear in shred vase be on the mantelpiece as well as a small box fill with english fancy needlework we come to the conclusion that the mistress of this abode must have be a eurasian lady probably one of the zenana of the master of the house who during the exodus from the city have flee with or be forcibly carry away by she protector a dismal mishap occur to I in this room choose a comfortable-looking ottoman i sit down little dream that i have fall into a trap which would occasion much laughter among my friend for day to come feel a strange moist sensation in a certain portion of my body i jump up from the seat to find to my horror that i have plump down on a quantity of ghee or clarify butter a jar of ghee be lie on the floor and a portion of this horrible mess have be spill on the seat of the ottoman i be dress in white trousers and jacket of the same material and find to my intense disgust that the ghee have leave a large patch of color which no amount of rub would eradicate we be far from we quarter it be broad daylight and to my mortification i be compel to walk thus brand through the street of the city the laughing-stock of those who see the plight i be in delhus be celebrate for miniature painting do on talc hundred of which be find at this time some be of rare workmanship portrait of beautiful woman and drawing of celebrated building all execute in a style of art peculiar to the craftsman of that place we be fortunate during we search in come across the house of one of these artist and disinter from its concealment a box full of these painting they afterwards sell at a good price and i possess myself of some twenty of the most beautiful comprise portrait of zeenat mahal the favorite wife of the king other lady of the zenana and picture of the taj and jama masjid besides other mosque throughout indium these oval-shaped miniature mount in gold form most acceptable souvenir of the city of delhus and one in particular contain the portrait of a lovely eastern face with head-dress and tiara of diamond and string of pearl round the neck i be offer # 20 for after it have be set in gold by a jeweller at plymouth in london in 1858 there be a great demand for gold ornament and jewellery from delhus so much so that a note goldsmith offer I the highest price for article of that description nor would he at first -- till convince -- accept my assurance that i have part with all my delhus loot before leave indium we be occupy for nearly three week in we quest for plunder engage in the exciting work almost every day and seldom fail to find some article of value we last adventure in that line deserve a detailed description for though the nature of the loot obtain be such that it be useless to appropriate for we own use any of the goods find still the value of the plunder increase to a large extent the delhus prize-money we have notice in the room of the agent pile of kincob or cloth of gold worth i fear to say how many rupee a yard the manufacture of this material be carry on to a great extent in delhus there be much demand for the rich and costly fabric among the prince and noble of hindostan hitherto in we rambling through the house we have only come across a few piece of this gold brocade but as luck would have it on the last day in which i join n -- in he duty he have receive information from a native that a large store of kincob be conceal in the house of a merchant who have deal in that material the man guide we to the house in question but after search in every imaginable place no sign of the gold cloth could be find from the name of the merchant and certain other well-known indication we feel convinced that he goods be conceal underground and we commence tap the floor of the largest room with we hammer presently in the very center of the apartment there come a hollow sound and digging down about a foot we find a trap-door this be lift disclose a wooden staircase lead down to what seem to we a apartment conceal in cimmerian darkness light the wax candle we always carry about with we we for some distance descend the step which seem to lead into the bowels of the earth the room turn out to be about twenty foot square and ten foot high and range around pile one on top of the other be score of large box one of these we open and find it to contain kincob of the rarest kind other that we look into be full of the same gorgeous material and we come to the conclusion that here spread about there be a treasure the value of which amount to a lakh of rupee four large cart be load with the box and take to the prize agent the contents sell afterwards for a very large sum and thus end in a most successful find my connection with the loot of delhus though many year have elapse the event of those three week seem as vivid in my memory as though they have happen yesterday -- the brightness of the jewel the dazzling gold the nerve work to the highest pitch of tension while wait in eager expectation for the result of a search these episode of my life appear more like a fairytale or a legend of the arabian night than true history and sober reality what opportunity of accumulate a small fortune be throw in my way the treasure lay at my foot only want to be pick up and many will say that i be a fool not to take advantage of the prize i can however certainly aver that i show great moderation in possess myself of only a small portion of the plunder -- the amount i appropriate be but a infinitesimal part of the delhus prize money it be very unlikely that delhus or any other rich city in indium will be give over to sack and pillage during this generation but the remembrance of the day of 1857 and of the traditional wealth of the country still exist amongst the nation of the east and only recently during the scare arise out of the russian occupation of merv it be state that the turkoman now feudatory of that empire cast longing eye on hindostan where gold and diamond could be pick up in the street of the large city during my stay at umballah i make arrangement with a officer of the civil service for the sale of the loot i have bring from delhus he entrust the commission to one of he native writer who execute the work in a satisfactory manner though the price i receive be hardly equal to the amount i have anticipate to my friend 's wife i give a filigree gold chain of beautiful workmanship and of such length that it reach six time round the neck also a tiara of precious stone while i also present some pearl and gold mohur there be no doubt that have i bring the whole of my plunder home to england the price obtain for it would have be far in excess of what i receive at umballah but the risk of transportation be too great i fear also the chance of robbery and the anxiety attach to carry about with I so many article of value index afghan : they want of bravery at the siege of delhus ahm alus
