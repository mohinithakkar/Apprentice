will be twenty-one birthday -- much too old to come to school -- when dolly be ten birthday you can tell you father the teacher like the indian child come to school when they be very short so they can

very indian-minded but he tell I i do not know white from indian lucinda be so sad she will not try she look so horrid -- dolly too -- i be much ashamed of they i shall not speak to they before the white visitor and the teacher -- only down at camp then you will be very wrong say cordelium run bird i would not be ashamed to speak to my own people anywhere ee you talk so good because you father wear a grand policeman 's coat and trousers and you mother 's head be in a hood say hannah straight tree excitedly my father wear a very funny indian clothes and feather in he hair and my big sister 's head be in a shawl all the girl will say on christmas ` susie look just like a fairy in the jack frost song we shall give she very lot of candy from we christmas bag ' dolly know the jack frost motion i teach she and she do they with the child down at camp but i shall not tell the teacher for dolly have no pretty thing to wear that be why i will not let she play the game if my father see she in the jack frost song and game he would be glad she be so smart and just like he would let she come to school but you would be so sorry if my big and little sister come to school you think susie be a skin-white girl and dolly be a very copper-colored indian you do not speak true be the denial i should not be sorry and i do not think susie be a skin-white girl she be very copper-colored too but you do not wish dolly would be in the jack frost song and wear a red dress just like susie 's challenge hannah straight tree disconcert she companion with the pierce gaze habitual to she race though not quite innocent of all the charge lay to she cordelium run bird be a truthful girl and she would not disown a fail plainly set before she by another she evade she companion 's gaze in silence you be think hard you can not say it be the fierce indictment from hannah straight tree but -- i wish she could be in another motion song -- and wear a -- green dress come the hesitating answer ee you think they would not watch susie all the time if dolly motion jack frost too and look like susie and you do not wish that dolly have a blue dress -- only ugly green -- and look like susie in the game say hannah straight tree but little white girl do not need to wear alike dress be cordelium run bird 's argument because the little white visitor last summer look just like a fairy in the pretty pink with white lace do she sister have to wish another little white girl look the very too same she ask there be a difference but i can not tell answer hannah straight tree take down she broom in puzzle moodiness the two girl go about they work in a most unfortunate state of mind hannah 's discontent at dolly 's lack and susie 's plenty and the prospect of cordelium 's triumph through the pet little sister grow upon she and result in unlooked-for trial to cordelium who be much discomfited by the force of she companion 's criticism cordelium run bird be a bright attractive girl quite conscientious in discharge she industrial and school duty and much interested in the sunday-school but in a private talk the very day before the teacher have refer to she in some perplexity i wish cordelium run bird be a little different say the school-teacher she lead she class and be a credit to the school in most respects but she be rather too ambitious to outdo other it create jealousy i have observe that she be notional in the making of she dress say the sew teacher she be apt to want the skirt a little wider and the hem a half-inch deeper than the regular uniform and she ask to have more buttonhole which mean more button and a extra ruffle on the waist but she beg I so politely and appear so thankful if i grant these trifling favor that i find myself indulge she too frequently she do the extra work herself cheerfully and neatly if not speedily but closely watch by other she have learn as if by intuition that variety be the spice of life but she seem unconscious of the fact that she make the other girl discontented but she be so pleasant and obedient as a rule that minor fault may be forgive she the white mother charitably conclude chapter ii as something quite unusual at that season in the dakota there have be a thaw the day before and a great quantity of mud have be track in on the girl ' side by the sewing class come from the schoolhouse separate from the main mission building to the upstairs room in which the sewing work be do hannah straight tree quickly sweep she portion of the hall for there be but little mud on the teacher ' side and be proceed to she stair before cordelium run bird be half way along she floor you have not take up you dirt you have sweep it over on my side exclaim cordelium run bird who with all she close attention to she own work keep a sharp eye on the other 's movement there be little and it will not be much work to take it up with yours be hannah 's reply when we finish yesterday i lend we dustpan to the middle dormitory girl -- they say theirs be too break -- and they lose it now they say they can borrow the south dormitory dustpan and they shall not hunt ours you can always find thing better than i can so you must hunt it and take up my dirt be hannah straight tree 's demand tokee how strange you talk exclaimed cordelium run bird in amazement the dormitory girl must ask for a new dustpan if they break theirs it be not the rule to lend thing for it make confusion if you lend the dustpan you must find it and take up you dirt for i have more to do than you it be number 8 and you can tell it when you see it you be very cross as well as proud and vain -- and you have learn the motto every word if i have learn the motto i should try to be good say hannah straight tree the motto do not say a girl can tell we we must do a work that be not ours and we must mind she i shall sweep you dirt back be the warm reply cordelium run bird give she broom a sudden push and send the sweepings fly backward in a cloud now look how mean you be again i have to sweep my floor cry hannah straight tree angrily proud -- vain -- cross -- mean she count the four failing on she finger not the least bit do i care reply cordelium run bird sting beyond endurance by hannah 's taunt i be not cross at first but now i be because you call I four bad name i be now glad you little sister can not play the game or motion in one song or even have a ugly green dress i be not sorry that you big and little sister can not come to school and very much i wish i have not learn the motto here the young sioux girl who be compel to battle with hereditary pride and stubbornness in every effort to do right forget the white mother 's admonition that the heart might be a dark place and a cold place need to be cleanse of evil thought hannah straight tree do not hunt the dustpan but with perseverance worthy of a better cause she brush the sweepings from she floor and stair upon a ragged palm-leaf fan which she discover in a corner and drop they into the scrub-pail take they out of door cordelium bring a shoe-box from she cupboard in the playroom and apply it as a inconvenient dustpan meanwhile dustpan number 8 remain in the darkest corner of the middle dormitory closet where it have be push in the rush of clear up the day before cordelium run bird 's work of make clean she floor and stair be even harder than she have expect never have there seem so many errand to and fro by those who do the weekly cleaning in the three dormitory numbering quite a force the thaw have end in a freezing snow squall in the night but a sufficient quantity of mud be cling to the broad sole of the government shoe that tramp across cordelium 's wet floor to insure a startling trail of footprint i can not keep they up they come again so fast she murmur to herself in grim despair while wring out she mop-rag to attack a line of track imprint by the largest girl in school in go to and from the laundry to dispose of laid-off sheet and pillow-case _ ver-ry hor-r-i-d _ picture of the ugly issue shoe i will not wear they i be wear kid store shoe my father buy for every day the dormitory girl be shovel-feeted and i wish they could not

help the middle dormitory girl for reason all she own the reckless speech be repeat to the dormitory girl by hannah straight tree much to they displeasure the dormitory girl be shovel-feeted and she wish they could not walk one step only lie in bed exclaim the largest girl sit down on a straw-tick to discuss the matter then we should be cripple and tokee how many cripple there would be if they come from both the other dormitory into this to lie down with the middle dormitory girl there would be one cripple in each bed and in one there would be two cripple say a broom girl who be quite expert at figure have study on the problem with the aid of broom-straw represent cripple this portrayal of the startling situation if cordelium run bird 's wish could be fulfil increase the shock of indignation in the dormitory ee cry one we hate the ugly government shoe of course and wish that we could wear the nice shoe from we mission box every day but we can not only sunday -- and we have to change they after sunday-school -- and when we wear we best clothes for white visitor cordelia run bird will not wear the government shoe because she father be a agency policeman and can buy store shoe for every day i be always much ashamed of my big foot and now i be more ashamed complain the largest girl if the dormitory girl be shovel-feeted every large girl in this school be shovel-feeted cordelium be very cross about the dustpan too but we can pay she back say hannah straight tree add fresh fuel to the fire now i shall not show she how to feather-stitch the little blue dress say the

with she foot upset it herself the stair be deluge with the contents hannah straight tree fall back with a laugh now see what you have do yourself i do not spill one drop you can not say i do cordelium run bird burst into upbraid exclamation in dakota which because they wish they to learn to speak english be a forbid language in the school except on sunday and on holiday by a odd mishap of memory cordelium be apt to break the rule in moment of excitement and she know the penalty too well now you have talk dakota and you must report yourself hannah straight tree say triumphantly you wish the dormitory girl would have to lie in bed -- now you must lie in bed yourself you can not feather-stitch or speak to anyone the unclean water freeze upon the stair and cordelium run bird 's work of thaw it with hot water be a long and painful process when it be accomplish though but poorly she go upstairs a second time pass through the front hall to the white mother 's room to report that she have speak in dakota again cordelia how can you forget so often say the young white mother in a seriously inquire tone the little indian girl 's excitement have now give place to discouragement she be

straight tree in dakota do hannah tip it over no ma'am i tip it over with all she sense of injury cordelium run bird would not tell tale to divide the blame the white mother see that there be more than she know of connect with the trouble in the hall but see that the race mood be upon cordelium she forbear all further question it have often be explain that if the older pupil speak dakota very much the little one would speak it too and not learn english as they should she say i be sorry that the cross thought cause you to forget cordelium run bird i be very cross now say cordelium fear she

allow to speak to she go to she corner in the south dormitory she put on she nightgown and creep into bed she hide she head beneath the blanket to shut out the sound below in which she be to have no part for several hour but though cordelium run bird be in solitude she sharp ear catch the noise of romp child in the playroom and the frequent drop of the sliding-door upon the narrow individual cupboard indicate a excessive rummaging of shelf cordelium know full well the prying habit of the indian child i be glad i have the red dress in my trunk but they will meddle with my other thing and look at susie 's blue dress and then roll it up in such bad wrinkle she say to herself just like they will drop a skein of feather-stitching silk and tramp it with they foot till it be very dirty then some girl will pick it up to sew she doll clothes and there will not be enough for susie 's dress cordelium run bird hold she breath as these thought come to she but i do not know if i can feather-stitch it now for there be no one to teach I that i know of just like hannah straight tree and the dormitory girl will tell the whole school to hate I and they will if i can not get a large girl to help make the red dress and i try to do it all alone it will fit so bad and i can not get it do in time what if i should tell my mother to have susie stay at camp and not once come inside the yard christmas time then she would not need the dress and they could not call they issue goods and not choose susie in the game and shut they eye at she cordelium lay very still but the thought of susie 's miss the festivity by stay in the big building in the mission pasture where the indian visitor camp in winter be put from she in short order susie shall not stay in camp i shall find a way to

ver-r-y ugly issue shoe she ought to wear a drag dress to hide they there be a burst of laughter while the keen black eye of the entire group be fix upon cordelium run bird 's foot she do not draw they back nor lift she eye but suddenly she dusky face grow scarlet and there be a nervous tremble of she lip that move persistently in a attempted study of the lesson she have hear the word as the girl intend she should they be speak in dakota without fear of be understand by the white mother who be in the playroom pass penny for the missionary plate the white mother hear the laugh and step into the space between the slide door which be ajar she see the girl ' resentment at a glance and that it be direct at cordelium run bird she be trouble but could not combat the feeling that have spread throughout the school to mar the peace and quiet of the sabbath which these indian girl be wont to keep in reverent spirit she have buy another pair of shoe for susie -- stocking too -- not black one like the little schoolgirl have to wear for best but very stylish brown one hannah straight tree say she put they in she trunk last night i creep upstairs and watch she for the child say she have they in she pocket the large and middle-sized girl must not see they till the entertainment but the little girl keep say they be like the one the little white visitor that wear the dress that be

lucinda she tell the little girl because she know they would tell I but dolly and lucinda shall not wear they very cotton silk of course the ringing of the bell for sunday-school relieved cordelium run bird of the torment she be undergo conversation be suspend and the girl put on they hood and march in a procession to the school-house guide by the teacher cordelium have a try hour in sunday-school the middle-sized girl she companion in the white mother 's class indulge in frequent whispering at she expense and keep deep silence when she try to lead the class as she be wont in read reference verse and in concert recitation of the memory verse and the golden text thus it happen that she read a reference verse alone in falter accent with the eye of all the class upon she : ' _ remember the word of the lord jesus how he say it be more bless to give than to receive _ ' she give a nickel every Sunday so she mind the verse and get the red dress very cheap hannah straight tree whisper from the seat behind the white mother hear the whisper but the word be in dakota so she fail to understand she see cordelium run bird shrink and color and she face grow very grave see this the class cease whisper but the white mother 's faithful teaching go unheeded and she see the lesson be a failure in fact the whole room be in sad disorder from the open to the close of sunday-school and all three teacher be perplexed and disappointed by the strange behavior of they usually attentive pupil how unfortunate that the race mood have attack the school when christmas be approach and we wish the girl to do they best and be they happiest say the white mother linger for a minute in the schoolroom after the dismissal cordelium seem about the only one except the little girl who be not out of sort to-day yet she be the one they be all against the older girl all seem displeased at she the large girl worry I with loud and constant whispering and inattention to the lesson be the school-teacher 's sorrowful report there be so many with the superintendent 's class combine with mine i find it quite impossible to keep good order as you probably observe the superintendent be not present he have start for the distant railroad station two day previously to get the christmas box i have never have the slightest trouble with both class heretofore but to-day they seem to throw off all restraint and i be simply in despair add the young teacher with a strained expression in she voice they whisper in dakota and they meaning be a mystery but i hear cordelium run bird 's name and hannah straight tree 's very often also susie dolly and lucinda there be some trouble in the hall yesterday which make cordelium run bird moody for a time but she recover she good-nature in the afternoon and seem to be behave nicely now although much hurt by the treatment which she be receive from the girl the white mother say the child be excite also say the teacher who have teach the infant class they whisper much in english and i gather from they talk that the unusual wardrobe which cordelium be prepare for she little sister to appear in during she christmas visit have to do with the disturbance i be force to hear about the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking and the blue dress and the black shoe and stocking till i know not what to do it seem that hannah be vex about the little thing and the other girl be sympathize with she and they seem to have some grievance of they own besides that explain it say the white mother perhaps it be unwise to let cordelium have the red cashmere for the little dress but she be pay for it by contribute a portion of she hard-earned money to the missionary fund she patience with the baby who be very fretful be quite wonderful she cheerfully devote all she playtime for a month to baby while i give attention to the little child and i think it but a just reward to let she have the little dress especially as it be in she mission box she father have not bring the blue dress then but dear I she have add brown shoe and stocking which i do not in the least expect the child in they bedtime talk have tell the white mother of cordelium run bird 's purchase at the store and later in the evening the second teacher have inform she of the barter of the indian doll the brown shoe and stocking must be lay to my account whatever can be do exclaim the school-teacher in dismay nothing say the white mother firmly i wish cordelium be less extravagant and we will be careful to restrain she after this but indian girl must learn as well as white girl to respect the right of property the girl have be allow much freedom in the spending of what money they could call they own but it have mostly go for hair ribbon and candy and there have be no trouble before i hope the feeling will subside however in a day or two so many christmas pleasure be in prospect that the girl will surely have no room for strife and envy in they heart here the teacher hasten to the mission building to discharge the duty that devolve upon they after sunday-school just before sun \ et Monday afternoon a flock of girl be gather at the stile in front watch with intensity a solitary little figure move slowly on a far side of the pasture near the barb wire fence again there walk cordelium run bird very far away say hannah straight tree she have walk alone two afternoon she must be think very hard she be go on the mourner 's walk observe the girl who keep the playroom when a indian walk alone so far and very slow that mean they be too sad she can not be happy for the large girl -- only I -- and the middle-sized girl do not talk to she then too of course she think of annie it be just one year ago this Monday that they take she to the agency the large girl do not wash because there be a funeral and cordelium run bird be so proud because the girl all cry say hannah now i wish we have not cry kee you must not be so mean as that exclaim the largest girl in shocked surprise of course we cry for annie she be very kind to everyone -- not cross like we she be a very little cross sometimes because she be a indian she try much harder than cordelium run bird i be glad i sing ` the sweet by and by ' when she be so afraid say emma two bear the girl be silent for a little stir by memory of the schoolmate who have pass into the life beyond meantime the solitary girl in the snowy pasture continue she walk i can wish i have not tell cordelium run bird that i would not sleep with anyone but she say hannah i be glad she be not in the middle dormitory now they put she in we dormitory so that she can go and tell the teacher if a little girl be sick or cry remark the prudent little girl who have arrive upon the scene with several other child the teacher say she wake up easy and be braver in the dark than any other girl ee cordelium run bird be a dress pattern for the other girl -- i mean a pattern hannah cry cordelium be the bravest and she have a white memory so she have the longest piece cordelium be polite she keep she clothes so clean and do not tear they so the missionary lady send she prettier thing for the teacher write she be so nice the visitor always talk about cordelium run bird very lot they do not think the girl be listen but they be they should not listen that be steal talk the white mother say reply the prudent little girl we like cordelium run bird for she do not scold we little girl and tell we we be in the way as you do be the bold defense we shall choose susie in the game if the little girl choose susie the large and middle-sized girl can pull they hair when they be comb they be the appalling threat from hannah straight tree if they tell the teacher we can say they hair be snarly and we could not help it ee we shall not pull the little girl ' hair and tell a lie say emma two bear rally she honest principle we can treat cordelium run bird cross because she call we shovel-feeted and be very vain so we should punish she but we will not be wicked i do not say we shall -- i say we can retract hannah in confusion the girl be very mean to walk whole-feet where she be scrub say the playroom girl who know from sad experience what cordelium 's trial must have be it make I very cross because the little girl will not stay out or sit still on the bench when i scrub the playroom and they do not make big track if they do walk whole-feet you can speak to she because she could not call you shovel-feeted for the white mother let you always wear the mission shoe say hannah straight tree grow bold again because i have a onion -- no a bunion -- on my foot the issue shoe would make it worse just like there be no girl in school that do not hate to have the horrid whole-feet track on she wet floor i hate they -- some confess a middle dormitory girl i too admit a south dormitory girl i throw a few drop of scrub water on a girl that walk whole-feet i tell a girl she track be so big just like she have on snowshoe say a north dormitory girl relentingly of course i make the very biggest kind of track on cordelium run bird 's wet floor say the largest girl but if we walk tiptoe all the other girl will laugh and say ` see how she nip along she try to walk so nice just like the teacher ' and if we be walk on we heel they say ` very awkward hear she tramp just like a steer ' but it be not kind to walk whole-feet the race mood be upon the wane and hannah straight tree be fast lose influence i would not have care so much about the blue dress and the black shoe and stocking but she buy the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking when she little sister do not need they hannah argue in a injured tone she do not buy they with you money say the playroom girl you would not have take care of a cross baby four week and miss a plum picnic and not play a leap to earn pretty thing for dolly you be much too lazy now i shall not stay another minute spring from the stile in deep chagrin you all can like cordelium run bird if you want to but i shall not like she hannah straight tree run into the house and those remain turn again to watch cordelium she have reach a sloping bluff down which the fence extend to the flat beside the river she stand a moment on the edge then wrap she clothes about she and sit down on the crust presently she disappear she have slide down hill observe the playroom girl she must be go to the river she should not it will soon be dark and she be all alone say emma two bear in a tone betray some anxiety chapter vi cordelium run bid hold she clothes about she with one hand steer with she foot and reach the flat in safety she arise and stand still and look toward the river to a space of open water on the near side of a sandbar half way over she take a few step forward rather slowly then she pace quicken more and more till she be run breathlessly as if in fear of lose she resolve to carry out some plan she be intent upon in rush through a hollow line with willow tree she slip and almost lose she footing and in struggle to regain it she release she hold upon a well-filled gingham bag which she have hide beneath she coat and drop it on the ground she pick it up and hang it by the draw-string on she arm but with this interruption of she headlong course there come a corresponding halt of purpose so she turn aside and walk a few yard down the hollow where she find a log on which to seat herself presently she murmur in the passive monotone of a despairing indian girl : just like i have to stop and think before i do it if i drown the blue dress and the black shoe and stocking and the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking i can write to hannah straight tree for she will not let I speak to she : ` now you see i truly be not vain for i have put the christmas clothes for susie in my workbag and a stone so it would sink and i have drown they in the airhole in the middle of the river ' but again that would be brag be she puzzle afterthought just like jesus be not help I one bit for very fast i go and buy the brown shoe and stocking after i have pray to stop be vain and the teacher look so sorry and i be ashamed to tell the white mother everything i say and do be vain and bragging and i can not think hard enough to help it my tongue brag about dolly and lucinda 's hair ribbon to the little girl and my foot brag about the issue shoe i stick they out so far and when the girl make fun of I i do not pull the shoe back for i want they to think i be not scared but sorry i be truly try to try hard but i be try the wrong way now my pencil will be brag if it tell hannah straight tree i have drown the thing cordelia sit in troubled thought while the pink and golden color of the sunset fade from the sky above the bluff and the wind sigh through the hollow the white mother say it be not right to even waste a pin and many nice thing that have cost much money would be waste if i drown they i shall look at they and think again what i can do she draw the contents from the bag and spread they on she lap first she give attention to the little blue dress she have help to make at the expense of many play hour -lrb- illustration : she draw the contents from she bag and spread they on she lap -rrb- emma two bear make the waist so nice and say she would not take one thing for pay but i make she take a shell necklace that be very pretty but i do not care for it myself it be so indian-minded emma be so generous i wish i could be generous if i should give the blue dress to dolly and the black shoe and stocking just like i should be some generous what if i should truly do it with a sudden interest in she tone she would look as pretty as the little schoolgirl then and she could motion jack frost and hannah and the other could not say susie do not need the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking i be ` most sure jessie turn heart will help I make the red dress if i bring the playroom wood for she till we change work next month she hate to bring wood for she foot get cold and then the sore bunch pinch she much worse she be very fast and stylish make dress and she feather-stitch and she say she be not cross at I she say one time she like to sew so much just like she would be get up and sew in she sleep so i shall ask she to trade work but hannah straight tree say she hate light blue for it make a copper-colored indian look much blacker and she hate one tuck and there would have to be one for the blue dress be too long for dolly and it smut some too and be not soft and fine hannah would not want it she would say susie look much nicer in the red dress and dolly should not motion jack frost in the blue one cordelium put the blue dress and the black shoe and stocking back into the bag and spread the red cashmere across she lap and smooth it lovingly it feel so soft i like to rub it just the color of the one rise on the white mother 's window bush she hold it up luxuriate in its warm red glow ver-ry sw-e-et and pretty -- and the brown shoe and stocking too i shall put they on the clean snow and look at they she spread the thing on the hard white crust and view they with increase admiration suddenly she catch they up and hide they in she apron for the sight of they be far too tempting then she lock she hand together in she lap and sit so still a wood-mouse dare to leave he hole beneath the log and frisk about she foot the baby be so cross i could not play one bit the whole four week she say at length in supplicate tone just like i earn the dress so hard i think i do not care much for the indian doll but my grandmother can not make another for she now have par-a-lay-si in she hand -- the doctor say it be and i sell the indian doll to get the brown shoe and stocking dolly have a round face and she eye be pretty susie have a thin face and she be a very little cross-eyed so she need a prettier dress to look as nice as dolly but lucinda can not come to school if dolly can not and she feel so sad if dolly 's father see she look very pretty in a red dress and a brown shoe and stocking just like he would feel so happier he would let she come to school then lucinda would be glad and she would learn the neat way and they would grow dolly more white-minded the verse i read yesterday be a king 's daughter ' verse helen mark it -- annie too what if annie should be look down from up there -- point to a newly glimmer star -- and speak just like this : ` dear cordelia these word i tell you -- it be more bless to give than to receive i would give the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking to the little girl name dolly straight tree ' cordelium look another minute at the star of course annie can not speak those word up there but she would like to have I do it and my father and my mother would not care for i should tell they just like annie think i ought to and they always let I do a thing i want to anyhow if a indian likes another indian very much he will give he a big present my father tell a indian man one time ' i be you friend so i shall give you a pony ' and he do and the indian man tell my father ' i be you friend so i shall give you a steer ' and a white man laugh and say it be a good trade but the indian do not laugh they say my father and the other indian be very generous now i have find the right way and it make I very happier and i shall not change my thought in firm relief i shall do this kind : till dolly and lucinda come i shall not say one word to any girl or even tell the white mother then susie 's best thing i shall give to hannah straight tree in a way that will surprise she tokee there ring the half-hour bell till supper and i be down here and it be moonlight cordelium hastily replace the best thing in the bag and scamper home chapter vii cordelium run bird carry out she plan of ask jessie turn heart the playroom girl to help she make the red dress and the latter willingly agree to trade work and escape bringing in the wood to the torture of she lame foot cordelium find that she have undertake no light task for there be violent snowstorm in the next two week and a enormous quantity of wood be swallow by the great stove in the playroom which must need be keep red-hot from long before dawn until bedtime to dispel the freezing atmosphere within owe to the influence of the playroom girl the large and middle-sized girl in general cease to be intensely hostile to cordelium but they do not break the seal of silence so she could not ask help from among they the small girl show they friendship for cordelium now and then by march in a line behind she from the wood-yard laden with what fuel they could bring or even go down the path the older girl have break to the flat for willow fagot which they tie upon they back and bring to she for kindle hannah straight tree try cordelium 's resolution to do good to she by stealthy persecution that escape the notice of the teacher who remark to one another in relief that hannah and the other girl appear in better humor toward cordelium and the fatter have regain she cheerful spirit hannah take she station in the little outside hall one bluster afternoon watch through the side window till cordelium climb the porch step load to she chin with wood then hannah brace she back against the outside door cordelium spare one hand with difficulty tug at the door with wind-tossed garment all in vain she drop she wood to use both hand the door would sometimes stick when lightly close and think this to be the case she throw she weight against it in a forcible attempt to burst it open hannah jump away and dart through the inside door in silent glee cordelium fall full length into the hall and strike she head against the inner threshold she lay in a dazed condition for a little then arouse herself to catch a glimpse of hannah peer through the window of the inside door she vanish instantly but the expression of she face have tell cordelium where the mischief lay she will not let I like she thought cordelium struggle to she foot with ache head and blinking back the tear just like i shall have to hate she just a little while i do she good she turn and see to she surprise that emma two bear who have come behind she to the porch be gather up she wood emma often help to fill the wood-box in the music room as a especial friend of hers attend to that work and cordelium fear she wood be be boldly capture for that purpose she be about to cry out sharply but restrain herself and fall back silently while emma pass into the house cordelium follow she and see with sink heart that emma take a straight track through the playroom for the music room but on the threshold of the room she whirl about and walk to the playroom wood-box drop the wood in thank you very much exclaim cordelium in sign language on she finger etiquette forbid she to employ she tongue in the expression of she gratitude see that the girl have place a ban on it a curious contortion of the deaf-and-dumb alphabet be use among the indian girl when pride forbid the use of speech you need not thank I i be only punish hannah straight tree emma answer likewise with she finger this exchange of compliment be read without scruple by the many pair of eye include hannah 's that be watch the affair emma two bear talk deaf-and-dumb to she now we can plan crack-the-whip with she for that be not a speaking game observe a middle-sized girl who have be a comrade of cordelium 's heretofore she will not have time to crack the whip say hannah she be go to the south dormitory where she sit she whole playtime help sew the red dress for susie so she can look nicer than the other little home sister and the little schoolgirl you be very jealous-minded and you try hard to spite cordelium run bird say the recent comrade you can talk that way because you have no little sister grumble hannah cordelium pass upstairs with quick step just like the large and middle-sized girl -- only hannah straight tree -- will again be speak to I pretty soon she say to jessie turn heart who sit beside a sunny window in the south dormitory sew briskly on the little red waist they can not speak to you till christmas day because they all say they would not jessie answer then if you ap-ol-ogize and say you do not wish they to be cripple any more and that you will stop talk vain they will again speak to you and they will walk heel or tiptoe on you floor i shall write a ap-ol-ogy in dakota on three papers christmas morning and pin they on a side of the three dormitory but you must not tell because i do not wish to brag what i shall do cordelium say in strictest confidence i think it would be better if you have but one shoe and stocking and best dress for susie but you can not help it now the playroom girl reply two best dress and two shoe and stocking look too many when the other little home sister have not one best thing cordelium run bird be quite strongly tempt to confide still further in the friendly playroom girl who have sustain she through the try tempest of event but she resist and begin to hem the little skirt in silence ee how short you have it jessie notice suddenly you must think susie be to grow the other way before she wear it cordelium 's only answer be a noncommittal smile which jessie fail to understand this thought however suddenly impressed cordelium : now it be too short for susie and the hem be not one bit too wide so i could not let it down what if hannah straight tree be so cross she will not let dolly wear it and there be no other little home sister just the size of dolly that could wear it and be come christmas just like hannah will not take it and will keep on hate I forever and ever so i can not do she good whether this foreboding be fulfil or otherwise will be explain in hannah 's letter to the king 's daughter in the far east who have send the little bible and the loving message to the king 's daughter in the far west : _ dear helen merriam _ : now i shall write you a letter for cordelium run bird can not for she say it would be brag it be all about christmas and we big and little sister cordelium 's big sister be now in heaven and cordelium write good-by to you from annie my big sister be now in the first reader but she can not help it for my mother die and so lucinda have to stay at home and keep dolly and that be my little sister and it be about susie -- that be cordelium 's little sister -- that i get so mean and jealous for she have a nice christmas thing -- two kind -- and dolly would not have one kind and she would look so horrid so i call cordelium run bird proud vain cross mean and i talk about she so the girl get cross at she and i make she push a pail of scrub water downstairs so she talk dakota and have to lie in bed and could not feather-stitch the blue dress for it smut so the silk would be too dirty but she feather-stitch the red dress and she sell she indian doll and it be she grandmother 's when she be cordelium 's age so she buy the brown shoe and stocking and cordelium read the king 's daughter ' verse ` love you enemy ' and ` it be more bless to give than to receive ' so she put the red dress and the brown shoe and stocking and two hair ribbon in a box and jessie turn heart tie a blue scarf round my eye so tight i could not see and lead I to the chicken house and i put my hand on the box and jessie pull off the scarf and i uncover the box and find the thing and cordelium run bird have pin a piece of paper on the red dress and these word be write on
