produce by juliet sutherland josephine paoluccus and the online distribute proofread team the essay of arthur schopenhauer translate by t bailey saunder ma counsel and maxim _ le bonheur n'est pas choose aisée : il est très difficile de le trouver en nous et impossible de le trouver ailleur _ chamfort contents chapter introduction i general rule ii we relation to ourselves iii we relation to other iv worldly fortune v the age of life introduction if my object in these page be to present a complete scheme of counsel and maxim for the guidance of life i should have to repeat the numerous rule -- some of they excellent -- which have be draw up by thinker of all age from theogni and solomon -lrb- 1 -rrb- down to la rochefoucauld and in so do i should inevitably entail upon the reader a vast amount of well-worn commonplace but the fact be that in this work i make still less claim to exhaust my subject than in any other of my writings -lrb- footnote 1 : i refer to the proverb and maxim ascribe in the old testament to the king of that name -rrb- a author who make no claim to completeness must also in a great measure abandon any attempt at systematic arrangement for he double loss in this respect the reader may console himself by reflect that a complete and systematic treatment of such a subject as the guidance of life could hardly fail to be a very wearisome business i have simply put down those of my thought which appear to be worth communicate -- thought which as far as i know have not be utter or at any rate not just in the same form by any one else so that my remark may be take as a supplement to what have be already achieve in the immense field however by way of introduce some sort of order into the great variety of matter upon which advice will be give in the follow page i shall distribute what i have to say under the follow head : -lrb- 1 -rrb- general rule -lrb- 2 -rrb- we relation to ourselves -lrb- 3 -rrb- we relation to other and finally -lrb- 4 -rrb- rule which concern we manner of life and we worldly circumstance i shall conclude with some remark on the change which the various period of life produce in we chapter i general rule -- section 1 the first and foremost rule for the wise conduct of life seem to I to be contain in a view to which aristotle parenthetically refer in the _ nichomachean ethic _ : -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- greek : o phronimoz to alupon dioke e ou to aedu -rrb- or as it may be render _ not pleasure but freedom from pain be what the wise man will aim at _ -lrb- footnote 1 : vii -lrb- 12 -rrb- 12 -rrb- the truth of this remark turn upon the negative character of happiness -- the fact that pleasure be only the negation of pain and that pain be the positive element in life though i have give a detailed proof of this proposition in my chief work -lrb- 1 -rrb- i may supply one more illustration of it here draw from a circumstance of daily occurrence suppose that with the exception of some sore or painful spot we be physically in a sound and healthy condition : the sore of this one spot will completely absorb we attention cause we to lose the sense of general well-being and destroy all we comfort in life in the same way when all we affair but one turn out as we wish the single instance in which we aim be frustrated be a constant trouble to we even though it be something quite trivial we think a great deal about it and very little about those other and more important matter in which we have be successful in both these case what have meet with resistance be _ the will _ in the one case as it be objectify in the organism in the other as it present itself in the struggle of life and in both it be plain that the satisfaction of the will consist in nothing else than that it meet with no resistance it be therefore a satisfaction which be not directly feel at most we can become conscious of it only when we reflect upon we condition but that which check or arrest the will be something positive it proclaim its own presence all pleasure consist in merely remove this check -- in other word in free we from its action and hence pleasure be a state which can never last very long -lrb- footnote 1 : _ welt al wille und vorstellung _ vol i p 58 -rrb- this be the true basis of the above excellent rule quote from aristotle which bid we direct we aim not toward secure what be pleasurable and agreeable in life but toward avoid as far as possible its innumerable evil if this be not the right course to take that say of voltaire 's _ happiness be but a dream and sorrow be real _ would be as false as it be in fact true a man who desire to make up the book of he life and determine where the balance of happiness lie must put down in he account not the pleasure which he have enjoy but the evil which he have escape that be the true method of eudaemonology for all eudaemonology must begin by recognize that its very name be a euphemism and that _ to live happily _ only mean _ to live less unhappily _ -- to live a tolerable life there be no doubt that life be give we not to be enjoy but to be overcome -- to be get over there be numerous expression illustrate this -- such as _ degere vitam vita defungus _ or in italian _ si scampa cosi _ or in german _ man muss suchen durchzukomman er wird schon durch die welt komman _ and so on in old age it be indeed a consolation to think that the work of life be over and do with the happiest lot be not to have experience the keenest delight or the greatest pleasure but to have bring life to a close without any very great pain bodily or mental to measure the happiness of a life by its delight or pleasure be to apply a false standard for pleasure be and remain something negative that they produce happiness be a delusion cherish by envy to its own punishment pain be feel to be something positive and hence its absence be the true standard of happiness and if over and above freedom from pain there be also a absence of boredom the essential condition of earthly happiness be attain for all else be chimerical it follow from this that a man should never try to purchase pleasure at the cost of pain or even at the risk of incur it to do so be to pay what be positive and real for what be negative and illusory while there be a net profit in sacrifice pleasure for the sake of avoid pain in either case it be a matter of indifference whether the pain follow the pleasure or precede it while it be a complete inversion of the natural order to try and turn this scene of misery into a garden of pleasure to aim at joy and pleasure rather than at the greatest possible freedom from pain -- and yet how many do it -- there be some wisdom in take a gloomy view in look upon the world as a kind of hell and in confine one 's effort to secure a little room that shall not be expose to the fire the fool rush after the pleasure of life and find himself they dupe the wise man avoid its evil and even if notwithstanding he precaution he fall into misfortune that be the fault of fate not of he own folly as far as he be successful in he endeavor he can not be say to have live a life of illusion for the evil which he shun be very real even if he go too far out of he way to avoid evil and make a unnecessary sacrifice of pleasure he be in reality not the worse off for that for all pleasure be chimerical and to mourn for have lose any of they be a frivolous and even ridiculous proceed the failure to recognize this truth -- a failure promote by optimistic idea -- be the source of much unhappiness in moment free from pain we restless wish present as it be in a mirror the image of a happiness that have no counterpart in reality seduce we to follow it in do so we bring pain upon ourselves and that be something undeniably real afterwards we come to look with regret upon that lose state of painlessness it be a paradise which we have gamble away it be no longer with we and we long in vain to undo what have be do one might well fancy that these vision of wish fulfil be the work of some evil spirit conjure up in order to entice we away from that painless state which form we highest happiness a careless youth may think that the world be mean to be enjoy as though it be the abode of some real or positive happiness which only those fail to attain who be not clever enough to overcome the difficulty that lie in the way this false notion take a stronger hold on he when he come to read poetry and romance and to be deceive by outward show -- the hypocrisy that characterize the world from begin to end on which i shall have something to say presently the result be that he life be the more or less deliberate pursuit of positive happiness and happiness he take to be equivalent to a series of definite pleasure in seek for these pleasure he encounter danger -- a fact which should not be forget he hunt for game that do not exist and so he end by suffer some very real and positive misfortune -- pain distress sickness loss care poverty shame and all the thousand ill of life too late he discover the trick that have be play upon he but if the rule i have mention be observe and a plan of life be adopt which proceed by avoid pain -- in other word by take measure of precaution against want sickness and distress in all its form the aim be a real one and something may be achieve which will be great in proportion as the plan be not disturb by strive after the chimera of positive happiness this agree with the opinion express by goethe in the _ elective affinity _ and there put into the mouth of mittler -- the man who be always try to make other people happy : _ to desire to get rid of a evil be a definite object but to desire a better fortune than one have be blind folly _ the same truth be contain in that fine french proverb : _ le mieux est l'ennemi du bien _ -- leave well alone and as i have remark in my chief work -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be the lead thought underlie the philosophical system of the cynic for what be it lead the cynic to repudiate pleasure in every form if it be not the fact that pain be in a greater or less degree always bind up with pleasure to go out of the way of pain seem to they so much easier than to secure pleasure deeply impressed as they be by the negative nature of pleasure and the positive nature of pain they consistently devote all they effort to the avoidance of pain the first step to that end be in they opinion a complete and deliberate repudiation of pleasure as something which serve only to entrap the victim in order that he might be deliver over to pain -lrb- footnote 1 : _ welt al wille und vorstellung _ vol ii ch 16 -rrb- we be all bear as schiller say in arcadium in other word we come into the world full of claim to happiness and pleasure and we cherish the fond hope of make they good but as a rule fate soon teach we in a rough and ready way that we really possess nothing at all but that everything in the world be at its command in virtue of a unassailable right not only to all we have or acquire to wife or child but even to we very limb we arm leg _ eye _ and ear nay even to the nose in the middle of we face and in any case after some little time we learn by experience that happiness and pleasure be a _ fa morgana _ which visible from afar vanish as we approach that on the other hand suffering and pain be a reality which make its presence feel without any intermediary and for its effect stand in no need of illusion or the play of false hope if the teaching of experience bear fruit in we we soon give up the pursuit of pleasure and happiness and think much more about make ourselves secure against the attack of pain and suffering we see that the best the world have to offer be a existence free from pain -- a quiet tolerable life and we confine we claim to this as to something we can more surely hope to achieve for the safest way of not be very miserable be not to expect to be very happy merck the friend of goethe 's youth be conscious of this truth when he write : _ it be the wretched way people have of set up a claim to happiness _ -- _ and that to in a measure correspond with they desire _ -- _ that ruin everything in this world a man will make progress if he can get rid of this claim -lrb- 1 -rrb- and desire nothing but what he see before he _ accordingly it be advisable to put very moderate limit upon we expectation of pleasure possession rank honor and so on because it be just this strive and struggle to be happy to dazzle the world to lead a life full of pleasure which entail great misfortune it be prudent and wise i say to reduce one 's claim if only for the reason that it be extremely easy to be very unhappy while to be very happy be not indeed difficult but quite impossible with justice sing the poet of life 's wisdom : _ auream quisqui mediocritatem diligit tutu caret obsoletus sordibus tectus caret invidenda sobrius aula savius venti agitatur ingen pinus : et celsae graviori casu decidunt turre feriuntque summo fulgura money -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ -- the golden mean be best -- to live free from the squalor of a mean abode and yet not be a mark for envy it be the tall pine which be cruelly shake by the wind the highest summit that be strike in the storm and the lofty tower that fall so heavily -lrb- footnote 1 : letter to and from merck -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : horace ode ii x -rrb- he who have take to heart the teaching of my philosophy -- who know therefore that we whole existence be something which have better not have be and that to disown and disclaim it be the highest wisdom -- he will have no great expectation from anything or any condition in life : he will spend passion upon nothing in the world nor lament over-much if he fail in any of he undertaking he will feel the deep truth of what plato -lrb- 1 -rrb- say : -lrb- greek : oute ti ton anthropinon haxion on megalae spondae -rrb- -- nothing in human affair be worth any great anxiety or as the persian poet have it _ though from thy grasp all worldly thing should flee grieve not for they for they be nothing worth : and though a world in thy possession be joy not for worthless be the thing of earth since to that better world ` tis give to thee to pass speed on for this be nothing worth _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ republic _ x 604 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ translator 's note _ from the anvár-i suhailí -- _ the light of canopus _ -- be the persian version of the _ table of bidpai _ translate by eb eastwick ch iii story vi p 289 -rrb- the chief obstacle to we arrive at these salutary view be that hypocrisy of the world to which i have already allude -- a hypocrisy which should be early reveal to the young most of the glory of the world be mere outward show like the scene on a stage : there be nothing real about they ship festoon and hang with pennant firing of cannon illuminations beat of drum and blowing of trumpet shout and applaud -- these be all the outward sign the pretence and suggestion -- as it be the hieroglyphic -- of _ joy _ : but just there joy be as a rule not to be find it be the only guest who have decline to be present at the festival where this guest may really be find he come generally without invitation he be not formerly announce but slip in quietly by himself _ san facon _ often make he appearance under the most unimportant and trivial circumstance and in the commonest company -- anywhere in short but where the society be brilliant and distinguished joy be like the gold in the australian mine -- find only now and then as it be by the caprice of chance and accord to no rule or law oftenest in very little grain and very seldom in heap all that outward show which i have describe be only a attempt to make people believe that it be really joy which have come to the festival and to produce this impression upon the spectator be in fact the whole object of it with _ mourning _ it be just the same that long funeral procession move up so slowly how melancholy it look what a endless row of carriage but look into they -- they be all empty the coachman of the whole town be the sole escort the dead man have to he grave eloquent picture of the friendship and esteem of the world this be the falsehood the hollowness the hypocrisy of human affair take another example -- a roomful of guest in full dress be receive with great ceremony you could almost believe that this be a noble and distinguished company but as a matter of fact it be compulsion pain and boredom who be the real guest for where many be invite it be a rabble -- even if they all wear star really good society be everywhere of necessity very small in brilliant festival and noisy entertainment there be always at bottom a sense of emptiness prevalent a false tone be there : such gathering be in strange contrast with the misery and barrenness of we existence the contrast bring the true condition into greater relief still these gathering be effective from the outside and that be just they purpose chamfort -lrb- 1 -rrb- make the excellent remark that _ society _ -- _ les cercles les salons ce qu'on appelle le monde _ -- be like a miserable play or a bad opera without any interest in itself but support for a time by mechanical aid costume and scenery -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ nichola chamfort -lrb- 1741-94 -rrb- a french miscellaneous writer whose brilliant conversation power of sarcasm and epigrammic force couple with a extraordinary career render he one of the most interesting and remarkable man of he time schopenhauer undoubtedly owe much to this writer to whom he constantly refer -rrb- and so too with academy and chair of philosophy you have a kind of sign-board hang out to show the apparent abode of _ wisdom _ : but wisdom be another guest who decline the invitation she be to be find elsewhere the chiming of bell ecclesiastical millinery attitude of devotion insane antic -- these be the pretence the false show of _ piety _ and so on everything in the world be like a hollow nut there be little kernel anywhere and when it do exist it be still more rare to find it in the shell you may look for it elsewhere and find it as a rule only by chance section 2 to estimate a man 's condition in regard to happiness it be necessary to ask not what thing please he but what thing trouble he and the more trivial these thing be in themselves the happier the man will be to be irritated by trifle a man must be well off for in misfortune trifle be unfelt section 3 care should be take not to build the happiness of life upon a _ broad foundation _ -- not to require a great many thing in order to be happy for happiness on such a foundation be the most easily undermine it offer many more opportunity for accident and accident be always happen the architecture of happiness follow a plan in this respect just the opposite of that adopt in every other case where the broadest foundation offer the greatest security accordingly to reduce you claim to the lowest possible degree in comparison with you means -- of whatever kind these may be -- be the surest way of avoid extreme misfortune to make extensive preparation for life -- no matter what form they may take -- be one of the greatest and commonest of folly such preparation presuppose in the first place a long life the full and complete term of year appoint to man -- and how few reach it and even if it be reach it be still too short for all the plan that have be make for to carry they out requite more time than be think necessary at the beginning and then how many mischance and obstacle stand in the way how seldom the goal be ever reach in human affair and lastly even though the goal should be reach the change which time work in we have be leave out of the reckoning : we forget that the capacity whether for achievement or for enjoyment do not last a whole lifetime so we often toil for thing which be no longer suit to we when we attain they and again the year we spend in prepare for some work unconsciously rob we of the power for carry it out how often it happen that a man be unable to enjoy the wealth which he acquire at so much trouble and risk and that the fruit of he labor be reserve for other or that he be incapable of fill the position which he have win after so many year of toil and struggle fortune have come too late for he or contrarily he have come too late for fortune -- when for instance he want to achieve great thing say in art or literature : the popular taste have change it may be a new generation have grow up which take no interest in he work other have go a shorter way and get the start of he these be the fact of life which horace must have have in view when he lament the uselessness of all advice : -- _ quid eternis minorem consiliis animum fatigas _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ode ii xi -rrb- the cause of this commonest of all folly be that optical illusion of the mind from which everyone suffer make life at its beginning seem of long duration and at its end when one look back over the course of it how short a time it seem there be some advantage in the illusion but for it no great work would ever be do we life be like a journey on which as we advance the landscape take a different view from that which it present at first and change again as we come nearer this be just what happen -- especially with we wish we often find something else nay something better than what we be look for and what we look for we often find on a very different path from that on which we begin a vain search instead of finding as we expect pleasure happiness joy we get experience insight knowledge -- a real and permanent blessing instead of a fleeting and illusory one this be the thought that run through _ wilkelm meister _ like the bass in a piece of music in this work of goethe 's we have a novel of the _ intellectual _ kind and therefore superior to all other even to sir walter scott 's which be one and all _ ethical _ in other word they treat of human nature only from the side of the will so too in the _ zauberflöte _ -- that grotesque but still significant and even hieroglyphic -- the same thought be symbolize but in great coarse line much in the way in which scenery be paint here the symbol would be complete if tamino be in the end to be cure of he desire to possess tainina and receive in she stead initiation into the mystery of the temple of wisdom it be quite right for papageno he necessary contrast to succeed in get he papagena man of any worth or value soon come to see that they be in the hand of fate and gratefully submit to be mould by its teaching they recognize that the fruit of life be experience and not happiness they become accustomed and content to exchange hope for insight and in the end they can say with petrarch that all they care for be to learn : -- _ altro diletto che ` mparar non provo _ it may even be that they to some extent still follow they old wish and aim trifle with they as it be for the sake of appearance all the while really and seriously look for nothing but instruction a process which lend they a air of genius a trait of something contemplative and sublime in they search for gold the alchemist discover other thing -- gunpowder china medicine the law of nature there be a sense in which we be all alchemist chapter ii we relation to ourselves -- section 4 the mason employ on the building of a house may be quite ignorant of its general design or at any rate he may not keep it constantly in mind so it be with man : in work through the day and hour of he life he take little thought of its character as a whole if there be any merit or importance attach to a man 's career if he lay himself out carefully for some special work it be all the more necessary and advisable for he to turn he attention now and then to its _ plan _ that be to say the miniature sketch of its general outline of course to do that he must have apply the maxim -lrb- greek : gnothus seauton -rrb- he must have make some little progress in the art of understand himself he must know what be he real chief and foremost object in life -- what it be that he most want in order to be happy and then after that what occupy the second and third place in he thought he must find out what on the whole he vocation really be -- the part he have to play he general relation to the world if he map out important work for himself on great line a glance at this miniature plan of he life will more than anything else stimulate rouse and ennoble he urge he on to action and keep he from false path again just as the traveler on reach a height get a connected view over the road he have take with its many turn and winding so it be only when we have complete a period in we life or approach the end of it altogether that we recognize the true connection between all we action -- what it be we have achieve what work we have do it be only then that we see the precise chain of cause and effect and the exact value of all we effort for as long as we be actually engage in the work of life we always act in accordance with the nature of we character under the influence of motive and within the limit of we capacity -- in a word from begin to end under a law of _ necessity _ at every moment we do just what appear to we right and proper it be only afterwards when we come to look back at the whole course of we life and its general result that we see the why and wherefore of it all when we be actually do some great deed or create some immortal work we be not conscious of it as such we think only of satisfy present aim of fulfil the intention we happen to have at the time of do the right thing at the moment it be only when we come to view we life as a connected whole that we character and capacity show themselves in they true light that we see how in particular instance some happy inspiration as it be lead we to choose the only true path out of a thousand which might have bring we to ruin it be we genius that guide we a force feel in the affair of the intellectual as in those of the world and work by its defect just in the same way in regard to evil and disaster section 5 another important element in the wise conduct of life be to preserve a proper proportion between we thought for the present and we thought for the future in order not to spoil the one by pay over-great attention to the other many live too long in the present -- frivolous people i mean other too much in the future ever anxious and full of care it be seldom that a man hold the right balance between the two extreme those who strive and hope and live only in the future always look ahead and impatiently anticipate what be come as something which will make they happy when they get it be in spite of they very clever air exactly like those donkey one see in italy whose pace may be hurry by fix a stick on they head with a wisp of hay at the end of it this be always just in front of they and they keep on try to get it such people be in a constant state of illusion as to they whole existence they go on live _ ad interim _ until at last they die instead therefore of always think about we plan and anxiously look to the future or of give ourselves up to regret for the past we should never forget that the present be the only reality the only certainty that the future almost always turn out contrary to we expectation that the past too be very different from what we suppose it to have be but the past and the future be on the whole of less consequence than we think distance which make object look small to the outward eye make they look big to the eye of think the present alone be true and actual it be the only time which possess full reality and we existence lie in it exclusively therefore we should always be glad of it and give it the welcome it deserve and enjoy every hour that be bearable by its freedom from pain and annoyance with a full consciousness of its value we shall hardly be able to do this if we make a wry face over the failure of we hope in the past or over we anxiety for the future it be the height of folly to refuse the present hour of happiness or wantonly to spoil it by vexation at by-gone or uneasiness about what be to come there be a time of course for forethought nay even for repentance but when it be over let we think of what be past as of something to which we have say farewell of necessity subdue we heart -- -lrb- greek : alla ta man protuchthaus easoman achnumenous per tumhon enus staethessus philon damasnte hananka -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- and of the future as of that which lie beyond we power in the lap of the god -- -lrb- greek : all aetous man tauta theon en gounasus keitaus -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ iliad _ xix 65 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ibid _ xvii 514 -rrb- but in regard to the present let we remember seneca 's advice and live each day as if it be we whole life -- _ singula die singula vita puta _ : let we make it as agreeable as possible it be the only real time we have only those evil which be sure to come at a definite date have any right to disturb we and how few there be which fulfill this description for evil be of two kind either they be possible only at most probable or they be inevitable even in the case of evil which be sure to happen the time at which they will happen be uncertain a man who be always prepare for either class of evil will not have a moment of peace leave he so if we be not to lose all comfort in life through the fear of evil some of which be uncertain in themselves and other in the time at which they will occur we should look upon the one kind as never likely to happen and the other as not likely to happen very soon now the less we peace of mind be disturb by fear the more likely it be to be agitate by desire and expectation this be the true meaning of that song of goethe 's which be such a favorite with everyone : _ ich hab ' mein ' sach ' auf nichts gestellt _ it be only after a man have get rid of all pretension and take refuge in mere unembellished existence that he be able to attain that peace of mind which be the foundation of human happiness peace of mind that be something essential to any enjoyment of the present moment and unless its separate moment be enjoy there be a end of life 's happiness as a whole we should always collect that _ to-day _ come only once and never return we fancy that it will come again to-morrow but _ to-morrow _ be another day which in its turn come once only we be apt to forget that every day be a integral and therefore irreplaceable portion of life and to look upon life as though it be a collective idea or name which do not suffer if one of the individual it cover be destroy we should be more likely to appreciate and enjoy the present if in those good day when we be well and strong we do not fail to reflect how in sickness and sorrow every past hour that be free from pain and privation seem in we memory so infinitely to be envy -- as it be a lose paradise or some one who be only then see to have act as a friend but we live through we day of happiness without notice they it be only when evil come upon we that we wish they back a thousand gay and pleasant hour be waste in ill-humor we let they slip by unenjoyed and sigh for they in vain when the sky be overcast those present moment that be bearable be they never so trite and common -- pass by in indifference or it may be impatiently push away -- those be the moment we should honor never fail to remember that the ebbing tide be even how hurry they into the past where memory will store they transfigure and shine with a imperishable light -- in some after-time and above all when we day be evil to raise the veil and present they as the object of we fondest regret section 6 _ limitation always make for happiness _ we be happy in proportion as we range of vision we sphere of work we point of contact with the world be restricted and circumscribe we be more likely to feel worried and anxious if these limit be wide for it mean that we care desire and terror be increase and intensify that be why the blind be not so unhappy as we might be incline to suppose otherwise there would not be that gentle and almost serene expression of peace in they face another reason why limitation make for happiness be that the second half of life prove even more dreary that the first as the year wear on the horizon of we aim and we point of contact with the world become more extend in childhood we horizon be limit to the narrowest sphere about we in youth there be already a very considerable widening of we view in manhood it comprise the whole range of we activity often stretch out over a very distant sphere -- the care for instance of a state or a nation in old age it embrace posterity but even in the affair of the intellect limitation be necessary if we be to be happy for the less the will be excite the less we suffer we have see that suffering be something positive and that happiness be only a negative condition to limit the sphere of outward activity be to relieve the will of external stimulus : to limit the sphere of we intellectual effort be to relieve the will of internal source of excitement this latter kind of limitation be attend by the disadvantage that it open the door to boredom which be a direct source of countless suffering for to banish boredom a man will have recourse to any means that may be handy -- dissipation society extravagance gaming and drinking and the like which in they turn bring mischief ruin and misery in they train _ difficile in otio quie _ -- it be difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do that limitation in the sphere of outward activity be conducive nay even necessary to human happiness such as it be may be see in the fact that the only kind of poetry which depict man in a happy state of life -- idyllic poetry i mean -- always aim as a intrinsic part of its treatment at represent they in very simple and restricted circumstance it be this feeling too which be at the bottom of the pleasure we take in what be call _ genre _ picture _ simplicity _ therefore as far as it can be attain and even _ monotony _ in we manner of life if it do not mean that we be bore will contribute to happiness just because under such circumstance life and consequently the burden which be the essential concomitant of life will be least feel we existence will glide on peacefully like a stream which no wave or whirlpool disturb section 7 whether we be in a pleasant or a painful state depend ultimately upon the kind of matter that pervade and engross we consciousness in this respect purely intellectual occupation for the mind that be capable of it will as a rule do much more in the way of happiness than any form of practical life with its constant alternation of success and failure and all the shock and torment it produce but it must be confess that for such occupation a pre-eminent amount of intellectual capacity be necessary and in this connection it may be note that just as a life devote to outward activity will distract and divert a man from study and also deprive he of that quiet concentration of mind which be necessary for such work so on the other hand a long course of thought will make he more or less unfit for the noisy pursuit of real life it be advisable therefore to suspend mental work for a while if circumstance happen which demand any degree of energy in affair of a practical nature section 8 to live a life that shall be entirely prudent and discreet and to draw from experience all the instruction it contain it be requisite to be constantly think back -- to make a kind of recapitulation of what we have do of we impression and sensation to compare we former with we present judgment -- what we set before we and struggle to achieve with the actual result and satisfaction we have obtain to do this be to get a repetition of the private lesson of experience -- lesson which be give to every one experience of the world may be look upon as a kind of text to which reflection and knowledge form the commentary where there be great deal of reflection and intellectual knowledge and very little experience the result be like those book which have on each page two line of text to forty line of commentary a great deal of experience with little reflection and scant knowledge give we book like those of the _ editio bipontina _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- where there be no note and much that be unintelligible -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ a series of greek latin and french classic publish at zweibräcken in the palatinate from and after the year 1779 cf butter _ ueber die bipontiner und die editione bipontinae _ -rrb- the advice here give be on a par with a rule recommend by pythagora -- to review every night before go to sleep what we have do during the day to live at random in the hurly-burly of business or pleasure without ever reflect upon the past -- to go on as it be pull cotton off the reel of life -- be to have no clear idea of what we be about and a man who live in this state will have chaos in he emotion and certain confusion in he thought as be soon manifest by the abrupt and fragmentary character of he conversation which become a kind of mincemeat a man will be all the more expose to this fate in proportion as he live a restless life in the world amid a crowd of various impression and with a correspondingly small amount of activity on the part of he own mind and in this connection it will be in place to observe that when event and circumstance which have influence we pass away in the course of time we be unable to bring back and renew the particular mood or state of feeling which they arouse in we : but we can remember what we be lead to say and do in regard to they and thus form as it be the result expression and measure of those event we should therefore be careful to preserve the memory of we thought at important point in we life and herein lie the great advantage of keep a journal section 9 to be self-sufficient to be all in all to oneself to want for nothing to be able to say _ omnium mea mecum porto _ -- that be assuredly the chief qualification for happiness hence aristotle 's remark -lrb- greek : hae eudaimonia ton autarchon estus -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- to be happy means to be self-sufficient -- can not be too often repeat it be at bottom the same thought as be present in the very well-turned sentence from chamfort : _ le bonheur n'est pas choose aisée : il est très difficile de le trouver en nous et impossible de le trouver ailleur _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ eudem eth _ vii ii 37 -rrb- for while a man can not reckon with certainty upon anyone but himself the burden and disadvantage the danger and annoyance which arise from have to do with other be not only countless but unavoidable there be no more mistaken path to happiness than worldliness revelry _ high life _ : for the whole object of it be to transform we miserable existence into a succession of joy delight and pleasure -- a process which can not fail to result in disappointment and delusion on a par in this respect with its _ obligato _ accompaniment the interchange of lie -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : as we body be conceal by the clothes we wear so we mind be veil in lie the veil be always there and it be only through it that we can sometimes guess at what a man really think just as from he clothes we arrive at the general shape of he body -rrb- all society necessarily involve as the first condition of its existence mutual accommodation and restraint upon the part of its member this mean that the larger it be the more insipid will be its tone a man can be _ himself _ only so long as he be alone and if he do not love solitude he will not love freedom for it be only when he be alone that he be really free constraint be always present in society like a companion of whom there be no riddance and in proportion to the greatness of a man 's individuality it will be hard for he to bear the sacrifice which all intercourse with other demand solitude will be welcome or endure or avoid accord as a man 's personal value be large or small -- the wretch feeling when he be alone the whole burden of he misery the great intellect delighting in its greatness and everyone in short be just what he be further if a man stand high in nature 's list it be natural and inevitable that he should feel solitary it will be a advantage to he if he surroundings do not interfere with this feeling for if he have to see a great deal of other people who be not of like character with himself they will exercise a disturbing influence upon he adverse to he peace of mind they will rob he in fact of himself and give he nothing to compensate for the loss but while nature set very wide difference between man and man in respect both of morality and of intellect society disregard and efface they or rather it set up artificial difference in they stead -- gradation of rank and position which be very often diametrically oppose to those which nature establish the result of this arrangement be to elevate those whom nature have place low and to depress the few who stand high these latter then usually withdraw from society where as soon as it be at all numerous vulgarity reign supreme what offend a great intellect in society be the equality of rights lead to equality of pretension which everyone enjoy while at the same time inequality of capacity mean a corresponding disparity of social power so-called _ good society _ recognize every kind of claim but that of intellect which be a contraband article and people be expect to exhibit a unlimited amount of patience towards every form of folly and stupidity perversity and dullness whilst personal merit have to beg pardon as it be for be present or else conceal itself altogether intellectual superiority offend by its very existence without any desire to do so the worst of what be call good society be not only that it offer we the companionship of people who be unable to win either we praise or we affection but that it do not allow of we be that which we naturally be it compel we for the sake of harmony to shrivel up or even alter we shape altogether intellectual conversation whether grave or humorous be only fit for intellectual society it be downright abhorrent to ordinary people to please whom it be absolutely necessary to be commonplace and dull this demand a act of severe self-denial we have to forfeit three-fourth of ourselves in order to become like other people no doubt they company may be set down against we loss in this respect but the more a man be worth the more he will find that what he gain do not cover what he lose and that the balance be on the debit side of the account for the people with whom he deal be generally bankrupt -- that be to say there be nothing to be get from they society which can compensate either for its boredom annoyance and disagreeableness or for the self-denial which it render necessary accordingly most society be so constitute as to offer a good profit to anyone who will exchange it for solitude nor be this all by way of provide a substitute for real -- i mean intellectual -- superiority which be seldom to be meet with and intolerable when it be find society have capriciously adopt a false kind of superiority conventional in its character and rest upon arbitrary principle -- a tradition as it be hand down in the higher circle and like a password subject to alteration i refer to _ bon-ton _ fashion whenever this kind of superiority come into collision with the real kind its weakness be manifest moreover the presence of _ good tone _ mean the absence of _ good sense _ no man can be in _ perfect accord _ with any one but himself -- not even with a friend or the partner of he life difference of individuality and temperament be always bring in some degree of discord though it may be a very slight one that genuine profound peace of mind that perfect tranquillity of soul which next to health be the highest blessing the earth can give be to be attain only in solitude and as a permanent mood only in complete retirement and then if there be anything great and rich in the man 's own self he way of life be the happiest that may be find in this wretched world let I speak plainly however close the bond of friendship love marriage -- a man ultimately look to himself to he own welfare alone at most to he child 's too the less necessity there be for you to come into contact with mankind in general in the relation whether of business or of personal intimacy the better off you be loneliness and solitude have they evil it be true but if you can not feel they all at once you can at least see where they lie on the other hand society be _ insidious _ in this respect as in offer you what appear to be the pastime of please social intercourse it work great and often irreparable mischief the young should early be train to bear be leave alone for it be a source of happiness and peace of mind it follow from this that a man be best off if he be throw upon he own resource and can be all in all to himself and cicero go so far as to say that a man who be in this condition can not fail to be very happy -- _ nemo potest non beatissimus esse qui est totus aptus ex sese quique in se uno ponit omnia _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- the more a man have in himself the less other can be to he the feeling of self-sufficiency it be that which restrain those whose personal value be in itself great riches from such considerable sacrifice as be demand by intercourse with the world let alone then from actually practice self-denial by go out of they way to seek it ordinary people be sociable and complaisant just from the very opposite feeling -- to bear other ' company be easier for they than to bear they own moreover respect be not pay in this world to that which have real merit it be reserve for that which have none so retirement be at once a proof and a result of be distinguish by the possession of meritorious quality it will therefore show real wisdom on the part of any one who be worth anything in himself to limit he requirement as may be necessary in order to preserve or extend he freedom and -- since a man must come into some relation with he fellow-men -- to admit they to he intimacy as little as possible -lrb- footnote 1 : _ paradoxa stoidorum _ : ii -rrb- i have say that people be render sociable by they ability to endure solitude that be to say they own society they become sick of themselves it be this vacuity of soul which drive they to intercourse with other -- to travels in foreign country they mind be want in elasticity it have no movement of its own and so they try to give it some -- by drink for instance how much drunkenness be due to this cause alone they be always look for some form of excitement of the strongest kind they can bear -- the excitement of be with people of like nature with themselves and if they fail in this they mind sink by its own weight and they fall into a grievous lethargy -lrb- 1 -rrb- such people it may be say possess only a small fraction of humanity in themselves and it require a great many of they put together to make up a fair amount of it -- to attain any degree of consciousness as man a man in the full sense of the word -- a man _ par excellence _ -- do not represent a fraction but a whole number : he be complete in himself -lrb- footnote 1 : it be a well-known fact that we can more easily bear up under evil which fall upon a great many people besides ourselves as boredom seem to be a evil of this kind people band together to offer it a common resistance the love of life be at bottom only the fear of death and in the same way the social impulse do not rest directly upon the love of society but upon the fear of solitude it be not alone the charm of be in other ' company that people seek it be the dreary oppression of be alone -- the monotony of they own consciousness -- that they would avoid they will do anything to escape it -- even tolerate bad companion and put up with the feeling of constraint which all society involve in this case a very burdensome one but if aversion to such society conquer the aversion to be alone they become accustomed to solitude and harden to its immediate effect they no longer find solitude to be such a very bad thing and settle down comfortably to it without any hankering after society -- and this partly because it be only indirectly that they need other ' company and partly because they have become accustomed to the benefit of be alone -rrb- ordinary society be in this respect very like the kind of music to be obtain from a orchestra compose of russian horn each horn have only one note and the music be produce by each note come in just at the right moment in the monotonous sound of a single horn you have a precise illustration of the effect of most people 's mind how often there seem to be only one think there and no room for any other it be easy to see why people be so bored and also why they be sociable why they like to go about in crowd -- why mankind be so _ gregarious _ it be the monotony of he own nature that make a man find solitude intolerable _ omni stultitium laborat fastidio suus _ : folly be truly its own burden put a great many man together and you may get some result -- some music from you horn a man of intellect be like a artist who give a concert without any help from anyone else playing on a single instrument -- a piano say which be a little orchestra in itself such a man be a little world in himself and the effect produce by various instrument together he produce single-handed in the unity of he own consciousness like the piano he have no place in a symphony : he be a soloist and perform by himself -- in solitude it may be or if in company with other instrument only as principal or for set the tone as in singing however those who be fond of society from time to time may profit by this simile and lay it down as a general rule that deficiency of quality in those we meet may be to some extent compensate by a increase in quantity one man 's company may be quite enough if he be clever but where you have only ordinary people to deal with it be advisable to have a great many of they so that some advantage may accrue by let they all work together -- on the analogy of the horn and may heaven grant you patience for you task that mental vacuity and barrenness of soul to which i have allude be responsible for another misfortune when man of the better class form a society for promote some noble or ideal aim the result almost always be that the innumerable mob of humanity come crowd in too as it always do everywhere like vermin -- they object be to try and get rid of boredom or some other defect of they nature and anything that will effect that they seize upon at once without the slightest discrimination some of they will slip into that society or push themselves in and then either soon destroy it altogether or alter it so much that in the end it come to have a purpose the exact opposite of that which it have at first this be not the only point of view from which the social impulse may be regard on cold day people manage to get some warmth by crowd together and you can warm you mind in the same way -- by bring it into contact with other but a man who have a great deal of intellectual warmth in himself will stand in no need of such resource i have write a little fable illustrate this : it may be find elsewhere -lrb- 1 -rrb- as a general rule it may be say that a man 's sociability stand very nearly in inverse ratio to he intellectual value : to say that so and so be very unsociable be almost tantamount to say that he be a man of great capacity -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ the passage to which schopenhauer refer be _ parerga _ : vol ii § 413 -lrb- 4th edition -rrb- the fable be of certain porcupine who huddle together for warmth on a cold day but as they begin to prick one another with they quill they be oblige to disperse however the cold drive they together again when just the same thing happen at last after many turn of huddle and disperse they discover that they would be best off by remain at a little distance from one another in the same way the need of society drive the human porcupine together -- only to be mutually repel by the many prickly and disagreeable quality of they nature the moderate distance which they at last discover to be the only tolerable condition of intercourse be the code of politeness and fine manners and those who transgress it be roughly tell -- in the english phrase -- _ to keep they distance _ by this arrangement the mutual need of warmth be only very moderately satisfied -- but then people do not get prick a man who have some heat in himself prefer to remain outside where he will neither prick other people nor get prick himself -rrb- solitude be doubly advantageous to such a man firstly it allow he to be with himself and secondly it prevent he be with other -- a advantage of great moment for how much constraint annoyance and even danger there be in all intercourse with the world _ tout notre mal _ say la bruyère _ vient de ne pouvoir être seul _ it be really a very risky nay a fatal thing to be sociable because it mean contact with nature the great majority of which be bad morally and dull or perverse intellectually to be unsociable be not to care about such people and to have enough in oneself to dispense with the necessity of they company be a great piece of good fortune because almost all we suffering spring from have to do with other people and that destroy the peace of mind which as i have say come next after health in the element of happiness peace of mind be impossible without a considerable amount of solitude the cynic renounce all private property in order to attain the bliss of have nothing to trouble they and to renounce society with the same object be the wisest thing a man can do bernardin de saint pierre have the very excellent and pertinent remark that to be spare in regard to food be a means of health in regard to society a means of tranquillity -- _ la diète des ailmen nous rend la santé du corps et celle des hommes la tranquillité de l'âme _ to be soon on friendly or even affectionate term with solitude be like win a gold mine but this be not something which everybody can do the prime reason for social intercourse be mutual need and as soon as that be satisfied boredom drive people together once more if it be not for these two reason a man would probably elect to remain alone if only because solitude be the sole condition of life which give full play to that feeling of exclusive importance which every man have in he own eye -- as if he be the only person in the world a feeling which in the throng and press of real life soon shrivel up to nothing get at every step a painful _ démenti _ from this point of view it may be say that solitude be the original and natural state of man where like another adam he be as happy as he nature will allow but still have adam no father or mother there be another sense in which solitude be not the natural state for at he entrance into the world a man find himself with parent brother sister that be to say in society and not alone accordingly it can not be say that the love of solitude be a original characteristic of human nature it be rather the result of experience and reflection and these in they turn depend upon the development of intellectual power and increase with the year speak generally sociability stand in inverse ratio with age a little child raise a piteous cry of fright if it be leave alone for only a few minute and later on to be shut up by itself be a great punishment young people soon get on very friendly term with one another it be only the few among they of any nobility of mind who be glad now and then to be alone -- but to spend the whole day thus would be disagreeable a grown-up man can easily do it it be little trouble to he to be much alone and it become less and less trouble as he advance in year a old man who have outlive all he friend and be either indifferent or dead to the pleasure of life be in he proper element in solitude and in individual case the special tendency to retirement and seclusion will always be in direct proportion to intellectual capacity for this tendency be not as i have say a purely natural one it do not come into existence as a direct need of human nature it be rather the effect of the experience we go through the product of reflection upon what we need really be proceed more especially from the insight we attain into the wretched stuff of which most people be make whether you look at they moral or they intellect the worst of it all be that in the individual moral and intellectual shortcoming be closely connected and play into each other 's hand so that all manner of disagreeable result be obtain which make intercourse with most people not only unpleasant but intolerable hence though the world contain many thing which be thoroughly bad the worst thing in it be society even voltaire that sociable frenchman be oblige to admit that there be everywhere crowd of people not worth talk to : _ la terre est couverte de gens qui ne méritent pas qu'on leur parle _ and petrarch give a similar reason for wish to be alone -- that tender spirit so strong and constant in he love of seclusion the stream the plain and wood know well he say how he have try to escape the perverse and stupid people who have miss the way to heaven : -- _ cercato ho sempre solitarium vita -lrb- le rive il sanno e le campagne e i boschi -rrb- per fuggir quest ' ingegni stortus e loschi che la strada del ciel ' hanno smarrita _ he pursue the same strain in that delightful book of he _ devita solitarium _ which seem to have give zimmerman the idea of he celebrated work on _ solitude _ it be the secondary and indirect character of the love of seclusion to which chamfort allude in the following passage couch in he sarcastic vein : _ on dit quelquefois d'un homme qui vit seul il n'aime pas la société c'est souvent comme si on disait d'un homme qu'il n'aime pas la promenade sous le pretexte qu'il ne se promène pas volontiers le soir dans le forêt de bondy _ you will find a similar sentiment express by the persian poet sadus in he _ garden of rose since that time _ he say _ we have take leave of society prefer the path of seclusion for there be safety in solitude _ angelus silesius -lrb- 1 -rrb- a very gentle and christian writer confess to the same feeling in he own mythical language herod he say be the common enemy and when as with joseph god warn we of danger we fly from the world to solitude from bethlehem to egypt or else suffering and death await we -- _ herode ist ein feind der joseph der verstand dem machte gott die gefahr im traum -lrb- in geist -rrb- bekannt die welt ist bethlehem aegypten einsamkeit fleuch meine seele fleuch sonst stirbest du vor leid _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ angelus silesius pseudonym for johanne scheffler a physician and mystic poet of the seventeenth century -lrb- 1624-77 -rrb- -rrb- giordano bruno also declare himself a friend of seclusion _ tantus uominus _ he say _ che in terra hanno voluto gustare vita celeste dissero con una voce ecce elongavi fugien et mansi in solitudine _ -- those who in this world have desire a foretaste of the divine life have always proclaim with one voice : _ lo then would i wander far off i would lodge in the wilderness _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : psalm lv 7 -rrb- and in the work from which i have already quote sadus say of himself : _ in disgust with my friend at damascus i withdraw into the desert about jerusalem to seek the society of the beast of the field _ in short the same thing have be say by all whom prometheus have form out of better clay what pleasure could they find in the company of people with whom they only common ground be just what be lowest and least noble in they own nature -- the part of they that be commonplace trivial and vulgar what do they want with people who can not rise to a higher level and for whom nothing remain but to drag other down to theirs for this be what they aim at it be a aristocratic feeling that be at the bottom of this propensity to seclusion and solitude rascal be always sociable -- more 's the pity and the chief sign that a man have any nobility in he character be the little pleasure he take in other ' company he prefer solitude more and more and in course of time come to see that with few exception the world offer no choice beyond solitude on one side and vulgarity on the other this may sound a hard thing to say but even angelus silesius with all he christian feeling of gentleness and love be oblige to admit the truth of it however painful solitude may be he say be careful not to be vulgar for then you may find a desert everywhere : -- _ die einsamkeit ist noth : doch seus nur nicht gemein so kannst du überall in einer wüste sein _ it be natural for great mind -- the true teacher of humanity -- to care little about the constant company of other just as little as the schoolmaster care for join in the gambol of the noisy crowd of boy which surround he the mission of these great mind be to guide mankind over the sea of error to the haven of truth -- to draw it forth from the dark abyss of a barbarous vulgarity up into the light of culture and refinement man of great intellect live in the world without really belong to it and so from they earliest year they feel that there be a perceptible difference between they and other people but it be only gradually with the lapse of year that they come to a clear understanding of they position they intellectual isolation be then reinforce by actual seclusion in they manner of life they let no one approach who be not in some degree emancipate from the prevail vulgarity from what have be say it be obvious that the love of solitude be not a direct original impulse in human nature but rather something secondary and of gradual growth it be the more distinguishing feature of nobler mind develop not without some conquest of natural desire and now and then in actual opposition to the prompting of mephistophele -- bidding you exchange a morose and soul-destroying solitude for life amongst man for society even the worst he say will give a sense of human fellowship : -- _ hör ' auf mit deinem gram zu spielen der wie ein geier dir be leben frisst : die schlechteste gesellschaft lässt dich fühlen dass du ein mensch mit menschen bist -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -lrb- footnote 1 : goethe 's _ faust _ part i 1281-5 -rrb- to be alone be the fate of all great mind -- a fate deplore at time but still always choose as the less grievous of two evil as the year increase it always become easier to say dare to be wise -- _ sapere aude _ and after sixty the inclination to be alone grow into a kind of real natural instinct for at that age everything combine in favor of it the strongest impulse -- the love of woman 's society -- have little or no effect it be the sexless condition of old age which lay the foundation of a certain self-sufficiency and that gradually absorb all desire for other ' company a thousand illusion and folly be overcome the active year of life be in most case go a man have no more expectation or plan or intention the generation to which he belong have pass away and a new race have spring up which look upon he as essentially outside its sphere of activity and then the year pass more quickly as we become older and we want to devote we remain time to the intellectual rather than to the practical side of life for provide that the mind retain its faculty the amount of knowledge and experience we have acquire together with the facility we have gain in the use of we power make it then more than ever easy and interesting to we to pursue the study of any subject a thousand thing become clear which be formerly envelop in obscurity and result be obtain which give a feeling of difficulty overcome from long experience of man we cease to expect much from they we find that on the whole people do not gain by a nearer acquaintance and that -- apart from a few rare and fortunate exception -- we have come across none but defective specimen of human nature which it be advisable to leave in peace we be no more subject to the ordinary illusion of life and as in individual instance we soon see what a man be make of we seldom feel any inclination to come into closer relation with he finally isolation -- we own society -- have become a habit as it be a second nature to we more especially if we have be on friendly term with it from we youth up the love of solitude which be formerly indulge only at the expense of we desire for society have now come to be the simple quality of we natural disposition -- the element proper to we life as water to a fish this be why anyone who possess a unique individuality -- unlike other and therefore necessarily isolate -- feel that as he become older he position be no longer so burdensome as when he be young for as a matter of fact this very genuine privilege of old age be one which can be enjoy only if a man be possess of a certain amount of intellect it will be appreciate most of all where there be real mental power but in some degree by every one it be only people of very barren and vulgar nature who will be just as sociable in they old age as they be in they youth but then they become troublesome to a society to which they be no longer suit and at most manage to be tolerate whereas they be formerly in great request there be another aspect of this inverse proportion between age and sociability -- the way in which it conduce to education the younger that people be the more in every respect they have to learn and it be just in youth that nature provide a system of mutual education so that mere intercourse with other at that time of life carry instruction with it human society from this point of view resemble a huge academy of learn on the bell and lancaster system oppose to the system of education by means of book and school as something artificial and contrary to the institution of nature it be therefore a very suitable arrangement that in he young day a man should be a very diligent student at the place of learn provide by nature herself but there be nothing in life which have not some drawback -- _ nihil est ab omnus parte beatum _ as horace say or in the word of a indian proverb _ no lotus without a stalk _ seclusion which have so many advantage have also its little annoyance and drawback which be small however in comparison with those of society hence anyone who be worth much in himself will get on better without other people than with they but amongst the disadvantage of seclusion there be one which be not so easy to see as the rest it be this : when people remain indoors all day they become physically very sensitive to atmospheric change so that every little draught be enough to make they ill so with we temper a long course of seclusion make it so sensitive that the most trivial incident word or even look be sufficient to disturb or to vex and offend we -- little thing which be unnoticed by those who live in the turmoil of life when you find human society disagreeable and feel yourself justified in fly to solitude you can be so constitute as to be unable to bear the depression of it for any length of time which will probably be the case if you be young let I advise you then to form the habit of take some of you solitude with you into society to learn to be to some extent alone even though you be in company not to say at once what you think and on the other hand not to attach too precise a meaning to what other say rather not to expect much of they either morally or intellectually and to strengthen yourself in the feeling of indifference to they opinion which be the surest way of always practice a praiseworthy toleration if you do that you will not live so much with other people though you may appear to move amongst they : you relation to they will be of a purely objective character this precaution will keep you from too close contact with society and therefore secure you against be contaminate or even outraged by it -lrb- 1 -rrb- society be in this respect like a fire -- the wise man warm himself at a proper distance from it not come too close like the fool who on get scorched run away and shiver in solitude loud in he complaint that the fire burn -lrb- footnote 1 : this restricted or as it be entrenched kind of sociability have be dramatically illustrate in a play -- well worth reading -- of moratin 's entitle _ el café o sea la comedia nuova _ -lrb- the cafe or the new comedy -rrb- chiefly by one of the character don pedro and especially in the second and third scene of the first act -rrb- section 10 _ envy _ be natural to man and still it be at once a vice and a source of misery -lrb- 1 -rrb- we should treat it as the enemy of we happiness and stifle it like a evil thought this be the advice give by seneca as he well put it we shall be please with what we have if we avoid the self-torture of compare we own lot with some other and happier one -- _ nostra nos sine comparatione delectent nunquam erit felix quem torquebit felicior -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ and again _ quum adspexeris quot te antecedent cogita quot sequantur _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- -- if a great many people appear to be better off than yourself think how many there be in a worse position it be a fact that if real calamity come upon we the most effective consolation -- though it spring from the same source as envy -- be just the thought of greater misfortune than ours and the next best be the society of those who be in the same luck as we -- the partner of we sorrow -lrb- footnote 1 : envy show how unhappy people be and they constant attention to what other do and leave undo how much they be bore -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ de ira _ : iii 30 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : epist xv -rrb- so much for the envy which we may feel towards other as regard the envy which we may excite in they it should always be remember that no form of hatred be so implacable as the hatred that come from envy and therefore we should always carefully refrain from do anything to rouse it nay as with many another form of vice it be better altogether to renounce any pleasure there may be in it because of the serious nature of its consequence aristocracy be of three kind : -lrb- 1 -rrb- of birth and rank -lrb- 2 -rrb- of wealth and -lrb- 3 -rrb- of intellect the last be really the most distinguish of the three and its claim to occupy the first position come to be recognize if it be only allow time to work so eminent a king as frederick the great admit it -- _ les âmes privilegiées rangent à l'égal des souverain _ as he say to he chamberlain when the latter express he surprise that voltaire should have a seat at the table reserve for king and prince whilst minister and general be relegate to the chamberlain 's every one of these aristocracy be surround by a host of envious person if you belong to one of they they will be secretly embittered against you and unless they be restrain by fear they will always be anxious to let you understand that _ you be no better than they _ it be by they anxiety to let you know this that they betray how greatly they be conscious that the opposite be the truth the line of conduct to be pursue if you be expose to envy be to keep the envious person at a distance and as far as possible avoid all contact with they so that there may be a wide gulf fix between you and they if this can not be do to bear they attack with the greatest composure in the latter case the very thing that provoke the attack will also neutralize it this be what appear to be generally do the member of one of these aristocracy usually get on very well with those of another and there be no call for envy between they because they several privilege effect a equipoise section 11 give mature and repeated consideration to any plan before you proceed to carry it out and even after you have thoroughly turn it over in you mind make some concession to the incompetency of human judgment for it may always happen that circumstance which can not be investigate or foresee will come in and upset the whole of you calculation this be a reflection that will always influence the negative side of the balance -- a kind of warn to refrain from unnecessary action in matter of importance -- _ quieta non movere _ but have once make up you mind and begin you work you must let it run its course and abide the result -- not worry yourself by fresh reflection on what be already accomplish or by a renewal of you scruple on the score of possible danger : free you mind from the subject altogether and refuse to go into it again secure in the thought that you give it mature attention at the proper time this be the same advice as be give by a italian proverb -- _ legalum bene e poi lascia la andare _ -- which goethe have translate thus : see well to you girth and then ride on boldly -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it may be observe in pass that a great many of the maxim which goethe put under the head of _ proverbial _ be translation from the italian -rrb- and if notwithstanding that you fail it be because human affair be the sport of chance and error socrate the wisest of man need the warning voice of he good genius or -lrb- greek : daimonion -rrb- to enable he to do what be right in regard to he own personal affair or at any rate to avoid mistake which argue that the human intellect be incompetent for the purpose there be a say -- which be report to have originate with one of the pope -- that when misfortune happen to we the blame of it at least in some degree attach to ourselves if this be not true absolutely and in every instance it be certainly true in the great majority of case it even look as if this truth have a great deal to do with the effort people make as far as possible to conceal they misfortune and to put the best face they can upon they for fear lest they misfortune may show how much they be to blame section 12 in the case of a misfortune which have already happen and therefore can not be alter you should not allow yourself to think that it might have be otherwise still less that it might have be avoid by such and such means for reflection of this kind will only add to you distress and make it intolerable so that you will become a tormentor to yourself -- -lrb- greek : heautontimoroumeaeo -rrb- it be better to follow the example of king david who as long as he son lay on the bed of sickness assail jehovah with unceasing supplication and entreaty for he recovery but when he be dead snap he finger and think no more of it if you be not light-hearted enough for that you can take refuge in fatalism and have the great truth reveal to you that everything which happen be the result of necessity and therefore inevitable however good this advice may be it be one-sided and partial in relieve and quiet we for the moment it be no doubt effective enough but when we misfortune have result -- as be usually the case -- from we own carelessness or folly or at any rate partly by we own fault it be a good thing to consider how they might have be avoid and to consider it often in spite of its be a tender subject -- a salutary form of self-discipline which will make we wiser and better man for the future if we have make obvious mistake we should not try as we generally do to gloss they over or to find something to excuse or extenuate they we should admit to ourselves that we have commit fault and open we eye wide to all they enormity in order that we may firmly resolve to avoid they in time to come to be sure that mean a great deal of self-inflicted pain in the shape of discontent but it should be remember that to spare the rod be to spoil the child -- -lrb- greek : ho mae dareis anthropo ou paideuetaus -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : menander monost : 422 -rrb- section 13 in all matter affect we weal or woe we should be careful not to let we imagination run away with we and build no castle in the air in the first place they be expensive to build because we have to pull they down again immediately and that be a source of grief we should be still more on we guard against distressing we heart by depict possible misfortune if these be misfortune of a purely imaginary kind or very remote and unlikely we should at once see on awake from we dream that the whole thing be mere illusion we should rejoice all the more in a reality better than we dream or at most be warn against misfortune which though very remote be still possible these however be not the sort of plaything in which imagination delight it be only in idle hour that we build castle in the air and they be always of a please description the matter which go to form gloomy dream be mischance which to some extent really threaten we though it be from some distance imagination make we look larger and nearer and more terrible than they be in reality this be a kind of dream which can not be so readily shake off on awake as a pleasant one for a pleasant dream be soon dispel by reality leave at most a feeble hope lie in the lap of possibility once we have abandon ourselves to a fit of the blues vision be conjure up which do not so easily vanish again for it be always just possible that the vision may be realize but we be not always able to estimate the exact degree of possibility : possibility may easily pass into probability and thus we deliver ourselves up to torture therefore we should be careful not to be over-anxious on any matter affect we weal or we woe not to carry we anxiety to unreasonable or injudicious limit but coolly and dispassionately to deliberate upon the matter as though it be a abstract question which do not touch we in particular we should give no play to imagination here for imagination be not judgment -- it only conjure up vision induce a unprofitable and often very painful mood the rule on which i be here insist should be most carefully observe towards evening for as darkness make we timid and apt to see terrifying shape everywhere there be something similar in the effect of indistinct thought and uncertainty always bring with it a sense of danger hence towards evening when we power of thought and judgment be relax -- at the hour as it be of subjective darkness -- the intellect become tired easily confuse and unable to get at the bottom of thing and if in that state we meditate on matter of personal interest to ourselves they soon assume a dangerous and terrifying aspect this be mostly the case at night when we be in bed for then the mind be fully relax and the power of judgment quite unequal to its duty but imagination be still awake night give a black look to everything whatever it may be this be why we thought just before we go to sleep or as we lie awake through the hour of the night be usually such confusion and perversion of fact as dream themselves and when we thought at that time be concentrate upon we own concern they be generally as black and monstrous as possible in the morning all such nightmare vanish like dream : as the spanish proverb have it _ noche tinta bianco el dia _ -- the night be color the day be white but even towards nightfall as soon as the candle be light the mind like the eye no longer see thing so clearly as by day : it be a time unsuited to serious meditation especially on unpleasant subject the morning be the proper time for that -- as indeed for all effort without exception whether mental or bodily for the morning be the youth of the day when everything be bright fresh and easy of attainment we feel strong then and all we faculty be completely at we disposal do not shorten the morning by get up late or waste it in unworthy occupation or in talk look upon it as the quintessence of life as to a certain extent sacred evening be like old age : we be languid talkative silly each day be a little life : every waking and rise a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every go to rest and sleep a little death but condition of health sleep nourishment temperature weather surroundings and much else that be purely external have in general a important influence upon we mood and therefore upon we thought hence both we view of any matter and we capacity for any work be very much subject to time and place so it be best to profit by a good mood -- for how seldom it come -- _ nehmt die gute stimmung wahr denn sie kommt so selten _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : goethe -rrb- we be not always able to form new idea about we surroundings or to command original thought : they come if they will and when they will and so too we can not always succeed in completely consider some personal matter at the precise time at which we have determine beforehand to consider it and just when we set ourselves to do so for the peculiar train of thought which be favorable to it may suddenly become active without any special call be make upon it and we may then follow it up with keen interest in this way reflection too choose its own time this reining-in of the imagination which i be recommend will also forbid we to summon up the memory of the past misfortune to paint a dark picture of the injustice or harm that have be do we the loss we have sustain the insult slight and annoyance to which we have be expose : for to do that be to rouse into fresh life all those hateful passion long lay asleep -- the anger and resentment which disturb and pollute we nature in a excellent parable proclus the neoplatonist point out how in every town the mob dwell side by side with those who be rich and distinguished : so too in every man be he never so noble and dignified there be in the depth of he nature a mob of low and vulgar desire which constitute he a animal it will not do to let this mob revolt or even so much as peep forth from its hiding-place it be hideous of mien and its rebel leader be those flight of imagination which i have be describe the smallest annoyance whether it come from we fellow-men or from the thing around we may swell up into a monster of dreadful aspect put we at we wit ' end -- and all because we go on brooding over we trouble and paint they in the most glaring color and on the largest scale it be much better to take a very calm and prosaic view of what be disagreeable for that be the easiest way of bear it if you hold small object close to you eye you limit you field of vision and shut out the world and in the same way the people or the thing which stand nearest even though they be of the very smallest consequence be apt to claim a amount of attention much beyond they due occupy we disagreeably and leave no room for serious thought and affair of importance we ought to work against this tendency section 14 the sight of thing which do not belong to we be very apt to raise the thought : _ ah if that be only mine _ make we sensible of we privation instead of that we should do better by more frequently put to ourselves the opposite case : _ ah if that be not mine _ what i mean be that we should sometimes try to look upon we possession in the light in which they would appear if we have lose they whatever they may be property health friend a wife or child or someone else we love we horse or we dog -- it be usually only when we have lose they that we begin to find out they value but if we come to look at thing in the way i recommend we shall be doubly the gainer we shall at once get more pleasure out of they than we do before and we shall do everything in we power to prevent the loss of they for instance by not risk we property or anger we friend or expose we wife to temptation or be careless about we child 's health and so on we often try to banish the gloom and despondency of the present by speculate upon we chance of success in the future a process which lead we to invent a great many chimerical hope every one of they contain the germ of illusion and disappointment be inevitable when we hope be shatter by the hard fact of life it be less hurtful to take the chance of misfortune as a theme for speculation because in do so we provide ourselves at once with measure of precaution against it and a pleasant surprise when it fail to make its appearance be it not a fact that we always feel a marked improvement in we spirit when we begin to get over a period of anxiety i may go further and say that there be some use in occasionally look upon terrible misfortune -- such as might happen to we -- as though they have actually happen for then the trivial reverse which subsequently come in reality be much easier to bear it be a source of consolation to look back upon those great misfortune which never happen but in follow out this rule care must be take not to neglect what i have say in the precede section section 15 the thing which engage we attention -- whether they be matter of business or ordinary event -- be of such diverse kind that if take quite separately and in no fixed order or relation they present a medley of the most glaring contrast with nothing in common except that they one and all affect we in particular there must be a corresponding abruptness in the thought and anxiety which these various matter arouse in we if we thought be to be in keep with they various subject therefore in set about anything the first step be to withdraw we attention from everything else : this will enable we to attend to each matter at its own time and to enjoy or put up with it quite apart from any thought of we remain interest we thought must be arrange as it be in little drawer so that we may open one without disturb any of the other in this way we can keep the heavy burden of anxiety from weigh upon we so much as to spoil the little pleasure of the present or from rob we of we rest otherwise the consideration of one matter will interfere with every other and attention to some important business may lead we to neglect many affair which happen to be of less moment it be most important for everyone who be capable of higher and nobler thought to keep they mind from be so completely engross with private affair and vulgar trouble as to let they take up all he attention and crowd out worthier matter for that be in a very real sense to lose sight of the true end of life -- _ propter vitam vivendus perdere causa _ of course for this -- as for so much else -- self-control be necessary without it we can not manage ourselves in the way i have describe and self-control may not appear so very difficult if we consider that every man have to submit to a great deal of very severe control on the part of he surroundings and that without it no form of existence be possible further a little self-control at the right moment may prevent much subsequent compulsion at the hand of other just as a very small section of a circle close to the center may correspond to a part near the circumference a hundred time as large nothing will protect we from external compulsion so much as the control of ourselves and as seneca say to submit yourself to reason be the way to make everything else submit to you -- _ si tibi vis omnia subjicere te subjice rationi _ self-control too be something which we have in we own power and if the worst come to the worst and it touch we in a very sensitive part we can always relax its severity but other people will pay no regard to we feeling if they have to use compulsion and we shall be treat without pity or mercy therefore it will be prudent to anticipate compulsion by self-control section 16 we must set limit to we wish curb we desire moderate we anger always remember that a individual can attain only a infinitesimal share in anything that be worth have and that on the other hand everyone must incur many of the ill of life in a word we must bear and forbear -- _ abstinere et sustinere _ and if we fail to observe this rule no position of wealth or power will prevent we from feel wretched this be what horace mean when he recommend we to study carefully and inquire diligently what will best promote a tranquil life -- not to be always agitate by fruitless desire and fear and hope for thing which after all be not worth very much : -- _ inter cuncta lege et percontabere doctos qua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido ne pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spe -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -lrb- footnote 1 : epist i xviii 97 -rrb- section 17 life consist in movement say aristotle and he be obviously right we exist physically because we organism be the seat of constant motion and if we be to exist intellectually it can only be by means of continual occupation -- no matter with what so long as it be some form of practical or mental activity you may see that this be so by the way in which people who have no work or nothing to think about immediately begin to beat the devil 's tattoo with they knuckle or a stick or anything that come handy the truth be that we nature be essentially _ restless _ in its character : we very soon get tire of have nothing to do it be intolerable boredom this impulse to activity should be regulate and some sort of method introduce into it which of itself will enhance the satisfaction we obtain activity -- do something if possible create something at any rate learn something -- how fortunate it be that man can not exist without that a man want to use he strength to see if he can what effect it will produce and he will get the most complete satisfaction of this desire if he can make or construct something -- be it a book or a basket there be a direct pleasure in see work grow under one 's hand day by day until at last it be finish this be the pleasure attach to a work of art or a manuscript or even mere manual labor and of course the higher the work the greater pleasure it will give from this point of view those be happiest of all who be conscious of the power to produce great work animated by some significant purpose : it give a higher kind of interest -- a sort of rare flavor -- to the whole of they life which by its absence from the life of the ordinary man make it in comparison something very insipid for richly endowed nature life and the world have a special interest beyond the mere everyday personal interest which so many other share and something higher than that -- a formal interest it be from life and the world that they get the material for they work and as soon as they be free from the pressure of personal need it be to the diligent collection of material that they devote they whole existence so with they intellect : it be to some extent of a two-fold character and devoted partly to the ordinary affair of every day -- those matter of will which be common to they and the rest of mankind and partly to they peculiar work -- the pure and objective contemplation of existence and while on the stage of the world most man play they little part and then pass away the genius live a double life at once a actor and a spectator let everyone then do something accord to the measure of he capacity to have no regular work no set sphere of activity -- what a miserable thing it be how often long travels undertake for pleasure make a man downright unhappy because the absence of anything that can be call occupation force he as it be out of he right element effort struggle with difficulty that be as natural to a man as grub in the ground be to a mole to have all he want satisfied be something intolerable -- the feeling of stagnation which come from pleasure that last too long to overcome difficulty be to experience the full delight of existence no matter where the obstacle be encounter whether in the affair of life in commerce or business or in mental effort -- the spirit of inquiry that try to master its subject there be always something pleasurable in the struggle and the victory and if a man have no opportunity to excite himself he will do what he can to create one and accord to he individual bent he will hunt or play cup and ball : or lead on by this unsuspected element in he nature he will pick a quarrel with some one or hatch a plot or intrigue or take to swindle and rascally course generally -- all to put a end to a state of repose which be intolerable as i have remark _ difficili in otio quie _ -- it be difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do section 18 a man should avoid be lead on by the phantom of he imagination this be not the same thing as to submit to the guidance of idea clearly think out : and yet these be rule of life which most people pervert if you examine closely into the circumstance which in any deliberation ultimately turn the scale in favor of some particular course you will generally find that the decision be influence not by any clear arrangement of idea lead to a formal judgment but by some fanciful picture which seem to stand for one of the alternative in question in one of voltaire 's or diderot 's romance -- i forget the precise reference -- the hero standing like a young hercule at the parting of way can see no other representation of virtue than he old tutor hold a snuff-box in he left hand from which he take a pinch and moralize whilst vice appear in the shape of he mother 's chambermaid it be in youth more especially that the goal of we effort come to be a fanciful picture of happiness which continue to hover before we eye sometimes for half and even for the whole of we life -- a sort of mock spirit for when we think we dream be to be realize the picture fade away leave we the knowledge that nothing of what it promise be actually accomplish how often this be so with the vision of domesticity -- the detailed picture of what we home will be like or of life among we fellow-citizen or in society or again of live in the country -- the kind of house we shall have its surroundings the mark of honor and respect that will be pay to we and so on -- whatever we hobby may be _ chaque fou a sa marotte _ it be often the same too with we dream about one we love and this be all quite natural for the vision we conjure up affect we directly as though they be real object and so they exercise a more immediate influence upon we will than a abstract idea which give merely a vague general outline devoid of detail and the detail be just the real part of it we can be only indirectly affect by a abstract idea and yet it be the abstract idea alone which will do as much as it promise and it be the function of education to teach we to put we trust in it of course the abstract idea must be occasionally explain -- paraphrase as it be -- by the aid of picture but discreetly _ cum grano salis _ section 19 the precede rule may be take as a special case of the more general maxim that a man should never let himself be master by the impression of the moment or indeed by outward appearance at all which be incomparably more powerful in they effect than the mere play of thought or a train of idea not because these momentary impression be rich in virtue of the datum they supply -- it be often just the contrary -- but because they be something palpable to the sens and direct in they work they forcibly invade we mind disturb we repose and shatter we resolution it be easy to understand that the thing which lie before we very eye will produce the whole of its effect at once but that time and leisure be necessary for the working of thought and the appreciation of argument as it be impossible to think of everything at one and the same moment this be why we be so allure by pleasure in spite of all we determination to resist it or so much annoy by a criticism even though we know that its author it totally incompetent to judge or so irritated by a insult though it come from some very contemptible quarter in the same way to mention no other instance ten reason for think that there be no danger may be outweigh by one mistaken notion that it be actually at hand all this show the radical unreason of human nature woman frequently succumb altogether to this predominate influence of present impression and there be few man so overweight with reason as to escape suffer from a similar cause if it be impossible to resist the effect of some external influence by the mere play of think the best thing to do be to neutralize it by some contrary influence for example the effect of a insult may be overcome by seek the society of those who have a good opinion of we and the unpleasant sensation of imminent danger may be avoid by fix we attention on the means of ward it off leibnitz -lrb- 1 -rrb- tell of a italian who manage to bear up under the torture of the rack by never for a moment cease to think of the gallows which would have await he have he reveal he secret he keep on cry out : _ i see it i see it _ -- afterwards explain that this be part of he plan -lrb- footnote 1 : _ nouveaux essai _ liv i ch 2 sec 11 -rrb- it be from some such reason as this that we find it so difficult to stand alone in a matter of opinion -- not to be make irresolute by the fact that everyone else disagree with we and act accordingly even though we be quite sure that they be in the wrong take the case of a fugitive king who be try to avoid capture how much consolation he must find in the ceremonious and submissive attitude of a faithful follower exhibit secretly so as not to betray he master 's strict _ incognito _ it must be almost necessary to prevent he doubt he own existence section 20 in the first part of this work i have insist upon the great value of _ health _ as the chief and most important element in happiness let I emphasize and confirm what i have there say by give a few general rule as to its preservation the way to harden the body be to impose a great deal of labor and effort upon it in the day of good health -- to exercise it both as a whole and in its several part and to habituate it to withstand all kind of noxious influence but on the appearance of a illness or disorder either in the body as a whole or in many of its part a contrary course should be take and every means use to nurse the body or the part of it which be affect and to spare it any effort for what be ail and debilitate can not be harden the muscle may be strengthen by a vigorous use of they but not so the nerve they be weaken by it therefore while exercise the muscle in every way that be suitable care should be take to spare the nerve as much as possible the eye for instance should be protect from too strong a light -- especially when it be reflect light -- from any strain of they in the dark or from the long-continued examination of minute object and the ear from too loud sound above all the brain should never be force or use too much or at the wrong time let it have a rest during digestion for then the same vital energy which form thought in the brain have a great deal of work to do elsewhere -- i mean in the digestive organ where it prepare chyme and chyle for similar reason the brain should never be use during or immediately after violent muscular exercise for the motor nerve be in this respect on a par with the sensory nerve the pain feel when a limb be wound have its seat in the brain and in the same way it be not really we leg and arm which work and move -- it be the brain or more strictly that part of it which through the medium of the spine excite the nerve in the limb and set they in motion accordingly when we arm and leg feel tired the true seat of this feeling be in the brain this be why it be only in connection with those muscle which be set in motion consciously and voluntarily -- in other word depend for they action upon the brain -- that any feeling of fatigue can arise this be not the case with those muscle which work involuntarily like the heart it be obvious then that injury be do to the brain if violent muscular exercise and intellectual exertion be force upon it at the same moment or at very short interval what i say stand in no contradiction with the fact that at the beginning of a walk or at any period of a short stroll there often come a feeling of enhance intellectual vigor the part of the brain that come into play have have no time to become tired and besides slight muscular exercise conduce to activity of the respiratory organ and cause a purer and more oxydated supply of arterial blood to mount to the brain it be most important to allow the brain the full measure of sleep which be require to restore it for sleep be to a man 's whole nature what wind up be to a clock -lrb- 1 -rrb- this measure will vary directly with the development and activity of the brain to overstep the measure be mere waste of time because if that be do sleep gain only so much in length as it lose in depth -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ of welt al wille und vorstellung _ 4th edition bk ii pp 236-40 -rrb- -lrb- footnote : 2 : _ cf loc : cit _ : p 275 sleep be a morsel of death borrow to keep up and renew the part of life which be exhaust by the day -- _ le sommeil est un emprunt fait à la mort _ or it might be say that sleep be the interest we have to pay on the capital which be call in at death and the higher the rate of interest and the more regularly it be pay the further the date of redemption be postpone -rrb- it should be clearly understand that thought be nothing but the organic function of the brain and it have to obey the same law in regard to exertion and repose as any other organic function the brain can be ruin by overstrain just like the eye as the function of the stomach be to digest so it be that of the brain to think the notion of a _ soul _ -- as something elementary and immaterial merely lodge in the brain and need nothing at all for the performance of its essential function which consist in always and unweariedly _ think _ -- have undoubtedly drive many people to foolish practice lead to a deadening of the intellectual power frederick the great even once try to form the habit of do without sleep altogether it would be well if professor of philosophy refrain from give currency to a notion which be attend by practical result of a pernicious character but then this be just what professorial philosophy do in its old-womanish endeavor to keep on good term with the catechism a man should accustom himself to view he intellectual capacity in no other light than that of physiological function and to manage they accordingly -- nursing or exercise they as the case may be remember that every kind of physical suffering malady or disorder in whatever part of the body it occur have its effect upon the mind the best advice that i know on this subject be give by cabani in he _ rapport du physique et du moral de l'homme _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ the work to which schopenhauer here refer be a series of essay by cabani a french philosopher -lrb- 1757-1808 -rrb- treat of mental and moral phenomenon on a physiological basis in he later day cabani completely abandon he materialistic standpoint -rrb- through neglect of this rule many man of genius and great scholar have become weak-minded and childish or even go quite mad as they grow old to take no other instance there can be no doubt that the celebrated english poet of the early part of this century scott wordsworth southey become intellectually dull and incapable towards the end of they day nay soon after pass they sixtieth year and that they imbecility can be trace to the fact that at that period of life they be all lead on by the promise of high pay to treat literature as a trade and to write for money this seduce they into a unnatural abuse of they intellectual power and a man who put he pegasus into harness and urge on he muse with the whip will have to pay a penalty similar to that which be exact by the abuse of other kind of power and even in the case of kant i suspect that the second childhood of he last four year be due to overwork in later life and after he have succeed in become a famous man every month of the year have its own peculiar and direct influence upon health and bodily condition generally nay even upon the state of the mind it be a influence dependent upon the weather chapter iii we relation to other -- section 21 in make he way through life a man will find it useful to be ready and able to do two thing : to look ahead and to overlook : the one will protect he from loss and injury the other from dispute and squabble no one who have to live amongst man should absolutely discard any person who have he due place in the order of nature even though he be very wicked or contemptible or ridiculous he must accept he as a unalterable fact -- unalterable because the necessary outcome of a eternal fundamental principle and in bad case he should remember the word of mephistophele : _ e muss auch solche käuze geben -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -- there must be fool and rogue in the world if he act otherwise he will be commit a injustice and give a challenge of life and death to the man he discard no one can alter he own peculiar individuality he moral character he intellectual capacity he temperament or physique and if we go so far as to condemn a man from every point of view there will be nothing leave he but to engage we in deadly conflict for we be practically allow he the right to exist only on condition that he become another man -- which be impossible he nature forbid it -lrb- footnote 1 : goethe 's _ faust _ part i -rrb- so if you have to live amongst man you must allow everyone the right to exist in accordance with the character he have whatever it turn out to be : and all you should strive to do be to make use of this character in such a way as its kind and nature permit rather than to hope for any alteration in it or to condemn it off-hand for what it be this be the true sense of the maxim -- live and let live that however be a task which be difficult in proportion as it be right and he be a happy man who can once for all avoid have to do with a great many of he fellow creature the art of put up with people may be learn by practice patience on inanimate object which in virtue of some mechanical or general physical necessity oppose a stubborn resistance to we freedom of action -- a form of patience which be require every day the patience thus gain may be apply to we dealings with man by accustom ourselves to regard they opposition wherever we encounter it as the inevitable outcome of they nature which set itself up against we in virtue of the same rigid law of necessity as govern the resistance of inanimate object to become indignant at they conduct be as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it roll into you path and with many people the wisest thing you can do be to resolve to make use of those whom you can not alter section 22 it be astonishing how easily and how quickly similarity or difference of mind and disposition make itself feel between one man and another as soon as they begin to talk : every little trifle show it when two people of totally different nature be converse almost everything say by the one will in a greater or less degree displease the other and in many case produce positive annoyance even though the conversation turn upon the most out-of-the-way subject or one in which neither of the party have any real interest people of similar nature on the other hand immediately come to feel a kind of general agreement and if they be cast very much in the same mould complete harmony or even unison will flow from they intercourse this explain two circumstance first of all it show why it be that common ordinary people be so sociable and find good company wherever they go ah those good dear brave people it be just the contrary with those who be not of the common run and the less they be so the more unsociable they become so that if in they isolation they chance to come across some one in whose nature they can find even a single sympathetic chord be it never so minute they show extraordinary pleasure in he society for one man can be to another only so much as the other be to he great mind be like eagle and build they nest in some lofty solitude secondly we be enable to understand how it be that people of like disposition so quickly get on with one another as though they be draw together by magnetic force -- kindred soul greet each other from afar of course the most frequent opportunity of observe this be afford by people of vulgar taste and inferior intellect but only because they name be legion while those who be better off in this respect and of a rarer nature be not often to be meet with : they be call rare because you can seldom find they take the case of a large number of people who have form themselves into a league for the purpose of carry out some practical object if there be two rascal among they they will recognize each other as readily as if they bear a similar badge and will at once conspire for some misfeasance or treachery in the same way if you can imagine -- _ per impossible _ -- a large company of very intelligent and clever people amongst whom there be only two blockhead these two will be sure to be draw together by a feeling of sympathy and each of they will very soon secretly rejoice at have find at least one intelligent person in the whole company it be really quite curious to see how two such man especially if they be morally and intellectually of a inferior type will recognize each other at first sight with what zeal they will strive to become intimate how affably and cheerily they will run to greet each other just as though they be old friend -- it be all so striking that one be tempt to embrace the buddhist doctrine of metempsychosis and presume that they be on familiar term in some former state of existence still in spite of all this general agreement man be keep apart who might come together or in some case a passing discord spring up between they this be due to diversity of mood you will hardly ever see two people exactly in the same frame of mind for that be something which vary with they condition of life occupation surroundings health the train of thought they be in at the moment and so on these difference give rise to discord between person of the most harmonious disposition to correct the balance properly so as to remove the disturbance -- to introduce as it be a uniform temperature -- be a work demand a very high degree of culture the extent to which uniformity of mood be productive of good-fellowship may be measure by its effect upon a large company when for instance a great many people be gather together and present with some objective interest which work upon all alike and influence they in a similar way no matter what it be -- a common danger or hope some great news a spectacle a play a piece of music or anything of that kind -- you will find they rouse to a mutual expression of thought and a display of sincere interest there will be a general feeling of pleasure amongst they for that which attract they attention produce a unity of mood by overpower all private and personal interest and in default of some objective interest of the kind i have mention recourse be usually have to something subjective a bottle of wine be not a uncommon means of introduce a mutual feeling of fellowship and even tea and coffee be use for a like end the discord which so easily find its way into all society as a effect of the different mood in which people happen to be for the moment also in part explain why it be that memory always idealize and sometimes almost transfigure the attitude we have take up at any period of the past -- a change due to we inability to remember all the fleeting influence which disturb we on any give occasion memory be in this respect like the lens of a _ camera obscura _ : it contract everything within its range and so produce a much finer picture than the actual landscape afford and in the case of a man absence always go some way towards secure this advantageous light for though the idealize tendency of the memory require time to complete its work it begin it at once hence it be a prudent thing to see you friend and acquaintance only at considerable interval of time and on meet they again you will observe that memory have be at work section 23 no man can see _ over he own height _ let I explain what i mean you can not see in another man any more than you have in yourself and you own intelligence strictly determine the extent to which he come within its grasp if you intelligence be of a very low order mental quality in another even though they be of the highest kind will have no effect at all upon you you will see nothing in they possessor except the meanest side of he individuality -- in other word just those part of he character and disposition which be weak and defective you whole estimate of the man will be confine to he defect and he higher mental quality will no more exist for you than color exist for those who can not see intellect be invisible to the man who have none in any attempt to criticise another 's work the range of knowledge possess by the critic be as essential a part of he verdict as the claim of the work itself hence intercourse with other involve a process of level down the quality which be present in one man and absent in another can not come into play when they meet and the self-sacrifice which this entail upon one of the party call forth no recognition from the other consider how sordid how stupid in a word how _ vulgar _ most man be and you will see that it be impossible to talk to they without become vulgar yourself for the time be vulgarity be in this respect like electricity it be easily distribute you will then fully appreciate the truth and propriety of the expression _ to make yourself cheap _ and you will be glad to avoid the society of people whose only possible point of contact with you be just that part of you nature of which you have least reason to be proud so you will see that in deal with fool and blockhead there be only one way of show you intelligence -- by have nothing to do with they that mean of course that when you go into society you may now and then feel like a good dancer who get a invitation to a ball and on arrive find that everyone be lame : -- with whom be he to dance section 24 i feel respect for the man -- and he be one in a hundred -- who when he be wait or sit unoccupied refrain from rattle or beat time with anything that happen to be handy -- he stick or knife and fork or whatever else it may be the probability be that he be think of something with a large number of people it be quite evident that they power of sight completely dominate over they power of thought they seem to be conscious of existence only when they be make a noise unless indeed they happen to be smoking for this serve a similar end it be for the same reason that they never fail to be all eye and ear for what be go on around they section 25 la rochefoucauld make the striking remark that it be difficult to feel deep veneration and great affection for one and the same person if this be so we shall have to choose whether it be veneration or love that we want from we fellow-men they love be always selfish though in very different way and the means use to gain it be not always of a kind to make we proud a man be love by other mainly in the degree in which he moderate he claim on they good feeling and intelligence : but he must act genuinely in the matter and without dissimulation -- not merely out of forbearance which be at bottom a kind of contempt this call to mind a very true observation of helvetius -lrb- 1 -rrb- : _ the amount of intellect necessary to please we be a most accurate measure of the amount of intellect we have ourselves _ with these remark as premise it be easy to draw the conclusion -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ helvetius claude-adrien -lrb- 1715-71 -rrb- a french philosophical writer much esteem by schopenhauer he chief work _ de l'esprit _ excite great interest and opposition at the time of its publication on account of the author 's pronounced materialism -rrb- now with veneration the case be just the opposite it be wring from man reluctantly and for that very reason mostly conceal hence as compare with love veneration give more real satisfaction for it be connect with personal value and the same be not directly true of love which be subjective in its nature whilst veneration be objective to be sure it be more useful to be love than to be venerate section 26 most man be so thoroughly subjective that nothing really interest they but themselves they always think of they own case as soon as ever any remark be make and they whole attention be engross and absorb by the merest chance reference to anything which affect they personally be it never so remote : with the result that they have no power leave for form a objective view of thing should the conversation take that turn neither can they admit any validity in argument which tell against they interest or they vanity hence they attention be easily distract they be so readily offend insult or annoy that in discuss any impersonal matter with they no care be too great to avoid let you remark bear the slightest possible reference to the very worthy and sensitive individual whom you have before you for anything you may say will perhaps hurt they feeling people really care about nothing that do not affect they personally true and striking observation fine subtle and witty thing be lose upon they : they can not understand or feel they but anything that disturb they petty vanity in the most remote and indirect way or reflect prejudicially upon they exceedingly precious self -- to that they be most tenderly sensitive in this respect they be like the little dog whose toe you be so apt to tread upon inadvertently -- you know it by the shrill bark it set up : or again they resemble a sick man cover with sore and boil with whom the greatest care must be take to avoid unnecessary handling and in some people this feeling reach such a pass that if they be talk with anyone and he exhibit or do not sufficiently conceal he intelligence and discernment they look upon it as a downright insult although for the moment they hide they ill will and the unsuspecting author of it afterwards ruminate in vain upon they conduct and rack he brain to discover what he could possibly have do to excite they malice and hatred but it be just as easy to flatter and win they over and this be why they judgment be usually corrupt and why they opinion be sway not by what be really true and right but by the favor of the party or class to which they belong and the ultimate reason of it all be that in such people force of will greatly predominate over knowledge and hence they meager intellect be wholly give up to the service of the will and can never free itself from that service for a moment astrology furnish a magnificent proof of this miserable subjective tendency in man which lead they to see everything only as bear upon themselves and to think of nothing that be not straightway make into a personal matter the aim of astrology be to bring the motion of the celestial body into relation with the wretched _ ego _ and to establish a connection between a comet in the sky and squabble and rascality on earth -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see for instance stobasus _ eclog i _ xxii 9 -rrb- section 27 when any wrong statement be make whether in public or in society or in book and well receive -- or at any rate not refute -- that that be no reason why you should despair or think there the matter will rest you should comfort yourself with the reflection that the question will be afterwards gradually subject to examination light will be throw upon it it will be think over consider discuss and generally in the end the correct view will be reach so that after a time -- the length of which will depend upon the difficulty of the subject -- everyone will come to understand that which a clear head see at once in the meantime of course you must have patience he who can see truly in the midst of general infatuation be like a man whose watch keep good time when all clock in the town in which he live be wrong he alone know the right time but what use be that to he for everyone go by the clock which speak false not even except those who know that he watch be the only one that be right section 28 man be like child in that if you spoil they they become naughty therefore it be well not to be too indulgent or charitable with anyone you may take it as a general rule that you will not lose a friend by refuse he a loan but that you be very likely to do so by grant it and for similar reason you will not readily alienate people by be somewhat proud and careless in you behavior but if you be very kind and complaisant towards they you will often make they arrogant and intolerable and so a breach will ensue there be one thing that more than any other throw people absolutely off they balance -- the thought that you be dependent upon they this be sure to produce a insolent and domineering manner towards you there be some people indeed who become rude if you enter into any kind of relation with they for instance if you have occasion to converse with they frequently upon confidential matter they soon come to fancy that they can take liberty with you and so they try and transgress the law of politeness this be why there be so few with whom you care to become more intimate and why you should avoid familiarity with vulgar people if a man come to think that i be more dependent upon he than he be upon I he at once feel as though i have steal something from he and he endeavor will be to have he vengeance and get it back the only way to attain superiority in deal with man be to let it be see that you be independent of they and in this view it be advisable to let everyone of you acquaintance -- whether man or woman -- feel now and then that you could very well dispense with they company this will consolidate friendship nay with most people there will be no harm in occasionally mix a grain of disdain with you treatment of they that will make they value you friendship all the more _ chus non istima vien stimato _ as a subtle italian proverb have it -- to disregard be to win regard but if we really think very highly of a person we should conceal it from he like a crime this be not a very gratifying thing to do but it be right why a dog will not bear be treat too kindly let alone a man section 29 it be often the case that people of noble character and great mental gift betray a strange lack of worldly wisdom and a deficiency in the knowledge of man more especially when they be young with the result that it be easy to deceive or mislead they and that on the other hand nature of the commoner sort be more ready and successful in make they way in the world the reason of this be that when a man have little or no experience he must judge by he own antecedent notion and in matter demand judgment a antecedent notion be never on the same level as experience for with the commoner sort of people a antecedent notion mean just they own selfish point of view this be not the case with those whose mind and character be above the ordinary for it be precisely in this respect -- they unselfishness -- that they differ from the rest of mankind and as they judge other people 's thought and action by they own high standard the result do not always tally with they calculation but if in the end a man of noble character come to see as the effect of he own experience or by the lesson he learn from other what it be that may be expect of man in general -- namely that five-sixth of they be morally and intellectually so constitute that if circumstance do not place you in relation with they you have better get out of they way and keep as far as possible from have anything to do with they -- still he will scarcely ever attain a adequate notion of they wretchedly mean and shabby nature : all he life long he will have to be extend and add to the inferior estimate he form of they and in the meantime he will commit a great many mistake and do himself harm then again after he have really take to heart the lesson that have be teach he it will occasionally happen that when he be in the society of people whom he do not know he will be surprise to find how thoroughly reasonable they all appear to be both in they conversation and in they demeanor -- in fact quite honest sincere virtuous and trustworthy people and at the same time shrewd and clever but that ought not to perplex he nature be not like those bad poet who in set a fool or a knave before we do they work so clumsily and with such evident design that you might almost fancy you see the poet standing behind each of he character and continually disavow they sentiment and tell you in a tone of warning : _ this be a knave that be a fool do not mind what he say _ but nature go to work like shakespeare and goethe poet who make every one of they character -- even if it be the devil himself -- appear to be quite in the right for the moment that they come before we in they several part the character be describe so objectively that they excite we interest and compel we to sympathize with they point of view for like the work of nature every one of these character be evolve as the result of some hidden law or principle which make all they say and do appear natural and therefore necessary and you will always be the prey or the plaything of the devil and fool in this world if you expect to see they go about with horn or jangle they bell and it should be bear in mind that in they intercourse with other people be like the moon or like hunchback they show you only one of they side every man have a innate talent for mimicry -- for make a mask out of he physiognomy so that he can always look as if he really be what he pretend to be and since he make he calculation always within the line of he individual nature the appearance he put on suit he to a nicety and its effect be extremely deceptive he don he mask whenever he object be to flatter himself into some one 's good opinion and you may pay just as much attention to it as if it be make of wax or cardboard never forget that excellent italian proverb : _ non é si tristo cane che non meni la coda _ -- there be no dog so bad but that he will wag he tail in any case it be well to take care not to form a highly favorable opinion of a person whose acquaintance you have only recently make for otherwise you be very likely to be disappointed and then you will be ashamed of yourself and perhaps even suffer some injury and while i be on the subject there be another fact that deserve mention it be this a man show he character just in the way in which he deal with trifle -- for then he be off he guard this will often afford a good opportunity of observe the boundless egoism of man 's nature and he total lack of consideration for other and if these defect show themselves in small thing or merely in he general demeanor you will find that they also underlie he action in matter of importance although he may disguise the fact this be a opportunity which should not be miss if in the little affair of every day -- the trifle of life those matter to which the rule _ de minimis non _ apply -- a man be inconsiderate and seek only what be advantageous or convenient to himself to the prejudice of other ' rights if he appropriate to himself that which belong to all alike you may be sure there be no justice in he heart and that he would be a scoundrel on a wholesale scale only that law and compulsion bind he hand do not trust he beyond you door he who be not afraid to break the law of he own private circle will break those of the state when he can do so with impunity if the average man be so constitute that the good in he outweigh the bad it would be more advisable to rely upon he sense of justice fairness gratitude fidelity love or compassion than to work upon he fear but as the contrary be the case and it be the bad that outweigh the good the opposite course be the more prudent one if any person with whom we be associate or have to do exhibit unpleasant or annoying quality we have only to ask ourselves whether or not this person be of so much value to we that we can put up with frequent and repeated exhibition of the same quality in a somewhat aggravate form -lrb- 1 -rrb- in case of a affirmative answer to this question there will not be much to be say because talk be very little use we must let the matter pass with or without some notice but we should nevertheless remember that we be thereby expose ourselves to a repetition of the offence if the answer be in the negative we must break with we worthy friend at once and forever or in the case of a servant dismiss he for he will inevitably repeat the offence or do something tantamount to it should the occasion return even though for the moment he be deep and sincere in he assurance of the contrary there be nothing absolutely nothing that a man can not forget -- but not _ himself he own character _ for character be incorrigible because all a man 's action emanate from a inward principle in virtue of which he must always do the same thing under like circumstance and he can not do otherwise let I refer to my prize essay on the so-called _ freedom of the will _ the perusal of which will dissipate any delusion the reader may have on this subject -lrb- footnote 1 : to _ forgive and forget _ mean to throw away dearly buy experience -rrb- to become reconcile to a friend with whom you have break be a form of weakness and you pay the penalty of it when he take the first opportunity of do precisely the very thing which bring about the breach nay he do it the more boldly because he be secretly conscious that you can not get on without he this be also applicable to servant whom you have dismiss and then take into you service again for the same reason you should just as little expect people to continue to act in a similar way under altered circumstance the truth be that man alter they demeanor and sentiment just as fast as they interest change and they resign in this respect be a bill draw for short payment that the man must be still more short-sighted who accept the bill without protest it accordingly suppose you want to know how a man will behave in a office into which you think of put he you should not build upon expectation on he promise or assurance for even allow that he be quite sincere he be speak about a matter of which he have no knowledge the only way to calculate how he will behave be to consider the circumstance in which he will be place and the extent to which they will conflict with he character if you wish to get a clear and profound insight -- and it be very needful -- into the true but melancholy element of which most man be make you will find in a very instructive thing to take the way they behave in the page of literature as a commentary to they doings in practical life and _ vice versa _ the experience thus gain will be very useful in avoid wrong idea whether about yourself or about other but if you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity -- in life or in literature -- you must be careful not to let it annoy or distress you but to look upon it merely as a addition to you knowledge -- a new fact to be consider in study the character of humanity you attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumble upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral of course there be some fact which be very exceptional and it be difficult to understand how they arise and how it be that there come to be such enormous difference between man and man but in general what be say long ago be quite true and the world be in a very bad way in savage country they eat one another in civilized they deceive one another and that be what people call the way of the world what be state and all the elaborate system of political machinery and the rule of force whether in home or in foreign affair -- what be they but barrier against the boundless iniquity of mankind do not all history show that whenever a king be firmly plant on a throne and he people reach some degree of prosperity he use it to lead he army like a band of robber against adjoining country be not almost all war ultimately undertake for purpose of plunder in the most remote antiquity and to some extent also in the middle age the conquer become slave -- in other word they have to work for those who conquer they and where be the difference between that and pay war-tax which represent the product of we previous work all war say voltaire be a matter of robbery and the german should take that as a warning section 30 no man be so form that he can be leave entirely to himself to go he own way everyone need to be guide by a preconceived plan and to follow certain general rule but if this be carry too far and a man try to take on a character which be not natural or innate in he but it artificially acquire and evolve merely by a process of reasoning he will very soon discover that nature can not be force and that if you drive it out it will return despite you effort : -- _ naturam expelle furca taman usque recurret _ to understand a rule govern conduct towards other even to discover it for oneself and to express it neatly be easy enough and still very soon afterwards the rule may be break in practice but that be no reason for despair and you need not fancy that as it be impossible to regulate you life in accordance with abstract idea and maxim it be better to live just as you please here as in all theoretical instruction that aim at a practical result the first thing to do be to understand the rule the second thing be to learn the practice of it the theory may be understand at once by a effort of reason and yet the practice of it acquire only in course of time a pupil may lean the various note on a instrument of music or the different position in fencing and when he make a mistake as he be sure to do however hard he try he be apt to think it will be impossible to observe the rule when he be set to read music at sight or challenge to a furious duel but for all that gradual practice make he perfect through a long series of slip blunder and fresh effort it be just the same in other thing in learn to write and speak latin a man will forget the grammatical rule it be only by long practice that a blockhead turn into a courtier that a passionate man become shrewd and worldly-wise or a frank person reserve or a noble person ironical but though self-discipline of this kind be the result of long habit it always work by a sort of external compulsion which nature never cease to resist and sometimes unexpectedly overcome the difference between action in accordance with abstract principle and action as the result of original innate tendency be the same as that between a work of art say a watch -- where form and movement be impressed upon shapeless and inert matter -- and a living organism where form and matter be one and each be inseparable from the other there be a maxim attribute to the emperor napoleon which express this relation between acquire and innate character and confirm what i have say : _ everything that be unnatural be imperfect _ -- a rule of universal application whether in the physical or in the moral sphere the only exception i can think of to this rule be aventurine -lrb- 1 -rrb- a substance know to mineralogist which in its natural state can not compare with the artificial preparation of it -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ aventurine be a rare kind of quartz and the same name be give to a brownish-colored glass much resemble it which be manufacture at murano it be so call from the fact that the glass be discover by chance _ -lrb- arventura -rrb- _ -rrb- and in this connection let I utter a word of protest against any and every form of _ affectation _ it always arouse contempt in the first place because it argue deception and the deception be cowardly for it be base on fear and secondly it argue self-condemnation because it mean that a man be try to appear what he be not and therefore something which he thing better than he actually be to affect a quality and to plume yourself upon it be just to confess that you have not get it whether it be courage or learning or intellect or wit or success with woman or riches or social position or whatever else it may be that a man boast of you may conclude by he boast about it that that be precisely the direction in which he be rather weak for if a man really possess any faculty to the full it will not occur to he to make a great show of affect it he be quite content to know that he have it that be the application of the spanish proverb : _ herradura que chacolotea clavo le falta _ -- a clatter hoof mean a nail go to be sure as i say at first no man ought to let the rein go quite loose and show himself just as he be for there be many evil and bestial side to we nature which require to be hide away out of sight and this justify the negative attitude of dissimulation but it do not justify a positive feigning of quality which be not there it should also be remember that affectation be recognize at once even before it be clear what it be that be be affect and finally affectation can not last very long and one day the mask will fall off _ nemo potest personam diu ferre fictam _ say seneca -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ ficta cito in naturam suam recidunt _ -- no one can persevere long in a fictitious character for nature will soon reassert itself -lrb- footnote 1 : _ de clementium i _ 1 -rrb- section 31 a man bear the weight of he own body without know it but he soon feel the weight of any other if he try to move it in the same way a man can see other people 's shortcoming 's and vice but he be blind to he own this arrangement have one advantage : it turn other people into a kind of mirror in which a man can see clearly everything that be vicious faulty ill-bred and loathsome in he own nature only it be generally the old story of the dog bark at be own image it be himself that he see and not another dog as he fancy he who criticise other work at the reformation of himself those who form the secret habit of scrutinize other people 's general behavior and pass severe judgment upon what they do and leave undo thereby improve themselves and work out they own perfection : for they will have sufficient sense of justice or at any rate enough pride and vanity to avoid in they own case that which they condemn so harshly elsewhere but tolerant people be just the opposite and claim for themselves the same indulgence that they extend to other -- _ hanc veniam damus petimusque vicissim _ it be all very well for the bible to talk about the mote in another 's eye and the beam in one 's own the nature of the eye be to look not at itself but at other thing and therefore to observe and blame fault in another be a very suitable way of become conscious of one 's own we require a looking-glass for the due dress of we moral the same rule apply in the case of style and fine write if instead of condemn you applaud some new folly in these matter you will imitate it that be just why literary folly have such vogue in germany the german be a very tolerant people -- everybody can see that they maxim be -- _ hanc veniam damn petimusque vicissim _ section 32 when he be young a man of noble character fancy that the relation prevail amongst mankind and the alliance to which these relation lead be at bottom and essentially _ ideal _ in they nature that be to say that they rest upon similarity of disposition or sentiment or taste or intellectual power and so on but later on he find out that it be a _ real _ foundation which underlie these alliance that they be base upon some _ material _ interest this be the true foundation of almost all alliance : nay most man have no notion of a alliance rest upon any other basis accordingly we find that a man be always measure by the office he hold or by he occupation nationality or family relation -- in a word by the position and character which have be assign he in the conventional arrangement of life where he be ticket and treat as so much goods reference to what he be in himself as a man -- to the measure of he own personal quality -- be never make unless for convenience ' sake : and so that view of a man be something exceptional to be set aside and ignore the moment that anyone find it disagreeable and this be what usually happen but the more of personal worth a man have the less pleasure he will take in these conventional arrangement and he will try to withdraw from the sphere in which they apply the reason why these arrangement exist at all be simply that in this world of ours misery and need be the chief feature : therefore it be everywhere the essential and paramount business of life to devise the means of alleviate they section 33 as paper-money circulate in the world instead of real coin so be the place of true esteem and genuine friendship you have the outward appearance of it -- a mimic show make to look as much like the real thing as possible on the other hand it may be ask whether there be any people who really deserve the true coin for my own part i should certainly pay more respect to a honest dog wag he tail than to a hundred such demonstration of human regard true and genuine friendship presuppose a strong sympathy with the weal and woe of another -- purely objective in its character and quite disinterested and this in its turn mean a absolute identification of self with the object of friendship the egoism of human nature be so strongly antagonistic to any such sympathy that true friendship belong to that class of thing -- the sea-serpent for instance -- with regard to which no one know whether they be fabulous or really exist somewhere or other still in many case there be a grain of true and genuine friendship in the relation of man to man though generally of course some secret personal interest be at the bottom of they -- some one among the many form that selfishness can take but in a world where all be imperfect this grain of true feeling be such a ennobling influence that it give some warrant for call those relation by the name of friendship for they stand far above the ordinary friendship that prevail amongst mankind the latter be so constitute that be you to hear how you dear friend speak of you behind you back you would never say another word to they apart from the case where it would be a real help to you if you friend be to make some great sacrifice to serve you there be no better mean of test the genuineness of he feeling than the way in which he receive the news of a misfortune that have just happen to you at that moment the expression of he feature will either show that he one thought be that of true and sincere sympathy for you or else the absolute composure of he countenance or the pass trace of something other than sympathy will confirm the well-known maxim of la rochefoucauld : _ dan l'adversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvon toujor quelque choose quus ne nous deplait pa _ indeed at such a moment the ordinary so-called friend will find it hard to suppress the sign of a slight smile of pleasure there be few way by which you can make more certain of put people into a good humor than by tell they of some trouble that have recently befall you or by unreservedly disclose some personal weakness of yours how characteristic this be of humanity distance and long absence be always prejudicial to friendship however disincline a man may be to admit we regard for people whom we do not see -- even though they be we dearest friend -- gradually dry up in the course of year and they become abstract notion so that we interest in they grow to be more and more intellectual -- nay it be keep up only as a kind of tradition whilst we retain a lively and deep interest in those who be constantly before we eye even if they be only pet animal this show how much man be limit by they sens and how true be the remark that goethe make in _ tasso _ about the dominant influence of the present moment : -- _ die gegenwart ist eine mächtige göttin _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : act iv se 4 -rrb- _ friend of the house _ be very rightly so call because they be friend of the house rather than of its master in other word they be more like cat than dog you friend will tell you that they be sincere you enemy be really so let you enemy ' censure be like a bitter medicine to be use as a means of self-knowledge a friend in need as the say go be rare nay it be just the contrary no sooner have you make a friend than he be in need and ask for a loan section 34 a man must be still a greenhorn in the way of the world if he imagine that he can make himself popular in society by exhibit intelligence and discernment with the immense majority of people such quality excite hatred and resentment which be render all the harder to bear by the fact that people be oblige to suppress -- even from themselves -- the real reason of they anger what actually take place be this a man feel and perceive that the person with whom he be converse be intellectually very much he superior -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf _ welt al will und vorstellung _ bk ii p 256 -lrb- 4th edit -rrb- where i quote from dr johnson and from merck the friend of goethe 's youth the former say : _ there be nothing by which a man exasperate most people more than by display a superior ability of brilliancy in conversation they seem pleased at the time but they envy make they curse he at they heart _ -lrb- boswell _ life of johnson _ aetat : 74 -rrb- -rrb- he thereupon secretly and half unconsciously conclude that he interlocutor must form a proportionately low and limited estimate of he ability that be a method of reasoning -- a enthymeme -- which rouse the bitterest feeling of sullen and rancorous hatred and so gracian be quite right in say that the only way to win affection from people be to show the most animal-like simplicity of demeanor -- _ para ser bien quisto el unico medio vestirse la piel del mas simple de los brutos _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- balthazar graeian _ oraculo manual y arte de prudencia _ 240 gracian -lrb- 1584-1658 -rrb- be a spanish prose writer and jesuit whose work deal chiefly with the observation of character in the various phenomenon of life schopenhauer among other have a great admiration for he worldly philosophy and translate he _ oraculo manual _ -- a system of rule for the conduct of life -- into german the same book be translate into english towards the close of the seventeenth century -rrb- to show you intelligence and discernment be only a indirect way of reproach other people for be dull and incapable and besides it be natural for a vulgar man to be violently agitate by the sight of opposition in any form and in this case envy come in as the secret cause of he hostility for it be a matter of daily observation that people take the greatest pleasure in that which satisfy they vanity and vanity can not be satisfy without comparison with other now there be nothing of which a man be prouder than of intellectual ability for it be this that give he he commanding place in the animal world it be a exceedingly rash thing to let any one see that you be decidedly superior to he in this respect and to let other people see it too because he will then thirst for vengeance and generally look about for a opportunity of take it by means of insult because this be to pass from the sphere of _ intellect _ to that of _ will _ -- and there all be on a equal footing as regard the feeling of hostility hence while rank and riches may always reckon upon deferential treatment in society that be something which intellectual ability can never expect to be ignore be the greatest favor show to it and if people notice it at all it be because they regard it as a piece of impertinence or else as something to which its possessor have no legitimate right and upon which he dare to pride himself and in retaliation and revenge for he conduct people secretly try and humiliate he in some other way and if they wait to do this it be only for a fitting opportunity a man may be as humble as possible in he demeanor and yet hardly ever get people to overlook he crime in stand intellectually above they in the _ garden of rose _ sadus make the remark : -- _ you should know that foolish people be a hundredfold more averse to meet the wise than the wise be indispose for the company of the foolish _ on the other hand it be a real recommendation to be stupid for just as warmth be agreeable to the body so it do the mind good to feel its superiority and a man will seek company likely to give he this feeling as instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk in the sun if he want to get warm but this mean that he will be dislike on account of he superiority and if a man be to be like he must really be inferior in point of intellect and the same thing hold good of a woman in point of beauty to give proof of real and unfeigned inferiority to some of the people you meet -- that be a very difficult business indeed consider how kindly and heartily a girl who be passably pretty will welcome one who be downright ugly physical advantage be not think so much of in the case of man though i suppose you would rather a little man sit next to you than one who be bigger than yourself this be why amongst man it be the dull and ignorant and amongst woman the ugly who be always popular and in request -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be likely to be say of such people that they be extremely good-natured because every one want to find a pretext for care about they -- a pretext which will blind both himself and other people to the real reason why he like they this be also why mental superiority of any sort always tend to isolate its possessor people run away from he out of pure hatred and say all manner of bad thing about he by way of justify they action beauty in the case of woman have a similar effect : very pretty girl have no friend of they own sex and they even find it hard to get another girl to keep they company a handsome woman should always avoid apply for a position as companion because the moment she enter the room she prospective mistress will scowl at she beauty as a piece of folly with which both for she own and for she daughter 's sake she can very well dispense but if the girl have advantage of rank the case be very different because rank unlike personal quality which work by the force of mere contrast produce its effect by a process of reflection much in the same way as the particular hue of a person 's complexion depend upon the prevail tone of he immediate surroundings -lrb- footnote 1 : if you desire to get on in the world friend and acquaintance be by far the best passport to fortune the possession of a great deal of ability make a man proud and therefore not apt to flatter those who have very little and from whom on that account the possession of great ability should be carefully conceal the consciousness of small intellectual power have just the opposite effect and be very compatible with a humble affable and companionable nature and with respect for what be mean and wretched this be why a inferior sort of man have so many friend to befriend and encourage he these remark be applicable not only to advancement in political life but to all competition for place of honor and dignity nay even for reputation in the world of science literature and art in learn society for example mediocrity -- that very acceptable quality -- be always to the fore whilst merit meet with tardy recognition or with none at all so it be in everything -rrb- section 35 we trust in other people often consist in great measure of pure laziness selfishness and vanity on we own part : i say _ laziness _ because instead of make inquiry ourselves and exercise a active care we prefer to trust other _ selfishness _ because we be lead to confide in people by the pressure of we own affair and _ vanity _ when we ask confidence for a matter on which we rather pride ourselves and yet for all that we expect people to be true to the trust we repose in they but we ought not to become angry if people put no trust in we : because that really mean that they pay honesty the sincere compliment of regard it as a very rare thing -- so rare indeed as to leave we in doubt whether its existence be not merely fabulous section 36 _ politeness _ -- which the chinese hold to be a cardinal virtue -- be base upon two consideration of policy i have explain one of these consideration in my _ ethic _ the other be as follow : -- politeness be a tacit agreement that people 's miserable defect whether moral or intellectual shall on either side be ignore and not make the subject of reproach and since these defect be thus render somewhat less obtrusive the result be mutually advantageous -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- in the passage refer to _ -lrb- grundlage der moral _ collect work vol iv pp 187 and 198 -rrb- schopenhauer explain politeness as a conventional and systematic attempt to mask the egoism of human nature in the small affair of life -- a egoism so repulsive that some such device be necessary for the purpose of conceal its ugliness the relation which politeness bear to the true love of one 's neighbor be analogous to that exist between justice as a affair of legality and justice as the real integrity of the heart -rrb- it be a wise thing to be polite consequently it be a stupid thing to be rude to make enemy by unnecessary and willful incivility be just as insane a proceeding as to set you house on fire for politeness be like a counter -- a avowedly false coin with which it be foolish to be stingy a sensible man will be generous in the use of it it be customary in every country to end a letter with the word : -- _ you most obedient servant _ -- _ votre très-humble serviteur _ -- _ suo devotissimo servo _ -lrb- the german be the only people who suppress the word _ servant _ -- _ diener _ -- because of course it be not true -rrb- however to carry politeness to such a extent as to damage you prospects be like give money where only counter be expect wax a substance naturally hard and brittle can be make soft by the application of a little warmth so that it will take any shape you please in the same way by be polite and friendly you can make people pliable and oblige even though they be apt to be crabbed and malevolent hence politeness be to human nature what warmth be to wax of course it be no easy matter to be polite in so far i mean as it require we to show great respect for everybody whereas most people deserve none at all and again in so far as it demand that we should feign the most lively interest in people when we must be very glad that we have nothing to do with they to combine politeness with pride be a masterpiece of wisdom we should be much less ready to lose we temper over a insult -- which in the strict sense of the word mean that we have not be treat with respect -- if on the one hand we have not such a exaggerated estimate of we value and dignity -- that be to say if we be not so immensely proud of ourselves and on the other hand if we have arrive at any clear notion of the judgment which in he heart one man generally pass upon another if most people resent the slightest hint that any blame attach to they you may imagine they feeling if they be to overhear what they acquaintance say about they you should never lose sight of the fact that ordinary politeness be only a grin mask : if it shift its place a little or be remove for a moment there be no use raise a hue and cry when a man be downright rude it be as though he have take off all he clothes and stand before you in _ puri naturalibus _ like most man in this condition he do not present a very attractive appearance section 37 you ought never to take any man as a model for what you should do or leave undo because position and circumstance be in no two case alike and difference of character give a peculiar individual tone to what a man do hence _ duo cum faciunt idem non est idem _ -- two person may do the same thing with a different result a man should act in accordance with he own character as soon as he have carefully deliberate on what he be about to do the outcome of this be that _ originality _ can not be dispense with in practical matter : otherwise what a man do will not accord with what he be section 38 never combat any man 's opinion for though you reach the age of methuselah you would never have do set he right upon all the absurd thing that he believe it be also well to avoid correct people 's mistake in conversation however good you intention may be for it be easy to offend people and difficult if not impossible to mend they if you feel irritated by the absurd remark of two people whose conversation you happen to overhear you should imagine that you be listen to a dialogue of two fool in a comedy _ probatum est _ the man who come into the world with the notion that he be really go to instruct in matter of the highest importance may thank he star if he escape with a whole skin section 39 if you want you judgment to be accept express it coolly and without passion all violence have its seat in the _ will _ and so if you judgment be express with vehemence people will consider it a effort of will and not the outcome of knowledge which be in its nature cold and unimpassioned since the will be the primary and radical element in human nature and _ intellect _ merely supervene as something secondary people be more likely to believe that the opinion you express with so much vehemence be due to the excited state of you will rather than that the excitement of the will come only from the ardent nature of you opinion section 40 even when you be fully justify in praise yourself you should never be seduce into do so for vanity be so very common and merit so very uncommon that even if a man appear to be praise himself though very indirectly people will be ready to lay a hundred to one that he be talk out of pure vanity and that he have not sense enough to see what a fool he be make of himself still for all that there may be some truth in bacon 's remark that as in the case of calumny if you throw enough dirt some of it will stick so it it also in regard to self-praise with the conclusion that self-praise in small dose be to be recommend -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- schopenhauer allude to the following passage in bacon 's _ de augmenti scientiarum _ bk viii ch 2 : _ sicut enim dici solet de calumnia _ audacter calumniare semper aliquid haeret _ sic dici potest de jactantium -lrb- nisi plane deformi fuerit et ridicula _ -rrb- audacter te vendita semper aliquid haeret _ haerebit certe apud populum licet prudentiore subrideant itaque existimatio parta apud plurimo paucorum fastidium abunde compensabit _ -rrb- section 41 if you have reason to suspect that a person be tell you a lie look as though you believe every word he say this will give he courage to go on he will become more vehement in he assertion and in the end betray himself again if you perceive that a person be try to conceal something from you but with only partial success look as though you do not believe he this opposition on you part will provoke he into lead out he reserve of truth and bring the whole force of it to bear upon you incredulity section 42 you should regard all you private affair as secret and in respect of they treat you acquaintance even though you be on good term with they as perfect stranger let they know nothing more than they can see for themselves for in course of time and under altered circumstance you may find it a disadvantage that they know even the most harmless thing about you and as a general rule it be more advisable to show you intelligence by say nothing than by speak out for silence be a matter of prudence whilst speech have something in it of vanity the opportunity for display the one or the other quality occur equally often but the fleeting satisfaction afford by speech be often prefer to the permanent advantage secure by silence the feeling of relief which lively people experience in speak aloud when no one be listen should not be indulge lest it grow into a habit for in this way think establish such very friendly term with speech that conversation be apt to become a process of think aloud prudence exact that a wide gulf should be fix between what we think and what we say at time we fancy that people be utterly unable to believe in the truth of some statement affect we personally whereas it never occur to they to doubt it but if we give they the slightest opportunity of doubt it they find it absolutely impossible to believe it any more we often betray ourselves into reveal something simply because we suppose that people can not help notice it -- just as a man will throw himself down from a great height because he lose he head in other word because he fancy that he can not retain a firm foot any longer the torment of he position be so great that he think it better to put a end to it at once this be the kind of insanity which be call _ acrophobia _ but it should not be forget how clever people be in regard to affair which do not concern they even though they show no particularly sign of acuteness in other matter this be a kind of algebra in which people be very proficient : give they a single fact to go upon and they will solve the most complicated problem so if you wish to relate some event that happen long ago without mention any name or otherwise indicate the person to whom you refer you should be very careful not to introduce into you narrative anything that might point however distantly to some definite fact whether it be a particular locality or a date or the name of some one who be only to a small extent implicate or anything else that be even remotely connect with the event for that at once give people something positive to go upon and by the aid of they talent for this sort of algebra they will discover all the rest they curiosity in these matter become a kind of enthusiasm : they will spur on they intellect and drive it forward to the attainment of the most remote result for however unsusceptible and different people may be to general and universal truth they be very ardent in the matter of particular detail in keep with what i have say it will be find that all those who profess to give instruction in the wisdom of life be specially urgent in commend the practice of silence and assign manifold reason why it should be observe so it be not necessary for I to enlarge upon the subject any further however i may just add one or two little known arabian proverb which occur to I as peculiarly appropriate : -- _ do not tell a friend anything that you would conceal from a enemy _ _ a secret be in my custody if i keep it but should it escape I it be i who be the prisoner _ _ the tree of silence bear the fruit of peace _ section 43 money be never spend to so much advantage as when you have be cheat out of it for at one stroke you have purchase prudence section 44 if possible no animosity should be feel for anyone but carefully observe and remember the manner in which a man conduct himself so that you may take the measure of he value -- at any rate in regard to yourself -- and regulate you bearing towards he accordingly never lose sight of the fact that character be unalterable and that to forget the bad feature in a man 's disposition be like throw away hard-won money thus you will protect yourself against the result of unwise intimacy and foolish friendship _ give way neither to love nor to hate _ be one-half of worldly wisdom : _ say nothing and believe nothing _ the other half truly a world where there be need of such rule as this and the follow be one upon which a man may well turn he back section 45 to speak angrily to a person to show you hatred by what you say or by the way you look be a unnecessary proceeding -- dangerous foolish ridiculous and vulgar anger and hatred should never be show otherwise than in what you do and feeling will be all the more effective in action in so far as you avoid the exhibition of they in any other way it be only cold-blooded animal whose bite be poisonous section 46 to speak without emphasize you word -- _ parler san accent _ -- be a old rule with those who be wise in the world 's way it mean that you should leave other people to discover what it be that you have say and as they mind be slow you can make you escape in time on the other hand to emphasize you meaning -- _ parler avec accent _ -- be to address they feeling and the result be always the opposite of what you expect if you be polite enough in you manner and courteous in you tone there be many people whom you may abuse outright and yet run no immediate risk of offend they chapter iv worldly fortune -- section 47 however vary the form that human destiny may take the same element be always present and so life be everywhere much of a piece whether it pass in the cottage or in the palace in the barrack or in the cloister alter the circumstance as much as you please point to strange adventure success failure life be like a sweet-shop where there be a great variety of thing odd in shape and diverse in color -- one and all make from the same paste and when man speak of some one 's success the lot of the man who have fail be not so very different as it seem the inequality in the world be like the combination in a kaleidoscope at every turn a fresh picture strike the eye and yet in reality you see only the same bit of glass as you see before section 48 a ancient writer say very truly that there be three great power in the world _ sagacity strength _ and _ luck _ -- -lrb- greek : suneto krato tuchu -rrb- i think the last be the most efficacious a man 's life be like the voyage of a ship where luck -- _ secunda aut adversa fortuna _ -- act the part of the wind and speed the vessel on its way or drive it far out of its course all that the man can do for himself be of little avail like the rudder which if work hard and continuously may help in the navigation of the ship and yet all may be lose again by a sudden squall but if the wind be only in the right quarter the ship will sail on so as not to need any steer the power of luck be nowhere better express than in a certain spanish proverb : _ da ventura a tu hijo y echa lo en el mar _ -- give you son luck and throw he into the sea still chance it may be say be a malignant power and as little as possible should be leave to its agency and yet where be there any giver who in dispense gift tell we quite clearly that we have no right to they and that we owe they not to any merit on we part but wholly to the goodness and grace of the giver -- at the same time allow we to cherish the joyful hope of receive in all humility further undeserved gift from the same hand -- where be there any giver like that unless it be _ chance _ who understand the kingly art of show the recipient that all merit be powerless and unavailing against the royal grace and favor on look back over the course of he life -- that _ labyrinthine way of error _ -- a man must see many point where luck fail he and misfortune come and then it be easy to carry self-reproach to a unjust excess for the course of a man 's life be in no wise entirely of he own make it be the product of two factor -- the series of thing that happen and he own resolve in regard to they and these two be constantly interact upon and modify each other and besides these another influence be at work in the very limited extent of a man 's horizon whether it be that he can not see very far ahead in respect of the plan he will adopt or that he be still less able to predict the course of future event : he knowledge be strictly confine to present plan and present event hence as long as a man 's goal be far off he can not steer straight for it he must be content to make a course that be approximately right and in follow the direction in which he think he ought to go he will often have occasion to tack all that a man can do be to form such resolve as from time to time accord with the circumstance in which he be place in the hope of thus manage to advance a step nearer towards the final goal it be usually the case that the position in which we stand and the object at which we aim resemble two tendency work with dissimilar strength in different direction and the course of we life be represent by they diagonal or resultant force terence make the remark that life be like a game at dice where if the number that turn up be not precisely the one you want you can still contrive to use it equally : -- _ in vita est hominum quasi cum ludas tesseris si illud quod maxime opus est jactu non cadit illud quod cecidit forte id arte ut corrigas _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- or to put the matter more shortly life be a game of card when the card be shuffle and deal by fate but for my present purpose the most suitable simile would be that of a game of chess where the plan we determine to follow be condition by the play of we rival -- in life by the caprice of fate we be compel to modify we tactic often to such a extent that as we carry they out hardly a single feature of the original plan can be recognize -lrb- footnote 1 : he seem to have be refer to a game something like backgammon -rrb- but above and beyond all this there be another influence that make itself feel in we life it be a trite say -- only too frequently true -- that we be often more foolish than we think on the other hand we be often wiser than we fancy ourselves to be this however be a discovery which only those can make of whom it be really true and it take they a long time to make it we brain be not the wisest part of we in the great moment of life when a man decide upon a important step he action be direct not so much by any clear knowledge of the right thing to do as by a inner impulse -- you may almost call it a instinct -- proceed from the deepest foundation of he be if later on he attempt to criticise he action by the light of hard and fast idea of what be right in the abstract -- those unprofitable idea which be learn by rote or it may be borrow from other people if he begin to apply general rule the principle which have guide other to he own case without sufficiently weigh the maxim that one man 's meat be another 's poison then he will run great risk of do himself a injustice the result will show where the right course lay it be only when a man have reach the happy age of wisdom that he be capable of just judgment in regard either to he own action or to those of other it may be that this impulse or instinct be the unconscious effect of a kind of prophetic dream which be forget when we awake -- lend we life a uniformity of tone a dramatic unity such as could never result from the unstable moment of consciousness when we be so easily lead into error so liable to strike a false note it be in virtue of some such prophetic dream that a man feel himself call to great achievement in a special sphere and work in that direction from he youth up out of a inner and secret feeling that that be he true path just as by a similar instinct the bee be lead to build up its cell in the comb this be the impulse which balthazar gracian call _ la gran sindéresis _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- the great power of moral discernment : it be something that a man instinctively feel to be he salvation without which he be lose -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- this obscure word appear to be derive from the greek _ sugtaereo _ -lrb- nt and polyb -rrb- meaning to observe strictly it occur in _ the doctor and student _ a series of dialogue between a doctor of divinity and a student on the law of england first publish in 1518 and be there -lrb- dialog i ch 13 -rrb- explain as a natural power of the soule set in the highest part thereof move and stir it to good and abhor evil this passage be copy into milton 's commonplace book edit _ horwood _ § 79 the word be also find in the dictionary of the spanish academy -lrb- vol vi of the year 1739 -rrb- in the sense of a innate discernment of moral principle where a quotation be give from madre maria de jesus abbess of the convent of the conception at agreda a mystical writer of the seventeenth century frequently consult by philip iv -- and again in the bolognese dictionary of 1824 with a similar meaning illustrate from the writings of salvinus -lrb- 1653-1729 -rrb- for these reference i be indebted to the kindness of mr norman maccoll -rrb- to act in accordance with abstract principle be a difficult matter and a great deal of practice will be require before you can be even occasionally successful it of ten happen that the principle do not fit in with you particular case but every man have certain innate _ concrete principle _ -- a part as it be of the very blood that flow in he vein the sum or result in fact of all he thought feeling and volition usually he have no knowledge of they in any abstract form it be only when he look back upon the course he life have take that he become aware of have be always lead on by they -- as though they form a invisible clue which he have follow unawares section 49 that time work great change and that all thing be in they nature fleeting -- these be truth that should never be forget hence in whatever case you may be it be well to picture to yourself the opposite : in prosperity to be mindful of misfortune in friendship of enmity in good weather of day when the sky be overcast in love of hatred in moment of trust to imagine the betrayal that will make you regret you confidence and so too when you be in evil plight to have a lively sense of happier time -- what a lasting source of true worldly wisdom be there we should then always reflect and not be so very easily deceive because in general we should anticipate the very change that the year will bring perhaps in no form of knowledge be personal experience so indispensable as in learn to see that all thing be unstable and transitory in this world there be nothing that in its own place and for the time it last be not a product of necessity and therefore capable of be fully justified and it be this fact that make circumstance of every year every month even of every day seem as though they might maintain they right to last to all eternity but we know that this can never be the case and that in a world where all be fleeting change alone endure he be a prudent man who be not only undeceived by apparent stability but be able to forecast the line upon which movement will take place -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ chance _ play so great a part in all human affair that when a man try to ward off a remote danger by present sacrifice the danger often vanish under some new and unforeseen development of event and then the sacrifice in addition to be a complete loss bring about such a altered state of thing as to be in itself a source of positive danger in the face of this new development in take measure of precaution then it be well not to look too far ahead but to reckon with chance and often to oppose a courageous front to a danger in the hope that like many a dark thunder-cloud it may pass away without break -rrb- but people generally think that present circumstance will last and that matter will go on in the future as they have clone in the past they mistake arise from the fact that they do not understand the cause of the thing they see -- cause which unlike the effect they produce contain in themselves the germ of future change the effect be all that people know and they hold fast to they on the supposition that those unknown cause which be sufficient to bring they about will also be able to maintain they as they be this be a very common error and the fact that it be common be not without its advantage for it mean that people always err in unison and hence the calamity which result from the error affect all alike and be therefore easy to bear whereas if a philosopher make a mistake he be alone in he error and so at a double disadvantage -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : i may remark parenthetically that all this be a confirmation of the principle lay down in _ die welt al wille und vorstellung _ -lrb- bk i p 94 : 4th edit -rrb- that error always consist in make _ a wrong inference _ that be in ascribe a give effect to something that do not cause it -rrb- but in say that we should anticipate the effect of time i mean that we should mentally forecast what they be likely to be i do not mean that we should practically forestall they by demand the immediate performance of promise which time alone can fulfill the man who make he demand will find out that there be no worse or more exacting usurer than time and that if you compel time to give money in advance you will have to pay a rate of interest more ruinous than any jew would require it be possible for instance to make a tree burst forth into leaf blossom or even bear fruit within a few day by the application of unslaked lime and artificial heat but after that the tree will wither away so a young man may abuse he strength -- it may be only for a few week -- by try to do at nineteen what he could easily manage at thirty and time may give he the loan for which he ask but the interest he will have to pay come out of the strength of he later year nay it be part of he very life itself there be some kind of illness in which entire restoration to health be possible only by let the complaint run its natural course after which it disappear without leave any trace of its existence but if the sufferer be very impatient and while he be still affect insist that he be completely well in this case too time will grant the loan and the complaint may be shake off but life-long weakness and chronic mischief will be the interest pay upon it again in time of war or general disturbance a man may require ready money at once and have to sell out he investment in land or consol for a third or even a still smaller fraction of the sum he would have receive from they if he could have wait for the market to right itself which would have happen in due course but he compel time to grant he a loan and he loss be the interest he have to pay or perhaps he want to go on a long journey and require the money : in one or two year he could lay by a sufficient sum out of he income but he can not afford to wait and so he either borrow it or deduct it from he capital in other word he get time to lend he the money in advance the interest he pay be a disorder state of he account and permanent and increasing deficit which he can never make good such be time 's usury and all who can not wait be its victim there be no more thriftless proceeding than to try and mend the measure pace of time be careful then not to become its debtor section 50 in the daily affair of life you will have very many opportunity of recognize a characteristic difference between ordinary people of prudence and discretion in estimate the possibility of danger in connection with any undertake a ordinary man will confine he inquiry to the kind of risk that have already attend such undertaking in the past whereas a prudent person will look ahead and consider everything that might possibly happen in the future have regard to a certain spanish maxim : _ lo que no acaece en un ano acaece en un rato _ -- a thing may not happen in a year and yet may happen within two minute the difference in question be of course quite natural for it require some amount of discernment to calculate possibility but a man need only have he sens about he to see what have already happen do not omit to sacrifice to evil spirit what i mean be that a man should not hesitate about spending time trouble and money or give up he comfort or restrict he aim and deny himself if he can thereby shut the door on the possibility of misfortune the most terrible misfortune be also the most improbable and remote -- the least likely to occur the rule i be give be best exemplify in the practice of insurance -- a public sacrifice make on the altar of anxiety therefore take out you policy of insurance section 51 whatever fate befall you do not give way to great rejoicing or great lamentation partly because all thing be full of change and you fortune may turn at any moment partly because man be so apt to be deceive in they judgment as to what be good or bad for they almost every one in he turn have lament over something which afterwards turn out to be the very best thing for he that could have happen -- or rejoice at a event which become the source of he greatest suffering the right state of mind have be finely portray by shakespeare : _ i have feel so many quirk of joy and grief that the first face of neither on the start can woman I unto ` t _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ all 's well that end well act ii sc 2 _ -rrb- and in general it may be say that if a man take misfortune quietly it be because he know that very many dreadful thing may happen in the course of life and so he look upon the trouble of the moment as only a very small part of that which might come this be the stoic temper -- never to be unmindful of the sad fate of humanity -- _ condicioni humanoe oblitus _ but always to remember that we existence be full of woe and misery : and that the ill to which we be expose be innumerable wherever he be a man need only cast a look around to revive the sense of human misery : there before he eye he can see mankind struggle and flounder in torment -- all for the sake of a wretched existence barren and unprofitable if he remember this a man will not expect very much from life but learn to accommodate himself to a world where all be relative and no perfect state exist -- always look misfortune in the face and if he can not avoid it meet it with courage it should never be forget that misfortune be it great or small be the element in which we live but that be no reason why a man should indulge in fretful complaint and like beresford -lrb- 1 -rrb- pull a long face over the _ misery of human life _ -- and not a single hour be free from they or still less call upon the deity at every flea-bite -- _ in pulicis morsu deum invocare _ we aim should be to look well about we to ward off misfortune by go to meet it to attain such perfection and refinement in avert the disagreeable thing of life -- whether they come from we fellow-men or from the physical world -- that like a clever fox we may slip out of the way of every mishap great or small remember that a mishap be generally only we own awkwardness in disguise -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- rev jame beresford -lrb- 1764-1840 -rrb- miscellaneous writer the full title of this he chief work be the misery of human life or the last groan of timothy testy and samuel sensitive with a few supplementary sigh from mr testy -rrb- the main reason why misfortune fall less heavily upon we if we have look upon its occurrence as not impossible and as the say be prepared ourselves for it may be this : if before this misfortune come we have quietly think over it as something which may or may not happen the whole of its extent and range be know to we and we can at least determine how far it will affect we so that if it really arrive it do not depress we unduly -- its weight be not feel to be greater than it actually be but if no preparation have be make to meet it and it come unexpectedly the mind be in a state of terror for the moment and unable to measure the full extent of the calamity it seem so far-reaching in its effect that the victim might well think there be no limit to they in any case its range be exaggerate in the same way darkness and uncertainty always increase the sense of danger and of course if we have think over the possibility of misfortune we have also at the same time consider the source to which we shall look for help and consolation or at any rate we have accustom ourselves to the idea of it there be nothing that better fit we to endure the misfortune of life with composure than to know for certain that _ everything that happen -- from the smallest up to the greatest fact of existence -- happen of necessity _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- a man soon accommodate himself to the inevitable -- to something that must be and if he know that nothing can happen except of necessity he will see that thing can not be other that they be and that even the strangest chance in the world be just as much a product of necessity as phenomenon which obey well-known rule and turn out exactly in accordance with expectation let I here refer to what i have say elsewhere on the soothing effect of the knowledge that all thing be inevitable and a product of necessity -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : this be a truth which i have firmly establish in my prize-essay on the _ freedom of the will _ where the reader will find a detailed explanation of the grounds on which it rest cf especially p 60 -lrb- schopenhauer 's work 4th edit vol iv -- _ tr _ -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : cf _ welt al wille und vorstellung _ bk i p 361 -lrb- 4th edit -rrb- -rrb- if a man be steep in the knowledge of this truth he will first of all do what he can and then readily endure what he must we may regard the petty vexation of life that be constantly happen as design to keep we in practice for bear great misfortune so that we may not become completely enervate by a career of prosperity a man should be as siegfried armed _ cap-à-pie _ towards the small trouble of every day -- those little difference we have with we fellow-men insignificant dispute unbecome conduct in other people petty gossip and many other similar annoyance of life he should not feel they at all much less take they to heart and brood over they but hold they at arm 's length and push they out of he way like stone that lie in the road and upon no account think about they and give they a place in he reflection section 52 what people commonly call _ fate _ be as a general rule nothing but they own stupid and foolish conduct there be a fine passage in homer -lrb- 1 -rrb- illustrate the truth of this remark where the poet praise -lrb- greek : maeti -rrb- -- shrewd council and he advice be worthy of all attention for if wickedness be atone for only in another world stupidity get its reward here -- although now and then mercy may be show to the offender -lrb- footnote 1 : _ iliad _ xxiii 313 sqq -rrb- it be not ferocity but cunning that strike fear into the heart and forebode danger so true it be that the human brain be a more terrible weapon than the lion 's paw the most finished man of the world would be one who be never irresolute and never in a hurry section 53 _ courage _ come next to prudence as a quality of mind very essential to happiness it be quite true that no one can endow himself with either since a man inherit prudence from he mother and courage from he father still if he have these quality he can do much to develop they by means of resolute exercise in this world _ where the game be play with loaded dice _ a man must have a temper of iron with armor proof to the blow of fate and weapon to make he way against man life be one long battle we have to fight at every step and voltaire very rightly say that if we succeed it be at the point of the sword and that we die with the weapon in we hand -- on _ ne réussit dan ce monde qua la pointe de l'épee et on meurt les armes à la main _ it be a cowardly soul that shrink or grow faint and despondent as soon as the storm begin to gather or even when the first cloud appear on the horizon we motto should be _ no surrender _ and far from yield to the ill of life let we take fresh courage from misfortune : -- _ tu ne cede mali sed contra audentior ito _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : virgil _ aeneid _ vi 95 -rrb- as long as the issue of any matter fraught with peril be still in doubt and there be yet some possibility leave that all may come right no one should ever tremble or think of anything but resistance -- just as a man should not despair of the weather if he can see a bit of blue sky anywhere let we attitude be such that we should not quake even if the world fall in ruin about we : -- _ si fractus illabatur orbi impavidum ferient ruina _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : horace ode iii 3 -rrb- we whole life itself -- let alone its blessing -- would not be worth such a cowardly tremble and shrink of the heart therefore let we face life courageously and show a firm front to every ill : -- _ quocirca vivite forte fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus _ still it be possible for courage to be carry to a excess and to degenerate into rashness it may even be say that some amount of fear be necessary if we be to exist at all in the world and cowardice be only the exaggerated form of it this truth have be very well express by bacon in he account of _ terror panicus _ and the etymological account which he give of its meaning be very superior to the ancient explanation preserve for we by plutarch -lrb- 1 -rrb- he connect the expression with _ pan _ the personification of nature -lrb- 2 -rrb- and observe that fear be innate in every living thing and in fact tend to its preservation but that it be apt to come into play without due cause and that man be especially expose to it the chief feature of this _ panie terror _ be that there be no clear notion of any definite danger bind up with it that it presume rather than know that danger exist and that in case of need it plead fright itself as the reason for be afraid -lrb- footnote 1 : _ de iside et osiride _ ch 14 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ de sapientium veterum _ c 6 _ natura enim rerum omnibus viventibus indidit mentum ac formidinem vita atque essentiae suae conservatricem ac mala ingruentia vitantem et depellentem verumtamen eaden natura modum tenere nescia est : sed timoribus salutaribus semper vano et innanes admiscet adeo ut omnium -lrb- si intus conspici darentur -rrb- panici terroribus plenissima sint praesertim humana _ -rrb- chapter v the age of life there be a very fine say of voltaire 's to the effect that every age of life have its own peculiar mental character and that a man will feel completely unhappy if he mind be not in accordance with he year : -- _ quus n ' a pas l'esprit de son âge de son âge atout le malheur _ it will therefore be a fitting close to we speculation upon the nature of happiness if we glance at the chance which the various period of life produce in we we whole life long it be _ the present _ and the present alone that we actually possess : the only difference be that at the beginning of life we look forward to a long future and that towards the end we look back upon a long past also that we temperament but not we character undergo certain well-known change which make _ the present _ wear a different color at each period of life i have elsewhere state that in childhood we be more give to use we _ intellect _ than we _ will _ and i have explain why this be so -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be just for this reason that the first quarter of life be so happy : as we look back upon it in after year it seem a sort of lose paradise in childhood we relation with other be limit we want be few -- in a word there be little stimulus for the will and so we chief concern be the extension of we knowledge the intellect -- like the brain which attain its full size in the seventh year -lrb- 2 -rrb- be develop early though it take time to mature and it explore the whole world of its surroundings in its constant search for nutriment : it be then that existence be in itself a ever fresh delight and all thing sparkle with the charm of novelty -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- schopenhauer refer to _ die welt al wille und vorstellung _ bk ii c 31 p 451 -lrb- 4th edit -rrb- where he explain that this be due to the fact that at that period of life the brain and nervous system be much more developed than any other part of the organism -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ translator 's note _ -- this statement be not quite correct the weight of the brain increase rapidly up to the seventh year more slowly between the sixteenth and the twentieth year still more slowly till between thirty and forty year of age when it attain its maximum at each decennial period after this it be suppose to decrease in weight on the average a ounce for every ten year -rrb- this be why the year of childhood be like a long poem for the function of poetry as of all art be to grasp the _ idea _ -- in the platonic sense in other word to apprehend a particular object in such a way as to perceive its essential nature the characteristic it have in common with all other object of the same kind so that a single object appear as the representative of a class and the result of one experience hold good for a thousand it may be think that my remark be oppose to fact and that the child be never occupy with anything beyond the individual object or event which be present to it from time to time and then only in so far as they interest and excite its will for the moment but this be not really the case in those early year life -- in the full meaning of the word be something so new and fresh and its sensation be so keen and unblunted by repetition that in the midst of all its pursuit and without any clear consciousness of what it be do the child be always silently occupy in grasp the nature of life itself -- in arrive at its fundamental character and general outline by means of separate scene and experience or to use spinoza 's phraseology the child be learn to see the thing and person about it _ sub specie aeternitati _ -- as particular manifestation of universal law the younger we be then the more do every individual object represent for we the whole class to which it belong but as the year increase this become less and less the case that be the reason why youthful impression be so different from those of old age and that it also why the slight knowledge and experience gain in childhood and youth afterwards come to stand as the permanent rubric or head for all the knowledge acquire in later life -- those early form of knowledge pass into category as it be under which the result of subsequent experience be classify though a clear consciousness of what be be do do not always attend upon the process in this way the earliest year of a man 's life lay the foundation of he view of the world whether it be shallow or deep and although this view may be extend and perfect later on it be not materially altered it be a effect of this purely objective and therefore poetical view of the world -- essential to the period of childhood and promote by the as yet undeveloped state of the volitional energy -- that as child we be concerned much more with the acquisition of pure knowledge than with exercise the power of will hence that grave fixed look observable in so many child of which raphael make such a happy use in he depiction of cherub especially in the picture of the _ sistine madonna _ the year of childhood be thus render so full of bliss that the memory of they be always couple with longing and regret while we thus eagerly apply ourselves to learn the outward aspect of thing as the primitive method of understand the object about we education aim at instil into we _ idea _ but idea furnish no information as to the real and essential nature of object which as the foundation and true content of all knowledge can be reach only by the process call _ intuition _ this be a kind of knowledge which can in no wise be instil into we from without we must arrive at it by and for ourselves hence a man 's intellectual as well as he moral quality proceed from the depths of he own nature and be not the result of external influence and no educational scheme -- of pestalozzus or of any one else -- can turn a bear simpleton into a man of sense the thing be impossible he be bear a simpleton and a simpleton he will die it be the depth and intensity of this early intuitive knowledge of the external world that explain why the experience of childhood take such a firm hold on the memory when we be young we be completely absorb in we immediate surroundings there be nothing to distract we attention from they we look upon the object about we as though they be the only one of they kind as though indeed nothing else exist at all later on when we come to find out how many thing there be in the world this primitive state of mind vanish and with it we patience i have say elsewhere -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the world consider as _ object _ -- in other word as it be _ present _ to we objectively -- wear in general a please aspect but that in the world consider as _ subject _ -- that be in regard to its inner nature which be _ will _ -- pain and trouble predominate i may be allow to express the matter briefly thus : _ the world be glorious to look at but dreadful in reality _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ die welt al wille und vorstellung _ bk ii c 31 p 426-7 -lrb- 4th edit -rrb- to which the reader be refer for a detailed explanation of my meaning -rrb- accordingly we find that in the year of childhood the world be much better know to we on its outer or objective side namely as the presentation of will than on the side of its inner nature namely as the will itself since the objective side wear a please aspect and the inner or subjective side with its tale of horror remain as yet unknown the youth as he intelligence develop take all the form of beauty that he see in nature and in art for so many object of blissful existence they be so beautiful to the outward eye that on they inner side they must he think be much more beautiful still so the world lie before he like another eden and this be the arcadium in which we be all bear a little later this state of mind give birth to a thirst for real life -- the impulse to do and suffer -- which drive a man forth into the hurly-burly of the world there he learn the other side of existence -- the inner side the will which be thwart at every step then come the great period of disillusion a period of very gradual growth but once it have fairly begin a man will tell you that he have get over all he false notion -- _ l'âge des illusion est passé _ and yet the process be only begin and it go on extend its sway and apply more and more to the whole of life so it may be say that in childhood life look like the scenery in a theater as you view it from a distance and that in old age it be like the same scenery when you come up quite close to it and lastly there be another circumstance that contribute to the happiness of childhood as spring commence the young leaf on the tree be similar in color and much the same in shape and in the first year of life we all resemble one another and harmonize very well but with puberty divergence begin and like the radius of a circle we go further and further apart the period of youth which form the remainder of this earlier half of we existence -- and how many advantage it have over the later half -- be trouble and make miserable by the pursuit of happiness as though there be no doubt that it can be meet with somewhere in life -- a hope that always end in failure and lead to discontent a illusory image of some vague future bliss -- bear of a dream and shape by fancy -- float before we eye and we search for the reality in vain so it be that the young man be generally dissatisfy with the position in which he find himself whatever it may be he ascribe he disappointment solely to the state of thing that meet he on he first introduction to life when he have expect something very different whereas it be only the vanity and wretchedness of human life everywhere that he be now for the first time experience it would be a great advantage to a young man if he early training could eradicate the idea that the world have a great deal to offer he but the usual result of education be to strengthen this delusion and we first idea of life be generally take from fiction rather than from fact in the bright dawn of we youthful day the poetry of life spread out a gorgeous vision before we and we torture ourselves by longing to see it realize we might as well wish to grasp the rainbow the youth expect he career to be like a interesting romance and there lie the germ of that disappointment which i have be describe -lrb- 1 -rrb- what lend a charm to all these vision be just the fact that they be visionary and not real and that in contemplate they we be in the sphere of pure knowledge which be sufficient in itself and free from the noise and struggle of life to try and realize those vision be to make they a object of _ will _ -- a process which always involve pain -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf loc cit p 428 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : let I refer the reader if he be interested in the subject to the volume already cite chapter 37 -rrb- if the chief feature of the earlier half of life be a never-satisfied longing after happiness the later half be characterize by the dread of misfortune for as we advance in year it become in a greater or less degree clear that all happiness be chimerical in its nature and that pain alone be real accordingly in later year we or at least the more prudent amongst we be more intent upon eliminate what be painful from we life and make we position secure than on the pursuit of positive pleasure i may observe by the way that in old age we be better able to prevent misfortune from come and in youth better able to bear they when they come in my young day i be always please to hear a ring at my door : ah think i now for something pleasant but in later life my feeling on such occasion be rather akin to dismay than to pleasure : heaven help I think i what be i to do a similar revulsion of feeling in regard to the world of man take place in all person of any talent or distinction for that very reason they can not be say properly to belong to the world in a greater or less degree accord to the extent of they superiority they stand alone in they youth they have a sense of be abandon by the world but later on they feel as though they have escape it the earlier feeling be a unpleasant one and rest upon ignorance the second be pleasurable -- for in the meantime they have come to know what the world be the consequence of this be that as compare with the earlier the later half of life like the second part of a musical period have less of passionate longing and more restfulness about it and why be this the case simply because in youth a man fancy that there be a prodigious amount of happiness and pleasure to be have in the world only that it be difficult to come by it whereas when he become old he know that there be nothing of the kind he make he mind completely at ease on the matter enjoy the present hour as well as he can and even take a pleasure in trifle the chief result gain by experience of life be _ clearness of view _ this be what distinguish the man of mature age and make the world wear such a different aspect from that which it present in he youth or boyhood it be only then that he see thing quite plain and take they for that which they really be : while in earlier year he see a phantom-world put together out of the whim and crotchet of he own mind inherit prejudice and strange delusion : the real world be hide from he or the vision of it distort the first thing that experience find to do be to free we from the phantom of the brain -- those false notion that have be put into we in youth to prevent they entrance at all would of course be the best form of education even though it be only negative in aim : but it would be a task full of difficulty at first the child 's horizon would have to be limit as much as possible and yet within that limited sphere none but clear and correct notion would have to be give only after the child have properly appreciate everything within it might the sphere be gradually enlarged care be always take that nothing be leave obscure or half or wrongly understand the consequence of this training would be that the child 's notion of man and thing would always be limit and simple in they character but on the other hand they would be clear and correct and only need to be extend not to be rectify the same line might be pursue on into the period of youth this method of education would lay special stress upon the prohibition of novel reading and the place of novel would be take by suitable biographical literature -- the life of franklin for instance or moritz ' _ anton reiser _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- moritz be a miscellaneous writer of the last century -lrb- 1757-93 -rrb- he _ anton reiser _ compose in the form of a novel be practically a autobiography -rrb- in we early day we fancy that the lead event in we life and the person who be go to play a important part in it will make they entrance to the sound of drum and trumpet but when in old age we look back we find that they all come in quite quietly slip in as it be by the side-door almost unnoticed from the point of view we have be take up until now life may be compare to a piece of embroidery of which during the first half of he time a man get a sight of the right side and during the second half of the wrong the wrong side be not so pretty as the right but it be more instructive it show the way in which the thread have be work together intellectual superiority even if it be of the highest kind will not secure for a man a preponderating place in conversation until after he be forty year of age for age and experience though they can never be a substitute for intellectual talent may far outweigh it and even in a person of the meanest capacity they give a certain counterpoise to the power of a extremely intellectual man so long as the latter be young of course i allude here to personal superiority not to the place a man may gain by he work and on pass he fortieth year any man of the slightest power of mind -- any man that be who have more than the sorry share of intellect with which nature have endow five-sixth of mankind -- will hardly fail to show some trace of misanthropy for as be natural he have by that time infer other people 's character from a examination of he own with the result that he have be gradually disappoint to find that in the quality of the head or in those of the heart -- and usually in both -- he reach a level to which they do not attain so he gladly avoid have anything more to do with they for it may be say in general that every man will love or hate solitude -- in other word he own society -- just in proportion as he be worth anything in himself kant have some remark upon this kind of misanthropy in he _ critique of the faculty of judgment _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ kritik der urtheilskraft _ part i § 29 note ad fin -rrb- in a young man it be a bad sign as well from a intellectual as from a moral point of view if he be precocious in understand the way of the world and in adapt himself to its pursuit if he at once know how to deal with man and enter upon life as it be fully prepare it argue a vulgar nature on the other hand to be surprised and astonished at the way people act and to be clumsy and cross-grained in have to do with they indicate a character of the nobler sort the cheerfulness and vivacity of youth be partly due to the fact that when we be ascend the hill of life death be not visible : it lie down at the bottom of the other side but once we have cross the top of the hill death come in view -- death -- which until then be know to we only by hearsay this make we spirit droop for at the same time we begin to feel that we vital power be on the ebb a grave seriousness now take the place of that early extravagance of spirit and the change be noticeable even in the expression of a man 's face as long as we be young people may tell we what they please we look upon life as endless and use we time recklessly but the older we become the more we practice economy for towards the close of life every day we live give we the same kind of sensation as the criminal experience at every step on he way to be try from the standpoint of youth life seem to stretch away into a endless future from the standpoint of old age to go back but a little way into the past so that at the begin life present we with a picture in which the object appear a great way off as though we have reverse we telescope while in the end everything seem so close to see how short life be a man must have grow old that be to say he must have live long on the other hand as the year increase thing look smaller one and all and life which have so firm and stable a base in the day of we youth now seem nothing but a rapid flight of moment every one of they illusory : we have come to see that the whole world be vanity time itself seem to go at a much slower pace when we be young so that not only be the first quarter of life the happiest it be also the longest of all it leave more memory behind it if a man be put to it he could tell you more out of the first quarter of he life than out of two of the remain period nay in the spring of life as in the spring of the year the day reach a length that be positively tiresome but in the autumn whether of the year or of life though they be short they be more genial and uniform but why be it that to a old man he past life appear so short for this reason : he memory be short and so he fancy that he life have be short too he no longer remember the insignificant part of it and much that be unpleasant be now forget how little then there be leave for in general a man 's memory be as imperfect as he intellect and he must make a practice of reflect upon the lesson he have learn and the event he have experience if he do not want they both to sink gradually into the gulf of oblivion now we be unaccustomed to reflect upon matter of no importance or as a rule upon thing that we have find disagreeable and yet that be necessary if the memory of they be to be preserve but the class of thing that may be call insignificant be continually receive fresh addition : much that wear a air of importance at first gradually become of no consequence at all from the fact of its frequent repetition so that in the end we actually lose count of the number of time it happen hence we be better able to remember the event of we early than of we later year the longer we live the fewer be the thing that we can call important or significant enough to deserve further consideration and by this alone can they be fix in the memory in other word they be forget as soon as they be past thus it be that time run on leave always fewer trace of its passage further if disagreeable thing have happen to we we do not care to ruminate upon they least of all when they touch we vanity as be usually the case for few misfortune fall upon we for which we can be hold entirely blameless so people be very ready to forget many thing that be disagreeable as well as many that be unimportant it be from this double cause that we memory be so short and a man 's recollection of what have happen always become proportionately shorter the more thing that have occupy he in life the thing we do in year go by the event that happen long ago be like those object on the coast which to the seafarer on he outward voyage become smaller every minute more unrecognizable and harder to distinguish again it sometimes happen that memory and imagination will call up some long past scene as vividly as if it have occur only yesterday so that the event in question seem to stand very near to the present time the reason of this be that it be impossible to call up all the intervene period in the same vivid way as there be no one figure pervade it which can be take in at a glance and besides most of the thing that happen in that period be forget and all that remain of it be the general knowledge that we have live through it -- a mere notion of abstract existence not a direct vision of some particular experience it be this that cause some single event of long ago to appear as though it take place but yesterday : the intervene time vanish and the whole of life look incredibly short nay there be occasional moment in old age when we can scarcely believe that we be so advance in year or that the long past lie behind we have have any real existence -- a feeling which be mainly due to the circumstance that the present always seem fix and immovable as we look at it these and similar mental phenomenon be ultimately to be trace to the fact that it be not we nature in itself but only the outward presentation of it that lie in time and that the present be the point of contact between the world as subject and the world as object -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- by this remark schopenhauer mean that _ will _ which as he argue form the inner reality underlie all the phenomenon of life and nature be not in itself affect by time but that on the other hand time be necessary for the objectification of the will for the will as present in the pass phenomenon of the world time be thus definable as the condition of change and the present time as the only point of contact between reality and appearance -rrb- again why be it that in youth we can see no end to the year that seem to lie before we because we be oblige to find room for all the thing we hope to attain in life we cram the year so full of project that if we be to try and carry they all out death would come prematurely though we reach the age of methuselah another reason why life look so long when we be young be that we be apt to measure its length by the few year we have already live in those early year thing be new to we and so they appear important we dwell upon they after they have happen and often call they to mind and thus in youth life seem replete with incident and therefore of long duration sometimes we credit ourselves with a longing to be in some distant spot whereas in truth we be only longing to have the time back again which we spend there -- day when we be younger and fresher than we be now in those moment time mock we by wear the mask of space and if we travel to the spot we can see how much we have be deceive there be two way of reach a great age both of which presuppose a sound constitution as a _ conditio sine quâ non _ they may be illustrate by two lamp one of which burn a long time with very little oil because it have a very thin wick and the other just as long though it have a very thick one because there be plenty of oil to feed it here the oil be the vital energy and the difference in the wick be the manifold way in which the vital energy be use up to we thirty-sixth year we may be compare in respect of the way in which we use we vital energy to people who live on the interest of they money : what they spend to-day they have again to-morrow but from the age of thirty-six onward we position be like that of the investor who begin to entrench upon he capital at first he hardly notice any difference at all as the greater part of he expense be cover by the interest of he security and if the deficit be but slight he pay no attention to it but the deficit go on increase until he awake to the fact that it be become more serious every day : he position become less and less secure and he feel himself grow poorer and poorer while he have no expectation of this drain upon he resource come to a end he fall from wealth to poverty become faster every moment -- like the fall of a solid body in space until at last he have absolutely nothing leave a man be truly in a woeful plight if both the term of this comparison -- he vital energy and he wealth -- really begin to melt away at one and the same time it be the dread of this calamity that make love of possession increase with age on the other hand at the beginning of life in the year before we attain majority and for some little time afterwards -- the state of we vital energy put we on a level with those who each year lay by a part of they interest and add it to they capital : in other word not only do they interest come in regularly but the capital be constantly receive addition this happy condition of affair be sometimes bring about -- with health as with money -- under the watchful care of some honest guardian o happy youth and sad old age nevertheless a man should economize he strength even when he be young aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- observe that amongst those who be victor at olympium only two or three gain a prize at two different period once in boyhood and then again when they come to be man and the reason of this be that the premature effort which the training involve so completely exhaust they power that they fail to last on into manhood as this be true of muscular so it be still more true of nervous energy of which all intellectual achievement be the manifestation hence those infant prodigy -- _ ingenia praecoda _ -- the fruit of a hot-house education who surprise we by they cleverness as child afterwards turn out very ordinary folk nay the manner in which boy be force into a early acquaintance with the ancient tongue may perhaps be to blame for the dullness and lack of judgment which distinguish so many learn person -lrb- footnote 1 : _ politics _ -rrb- i have say that almost every man 's character seem to be specially suit to some one period of life so that on reach it the man be at he best some people be charming so long as they be young and afterwards there be nothing attractive about they other be vigorous and active in manhood and then lose all the value they possess as they advance in year many appear to best advantage in old age when they character assume a gentler tone as become man who have see the world and take life easily this be often the case with the french this peculiarity must be due to the fact that the man 's character have something in it akin to the quality of youth or manhood or old age -- something which accord with one or another of these period of life or perhaps act as a corrective to its special failing the mariner observe the progress he make only by the way in which object on the coast fade away into the distance and apparently decrease in size in the same way a man become conscious that he be advance in year when he find that people older than himself begin to seem young to he it have already be remark that the older a man become the fewer be the trace leave in he mind by all that he see do or experience and the cause of this have be explain there be thus a sense in which it may be say that it be only in youth that a man live with a full degree of consciousness and that he be only half alive when he be old as the year advance he consciousness of what go on about he dwindle and the thing of life hurry by without make any impression upon he just as none be make by a work of art see for the thousandth time a man do what he hand find to do and afterwards he do not know whether he have do it or not as life become more and more unconscious the nearer it approach the point at which all consciousness cease the course of time itself seem to increase in rapidity in childhood all the thing and circumstance of life be novel and that be sufficient to awake we to the full consciousness of existence : hence at that age the day seem of such immense length the same thing happen when we be travel : one month seem longer then than four spend at home still though time seem to last longer when we be young or on a journey the sense of novelty do not prevent it from now and then in reality hang heavily upon we hand under both these circumstance at any rate more than be the case when we be old or stay at home but the intellect gradually become so rub down and blunt by long habituation to such impression that thing have a constant tendency to produce less and less impression upon we as they pass by and this make time seem increasingly less important and therefore shorter in duration : the hour of the boy be longer than the day of the old man accordingly time go faster and faster the longer we live like a ball roll down a hill or to take another example : as in a revolving disc the further a point lie from the center the more rapid be its rate of progression so it be in the wheel of life the further you stand from the begin the faster time move for you hence it may be say that as far as concern the immediate sensation that time make upon we mind the length of any given year be in direct proportion to the number of time it will divide we whole life : for instance at the age of fifty the year appear to we only one-tenth as long as it do at the age of five this variation in the rate at which time appear to move exercise a most decide influence upon the whole nature of we existence at every period of it first of all it cause childhood -- even though it embrace only a span of fifteen year -- to seem the longest period of life and therefore the richest in reminiscence next it bring it about that a man be apt to be bore just in proportion as he be young consider for instance that constant need of occupation -- whether it be work or play -- that be show by child : if they come to a end of both work and play a terrible feeling of boredom ensue even in youth people be by no means free from this tendency and dread the hour when they have nothing to do as manhood approach boredom disappear and old man find the time too short when they day fly past they like arrow from a bow of course i must be understand to speak of _ man _ not of decrepit _ brute _ with this increase rapidity of time boredom mostly pass away as we advance in life and as the passion with all they attendant pain be then lay asleep the burden of life be on the whole appreciably lighter in later year than in youth provide of course that health remain so it be that the period immediately precede the weakness and trouble of old age receive the name of a man 's _ best year _ that may be a true appellation in view of the comfortable feeling which those year bring but for all that the year of youth when we consciousness be lively and open to every sort of impression have this privilege -- that then the seed be sow and the bud come forth it be the springtime of the mind deep truth may be perceive but can never be excogitate -- that be to say the first knowledge of they be immediate call forth by some momentary impression this knowledge be of such a kind as to be attainable only when the impression be strong lively and deep and if we be to be acquaint with deep truth everything depend upon a proper use of we early year in later life we may be better able to work upon other people -- upon the world because we nature be then finish and round off and no more a prey to fresh view but then the world be less able to work upon we these be the year of action and achievement while youth be the time for form fundamental conception and lay down the ground-work of think in youth it be the outward aspect of thing that most engage we while in age think or reflection be the predominate quality of the mind hence youth be the time for poetry and age be more inclined to philosophy in practical affair it be the same : a man shape he resolution in youth more by the impression that the outward world make upon he whereas when he be old it be think that determine he action this be partly to be explain by the fact that it be only when a man be old that the result of outward observation be present in sufficient number to allow of they be classify accord to the idea they represent -- a process which in its turn cause those idea to be more fully understand in all they bearing and the exact value and amount of trust to be place in they fix and determine while at the same time he have grow accustomed to the impression produce by the various phenomenon of life and they effect on he be no longer what they be contrarily in youth the impression that thing make that be to say the outward aspect of life be so overpoweringly strong especially in the case of people of lively and imaginative disposition that they view the world like a picture and they chief concern be the figure they cut in it the appearance they present nay they be unaware of the extent to which this be the case it be a quality of mind that show itself -- if in no other way -- in that personal vanity and that love of fine clothes which distinguish young people there can be no doubt that the intellectual power be most capable of endure great and sustained effort in youth up to the age of thirty-five at latest from which period they strength begin to decline though very gradually still the later year of life and even old age itself be not without they intellectual compensation it be only then that a man can be say to be really rich in experience or in learn he have then have time and opportunity enough to enable he to see and think over life from all its side he have be able to compare one thing with another and to discover point of contact and connect link so that only then be the true relation of thing rightly understand further in old age there come a increase depth in the knowledge that be acquire in youth a man have now many more illustration of any idea he may have attain thing which he think he know when he be young he now know in reality and besides he range of knowledge be wider and in whatever direction it extend it be thorough and therefore form into a consistent and connected whole whereas in youth knowledge be always defective and fragmentary a complete and adequate notion of life can never be attain by any one who do not reach old age for it be only the old man who see life whole and know its natural course it be only he who be acquaint -- and this be most important -- not only with its entrance like the rest of mankind but with its exit too so that he alone have a full sense of its utter vanity whilst the other never cease to labor under the false notion that everything will come right in the end on the other hand there be more conceptive power in youth and at that time of life a man can make more out of the little that he know in age judgment penetration and thoroughness predominate youth be the time for amass the material for a knowledge of the world that shall be distinctive and peculiar -- for a original view of life in other word the legacy that a man of genius leave to he fellow-men it be however only in later year that he become master of he material accordingly it will be find that as a rule a great writer give he best work to the world when he be about fifty year of age but though the tree of knowledge must reach its full height before it can bear fruit the root of it lie in youth every generation no matter how paltry its character think itself much wiser than the one immediately precede it let alone those that be more remote it be just the same with the different period in a man 's life and yet often in the one case no less than in the other it be a mistaken opinion in the year of physical growth when we power of mind and we store of knowledge be receive daily addition it become a habit for to-day to look down with contempt upon yesterday the habit strike root and remain even after the intellectual power have begin to decline -- when to-day should rather look up with respect to yesterday so it be that we often unduly depreciate the achievement as well as the judgment of we youth this seem the place for make the general observation that although in its main quality a man 's _ intellect _ or _ head _ as well as he _ character _ or _ heart _ be innate yet the former be by no means so unalterable in its nature as the latter the fact be that the intellect be subject to very many transformation which as a rule do not fail to make they actual appearance and this be so partly because the intellect have a deep foundation in the physique and partly because the material with which it deal be give in experience and so from a physical point of view we find that if a man have any peculiar power it first gradually increase in strength until it reach its acme after which it enter upon a path of slow decadence until it end in imbecility but on the other hand we must not lose sight of the fact that the material which give employment to a man 's power and keep they in activity -- the subject-matter of thought and knowledge experience intellectual attainment the practice of see to the bottom of thing and so a perfect mental vision form in themselves a mass which continue to increase in size until the time come when weakness show itself and the man 's power suddenly fail the way in which these two distinguishable element combine in the same nature -- the one absolutely unalterable and the other subject to change in two direction oppose to each other -- explain the variety of mental attitude and the dissimilarity of value which attach to a man at different period of life the same truth may be more broadly express by say that the first forty year of life furnish the text while the remain thirty supply the commentary and that without the commentary we be unable to understand aright the true sense and coherence of the text together with the moral it contain and all the subtle application of which it admit towards the close of life much the same thing happen as at the end of a _ bal masqué _ -- the mask be take off then you can see who the people really be with whom you have come into contact in you passage through the world for by the end of life character have come out in they true light action have bear fruit achievement have be rightly appreciate and all sham have fall to piece for this time be in every case requisite but the most curious fact be that it be also only towards the close of life than a man really recognize and understand he own true self -- the aim and object he have follow in life more especially the kind of relation in which he have stand to other people and to the world it will often happen that as a result of this knowledge a man will have to assign himself a lower place than he formerly think be he due but there be exception to this rule and it will occasionally be the case that he will take a higher position than he have before this will be owe to the fact that he have no adequate notion of the _ baseness _ of the world and that he set up a higher aim for himself than be follow by the rest of mankind the progress of life show a man the stuff of which he be make it be customary to call youth the happy and age the sad part of life this would be true if it be the passion that make a man happy youth be sway to and fro by they and they give a great deal of pain and little pleasure in age the passion cool and leave a man at rest and then forthwith he mind take a contemplative tone the intellect be set free and attain the upper hand and since in itself intellect be beyond the range of pain and man feel happy just in so far as he intellect be the predominate part of he it need only be remember that all pleasure be negative and that pain be positive in its nature in order to see that the passion can never be a source of happiness and that age be not the less to be envy on the ground that many pleasure be deny it for every sort of pleasure be never anything more than the quietive of some need or longing and that pleasure should come to a end as soon as the need cease be no more a subject of complaint than that a man can not go on eating after he have have he dinner or fall asleep again after a good night 's rest so far from youth be the happiest period of life there be much more truth in the remark make by plato at the beginning of the _ republic _ that the prize should rather be give to old age because then at last a man be free from the animal passion which have hitherto never cease to disquiet he nay it may even be say that the countless and manifold humor which have they source in this passion and the emotion that spring from it produce a mild state of madness and this last as long as the man be subject to the spell of the impulse -- this evil spirit as it be of which there be no riddance -- so that he never really become a reasonable be until the passion be extinguish there be no doubt that in general and apart from individual circumstance and particular disposition youth be mark by a certain melancholy and sadness while genial sentiment attach to old age and the reason for this be nothing but the fact that the young man be still under the service nay the force labor impose by that evil spirit which scarcely ever leave he a moment to himself to this source may be trace directly or indirectly almost all and every ill that befall or menace mankind the old man be genial and cheerful because after long lie in the bond of passion he can now move about in freedom still it should not be forget that when this passion be extinguish the true kernel of life be go and nothing remain but the hollow shell or from another point of view life then become like a comedy which begin by real actor be continue and bring to a end by automaton dress in they clothes however that may be youth be the period of unrest and age of repose and from that very circumstance the relative degree of pleasure belong to each may be infer the child stretch out its little hand in the eager desire to seize all the pretty thing that meet its sight charm by the world because all its sens be still so young and fresh much the same thing happen with the youth and he display greater energy in he quest he too be charm by all the pretty thing and the many please shape that surround he and forthwith he imagination conjure up pleasure which the world can never realize so he be fill with a ardent desire for he know not what delight -- rob he of all rest and make happiness impossible but when old age be reach all this be over and do with partly because the blood run cooler and the sens be no longer so easily allure partly because experience have show the true value of thing and the futility of pleasure whereby illusion have be gradually dispel and the strange fancy and prejudice which previously conceal or distort a free and true view of the world have be dissipate and put to flight with the result that a man can now get a juster and clearer view and see thing as they be and also in a measure attain more or less insight into the nullity of all thing on this earth it be this that give almost every old man no matter how ordinary he faculty may be a certain tincture of wisdom which distinguish he from the young but the chief result of all this change be the peace of mind that ensue -- a great element in happiness and in fact the condition and essence of it while the young man fancy that there be a vast amount of good thing in the world if he could only come at they the old man be steep in the truth of the preacher 's word that _ all thing be vanity _ -- know that however gilded the shell the nut be hollow in these later year and not before a man come to a true appreciation of horace 's maxim : _ nil admirari _ he be directly and sincerely convinced of the vanity of everything and that all the glory of the world be as nothing : he illusion be go he be no more beset with the idea that there be any particular amount of happiness anywhere in the palace or in the cottage any more than he himself enjoy when he be free from bodily or mental pain the worldly distinction of great and small high and low exist for he no longer and in this blissful state of mind the old man may look down with a smile upon all false notion he be completely undeceived and know that whatever may be do to adorn human life and deck it out in finery its paltry character will soon show through the glitter of its surroundings and that paint and be jewel it as one may it remain everywhere much the same -- a existence which have no true value except in freedom from pain and be never to be estimate by the presence of pleasure let alone then of display -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf horace _ epist _ i 12 i-4 -rrb- disillusion be the chief characteristic of old age for by that time the fiction be go which give life its charm and spur on the mind to activity the splendor of the world have be prove null and vain its pomp grandeur and magnificence be fade a man have then find out that behind most of the thing he want and most of the pleasure he long for there be very little after all and so he come by degree to see that we existence be all empty and void it be only when he be seventy year old that he quite understand the first word of the preacher and this again explain why it be that old man be sometimes fretful and morose it be often say that the common lot of old age be disease and weariness of life disease be by no means essential to old age especially where a really long span of year be to be attain for as life go on the condition of health and disorder tend to increase -- _ crescente vita crescit sanita et morbus _ and as far as weariness or boredom be concerned i have state above why old age be even less expose to that form of evil than youth nor be boredom by any means to be take as a necessary accompaniment of that solitude which for reason that do not require to be explain old age certainly can not escape it be rather the fate that await those who have never know any other pleasure but the gratification of the sens and the delight of society -- who have leave they mind unenlightened and they faculty unused it be quite true that the intellectual faculty decline with the approach of old age but where they be originally strong there will always be enough leave to combat the onslaught of boredom and then again as i have say experience knowledge reflection and skill in deal with man combine to give a old man a increasingly accurate insight into the way of the world he judgment become keen and he attain a coherent view of life : he mental vision embrace a wider range constantly find new use for he store of knowledge and add to they at every opportunity he maintain uninterrupted that inward process of self-education which give employment and satisfaction to the mind and thus form the due reward of all its effort all this serve in some measure as a compensation for decrease intellectual power and besides time as i have remark seem to go much more quickly when we be advance in year and this be in itself a preventive of boredom there be no great harm in the fact that a man 's bodily strength decrease in old age unless indeed he require it to make a live to be poor when one be old be a great misfortune if a man be secure from that and retain he health old age may be a very passable time of life its chief necessity be to be comfortable and well off and in consequence money be then prize more than ever because it be a substitute for fail strength desert by venus the old man like to turn to bacchus to make he merry in the place of want to see thing to travel and learn come the desire to speak and teach it be a piece of good fortune if the old man retain some of he love of study or of music or of the theater -- if in general he be still somewhat susceptible to the thing about he as be indeed the case with some people to a very late age at that time of life _ what a man have in himself _ be of greater advantage to he that ever it be before there can be no doubt that most people who have never be anything but dull and stupid become more and more of automaton as they grow old they have always think say and do the same thing as they neighbor and nothing that happen now can change they disposition or make they act otherwise to talk to old people of this kind be like write on the sand if you produce any impression at all it be go almost immediately old age be here nothing but the _ caput mortuum _ of life -- all that be essential to manhood be go there be case in which nature supply a third set of tooth in old age thereby apparently demonstrate the fact that that period of life be a second childhood it be certainly a very melancholy thing that all a man 's faculty tend to waste away as he grow old and at a rate that increase in rapidity : but still this be a necessary nay a beneficial arrangement as otherwise death for which it be a preparation would be too hard to bear so the greatest boon that follow the attainment of extreme old age be _ euthanasia _ -- a easy death not usher in by disease and free from all pain and struggle -lrb- 1 -rrb- for let a man live as long as he may he be never conscious of any moment but the present one and indivisible and in those late year the mind lose more every day by sheer forgetfulness than ever it gain anew -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ die welt al wille und vorstellung _ bk ii ch 41 for a further description of this happy end to life -rrb- the main difference between youth and age will always be that youth look forward to life and old age to death and that while the one have a short past and a long future before it the case be just the opposite with the other it be quite true that when a man be old to die be the only thing that await he while if he be young he may expect to live and the question arise which of the two fate be the more hazardous and if life be not a matter which on the whole it be better to have behind one than before do not the preacher say : _ the day of death -lrb- be better -rrb- than the day of one 's birth _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be certainly a rash thing to wish for long life -lrb- 2 -rrb- for as the spanish proverb have it it mean to see much evil -- _ quien larga vida vive mucho mal vide _ -lrb- footnote 1 : ecclesiaste vii 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the life of man can not strictly speak be call either _ long _ or _ short _ since it be the ultimate standard by which duration of time in regard to all other thing be measure in one of the vedic _ upanishad -lrb- oupnekhat _ ii -rrb- _ the natural length _ of human life be put down at one hundred year and i believe this to be right i have observe as a matter of fact that it be only people who exceed the age of ninety who attain _ euthanasia _ -- who die that be to say of no disease apoplexy or convulsion and pass away without agony of any sort nay who sometimes even show no pallor but expire generally in a sit attitude and often after a meal -- or i may say simply cease to live rather than die to come to one 's end before the age of ninety means to die of disease in other word prematurely now the old testament -lrb- psalm xc 10 -rrb- put the limit of human life at seventy and if it be very long at eighty year and what be more noticeable still herodotus -lrb- i 32 and iii 22 -rrb- say the same thing but this be wrong and the error be due simply to a rough and superficial estimate of the result of daily experience for if the natural length of life be from seventy to eighty year people would die about that time of mere old age now this be certainly not the case if they die then they die like younger people _ of disease _ and disease be something abnormal therefore it be not natural to die at that age it be only when they be between ninety and a hundred that people die of old age die i mean without suffer from any disease or show any special sign of they condition such as a struggle death-rattle convulsion pallor -- the absence of all which constitute _ euthanasia _ the natural length of human life be a hundred year and in assign that limit the upanishad be right once more -rrb- a man 's individual career be not as astrology wish to make out to be predict from observation of the planet but the course of human life in general as far as the various period of it be concern may be liken to the succession of the planet : so that we may be say to pass under the influence of each one of they in turn at ten _ mercury _ be in the ascendant and at that age a youth like this planet be characterize by extreme mobility within a narrow sphere where trifle have a great effect upon he but under the guidance of so crafty and eloquent a god he easily make great progress _ venus _ begin she sway during he twentieth year and then a man be wholly give up to the love of woman at thirty _ mar _ come to the front and he be now all energy and strength -- daring pugnacious and arrogant when a man reach the age of forty he be under the rule of the four _ asteroid _ that be to say he life have gain something in extension he be frugal in other word by the help of _ cere _ he favor what be useful he have he own hearth by the influence of _ vesta _ _ palla _ have teach he that which be necessary for he to know and he wife -- he _ juno _ -- rule as the mistress of he house but at the age of fifty _ jupiter _ be the dominant influence at that period a man have outlive most of he contemporary and he can feel himself superior to the generation about he he be still in the full enjoyment of he strength and rich in experience and knowledge and if he have any power and position of he own he be endowed with authority over all who stand in he immediate surroundings he be no more inclined to receive order from other he want to take command himself the work most suitable to he now be to guide and rule within he own sphere this be the point where jupiter culminate and where the man of fifty year be at he best then come _ saturn _ at about the age of sixty a weight as of _ lead _ dull and slow : -- _ but old folk many feign as they be dead unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead _ last of all _ uranus _ or as the say be a man go to heaven i can not find a place for _ neptune _ as this planet have be very thoughtlessly name because i may not call it as it should be call -- _ ero _ otherwise i should point out how beginning and end meet together and how closely and intimately ero be connect with death : how orcus or amenthe as the egyptian call he be not only the receiver but the giver of all thing -- -lrb- greek : lambanon kai didous -rrb- death be the great reservoir of life everything come from orcus everything that be alive now be once there could we but understand the great trick by which that be do all would be clear end of project gutenberg 's counsel and maxim by arthur schopenhauer
