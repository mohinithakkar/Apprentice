passenger on this boat grunt browning i have not see much of this young fellow bloodgood but he strike I as a mystery why well he seem to have money to burn and i do not understand why such a fellow do not take passage on a regular liner as far as that go smile merry i presume some people might think it rather singular that we do not cross the pond in a regular liner but then they might suppose it be a case of economy with we while they be talk there come a rap on they door which frank throw open just outside stand a young man with a flush face and distressed appearance he be dress in a plaid suit and wear a red four-in-hand necktie in which blaze a huge diamond there be two large solitaire ring on he left hand and he wear a heavy gold chain string across he vest beg you pardon dear

be a lot of boozer bloodgood turn on jack lift he eyebrow my dear fellow -- he begin but frank put in : we have no use for bromo seltzer as none of we be drinker oh of course not say the intruder with something like a sneer none of we be drinker but then we be all liable to get a little too much sometimes especially when we sit up late and play poker frank saw that diamond have take a instant dislike to the youth with the diamond and the red necktie and he feel like avert a storm even though he do not fancy the manner of the intruder we do not sit up late and play poker he say eh oh come off you be a jolly lot of fellow and you must have a fling sometimes we can be jolly without drinking or gambling why i be hang if you do not talk as if you consider it a crime to take a drink or have a little social game frank feel he blood warm up a bit but he hold himself in hand as he quietly retort : intemperance be a crime i presume there be man who take a drink as you call it without be intemperate but i prefer to let the stuff alone entirely and then there be no danger of go over the limit and i take you for a sport that show how a fellow can be fool but you do play poker occasionally i know that how do you know it mr bloodgood by you language you just speak of go over the limit that be a poker term and one use by many people who never play a game of card in they life but you have play card you have play poker can you deny it if i could i would not take the trouble mr bloodgood i think you have make a mistake in size up this crowd guess i have sneer the fellow you must be member of the ymca say frank panted jack open the door and let I -- but frank check the hot-headed youth again steady jack it be not necessary he will go directly mr bloodgood you speak as if it be a disgrace to belong to the ymca that show you ignorance and narrowness the ymca be a splendid organization and it have prove the anchor that have keep many a young man from dash onto the rock of destruction those who sneer at it should be ashamed of themselves but as a rule they be too bigoted prejudiced or narrow-minded to recognize the fact that some of the most manly young man to be find belong to the ymca bloodgood laugh and i take you for a sport he cry by jove never make such a blunder before in all my life study for the ministry i 'll wager ha ha ha frank saw that diamond could not be hold in check much longer one last word to you mr bloodgood he speak i be not study for the ministry and i do not even belong to the ymca if i be do the one or belong to the other i should not be ashamed of it i do not like you i can stand a little freshness in fact it rather please I but you be altogether too fresh you be offensive merry fling open the door good-day sir bloodgood step out turn round laugh and then walk away hang it merriwell grate diamond as frank close the door why do not you let I kick he out onto he neck chapter iv who be bloodgood diamond be thoroughly angry so be rattleton in he excitement harry say something that cause frank to turn quickly and observe : do not use that kind of language old man no matter what the provocation vulgarity be even lower than profanity harry 's face flush and he look intensely ashamed of himself i peg you bardon -- i mean i beg you pardon he splutter it slip out you know i do not say anything like that often i know it nod frank and that be why it sound all the worse i do not know that i ever hear you use such a word before harry do not resent frank 's reproof for he know frank be right and he be ashamed every young man who stoop to vulgarity should be ashamed profanity be coarse and degrading vulgarity be positively low and filthy the youth who be careful to keep he clothes and he body clean should be careful to keep he mouth clean let nothing go into it or come out of it that be in any way lowering do you ever hear a loafer on a corner use profane and obscene language i 'll warrant most of you have and i 'll warrant that you be thoroughly disgust you look on the fellow as low coarse cheap unfit to associate with respectable person the next time you use a word that you should be ashamed to have you mother or sister hear just think that you be follow the example of that loafer you be lower yourself in the eye of somebody even though you may not think so at the time perhaps one of you companion may be a person who use such language freely and yet he have never before hear it from you he laugh he call you a jolly good fellow to you face but he think to himself that you be no better than anybody else and behind you back he tell somebody what he think he be glad of the opportunity to show that you be no better than he be never tell a vulgar story better never listen to one unless you position be such that you can not escape without make yourself appear a positive cad if you have to listen to such a story forget it as soon as possible above all thing do not try to remember it some young man boast of the story they know and all they story be of the shady sort it be better to know no story than to know that kind it be better not to be call a good fellow than to win a reputation by always have a new story of the low sort ready on you tongue there be other and better way of win a reputation as a good fellow there be story which be genuinely humorous and funny which be also clean no matter how much of a laugh he may raise any self-respecting person feel that he have lower himself by tell a vulgar story it be not so if he have tell a clean story he be satisfy with the laughter he have cause and with himself frank merriwell be call a good fellow it be not often that he tell a story but when he do it be a good one and it be clean he have a inimitable way of tell anything and he story be all the more effective because they come at rare interval he do not cheapen they by make they common and never have anybody hear he tell a story that could prove offensive to the ear of a lady not that he have not be tempt to do so not that he have not hear such story he have be place in position where he could not help hear they without make himself appear like a thorough cad frank 's first attempt to tell a vulgar story have be the lesson that he need he be with a rather gay crowd of boy at the time and several have tell shady yarn and then they have call for one from frank he start to tell one work up to the point with all the skill of which he be capable he have they breathless ready to shout with laughter when the point be reach he draw they on and on with all the skill of which he be capable and then just as the climax be reach he suddenly realize just what he be about to say a thought come to he that make he heart give a great jump what if my mother be listen that be the think he mother be dead but she influence be over he a second thought follow many time he have seem to feel she hover near perhaps she be listen perhaps she be hear all that he be say frank merriwell stop and stand quite still at first he be very pale and then come a rush of blood to he face he turn crimson with shame and hang he head he companion look at he in astonishment they could not understand what have happen some of they cry go on go on after some seconds he try to speak at first he choke and could say nothing articulate after a little he mutter : i can not go on -- i can not finish the story you 'll have to excuse I fellow i be not feel well and he withdraw from the jolly party as soon as possible from that day frank merriwell never attempt to tell a story that be in the slightest degree vulgar he have learn he lesson and he never forget it some boy swagger chew tobacco talk vulgar and swear because they do not wish to be call sissy they fancy such action and language make they manly but nothing could be a greater mistake frank do nothing of the sort and all who know he regard he as thoroughly manly better to be call a sissy than to win reputed manliness at the cost of self-respect frank have force those who would have regard he with scorn to respect he he could play baseball or football with the best of they he could run jump swim ride and he excel by sheer determination in almost everything he undertake he would not be beat if defeat once he do not rest but prepared himself for another trial and go in to win or die in this way he show himself manly and he command the respect of enemy as well as friend rattleton be ashamed of the language he have use after the departure of bloodgood and he do not attempt to excuse himself further he lay back in he berth look sicker than ever i would give ten dollar for the privilege of help mr bloodgood out with my foot hiss jack diamond never see anybody so fresh oh i have see lot of people just like he grunt brown get out a pipe and lighting it do not smoke bruce groan rattleton as the steamer give a unusually heavy roll i be sick enough now that will make I worse oh we

fresher than just go out declare the virginian as he fling open the round window that serve to admit light and air there be something mighty queer about that fellow say frank do you notice the diamond he be wear fellow yes say bruce begin to puff away at he new briarwood regular eye-hitter they be who know they be genuine ask jack nobody here admit frank it be impossible to distinguish some fake stone from real diamond unless you examine they closely but somehow i have a fancy that those be genuine diamond what make you think so i do not know just why i think so but i do something tell I that for all of he swagger bloodgood be a fellow who would scorn to wear paste diamond what do you make out of the fellow anyway ask bruce i be not able to size he up yet admit frank i be not certain whether he come of a good family or a bad one but i be inclined to fancy it be the former i would like to know why you think so from jack he do not show very good breeding but there be a certain something about he face that make I believe he come from a high-grade family i think he have become lower by associate with bad companion well i do not care who or what he be declare jack if he get fresh around I again i 'll crack he one for luck i can not stand he for a cent better turn he over to I murmur bruce dozily i 'll sit on he and he 'll think he be under a elephant laugh merry bruce

mr slush be look for sucker be it possible he have be send there to inveigle they into the party so that some sharp might skin they it do not seem improbable harry seem to catch onto the same idea for he pop up in he bunk suddenly but a sudden roll of the steamer cause he to sink down again with a groan diamond 's eye begin to glitter he too fancy he see the little game no say merry slowly he do not invite any of we to come in the little man seem relieved i -- i do not know he falter if he have -- i -- i be go to say something perhaps it be not -- necessary perhaps not say frank but it may not do any hurt to say it and it may do some hurt -- to you mutter diamond under he breath i will kick this fellow but to the surprise of all the superstitious man cackle out a short broken laugh and say : oh i be go to -- to warn you -- that be all it -- it be liable to be a pretty -- stiff game i think it would be a -- good thing for you to -- keep out of it it start -- light but it be work -- up -- right along almost any time somebody be liable to -- to propose throw off the -- the limit and then somebody be go to get -- hurt if you be -- not in it why you will not be in any -- danger there be a silence the four youth look at the visitor and then at each other what do it mean if he be play they for sucker surely he be do it in a queer manner thank you say frank stiffly you be kind more than kind mutter diamond do not mention it say the little man try to look pleasant but make a dismal failure i -- i dont ' like to see respectable young man catch in a -- trap that be all think i would tell you do not know that you would -- thank I take my chance on that well i think i 'll -- be go he turn falteringly seem about to say something more open the door part way hesitate then say good-day and go out chapter vi the cargo of the eagle well well well the same word but from three different person and speak in three different inflection will somebody please hit I with something hard murmured jack what do it mean merry ask rattleton you may search I exclaimed frank in rather expressive slang something in which he seldom indulge unless under great provocation browning have say nothing he be pull steadily at he pipe quite unaware that it have go out what do you make of mr peddington slush ask jack i do not know what to make of he confess frank about the only thing of which i be sure be that he have a corker for a name that name be enough to make any man look sad and dejected what do he come here for anyhow ask rattleton to find out about raymond bloodgood -- he say i know he say so but i do not stake any talk -- i mean take any stock in that what difference do it make to he who bloodgood be that be something he do not make clear he do not seem to make anything clear declare jack i think for sure that he be go to throw out some hook to drag we into that game of poker if he have i should have know he be send here and i would kick he out whether you have be willing or not merry i would open the door and hold it wide for you smile frank what do you think of he brown ask harry he way of talk make I very tired yawn the big fellow he seem to work so hard to get anything out i 'll allow that we have have two rather queer visitor say the virginian and i shall take a interest in they both after this declare frank talk about superstitious person i believe he head the list from jack he say he be not superstitious laugh merry but the cat worry he and my twiddle my thumb put in bruce and this dagger pin in my scarf say frank it be a wonder he do not prophecy shipwreck or something of that sort groan rattleton who have settle at full length in he berth if this rolling motion keep up i shall get so i will not care if we be wreck he must be a dandy in a good swift game of poker laugh frank i should not think he would be able to make up he mind how to discard he would be a drawback to the game or i be much mistaken it strike I that he would be easy fruit say rattleton he look like a ` sucker ' himself but sometimes it be impossible to tell about a man till after you see he play anyhow these two visit be something to break the monotony of the voyage it promise to be pretty lively at the start but it have settle down to be rather quiet bloodgood and slush prove good food for conversation but the boy tire of that after a while diamond go out by himself and frank go to tutor maybe 's room where he spend the time till the gong sound for supper come harry say frank appear in the stateroom be not you ready for supper rattleton give a groan do not talk to I about eat he exclaim it make I sick to think about it leave I -- let I die in peace jack be not there so frank and bruce wash up and go out together they be nearly through eat when the virginian come in and take he place near they at the table usually the captain sit at the head of that table but he be not there now where have you be ask frank get onto a few thing say jack in a peculiar way why what be the matter with you ask bruce pause to stare at the southerner you be pale as a ghost be i say diamond he voice sound rather strain and unnatural sure thing i would not advise you to eat any more and perhaps you have not better look at the chandelier while they be swing you 'll be keep rattleton company oh i be not sick -- at least not seasick aver jack then what ail you i be go to prescribe ginger ale if it be the first stage of seasickness sometimes that will brace a person up and straighten out he stomach oh do not talk remedy to I i take medicine three day before i start on this voyage and everybody i see tell I something to do to keep from be sick i be wear a sheet of write paper across my chest now when supper be over jack motion for he friend to follow he the three go on deck and walk aft till they be quite alone the eagle be plow along over a desert sea the wave be run heavily and night be shut down grimly over the ocean what be the matter with you diamond ask brown why have you drag we out here it be cold and i would rather go into we stateroom and take a loaf after eat so heartily by jove if this keep up they will not have provision enough on this boat to feed I before we get across i want to have a little talk without say jack and i do not care about talk in the stateroom where i might be overhear what be up anyway demand frank warn by the manner of the virginian that jack fancy he have something of importance to tell they i have be investigate say jack what well i find out that there be something the matter on this boat do you learn what it be i do not know that i have but i have discover one thing i have learn the kind of cargo we carry what be it petroleum and powder chapter vii premonition of peril well that be hot stuff when it be burn say merriwell grimly rather grunt browning if i would know what the old boat carry i think i would hesitate some about shipping on she declare jack what if she do get on fire we have all go up in smoke say merriwell with absolute coolness that be about the size of it well say jack i hear two of the sailor talk in a very mysterious manner they say the ` eagle ' be hoodoo and the captain know it they say he have not sleep any to speak of since we leave new york sailor be always superstitious they be ignorant as a rule and ignorance breed superstition do you consider mr slush ignorant ask bruce do not have time to size he up but he be queer i shall feel that i be over a volcano during the rest of the voyage say jack what if there be somebody on board who wish to destroy the ship it would not be much of a job grunt brown a match touch to a powder keg would do the trick in a hurry but he would go up with the rest of we say frank unless he use a slow match put in jack these captain always have they enemy who be desperate fellow and ready to do almost anything to injure they the steamer might be set afire by means of a slow match which would give the villain time enough to get away i hardly think there be anybody desperate enough to do that kind of a trick for it would be a case of suicide perhaps not the chap who do the trick might have some plan of escape then i have know man desperate enough to commit suicide if they could destroy a enemy at the same time well it be likely all this worry about this vessel and cargo be entirely needless and foolish i do not believe it say the virginian i know now that the captain have be worry i have notice it in he manner he be pale and restless well it be likely he may be rather anxious for it be certain he can not carry any insurance on such a cargo he be not at the table to-night no i would give something to be on solid ground and away from this powder mill you know that sometimes there be such a thing as a unaccountable explosion a heavy sea must cause motion or friction in the cargo and friction often start a fire on shipboard fire on this vessel mean a quick road to glory huah grunt bruce i be not in the habit of worry about thing that may happen it be cold out here let 's go back to the stateroom it will be well enough to keep still about the nature of the cargo diamond say frank oh i shall keep still about that all right assure jack as they move back along the deck they discover somebody who be lean over the rail and make all sort of dismal sound and groan the next time i go to europe i 'll stay at home moan this individual oh my oh my how bad i feel next that come will be the shap of my two -- i mean the tap of my shoe it be rattle laugh frank softly and he be sicker than ever he be try to crawl out to get some air at this moment a man open the door near rattleton and ask : be the -- ah -- er -- moon up yet i do not know moaned harry but it be if i swallow it everything else be up anyhow if the -- ah -- moon come up red tonight it will mean -- i do not give a rap what it mean snorted rattleton do not talk to I let I die without torture I i be sick enough without have you make I worse mr slush for he be the anxious inquirer about the moon dodge back into the cabin close the door hesitatingly then rattleton unaware of the proximity of he amuse friend hang over the rail and groan again frank walk up and speak : i see my dear boy that you be heed the bible admonition hey groan harry what be it ` cast thy bread upon the water ' you be do it all right all right now do not carry this thing too far rattleton try to say in a fierce manner but he fierceness be laughable the worm will turn when trodden upon but the banana peel know a trick worth two of that do you ever hear that touch little poem about the man who step on a banana peel never do why that be too bad you do not know what you have miss listen and you shall hear it then frank solemnly declaim : he walk along one summer day as stately as a prince he step upon a banana peel and he have not ` banana ' where since rattleton give a still more dismal groan you be conspire with the element to hasten my death he say i can not stand many more like that you should wear a sheet of write paper across you breast same as i do say diamond then you will not be sick i have get two sheet of write paper across mine declare harry you should drink a bottle of ginger ale to settle you stomach put in frank just drink three bottle of ginger ale and they have turn my stomach wrong side out gurgle the sick youth you should allow yourself perfect relaxation and not try to fight against it from brown oh i have not allow myself anything else but perfect relaxation come from harry you all make I tired then he stagger into the cabin and disappear on he way back to the stateroom diamond and browning follow but frank linger behind although he have keep the fact conceal merry be trouble with a strange foreboding of come disaster in every way he try to overcome anything like superstition but he remember that on many other occasion he have be warn of come trouble by just such feeling i would like to know just what be go on upon this steamer he mutter as he walk forward i feel as if something be wrong and i shall not be satisfied till i investigate chapter viii in the stoke-hole frank find the chief engineer take some air merry fall into conversation with the man who be smoking and seem quite willing to talk have a pleasant and agreeable way frank easily lead the engineer on and it be not long before the man be quite take with the chatty passenger frank be careful not to seem inquisitive or prying for he know it would be easy to arouse the engineer 's suspicion if there should be anything wrong on the steamer however merry be work for a privilege and he obtain it when he express a desire to go below and have a look at the engine and furnace the engineer invite he to come along they pass through a door and then begin a descent by means of iron ladder the clanking roar of the machinery come up to they frank could hear and feel the throbbing heart beat of the great boat the engine room be quickly reach and there the engineer show he the massive machinery that move with the regularity of clockwork and the grace and ease that come from great power and perfect adjustment all this be interesting but frank be anxious to go still deeper go ahead say the engineer show he the way down that ladder there you 'll be able to see the furnace and the stoker at work i do not believe you 'll care to go into the stoke-hole frank descend great heat come up to he accompany by a glow that shift and change die down suddenly at one moment and glare out at the next he could hear the ring of shovel and the clank of iron door he reach a iron grate where a fierce heat roll up and seem to scorch he from that position he could look down into the stoke-hole and see the black grimy sweating half-clad man at work there above he at the head of the ladder he have just descend a pair of shine eye glare down but he see they not he have not observe a cleaner who be at work on the machinery in the engine-room and who keep he hat pull over he eye till frank depart the blacken stoker look like grim demon of the fiery pit as they labor at the coal which they be shovel into the mouth of the greedy furnace the shift glow be cause by the opening and closing of the furnace door which clang and ring for a moment the pit below would seem shroud in almost stygian darkness save for some bar of light that gleam out from a crack or draft and then there would be a rattle of iron and a flare of blood-red light that come with the fling open of a furnace door in the glare of light the bare-armed dirt-grimed stoker would shovel shovel shovel till it seem a wonder that the fire be not completely deaden by so much coal sometimes the door of all the furnace would seem open at once and the glare and heat that come up from the place be something awful merry wonder how human being could live down there in that terrible place some of the man be rake out ash and hoist it by means of a mechanism provide for the purpose frank pity the poor creature who be force to work down in that place yet he remember it be not so many month since he have apply for the position of wiper in a engine round-house obtain the job and work there with the grimiest and lowest employee of the railroad there be something fascinating in the black pit and the grimy man who labor down there in the glare and heat frank be so absorb that he hear no sound receive no warning of danger merry lean out over the edge of the iron grate something strike on he back he be clutch thrust out hurl from the grate it be do in a twinkle he could not defend himself but he make a clutch to save himself catch something swing in strike against the iron ladder and go tumble and slide downward at the moment when frank be attack a glare of light have fill the pit one of the stoker have turn he back to the gleaming mouth of the furnace and look upward as if to relieve he ache eye he see everything that occur on the grate he see a man slip down the ladder behind frank and spring on he back he see that man hurl frank from the grate the stoker utter a shout and run toward the foot of the ladder expect to find frank lay there severely injure or kill he be astounded when he see the ready-witted youth grasp the grate swing in strike the ladder cling and slide down frank come with a rush but he do not fall he land in the stoke-hole without be severely injure he be on he foot in a twinkling and up that ladder he go like a cat he assailant have dart up the ladder above and disappear merry reach the grate from which he have be hurl and then he run up the other ladder he be soon in the engine-room in that room there be no excitement the machinery be slide and swing in a regular manner while the engineer sit watch its movement talk to a assistant oiler and cleaner be at work where be he cry frank he voice sound clear and distinct they look at he in amazement what be the matter ask the engineer come forward i be attack from behind and throw into the stoke-hole merry explain the fellow who do it come in here throw into the stoke-hole yes from where the grate at the foot of the first ladder the engineer look doubtful my dear fellow he say you would have be maim or kill you do not seem to be harm frank realize that the engineer actually doubt he word he might have fall say the assistant but it would have break he neck i tell you i be attack from behind and throw down exclaimed frank i manage to get hold of the ladder and slide so i be not kill the engineer look annoyed this be what come of let a passenger in here he say it be the last time i 'll do it on my own responsibility now if you go out and tell you be throw into the stoke-hole there 'll be any amount of fuss over it i be tell it right here say frank grimly and i want to know who do the trick somebody who come from this room must have do it impossible then where do he come from the engineer and he assistant look at each other and the former begin to swear what do you think of it joe he ask think you make a mistake bill but he story will not go nobody 'll take any stock in it frank be angry it be something unusual for he word to be doubt and he feel like express he feeling decidedly he be save the trouble the grimy stoker who have witness the struggle and the fall appear in the door of the engine-room he see frank and cry : hello you so you be all right wonder you be not kill you come down with a rush young feller but you go back just as quick frank understand instantly here be a man who see it he cry he will tell you that i be not lie the engineer turn to the stoker how do he happen to fall he ask he do not fall declare the begrime coal heaver no what then -- ` nother chap jump on he back and fling he down it be wonderful he be not kill frank be triumphant he regard the engineer and he assistant with a grim smile on he face this be incredible exclaim the engineer who could have do such a thing

gregory and the wiper i want a look at those wiper say frank you shall have it mr gregory and i be talk together over here all the time you be go oh i do not suspect you say merry but i want a good look at those wiper do you see the man who throw you into the stoke-hole no but -- then how will you know who it be if you see he whoever do so have a reason for the act -- a motive he must have know I before i may know he come invite the engineer he call one of the wiper down from amid the slide shaft and move machinery the man come unhesitatingly frank take a square look at this man who do not seek to avoid inspection never see he before confess merry the wiper be dismiss hackett call the engineer the other wiper do not seem to hear he pretend to be very busy and keep at work hackett he could not fail to hear that he keep he face turn away but answer : yes sir come here i want you the wiper hesitate then he turn and slowly approach he face be besmear till scarcely a bit of natural color show and he hat be pull low over he eye he shamble forward awkwardly and stand in a awkward position with he eye cast down frank look at he closely and start then in a perfectly calm manner but with a trace of triumph in he voice he declare : this be the fellow who do the job chapter ix in iron what cry the engineer in astonishment how do you know ask the engineer 's assistant incredulously that be it -- how do you know demand the engineer you say you do not see the person who attack you i do not yet you say this be the man yes how do you know i know he you do yes you have see he before i should say so on several occasion he be one of my bitterest enemy this be not the first time he have try to kill or injure I he have make the attempt many time before he be the only person here who would do such a thing if this be true say the engineer grimly he shall pay dearly for he work the assistant nod what have you to say hackett demand the engineer i say it be a lie growl the fellow i never see this chap before he come into the engine-room he do not know I and i do not know he you hear what hackett have to say say the engineer turn to frank i hear what this fellow have to say but he name be not hackett be not no no more than mine be hackett then what be he name he name be harri assert merry and he be a gambler and a crook i 'll guarantee that he have not be long on the ` eagle ' no we take he on in new york scarcely two hour before we sail we need a man and he apply for any kind of a job find he have work round machinery and we take he as wiper and general assistant it be not so many week ago that he attack I at new haven say frank he fail to do I harm when he find i be go abroad he declare he would go along on the same steamer at the time he must have think i be go by one of the regular liner but it be plain he follow I up pretty close and find i be go over this way as there be no second-class passage on this boat he decide he could not travel in the same class with I without be discover and he resolve to go as one of the crew if he could get on that way that be how he happen to be here if what you say be true it will go pretty hard with mr harri we 'll have he iron and -- a cry of rage break from the lip of the accuse there be no proof he snarl no one can swear i attack this fellow and throw he into the stoke-hole oh yes say the stoker who have come up from below i see the whole business by the light from the furnace i plainly see the man who do it and you be the man that settle it declare the engineer you 'll make the rest of the voyage in iron mr harri then i 'll give you something to iron I for shout the furious young villain he leap on frank merriwell with the fierceness of a wounded tiger frank be not expect the assault and for the moment he be take off he guard they be close to the move machinery within four foot of they a huge plunging rod be play up and down move by a steel bar that weigh many ton harri attempt to fling frank beneath this bar where he would be strike and crush the villain nearly succeed so swift and savage be he attack frank realize that the purpose of the wretch be to fling he into the machinery and he brace himself to resist as quickly as possible shout of consternation break from the engineer and he assistant they spring forward to seize harri and help frank but before they could interfere frank break the hold of he enemy force he back and strike he a terrible blow between the eye fell he instantly merriwell stand over harri he hand clench he eye gleam get up he cry get up you dog i can not strike you when you be down and i would give a hundred dollar to hit you just once more but harri do not get up he realize that he second attempt have fail and he stand in awe of frank 's terrible fist he look up at those gleaming eye and turn away quickly feel a sudden great fear do frank merriwell bear a charmed life surely it seem that way to harri just then for the first time perhaps the young rascal begin to believe that it be not possible to harm the lad he hate with all the intensity of he nature the engineer and he assistant grab harri and hold he the former swearing savagely they drag the fellow to he foot but warn he to stand still harri do so for the moment at least he be completely cow a man be send for the captain with instruction to tell he just what occur of course the captain of the steamer be the only person who could order one of the man place in iron the captain come in in a little while and he listen in great amazement to the story of what have take place he face be hard and grim he ask frank a few question and then he order that harri be iron and confine in the hold mr merriwell say the captain i be very sorry that this happen on my ship it be all right captain say frank you be in no way to blame the fellow ship with the intention of do just what he do if he find a opportunity it will go hard-with he declare the master he 'll not get out of this without suffer the penalty harri be sullen and silent frank speak to he before he be lead away harri he say you have bring destruction on yourself i can not say that i arm sorry for you for by you persistent attack on I you have destroy any sympathy i might have feel you have ruin you own life no snarled sport you be the one you ruin I if i go to prison for this i 'll get free again sometime and i 'll not forget you frank merriwell all the year i be behind the bar will but add to the debt i owe you when i come forth to freedom i 'll find you if you be alive and i 'll have you life then he be march away between two stout man he iron clank and rattle chapter x the game in the next room when merry appear in he stateroom he be greet with a storm of question well what do this mean try to dodge we run away mut the whatter with you -- i mean what be the matter where have you be stand and give a account of yourself then he tell they a little story that astounded they beyond measure he explain how he have take a fancy to look the steamer over and have fall in with the engineer then he relate how he have visit the engine room and be throw into the stoke-hole but when he tell the name of he assailant the climax be capped harri gasp rattleton incredulously harris palpitated diamond astounded harri roar brown arouse from he lazy languidness on this steamer they shout in unison on this steamer nod frank really enjoy the sensation he have create he -- he attack you gurgle rattleton seem to forget he recent sickness he do and you escape after be throw into the stoke-hole fluttered diamond i be here and you do not kill the cur on sight roar brown he be in the hold in iron serve he right be the verdict of frank 's three friend well this be what i call a real sensation say the virginian you certainly find something frank well that fellow have reach the end of he rope at last say harry with intense satisfaction once more stretch himself in he bunk that be pretty sure nod jack attempt murder on the high sea be a pretty serious thing he 'll get push for it all right this time grunt brown begin to recover from he astonishment then they talk the affair over and frank give they he theory of sport 's presence on the steamer which seem plausible this be something rather more interesting than the superstitious man or the frenchman say diamond the superstitious man be interesting at first observe merry but i have a fancy that he might prove a bear then bruce grunt : say do fact and reason err and if they both err which the more the man of the smallest calibre be sure to be the greatest bear while they be talk the sound of voice come from the stateroom occupy by the frenchman soon it become evident that quite a little party have gather in that room the boy pay no attention to the party till it come time to turn in for the night then they become aware that something be take place in the adjoining room and it be not long before they make out that it be a game of poker as they become quiet they could hear the murmur of voice and occasionally some person would speak distinctly see raise or call diamond begin to get nervous say he observe that make I think of old time many a night i have spend at that what be the matter with you say frank do you want to go in there and take a hand well jack confess i do feel a itching i feel like get some sleep grunt bruce and they be keep I awake why be they play in a stateroom anyhow exclaim frank it be no place for a game of card at night that be so agreed rattleton dreamily but you be keep I awake by you chatter a good deal more than they be shut up the whole lot of you there be silence for a time and then with a savage exclamation diamond spring out of he berth and thump on the partition cry : come gentleman it be time to go to bed you be keep we awake there be no response jack go back to bed but the murmur continue in the next stateroom and the rattle of chip could be hear occasionally what be we go to do about it merriwell ask jack savagely we can complain but make a complaint be repellent to a college youth who be incline to regard as a cheap fellow anybody who would do such a thing and diamond do not agree to that well say frank i suppose i can go in there and clean they all out how at they own game laugh merry muffledly if anybody in this crowd tackle they that way i 'll be the one assert the virginian then nobody here will tackle they that way say frank remember how he have once save diamond from sharper in new haven frank be a person who believe that knowledge of almost any sort be likely to prove of value to a man at some stage of he career and he have make a practice of learn everything possible he have study up on the trick of gambler so that he know all about they method of rob they victim be a first-class amateur magician he knowledge of card trick have become of value to he in more than one instance he feel that he would be able to hold he own against pretty clever card-sharp but he do not care or propose to have any dealings with such man unless force to do so the boy keep still for a while they light be extinguish but up near the ceiling a shaft of light come through the partition from the other room diamond see it he jump up and drag a trunk into position by that partition mount on the trunk he apply he eye to the orifice and discover that he could see into the frenchman 's room very nicely what can you see grunt browning i can see everyone in there answer jack name they the frenchman the englishman the superstitious man and we fresh friend bloodgood same old crowd murmur frank yes and a hot old game come from the youth on the trunk my my but they be whoop she up they have get plenty to drink and they be play for big dust tell they to see up till to-morrow mumble bruce jack do not do so however he remain on the trunk watch the game seem greatly interested a big game of poker interested he any time it be through the influence of frank that he have be lead to renounce the game but the thirst for its excitement and delight remain with he for he have come from a family of card-player and sportsman come come laugh frank after a while i can hear you tooth chatter old man get off that trunk and turn in wait flutter jack -- wait till i see this hand play out in less than half a minute he cry : it be a skin game i know it be what be the lay asked merry that infernal frenchman be a card-sharp i suspect as much he pal be the englishman they be stand in together yes sure thing they be bleed bloodgood and slush bloodgood think he be pretty sharp and i have not much sympathy for he but i be sorry for poor little slush he should have pay attention to some of he sign and omen he know something disastrous would happen during this voyage and i rather think it will happen to he then diamond thump the wall again cry : stop that business in there mr slush you be play card with crook -- you be be rob get out of that game as soon as you can there be a sudden silence in the adjoining room and then m rouen montfort be hear to utter a exclamation in french follow which he cry : i see you to-morrow saire i make you swallow ze lie you may see I any time you like diamond fling back chapter xi the horror of the hold to the surprise of the four youth m montfort utterly ignore they on the follow day instead of seek trouble as have be anticipate well say jack in disgust he have less courage than i think he be just a common boast frenchman he be not a common frenchman declare frank i believe he be a rascal of more than common calibre but he lack nerve and i have nothing but contempt for he say the virginian i do not know but he would challenge I to a duel what if he have what if he have hiss the hot-blooded southern youth i would fight he at the drop of the hat that be all right but you know most frenchmen fight well in a duel i do not know anything of the kind they be expert fencer but i notice it be mighty seldom one of they be kill in a duel they sometimes draw a drop of blood and then they consider that ` honor be satisfied ' and that end it it be midway in the forenoon that frank meet mr slush on deck the little man be look more doleful and dejected than ever if possible the -- ah -- the moon show rather yellow last night he say that be a -- a sure sign of disaster well say merry with a smile i think the disaster will befall you sir if you do not steer clear of the crowd you be in last night mr slush look surprised might i -- ah -- inquire you meaning he falter i mean that you be play poker with card-sharp and they mean to rob you answer frank plainly i -- i wonder how you -- er -- know so much say the little man with something like faint sarcasm as frank fancied it make little difference how i know it but i be tell you the truth i be warn you for you good sir er -- ahem thank you -- very much mr slush walk away well i be hang if he do not take it coolly enough muttered frank perplexed frank feel a interest to know how sport harri be get along he walk forward and find the captain near the step that lead to the bridge in reply to merry 's inquiry the captain say : oh do not worry about he there be rat down there in the hold but i guess he 'll be able to fight they off he 'll have bread and water the rest of the voyage after that merry could not help thinking of harri all alone in the darkness of the hold with swarm of rat around he eat dry bread wash down with water frank feel that the youthful villain do not deserve any sympathy but despite himself he could not help feel a pang of pity for he when he express himself thus to he friend however they scoff at he serve the dog right flash diamond he be get just what he deserve and i be glad of it he will get what he deserve when we reach the other side grunt brown no say merry he be a american and he 'll have to be take back to the united state for punishment well he 'll get it all right
