produce by suzanne shell william bumgarner and pg distribute proofreader the late mr null by frank r stockton 1886 chapter i there be a wide entrance gate to the old family mansion of midbranch but it be never open to admit the family or visitor although occasionally a load of wood draw by two horse and two mule come between its tall chestnut post and be take by a roundabout way among the tree to a spot at the back of the house where the chip of several generation of sturdy wood-chopper have form a ligneous soil deeper than the arable surface of any portion of the nine hundred and fifty acre which form the farm of midbranch this seldom open gate be in a corner of the lawn and the driving of carriage or the ride of horse through it to the porch at the front of the house would have be the ruin of the short thick grass which have cover that lawn it be generally believe ever since virginium become a state but there have to be some way for people who come in carriage or on horseback to get into the house and therefore the fence at the bottom of the lawn at a point directly in front of the porch be cross by a set of broad wooden step five outside and five inside with a platform at the top these stair be wide enough to accommodate eight people abreast so that if a large carriage load of visitor arrive none of they need delay in cross the fence at the outside of the step run the narrow road which enter the plantation a quarter of a mile away and pass around the lawn and the garden to the barn and stable at the back on the other side of the road undivide from it by hedge or fence stretch like a sea gently move by a groundswell a vast field sometimes plant in tobacco and sometimes in wheat in the midst of this field stand a tall persimmon tree which yearly drop its half-candied fruit upon the first light snow of the winter it be true that persimmon quite fit to eat be to be find on this tree at a earlier period than this but such fruit be never notice by the people in those part who would not rudely wrench from jack frost he one little claim to rivalry with the sun as a fruit-ripener to the right of the field be a wide extent of pasture land run down to a small stream or branch which flow between two other stream of the same kind a mile or two on either side of it have give its name to the place in front to the left lay a great forest of chestnut oak sassafras and sweet gum with here and there a clump of tall pine stand up straight and stiff with a air of puritanic condemnation of the change fashion of the foliage about they on one side of the platform of the broad stile which have be mention sit one summer afternoon the lady of the house she be a young woman and although she face be a good deal shadow by she far-spreading hat it be easy to perceive that she be a handsome one she be the niece of mr robert brandon the elderly bachelor who own midbranch and she mother long since dead have call she roberta which be as near as she could come to the name of she only brother miss roberta 's father be a man whose mind and time be entirely give up to railroad and although he nominally live in new york he be for the greater part of the year engage in endeavor to forward he interest somewhere west of the mississippus two or three month of the winter be generally spend in he city home at these time he have he daughter with he but the rest of the year she live with she uncle whose household she direct with much good will and judgment the old gentleman do not keep she all the summer at midbranch he know what be necessary for a young lady who have be educate in germany and switzerland and who have afterwards make a very favorable impression in pari and london and so during the hot weather he take she with he to one of the fashionable southern resort where they always stay exactly six week the gentleman who be sit on the other side of the platform with he face turn towards she have know miss roberta for a year or more have meet she at the north and also in the virginium mountain and be now on a visit to the green sulphur spring about four mile from midbranch he ride over to see she nearly every day there be nothing surprising in this because the green sulphur once a much frequented resort have see great change and now although the end of the regular season have not arrive it have mr lawrence croft for its only guest there be a spacious hotel there there be a village of cottage of vary size there be building for servant and manager there be a ten-pin alley and a quiet ground there be arbor and swing and a square hole in a stone slab through which a little pool of greenish water could be see with a tin cup somewhat rusty lie by it but all be quiet and desert except one cottage in which the man live who have charge of the place and where mr croft board it be very pleasant for he to ride over to midbranch and take a walk with miss roberta and this be what they have be do to-day horseback ride have be suggest but mr brandon object to these he know mr croft to be a young man of good family and very comfortable fortune and he like he very much when he have he there to dinner but he do not wish he niece to go gallop around the country with he to quiet walk in the wood and through the meadow he could of course have no objection a good many of mr brandon 's principle like certain of he book be keep upon a top shelf but miss roberta always like to humor the few which the old gentleman be wont to have within easy reach this afternoon they have ramble through the wood where the hard smooth road wound picturesquely through the place in which it have be easiest to make a road and where the great trunk of the tree be partly cover by cling vine which miss roberta know to be either virginium creeper or poison oak although she do not remember which of these have cluster of five leaf and which of three the horse on which mr croft have ride over from the spring be tie to a fence near by and he now seem to indicate by he restless movement that it be quite time for the gentleman to go home but with this opinion mr croft decidedly differ he have have a long walk with the lady and plenty of opportunity to say anything that he might choose but still there be something very important which have not be say and which mr croft very much wish to say before he leave miss roberta that afternoon he only reason for hesitation be the fact that he do not know what he wish to say he be a man who always keep a lookout on the bow of he daily action in storm or in calm in fog or in bright sunshine that lookout must be at he post and upon he report it depend whether mr croft set more sail put on more steam reverse he engine or anchor he vessel a report from this lookout be what he hope to elicit by the remark which he wish to make he desire greatly to know whether miss roberta march look upon he in the light of a lover or in that of a intimate acquaintance whose present intimacy depend a good deal upon the propinquity of midbranch and the green sulphur spring he have endeavor to produce upon she mind the latter impression if he ever wish she to regard he as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way but the other procedure be much more difficult and he be not certain that he have succeed in it how to find out in what light she view he without allow the lady to perceive he purpose be a very delicate operation i wish say miss roberta poke with the end of she parasol at some half-withered wild flower which lay on the step beneath she that you would change you mind and take supper with we mr croft 's mind be very busy in endeavor to think of some casual remark some observation regard man nature or society or even a anecdote or historical incident which if bring into the conversation might produce upon the lady 's countenance some shade of expression or some variation in she tone or word which would give he the information he seek for but what he say be : be they really supper that you have or be they only tea now i know say the lady why you have sometimes take dinner with we but never supper you be afraid that it would be a tea lawrence croft be think that if this girl believe that he be in love with she it would make a great deal of difference in he present course of action if such be the case he ought not to come here so often or in fact he ought not to come at all until he have decide for himself what he be go to do but what could he say that would cause she for the briefest moment to unveil she idea of himself i never could endure he say those meal which consist of thin shaving of bread with thick plaster of butter aid and abet by sweet cake preserve and tea you should have reserve those remark she say until you have find out what sort of evening meal we have he could certainly say something he think perhaps it might be some little fanciful story which would call up in she mind without he appear to intend it some thought of he relationship to she as a lover -- that be if she have ever have such a notion if this could be do she face would betray the fact but not be ready to make such a remark he say : i beg you pardon but do you really have supper in the english fashion oh no answer miss roberta we do not have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitcher of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserve we have coffee as well as tea hot roll fleecy and light hot batter bread make of we finest corn meal hot biscuit and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody want it he can always have a slice of cold ham if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that she look upon I merely as a acquaintance i would cease to trouble my mind on this subject and let everything go on as before but i be not sure and i would rather not come here again until i be and at what hour he ask do you partake of a meal like that in summer time say miss roberta we have supper when it be dark enough to light the lamp my uncle dislike very much to be deprive by the advent of a meal of the out-door enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening it would be easy enough thought mr croft for I to say something about my be suddenly oblige to go away and then notice its effect upon she but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage I in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she look upon I would show nothing but a well-bred regret that i should be oblige to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for you supper say he be a very suitable one but i be not sure that such a variety of hot bread would agree with I do you ever see more healthy-looking lady and gentleman than you find in virginia asked miss march it be not that i want to know if she look favorably upon I say lawrence croft to himself for when i wish to discover that i shall simply ask she what i wish now to know be whether or not she consider I at all as a lover there surely must be something i can say which will give I a clew the virginian as a rule he reply be certainly a very well-grown and vigorous race in spite of the hot bread she say with a smile just then mr croft believe himself strike by a happy thought you be not prepared i suppose to say in consequence of it and that recall the fact that so much in this world happen in spite of thing instead of in consequence of they i do not know that i exactly understand say miss roberta well for instance say mr croft take the case of marriage do not you think that a man be more apt to marry in spite of he belief that he would be much better off as a bachelor than in consequence of a conviction that a benedict 's life would suit he better that say she depend a good deal on the woman as she say this lawrence glance quickly at she to observe the expression of she countenance the countenance plainly indicate that its owner have suddenly be make aware that the afternoon be slip away and that she have forget certain household duty that devolve upon she here come peggy she say and i must go into the house and give out supper do not you now think it would be well for you to follow we discussion of a virginium supper by eat one at this moment there arrive at the bottom of the inside step a small girl very black very solemn and very erect with she hand fold in front of she very straight up-and-down calico frock she feature expressive of a wooden stolidity which nothing but a hammer or chisel could alter and with large eye fix upon a far-away which apparently have disappear leave the eye in a condition of idle out-go miss rob say this wooden peggy aun ' judy say it be more 'n time to come housekeep which mean say miss roberta rise that i must go and get my key basket and descend into the store-room will not you come in we shall find uncle on the back porch mr croft decline with thanks and take he leave and the lady walk across the smooth grass to the house follow by the rigid peggy the young man approach he impatient horse and not without some difficulty get himself mount he have not that facility of sympathetically combine he own will and that of he horse which come to man who from they early boyhood be wont to consider horse as object quite as necessary to locomotion as shoe and stocking but lawrence croft be a fair graduate of a ride school and he go away in very good style to he cottage at the green sulphur spring i believe he say to himself as he ride through the wood that miss march expect no more of I than she would expect of any very intimate friend i shall feel perfectly free therefore to continue my investigation regard two point : first be she worth have and : second will she have I and i must be very careful not to get the position of these point reverse when miss roberta go into the store-room it be peggy who under the supervision of she mistress measure out the fine white flour for the biscuit for supper peggy be be educate to do these thing properly and she know exactly how many time the tin scoop must fill itself in the barrel for the ordinary need of the family miss roberta stand she eye contemplatively raise to the narrow window through which she could see a flush of sunset mingle itself with the outer air and peggy scoop once twice thrice four time then she stop and raise she head there come into the far-away gloom of she eye a quick sparkle like a flash of black lightning she make another and entirely supplementary scoop and then she stop and let the tin utensil fall into the barrel with a gentle thud that will do say miss roberta that night when she should have be in she bed peggy sit alone by the hearth in aunt judy 's cabin bake a cake it be a peculiar cake for she could get no sugar for it but she have supply this deficiency with molasses it be make of miss roberta 's finest white flour and egg there be in it and butter and it contain besides three raisin a olive and a prune when the outside of the cake have be sufficiently baked and every portion of it have be scrupulously eat the good little peggy murmur to herself : it be pow ` ful comfortin ' for miss rob to have sumfin ' on she min ' chapter ii about a week after mr lawrence croft have have he conversation with miss march on the stile step at midbranch he be oblige to return to he home in new york he be not a man of business but he have business and besides this he consider if he continue much longer to reside in the utterly attractionless cottage at the green sulphur spring and ride over every day to the very attractive house at midbranch that the point mention in the previous chapter might get themselves reverse he be a man who be proud of be under all circumstance frank and honest with himself he do not wish if it could be avoid to deceive other people but he be prudent and careful about exhibit he motive and intended course of action to he associate himself however he take into he strictest confidence he be fond of the idea that he go into the battle of life cover and protect by a great shield but that the inside of the shield be a mirror in which he could always see himself look into this mirror he now see that if he do not soon get away from miss roberta he would lay down he shield and surrender and it be he intent that this should not happen until he wish it to happen it be very natural when lawrence reach new york that he should take pleasure in talk about miss roberta march and she family with any one who know they he be particularly anxious if he could do so delicately and without exciting any suspicion of he object to know as much as possible about sylvester march the lady 's father in do this he do not feel that he be prying into the affair of other but he could not be true to himself unless he look well in advance before he make the step on which he mind be set it be in this way that he happen to learn that about two year before miss march have be engage to be marry but that the engagement have be break off for reason not know to he informant and he could find out nothing about the gentleman except that he name be junius keswick the fact that the lady have have a lover put she in a new light before lawrence croft he have have a idea suggest by the very friendly nature of they intercourse that she be a woman whose mind do not run out to love or marriage but now that he know that she be susceptible of be woo and win because these thing have actually happen to she he be very glad that he have come away from midbranch the impression soon become very strong upon the mind of lawrence that he would like to know what kind of man be this former lover he have know miss march about a year and at the time of he first acquaintaince with she she must have come very fresh from this engagement to study the man to whom roberta march have be willing to engage herself be to lawrence 's mode of think if not a prerequisite procedure in he contemplated course of action at least a very desirable one but he be rather surprise to find that no one know much about mr junius keswick or could give he any account of he present whereabouts although he have be at the time when he engagement be in force a resident of new york to consult a directory be therefore a obvious first step in the affair and with this intent mr croft enter one morning a apothecary 's shop in a street which though a busy one be in a rather out-of-the-way part of the city we have not any directory sir say the clerk but if you will step across the street you can find one at that little shop with the green door everybody go there to look at the directory the green door on the opposite side of the street approach by a single flat step of stone have a tin sign upon it on which be paint : information of every variety furnish within push open the door lawrence enter a long narrow room not very well light with a short counter on one side and some desk partially screen by a curtain at the farther end a boy be behind the counter and to he lawrence address himself ask permission to look at a city directory one cent if you look yourself three cent if we look say the boy produce a thick volume from beneath the counter one cent say lawrence smile at the oddity of this charge as he open the book and turn to the letter k yes say the boy and if the fine print hurt you eye we 'll look for three cent at this moment a man come from one of the desk at the other end of the room and hand the boy a letter with which that young person immediately depart the new-comer a smooth-shaven man of about thirty with the air of the proprietor or head manager very strong upon he take the boy 's position behind the counter and remark to lawrence : most people when they first come here think it rather queer to pay for look at the directory but you see we do not keep a directory to coax people to come in to buy medicine or anything else we sell nothing but information and part of we stock be what you get out of a directory but it be the best plan all round for we can afford to give you a clean good book instead of one all jagged and worn and as you pay you money you feel you can look as long as you like and come when you please it be a very good plan say lawrence close the book but the name i want be not here perhaps it be in last year 's directory say the man produce another volume from under the counter that would not do I much good say lawrence i want to know where some one reside this year it will do a great deal of good say the other for if we know where a person have live inquiry can be make there as to where he have go sometimes we go back three or four year and when we have once find a man 's name we follow he up from place to place until we can give the inquirer he present address what be the name you want sir you be look in the k 's keswick say lawrence junius keswick the man run he finger and he eye down a column and remark : there be keswick but it be peter laborer i suppose that be not the party lawrence smile and shake he head we will take the year before that say the man with cheerful alacrity heave up another volume here be two keswick he say in a moment one john and the other stephen w neither of they right no say lawrence my man be junius and we need not go any farther back i be afraid the person i be look for be only a sojourner in the city and that he name do not get into the directory i know that he be here year before last all right sir say the other push aside the volume he have be consult we 'll find the man for you from the hotel book and what be more we can see those two keswick that i find last perhaps they be relation of he and he be stay with they if you put the matter in we hand we 'll give you the address to-morrow night provide it be a ordinary case but if he have go to australia or japan of course it 'll take longer be it crime or relationship neither reply lawrence it be generally one of they say the man and if it be crime we carry it on to a certain point and then put it into the hand of the detective for we have nothing to do with police business private or otherwise but if it be relationship we 'll go right through with it to the end any kind of information you may want we 'll give you here scientific biographical business healthfulness of locality genuineness of antiquity age and standing of individual purity of liquor or tea from sample bible item localized china verify in fact anything you want to know we can tell you of course we do not pretend that we know all these thing but we know the people who do know or who can find they out by come to we and pay a small sum the most valuable information which it would take you year to find out can be secure with certainty and generally in a few day we know what to do and where to go and that be the point if it be a new bug or a microscope insect we put it into the hand of a man who know just what high scientific authority to apply to if it be the middle name of you next door neighbor we 'll give it to you from he baptismal record i be get up a pamphlet-circular which will be ready in about a week and which will fully explain we method of business with the charge for the different item etc well say lawrence take out he pocket-book i want the address of junius keswick and i think i will let you look it up for I what be you charge it will be two dollar say the man ordinary and if we find inquiry run into other country we will make special term and then there be seven cent one for you look and two three for ours you shall hear from we to-morrow night at you hotel or residence unless you prefer to call here i will call the day after to-morrow say lawrence produce a five-dollar note very good reply the proprietor will you please pay the cashier point at the same time to a desk behind lawrence which the latter have not notice approach this desk the top of which except for a small space in front be surround by short curtain he see a young girl busily engage in read a book he proffer she the note the proprietor at the same time call out : two seven the girl turn the book down to keep the place then she take the note and open a small drawer in which she fumble for some moment close the drawer she rise to she foot and wave the note over the curtain to she right have not any change eh say the man come from behind the counter and put on he hat as the boy 's not here i 'll step out and get it the girl turn up she book and begin to read again and lawrence stand and look at she wonder what need there be of a cashier in a place like this she appear to be under twenty rather thin-faced and be plainly dress in a few moment she raise she eye from she book and say : will not you sit down sir i be sorry you have to wait but we be short of change to-day and sometimes it be hard to get it in this neighborhood lawrence decline to be seat but be very willing to talk be it the proprietor of this establishment he ask who go out to get the money change yes sir she answer that be mr candy a queer name say lawrence smile the girl look up at he and smile in return there be a very perceptible twinkle in she eye which seem to be eye that would like to be merry one and a slight movement of the corner of she mouth which indicate a desire to say something in reply but restrain probably by loyalty to she employer or by prudent discretion regard conversation with stranger she be silent lawrence however continue he remark the whole business seem to I very odd suppose i be to come here and ask for information as to where i could get a five-dollar note change would mr candy be able to tell I he would do in that case just as he do in all other she say first he would go and find out and then he would let you know give information be only half the business finding thing out be the other half that be what he be do now so when he come back say lawrence he 'll have a new bit of information to add to he stock on hand which must be a very peculiar one i fancy the cashier smile yes she say and a very useful one too if people only know it do not they know it ask lawrence do not you have plenty of custom at this moment the door open mr candy enter and the conversation stop sorry to keep you wait sir say the proprietor pass some money to the cashier over the curtain who thereupon hand two dollar and ninety-three cent to lawrence through the little opening in front if you call the day after to-morrow the information will be ready for you say mr candy as the gentleman depart on the appoint day lawrence come again and find nobody in the place but the cashier who hand he a note mr candy leave this for you in case he should not be in when you call she say the note state that the search for the address of junius keswick have open very encouragingly but as it be quite evident that say person be not now in the city the investigation would have to be carry on on a more extended scale and a deposit of three dollar would be necessary to meet expense lawrence look from the note to the cashier who have be watch he as he read do mr candy want I to leave three dollar with you he ask that be what he say sir well say lawrence i do not care about pay for unlimited investigation in this way if the gentleman i be in search of have leave the city and mr candy have be able to find out to what place he go he should have tell I that and i would have decide whether or not i want he to do anything more the face of the cashier appear troubled i think sir she say that if you leave the money mr candy will do all he can to discover what you wish to know and that it will not be very long before you have the address of the person you be seek do you really think he have any clew ask lawrence this question do not seem to please the cashier and she answer gravely though without any show of resentment : that be a strange question after i advise you to leave the money lawrence have a kind heart and it reproach he i beg you pardon say he i will leave the money with you but i desire that mr candy will in he next communication give I all the information he have acquire up to the moment of write and then i will decide whether it be worth while to go on with the matter or not he thereupon take out he pocket-book and hand three dollar to the cashier who with a air of deliberate thoughtfulness smooth out the two note and place they in she drawer then she say : if you will leave you address sir i will see that you receive you information as soon as possible that will be better than for you to call because i can not tell you when to come very well say lawrence and i will be oblige to you if you will hurry up mr candy as much as you can and hand she he card he go he way the way of lawrence croft be generally a very pleasant one for the fortunate condition of he life make it possible for he to go around most of the rough place which might lie in it he family be a old one and a good one but there be very little of it leave and of its scatter remnant he be the most important member but although circumstance do not force he to do anything in particular he like to believe that he be a rigid master to himself and whatever he do be always do with a purpose when he travel he have a object in view when he stay at home the case be the same he present purpose be the most serious one of he life : he wish to marry and if she should prove to be the proper person he wish to marry roberta march and as a preliminary step in the carry out of he purpose he want very much to know what sort of man miss march have once be willing to marry when five day have elapse without he hearing from mr candy he become impatient and betook himself to the green door with the tin sign enter he find only the boy and the cashier address himself to the latter he ask if anything have be do in he business yes sir she say and i hope mr candy would write you a letter this morning before he go out but he do not he trace the gentleman to niagara fall and i think you 'll hear something very soon if inquiry have to be carry on outside of the city say lawrence they will probably cost a good deal and come to nothing i think i will drop the matter as far as mr candy be concerned i wish you would give we a little more time say the girl i be sure you will hear something in a few day and you need not be afraid there will be anything more to pay unless you be satisfied that you have receive the full worth of the money lawrence reflect for a few moment and then conclude to let the matter go on tell mr candy to keep I frequently inform of the progress of the affair say he and if he be really of any service to I i be willing to pay he but not otherwise that will be all right say the cashier and if mr candy be -- be prevent from do it i 'll write to you myself and keep you post as soon as the customer have go the boy who have be sit on the counter thus speak to the cashier : you know very well that old mintstick have give that thing up i know he have say the girl but i have not you have not anything to do with it say the boy yes i have she answer i advise that gentleman to pay he money and i be not go to see he cheat out of it of course mr candy do not mean to cheat he but he have go into that business about the origin of the tame blackberry and there be no know when he 'll get back to this thing which be not in he line anyway i should say it be not exclaim the boy with a loud laugh sendin ' I to look up they two keswick who be both put down as cordwainer in year before last 's directory and askin ' 'em if there be any junius in they family junius keswick do you say be that the name of the gentleman mr candy be look for yes say the boy presently the cashier remark : i be go to look at the book and she betake herself to the desk at the back part of the shop in about half a hour she return and hand to the boy a memorandum upon a scrap of paper you go out now to you lunch she say and while you be out stop at the st winifr hotel where mr candy find the name of junius keswick and see if it be not down again not long after the date which i have put on this slip of paper i think if a person go to niagara fall he would be just as likely to make a little trip of it and come back again as to keep travel on which mr candy suppose he do if you find the name again put down the date of arrival on this and see if there be any memorandum about forwarding letter all right say the boy but i 'll be go a hour and a half can not cut into my lunch time in the course of a few day lawrence croft receive a note sign candy & co per some illegible initial which state that mr junius keswick have be trace to a boarding-house in the city but as the establishment have be break up for some time endeavor be now be make to find the lady who have keep the house and when this be do it would most likely be possible to discover from she where mr keswick have go lawrence wait a few day and then call at the information shop again be mr candy absent and so be the boy the cashier inform he that she have find -- that be that the lady who keep the boarding-house have be find -- and she think she remember the gentleman in question and promise as soon as she could to look through a book in which she use to keep direction for the forwarding of letter and in this way another clew might soon be expect this seem to be go on better say lawrence but mr candy do not show much in the affair who be manage it you the girl blush and then laugh a little confusedly i be only the cashier she say and the laborious duty of you position would of course give you no time for anything else remark lawrence oh well say the girl of course it be easy enough for any one to see that i have not much to do as cashier but the boy and mr candy be nearly always out look up thing and i have to do other business besides attend to cash if you be attend to my business say lawrence i be very glad especially now that it have reach the boarding-house stage where i think a woman will be better able to work than a man be you do this entirely independent of mr candy well sir say the cashier with a honest straightforward look from she gray eye that please lawrence i may as well confess that i be but there be nothing mean about it he have all the same as give it up for he be wait to hear from a man at niagara who will never write to he and probably have not any thing to write and as i advise you to pay the money i feel bind in honor to see that the business be do if it can be do have you a brother or a husband to help you in these investigation and search ask lawrence no say the cashier with a smile sometimes i send we boy and as to board house i can go to they myself after we shut up here i wish say lawrence that you be marry and that you have a husband who would not interfere in this matter at all but who would go about with you and so enable you to follow up you clew thoroughly you take up the business in the right spirit and i believe you would succeed in find mr keswick but i do not like the idea of send you about by yourself i will not deny say the cashier that since i have begin this affair i would like very much to carry it out so if you do not object i will not give it up just yet and as soon as anything happen i 'll let you know chapter iii autumn in virginium especially if one be not too near the mountain be a season in which greenness sail very close to christmas although generally veer away in time to prevent its verdant hue from tinge that happy day with the gloomy influence of the prophetic proverb about churchyard long after the time when the people of the region water by the hudson and the merrimac be begin to button up they overcoat and to think of weather strip for they window-sash the dweller in the land through which flow the appomattox and the jame may sit upon they broad piazza and watch the grow glory of the forest where the crimson star of the sweet gum blaze among the rich yellow of the chestnut the linger green of the oak and the enduring verdure of the pine the insect still hum in the sunny air and the sun be now a genial orb whose warm ray cheer but not excoriate the orb just mention be approach the horizon when in a adjoining county to that in which be situate the hospitable mansion of midbranch a little negro boy about ten year old be drive some cow through a gateway that open on a public road the cow as they be go homeward file willingly through the gateway which lead into a field at the far end of which might be dimly discern a house

carriage then at some distance she stop short and gaze at it she do not retire behind a bush as she have do on a former occasion but she stand in the shade of a tree on the side of the road and wait as the carriage come nearer to the gate the surprise upon she face become rapidly mingle with indignation the driver have check the speed of he horse and without doubt intend to stop at the gate this might not have be sufficient to excite she emotion but she now see clearly have not be quite certain of it before that the occupant of the carriage be a lady and apparently a young one for she wear in she hat some bright-colored flower the driver stop get down open the gate and then mount to he seat drive through leave the gate standing wide open this contempt of ordinary proprietary requirement make the old lady spring out from the shelter of the shade brandish she umbrella she be about to cry out to the man to stop and shut the gate but she restrain herself the distance be too great and besides she think better of it she go again into the shade and wait in about ten minute the carriage come back but without the lady this time the driver get down shut the gate after he and drive rapidly away if blaze eye could crack glass the spectacles of the old lady would have be splintered into many piece as she stand by the roadside the end of she umbrella jab a inch or two into the ground after stand thus for some five minute she suddenly turn and walk vigorously away in the direction from which she have come uncle isham letty and the boy plez be very much surprised at the

the parlor she valise rather larger than that of the previous visitor be bring in and put in the hall she wait for a hour or two during which time letty make several attempt to account for the non-appearance of she mistress who she say be away on a visit but be expect back every minute and when supper be ready she partake of that meal alone and after a short evening spend in read she go to bed in the chamber which letty prepare for she before she retire letty who have show herself a very capable attendant say to she : wot 's you name miss i allus like to know the name o ' lady i wait on '' my name say the lady be mrs null chapter iv the autumn sun be shine very pleasantly when about nine o'clock in the morning mr null come out on the porch and standing at the top of the step look about she she have on she hat with the red flower and she wear a short jacket into the pocket of which she hand be thrust with a air which indicate satisfaction with the circumstance surround she the old dog lie on the grass at the bottom of the step look up at she and flop he tail upon the ground mr null call to he in a cheerful tone and the dog arise and hesitatingly put he forefoot on the bottom step then when she hold out she hand and speak to he again he determine that come what might he would go up those forbid step and let she pat he head this he do and after look about he to assure himself that this be reality and not a dog dream he lay down upon the door-mat and with a sigh of relief compose himself to sleep a black turkey gobbler who look as if he have be char in a fire follow by five turkey hen also suggest the idea that water have be throw over they before anything but they surface have be burn come timidly around the house and stop before venture upon the greensward in front of the porch then see nobody but mr null they advance with bob head and sway body to look into the resource of this seldom explore region plez who be come from the spring with a pail of water on he head see the dog on the porch and the turkey on the grass and stop to regard the spectacle he look at they and he look at mr null and a grin of amuse interest spread itself over he face mr null go down the step and approach the boy plez say she if you mistress or anybody should come here this morning you must run over to pine top hill and call I i be go there to read don ' you want I to go wid yer and show you de way miss null ask plez prepare to set down he pail oh no say she i know the way and with she hand still in she pocket from one of which protrude a rolled-up novel she walk down to the little stream which run from the spring cross the plank and take the path which lead by the side of the vineyard to pine top hill this lady visitor have now be here two day wait for the return of the mistress of the little estate and the sojourn have evidently be of benefit to she good air the good meal with which letty have provide she and a sort of sympathy which have spring up in a very sudden way between she and everything on the place have give brightness to she eye she even look a little plumper than when she come and certainly very pretty she climb pine top hill without make any mistake as to the best path and go directly to a low piece of sun-warmed rock which crop out from the ground not far from the basis of the cluster of pine which give the name to the hill a extended and very pretty view could be have from this spot and mr null seem to enjoy it look about she with quick turn of the head as if she want to satisfy herself that all of the scenery be there apparently satisfied that it be she stretch out she foot withdraw she gaze from the surrounding country and regard the toe of she boot now she smile a little and begin to speak freddy say she i must think over matter and have a talk with you about they nothing could be more proper than this since we be on we wedding tour you keep beautifully in the background which be very nice of you for that be what i marry you for but we must have a talk now for we have not say a word to each other nor perhaps think of each other during the whole three night and two day that we have be here i expect these people think it very queer that i should keep on wait for they mistress to come back but i can not help it i must stay till she come or he come and they must continue to think it funny and as for mr croft i suppose i should get a letter from he if he know where to write but you know freddy we be travel about on this wedding tour without let anybody especially mr croft know exactly where we be he must think it a awfully wonderful piece of good luck that a young married couple should happen to be journey in the very direction take by a gentleman whom he want to find and that they be willing to look for the gentleman without charge anything but the extra expense to which they may be put we would not charge he a cent you know freddy null but for the fear that he would think we would not truly act as he agent if we be not pay and so would employ somebody else we do not want he to employ anybody else we want to find junius keswick before he do and then maybe we will not want mr croft to find he at all but i hope it will not turn out that way he say it be neither crime nor relationship and of course it could not be what i hope be that it be good fortune but that be doubtful at any rate i must see junius first if i can possibly manage it if she would only come back and open she letter there might be no more trouble about it for i do not believe he would go away without leave she he address be not all this charming freddy and do not you feel glad that we come here for we wedding tour of course you do not enjoy it as much as i do for it can not seem so natural to you but you be bind to like it the very fact of my be here should make the place delightful in you eye mr null even if i have forget all about you ever since i come that afternoon as mr null be occupy some of she continuous leisure in feed the turkey at the back of the house she notice two color man in earnest conversation with isham when they have go she call to the old man uncle isham she

have hear that it take thirty year for a whole forest of old field pine to grow up but they will do it if the land be not plough now uncle isham i do not intend to let everything be at a standstill here just because you mistress be away that be one reason why i feed the turkey if they die or the farm all go wrong i should feel that it be partly my fault yaa be say uncle isham pass he hat from

like that say mrs null she brow slightly contract i have read a great deal about the foolishness of southern people plant wheat they can not compete with the great wheat farm of the west which sometimes cover a whole county and of course have so much they can afford to sell it a great deal cheaper than you can here and yet you go on year after year pay every cent you can rake and scrape for fertilize drug and get about a teacupful of wheat -- that be proportionately speak i do not think this sort of thing should continue uncle isham it would be a great deal better to plough that field for pickle now there be a steady market for pickle and so far as i know there be no pickle farm in the west pickle ejaculate the astonished isham do you mean miss null to put dat fiel ' down in kukumber at di time o ' yeah well say mr null thoughtfully i do not know that i feel authorize to make the change at present but i do know that the thing that pay most be small fruit and if you people down here would pay more attention to they you would make more money but the land must be plough and then we 'll see about plant it afterward you mistress will probably be home in time for that you go after the man and tell they i shall expect they to begin the first thing in the morning and if there be anything else to be do on the farm you come and tell I about it to-morrow i be go to take the responsibility on myself to see that matter go on properly until you mistress return letty and she son plez occupy a cabin not far from the house while uncle isham live alone in a much smaller

by myse ' f widout tremblin ' all froo my back bone fear ole miss come back a ' fin ' I dar ` lone chapter v when lawrence croft now take he afternoon walk in the city he be very glad to wear a light overcoat and to button it too but although the air be get a little nipping in new york he know that it must still be balmy and enjoyable in virginium he have never be down there at this season but he have hear about the virginium autumn and besides he have see a lady who have have a letter from roberta march in this letter miss march have write that as she father intend make a trip to texa and therefore would not come to new york as early as usual she would stay at least a month longer with she uncle brandon and she be glad to do it for the weather be perfectly lovely and she could stay out-of-door all day if she want to lawrence 's walk although very invigorating on account of the fine sharp air be not entirely cheer for they give he a opportunity to think that he be make no progress whatever in he attempt to study the character of junius keswick he have entrust the search for that gentleman 's address to mr candy 's cashier who have inform he most opportunely that she be about to set out on a wedding tour and that she have possess herself of clue of much value which could be readily follow up in connection with the project journey but a fortnight or more have elapse without he hearing anything from she and he have come to the conclusion that hymeneal joy must have drive all thought of business out of she little head after hear that roberta march intend protract she stay in the country the desire come to he to go down there himself he would like to have the novel experience of that region in autumn and he would like to see roberta but he could not help acknowledge to himself that the proceeding would scarcely be a wise one especially as he must go without the desire safeguard of know what kind of man miss march have once be willing to accept he feel that if he go down to the neighborhood of midbranch one of the battle of he life would begin and that when he hold up before he he figurative shield he would see in its inner mirror that on account of he own disposition toward the lady he be in a condition of great peril but for all that he want very much to go and no one will be surprise to learn that he do go he be a little embarrassed at first in regard to the pretext which he should make to himself for such a journey whatever satisfactory excuse he could make to himself in this case would of course do for other people although he be not prone to make excuse for he conduct to other people in general he know he would have to give some reason to mr brandon and miss roberta for he return to virginia so soon after have leave it he determine to make a visit to the mountain of north carolina and as midbranch would lie in he way of course he would stop there this he assure himself be not a subterfuge it be a very sensible thing to do he have a good deal of time on he hand before the city season at least for he would begin and he have read that the autumn be a admirable time to visit the country of the french broad how long a stop he would make at midbranch would be determine by circumstance he be sorry that he would not be able to look upon miss roberta with the advantage of know she former lover but it be something to know that she have have a lover with this fact in he mind he would be able to form a better estimate of she than he have form before the man who live in the cottage at the green sulphur spring be somewhat surprise when mr croft arrive there and desire to make arrangement as before for board and the use of a saddle horse but although it be not generally concede this man know very well that there be no water in the world so suitable to remedy the wear and tear of a city life as that of the green sulphur spring and therefore nobody could consider the young gentleman foolish for come back again while the season permit lawrence arrive at he cottage in the morning and early in the afternoon of the same day he ride over to midbranch he find the country a good deal change and he do not like the change he road which run for much of its distance through the wood be cover with leave some green and some red and yellow and he do not fancy the peculiar smell of these leaf which remind he in some way of that gathering together of the character in old-fashioned comedy shortly before the fall of the curtain in many place where there use to be a thick shade the foliage be now quite thin and through it he could see a good deal of the sky the virginium creeper or poison oak whichever they be be grow red upon the trunk of the tree as if they have be at table too long and show it and when he ride out of the wood he see that the field which he remember as wide swell slope of green with cattle and colt feed here and there be now be plough into corrugated stretch of monotonous drab and brown if he have be there through all the gradual change of the season he probably would have enjoy they as much as people ordinarily do but come back in this way the altered landscape slightly shock he when he have turn into the midbranch gate but be still a considerable distance from the house he involuntarily stop he horse he could see the broad step which cross the fence of the lawn and on one side of the platform on the top sit a lady whom he instantly recognize as miss roberta and on the other side of the platform sit a gentleman these two occupied very much the same position as lawrence himself and miss march have occupy when we first become acquaint with they lawrence look very sharply and earnestly at the gentleman could it be mr brandon no it be a much younger person he first impulse be to turn and ride away but this would be silly and unmanly and he continue he way to the stile he disposition to treat the matter with contempt make he feel how important the matter be to he the gentleman on the platform first see lawrence and announce to the lady that some one be come miss march turn around and then rise to she foot upon my word she exclaim elevate she eyebrow a good deal more than be usual with she if that be not mr croft who be he ask the other also rise he be a new york gentleman whom i know very well he be down here last summer but i can not imagine what bring he here again lawrence dismount tie he horse and approach the step miss roberta welcome he cordially come down a little way to shake hand with he then she introduce the two gentleman mr croft she say let I make you acquaint with mr keswick the afternoon or the portion of it that be leave be spend on the porch mr brandon join the party it be to he that lawrence chiefly talk for the most part about the game and scenery of north carolina with which the old gentleman be quite familiar but lawrence have sufficient regard for himself and he position in the eye of this family to help make a good deal of general conversation what he say or hear however occupy only the extreme corner of he mind the main portion of which be entirely fill with the chill fear that that man might be the keswick he be look for of course there be a bare chance that it be not for there might be a numerous family but even this little stupid glimmer of comfort be extinguish when mr brandon familiarly address the gentleman as junius lawrence take a good look at the man he be anxious to study and as far as outward appearance be concern he could find no fault with roberta for have accept he he be taller than croft and not so correctly dress he seem to be a person whom one would select as a companion for a hunt a sail or a talk upon political economy there be about he a air of present laziness but it be also evident that this be a disposition that could easily be throw off lawrence 's mind be not only very much occupied but very much perturb it must have be all a mistake about the engagement have be break off if this have be the case the easy friendliness of the relation between keswick and the old gentleman and he niece would have be impossible once or twice the thought come to lawrence that he should congratulate himself for not have avow he feeling toward miss roberta when he have a opportunity of do so but he predominant emotion be one of disgust with he previous mode of action if he have not weigh and consider the matter so carefully and have be willing to take he chance as other man take they he would at least have know in what relation he stand to roberta and

look down at the same time particularly when she have ask a question and be wait for the answer she face would be turn a little down but she eye would look up and give a very charming expression to those upturned eye and if she happen to allow the smile with which she cease speak to remain upon she pretty lip she generally have a answer of some sort very soon if for no other reason it would be give that she might ask another question it be in this manner she say to lawrence : do you really go away from we to-morrow yes say he i shall push on do you not find the country very beautiful at

place where he be sure there be no one to hear he he be go to tell I that he love I that he do not intend to speak quite so soon but that circumstance have make it impossible for he to restrain

morning junius keswick who have be up a long long time before breakfast sit after that meal look at roberta who be read a book in the parlor she be a strange girl think he i can not understand she how be it possible that she can sit there so placidly read that volume of huxley which i know she never see before and which she have open just about the middle on a morning when she be expect a man who will say thing to she which may change she whole life i could almost imagine that she have forget all about it peggy who have just enter the room to inform she mistress that aunt judy be ready for she stand in rigid uprightness she torpid eye settle upon the lady i reckon so run the think within the maze of she dark little interior dat miss rob 's wuss disgruntle dan she be dat ebenin ' when i make

after make a suitable change she find keswick there look a little tired have you friend go he ask in a very quiet tone he have not come yet she answer not come exclaimed keswick that be odd however there be two hour yet before dinner the two hour pass and no lawrence croft appear nor come he at all that day about dusk the man at the green sulphur spring ride over with a note from mr croft the note be to miss march of course and it simply state that the writer be very sorry he could not keep the appointment he have make with she but that it have suddenly become necessary for he to return to the north without continue the journey he have plan that he be much grieve to be deprive of the opportunity of see she again but that he would give himself the pleasure at the earliest possible moment of call on miss march when she arrive in new york when miss roberta have read this note she hand it to keswick who when he return it ask : do that suit you no say she it do not suit I at all chapter vi it be mail day at the very small village know as howlett 's and to the fence in front of the post-office be attach three mule and a horse inside the yard tie to the low bough of a tree be a very lean and melancholy horse on which have lately arrive wesley green the negro man who twice a week bring the mail from pocohonta a railway station twenty mile away there be a station not six mile from howlett 's but for some reason the mail bag be always bring from and carry to pocohonta wesley green require a whole day for a deliberate transit between the two point in the post-office which be the front room of a small wooden house approach by a high flight of step be the postmistress miss harriet corvey who sit on the floor in one corner while before she extend a semicircle of man and boy in this little assemblage certain elderly man occupy seat which be consider to belong to they quite as much as if they have be hire pew in a church and behind they stand up a row of tall young man and barefooted boy of the neighborhood while farthest in the rear be some quiet little darky with mail bag sling across they shoulder on a chair to the right and most convenient to miss harriet sit old madison chalkley the biggest and most venerable citizen of the neighborhood mr chalkley never by any chance get a letter the only mail matter he receive be the southern baptist recorder which come on saturday but like most of the people present he be at the post-office every mail day to see who get anything next to he sit colonel iston a tall lean quiet old gentleman who have for a long series of year occupy the position of a last apple on a tree he have no relative no friend with whom he correspond no business that be not conduct by word of mouth in the last fifteen year he have receive but one letter and that have so surprised he that he carry it about with he three day before he open it and then he find that it be really intend for a gentleman of the same name in another county and yet everybody know that if colonel iston fail to appear in he place on mail day it would be because he be dead or prostrate by sickness with the mail bag on the floor at she left miss harriet totally oblivious of any law forbid the opening of the mail in public would put she hand into its open mouth draw forth a letter or a paper hold it up in front of she spectacles and call out the name of its owner most of the letter go to the black boy with the mail bag who come from country house in the neighborhood but whoever receive letter journal or agricultural circular receive also at the same time the earnest gaze of everybody else in the room sometimes there be a letter for which there be no applicant present and then miss harriet would say : be anybody go past mr willis summerse and if anybody be he would take the letter and it be to be hope he remember to deliver it in the course of a week in spite of the precaution of the postmistress uncalled for letter would gradually accumulate and there be a little bundle of these in one of the few pigeon hole in a small desk in the corner of the room in the drawer of which the postage stamp be keep now and then a registered letter would arrive and this always create considerable sensation in the room and if the legal recipient do not happen to be present miss harriet never breathe a quiet breath until he or she have be send for have take the letter and give she a receipt sometimes she sit up as late as eleven o'clock at night on mail day hope that some one who have be send for would arrive to relieve she of a registered letter all the mail matter have be distribute everybody but mr madison chalkley have leave the room and when the old gentleman as be he wont on the first day of the month have go up to the desk untie the bundle of uncalled-for letter the outer one permanently round by the tightness of the cord and after carefully look over they one by one have make he usual remark about the folly of people who would not stay in a place until they letter could get to they have tie up the bundle and take he departure then miss harriet put the empty mail bag under the desk and go up-stair where a old lady sit by the window sewing in the fading light no letter for you to-day mr keswick say she of course not be the answer i do not expect any do not you think say miss harriet take a seat opposite the old lady that it be about time for you to go home and attend to you affair well upon my word say mr keswick let she hand and she work fall in she lap that be truly hospitable i do not expect it of you harriet corvey i would not have say it return the postmistress if i have not feel dead certain that you know you be always welcome here but tony mile tell I just before the mail come in that the lady who be at you place be run it herself and that she be go to use pickle brine for a fertilizer very likely say mr keswick she face totally unmoved by this intelligence -- very likely that be the way they use to do in ancient time or something of the same kind they use to sow salt over they enemy 's land so that nothing would ever grow there that woman 's family have sow salt over the land of I and mine for three generation and it be quite natural she should come here to finish up there be a little silence after this and then miss harriet remark : you people must know where you be why do not they come and tell you about these thing they know better answer mr keswick with a grim smile i go away once before and uncle isham hunt I up and he get a lesson that he 'll never forget when i want they to know where i be i 'll tell they but really and truly -- say miss harriet and you know i only speak to you for you own good for you pay you board here and if you do not you would be just as welcome -- do you intend to keep away from you own house as long as that lady choose to stay there exactly so long answer the old lady i shall not keep they out of my house if they choose to come to it no member of my family ever do that there be the house and they be free to enter it but they shall not find I there if there be any reason to believe that everything be drop and do with i would be as glad to see he as anybody could be but i know from he letter just what he be go to say when he come and as thing have turn out i see that it be all worse than i expect he and roberta march be both come and they think that together they could talk I down and make I forgive and be happy and all that stuff but as i be not there of course he would not stay and so there she be now by herself she think i must come home after a while and the minute i do that back he 'll come and then they 'll have just what they want but i reckon she 'll find that i can stick it out just as long as she can if roberta march turn thing upside down there it 'll be because she can not keep she hand out of mischief and that prove that she belong to she own family if there be any harm do it do not matter so much to I and it will be worse for he in the end and now harriet corvey if you have get to make up the mail to go away early in the morning you would better have supper over and get about it meanwhile at mr keswick 's house mr null be act just as conscientiously as she know how she have have some conversation with freddy on the subject and she have assure he and at the same time herself that what she be do be the only thing that could be do it be dreadfully hard for I to get the money to come down here she say to he -- you not help I a bit as ordinary husband do -- and i can not afford to go back until i have accomplish something it be very strange that she stay away so long without tell anybody where she have go to but i know she be queer and i suppose she have she own reason for what she do she can not be stay away on my account for she do not know who i be and would not have any objection to I if she do know i suspect it be something about junius which keep she away and i suppose she think he be still here but one of they must soon come back and if i can see he or find out from she where he be it will be all right it seem to I freddy that if i could have a good talk with junius thing would begin to look better for you and I and then i want to put he on he guard about this gentleman who be look for he by the way i suppose i ought to write a letter to mr croft or he 'll think i have give up the job and will set somebody else on the track and that be what i do not want he to do i can not say that i have positively anything to report but i can say that i have strong hope of success consider where i be as soon as i find that junius have really leave the north i conclude that this would be the best place to come to for he and now freddy there be nothing for we to do but to wait and if we can make ourselves useful here i be sure we will be glad to do it we both hate be lazy and a little housekeeping and farm managing will be good practice for we during we honeymoon put on she hat she go down into the garden where uncle isham be at work she could find little to do there for he be merely pull turnip and she could see nothing to suggest in regard to he method of work she have find too that the old negro have not much respect for she agricultural opinion he attend to he work as if he mistress have be at home and although in regard to the plough he have carry out the order of mr null he have do it because it ought to be do and because he be very glad for some one else to take the responsibility uncle isham say she after she have watch the process of turnip pull for a few minute if you have not anything else to do when you get through with this you might come up to the house and i will talk to you about the flower bed i suppose they ought to be make

dangerous proceeding than get into the cart and she be very slow and cautious about it first one of she great green baize foot be put over the tail of the cart and rest she weight upon the two man aunt patsy allow it to descend to the chair where it be gradually follow by the other foot have safely accomplish this much the old woman ejaculate : bress de lor ' when in the same prudent manner she have reach the ground she heave a sigh of relief and fervently exclaim : de lor ' be bress support by uncle isham and the other man aunt patsy now approach the step she be so old so little so bow and

miss harriet corvey who greet the old woman with much surprise but shake hand with she very cordially ebenin ' miss har ` et say aunt patsy and then lower she voice she ask : be ole miss h ` yar miss harriet hesitate a moment and then she answer : yes she be but i do not believe she 'll come down to see you oh i 'll go up-star say aunt patsy whar she she be in the spare chamber say miss harriet and aunt patsy with a nod of the head signify that she know all about that room cross the hall and begin slowly but steadily to ascend the stair miss harriet gaze upon she with amazement for aunt patsy have be consider chair-ridden when the postmistress be a young woman arrive at the end of she toilsome ascent aunt patsy knock at the door of the spare chamber and as the voice of she old mistress say come in she go in chapter vii when lawrence croft reach the green sulphur spring after he interview with miss march he soul be still bubble and boil with emotion and it continue in that condition all night at least during that great part of the night of which he be conscious the sight of the lady he love under the new circumstance in which he find she have determine he to throw prudence and precaution to the wind and to ask she at once to be he wife but the next morning lawrence arise very late he coffee have evidently be warm over and he bacon have be cook for a long long time the world do not appear to he in a favorable light and he be oblige to smoke two cigar before he be at all satisfy with it while he be smoke he do a good deal of thinking and it be then that he come to the conclusion that he would not go over to midbranch and propose to roberta march such precipitate action would be unjust to himself and unjust to she in she eye it would probably appear to be the act of a man who have be suddenly spur to action by the sight of a rival and this if roberta be the woman he believe she to be would prejudice she against he and yet he know very well that these reason would avail nothing if he should see she as he intend he have find that he be much more in love with she than he have suppose and he feel positively certain that the next time he be alone with she he would declare he passion another thing that he feel he should consider be that the presence of keswick if look upon with a philosophic eye be not a reason for immediate action if the old engagement have positively be break off he be at the house merely as a family friend while on the other hand if the rupture have not be absolute and if roberta really love this tall southerner and wish to marry he there be a feeling of honor about lawrence which forbid he to interfere at this moment when she come to new york he would find out how matter really stand and then he would determine on he own action and yet he would have propose to roberta that moment if he have have the opportunity she personal presence would have banish philosophy and even honor lawrence be a long time in come to these conclusion and it be late in the afternoon when he despatch he note have now give up he north carolina trip -- one object of which have be still another visit to midbranch on he return -- he be oblige to wait until the next day for a train to the north and consequently he have another evening to devote to reflection these after a time become unsatisfactory he have tell the exact truth in he note to roberta for he feel that it be necessary for he to leave that part of the country in order to make impossible a interview for which he believe the proper time have not arrive he be consult he best interest and also no doubt those of the lady and yet in spite of this reasoning he be not satisfy with himself he feel that he note be not entirely honest and true there be subterfuge about it and something of duplicity this he believe be foreign to he nature and he do not like it lawrence have scarcely finish he breakfast the next morning when mr junius keswick arrive at the door of he cottage this gentleman have walk over from midbranch and be a little dusty about he boot and the lower part of he trousers lawrence greet he politely but be unable to restrain a slight indication of surprise it be more pleasant on the porch than in the house mr croft invite he visitor to take a seat there and the latter very kindly accept the cigar which be offer he although he would have prefer the pipe he have in he pocket i think it possible say keswick as soon as the two have fairly begin to smoke that you might not yet have leave here and so come over in the hope of see you very kind say lawrence keswick smile i must admit say he that it be not solely for the pleasure of meeting you again that i come although i be very glad to have a opportunity for renew we acquaintance i come because i be quite convinced that miss march wish very much to see you at the time arrange between you and that she be annoyed and discompose by you failure to keep you engagement consider that you do not and probably could not know this i deem i would do you a service by inform you of the fact do miss march send you to tell I this exclaim lawrence miss march know nothing whatever of my come be the answer then i must say sir exclaim lawrence that you have take a great deal upon yourself keswick lean forward and after knock off the ash of he cigar on the outside of the railing he reply in a tone quite unmoved by the reproach of he companion : it may appear so on the face of it but in fact i be actuate only by a desire to serve miss march for whom i would do any service that i think she desire and look at it from you side i be sure that i would be very much oblige to any one who would inform I if i do not know it that a lady greatly wish to see I why do she want to see I ask croft what have she to say to I i do not know say keswick i only know that she be very much disappointed in not see you yesterday if that be the case she might have write to I say lawrence i do not think you quite understand the situation observe he companion miss march be not a lady who would even intimate to a gentleman that she wish he to come to she when it be obvious that such be not he desire but it seem to I that if the gentleman should become aware of the lady 's wish through the medium of a third party the matter would arrange itself without difficulty by the gentleman go to she i suppose remark croft of course say keswick there be no ` of course ' about it be lawrence 's rather quick reply at that moment some letter be bring to he from a little post-office near by to which he have order he mail to be forward as the address on one of these letter catch he eye the somewhat stern expression on he face give place to a smile and beg he visitor to excuse he he put he other letter into he pocket and open this one it be very short and be from mr candy 's cashier it be write from howlett 's virginium a place unknown to he and state that the writer expect in a very short time to give he some accurate information in regard to mr keswick and express the hope that he would allow the affair to remain entirely in she hand until she should write again it be quite natural that under the circumstance lawrence should smile broadly as he fold up this note the man in question be sit beside he and in a measure be turn the table upon he lawrence have be very anxious to find out what sort of a man be keswick and the latter now seem in the way of make some discovery in the same line in regard to lawrence one thing he must certainly do he must write as soon as possible to he enterprising agent and tell she that she service be no longer need she must have push the matter with a great deal of energy to have bring she down to virginium and he could not help hope that she discretion be equal to she investigative capacity when after this little interruption lawrence again address junius keswick he manner be so much more affable that the other could not fail but notice it mr keswick he say as we conversation seem to be base upon personality perhaps you will excuse I if i ask you if i be mistake in believe that you be once engage to be marry to miss march you be entirely correct say junius i be engage to she and i hope to be engage to she again indeed exclaim croft turn in he chair with a start yes continue keswick we engagement be dissolve in consequence of a certain family complication and as i say before i hope in time to be able to renew it lawrence throw away he cigar and sit for a few moment in think the engagement then do not exist roberta be free recollection come to he of he own intercourse with she during the past summer and he heart give a bind mr keswick say he upon consideration of the matter i think i will call upon miss march this morning if keswick have express himself entirely satisfy with this decision he would have do injustice to he feeling the service he have take upon himself to perform for miss march he have consider a duty but if he mission have fail he would have be better pleased than with its success he make however a courteous reply to croft 's remark and rise to depart but this the other would not allow you tell I say croft that you walk over here but it be much warmer now and you must not think of such a thing as walk back the man here have a horse and buggy i will get he to harness up and i will drive you over to midbranch as there be no good reason why he should decline this offer junius accept it and in half a hour the two be on they way chapter viii old mr brandon of midbranch be not in a very happy frame of mind and he have good reason for dissatisfaction he be a ardent supporter of a marriage between he niece and junius keswick and when the engagement have be break off he have consider that both these young people have act in a manner very foolish and contrary to they best interest there be no opposition to the match except from old mr keswick who be the aunt of junius but who consider herself as occupy the position of a mother junius be the son of a sister who have also marry into the keswick family and he parent have die while he be a boy he aunt have take he under she charge and she house have then become he home although of late year some of he absence have be long one mr keswick have no personal objection to roberta never have see that lady and know little of she but a alliance between she junius and any member of that branch of the brandon which to use the old lady 's own word have for four generation cheat strip and scornfully use my people scatter they atom over the face of three county be monstrous nothing could make she consent to such a enormity and she have inform junius that if he marry that march girl three of they should live together -- himself he wife and she undying curse in order that miss march might not fail to hear of this post-connubial arrangement she have be inform of it by letter of course this have break off the engagement for roberta would not live under a curse nor would she tear a man from the only near relative he have in the world keswick himself like most man would have be willing to have this tear take place for the sake of unite himself to such a charming creature as roberta march but the lady on one side be as inflexible as the lady on the other and the engagement be definitely and absolutely end mr brandon consider all this as stuff and nonsense he could not deny that he branch of the brandon have certainly get a good deal out of mr keswick 's family but here be a chance to make everything all right again and he would be delighted to see junius a relative although a distant one come into possession of midbranch as for the old lady 's opposition that should not be consider at all he think it be he opinion that she mind have be twist by she bad temper and nothing she could say could hurt anybody of late mr brandon have be much encourage by the fact that junius have begin to resume he position as a friend of the family this be all very well if the young people by occasional meeting could keep alive they sentiment toward each other the time would come when all opposition would cease and the marriage would become a assure fact he do not believe either of the young people would care enough for a post-mortem curse if there should be one to keep themselves separate from each other on its account for the rest of they life but the recent quite unexpected return of lawrence croft to midbranch combine with the evident discomposure into which roberta have be throw by he failure to come the next day have give the old gentleman some unpleasant idea he niece have mention that she expect mr croft that day and although she say nothing in regard to she subsequent disappointment and vexation he mind be quite acute enough to perceive it exactly what it all mean he know not but it augur danger for the first time he begin to look upon mr croft in the light of a suitor for roberta if a jealous feeling at find another person on the ground be the cause of he not come again it show that he be in earnest and this add to the evident disturbance of mind of both roberta and junius be enough to give mr brandon most serious fear that a obstacle to he cherish plan be arise roberta be fond of city life of society of travel and if she have really make up she mind that she union with junius be no longer to be think of the advent of a man like croft who have be make she acquaintance all summer and who have now return to virginia no doubt for the sole purpose of see she again be to say the least exceedingly ominous one thing only could correct this deplorable state of affair the absurd bar to the union of junius and roberta should be remove and they should be allow to enter upon the happiness that be they right above all the estate of midbranch should not be suffer to go into the possession of a outsider who might be good enough but who be of no earthly moment or interest to the brandon he would go himself and see the widow keswick and talk she out of she nonsense it be a long time since he have meet the old wild cat as he term she and he recollection of the last interview be not pleasant but he be not afraid of she and he hope that the common sense of what he would say would bring she to reason mr brandon make up he mind during the night and when he come down to breakfast he be very glad to find that junius have already go out for a walk the distance to the widow keswick 's house be about fifteen mile a pleasant day 's ride for the old gentleman and as he do not expect to return until the next day he feel oblige to inform roberta of he destination although of course he say nothing about the object of he visit he tell he niece that he be oblige to see the widow keswick on business to which remark she listen without reply soon after breakfast he mount he good horse albemarle and early in the afternoon he arrive at the widow keswick 's gate he have look for a stormy reception in which the thunder-bolt of rage should burst around he and he be surprised therefore to be receive with the frigidity of the north pole i never expect she say without any previous courtesy to see one of you people under my roof and it be not very long ago since i would have go away from it the moment any one of you come near it i be happy madam say mr brandon in he most courteous manner that that day be past my staying will not do you any good say the old lady whose purple sun-bonnet seem to heave with the uprisal of she hair except perhaps to get you a better meal than the servant would have give you but i want a lawyer and i can not afford to pay for one either and when i see you come i just make up my mind to get something out of you and if i do it it 'll be the first red mark for my side of the family mr brandon assure she that nothing would give he more pleasure than to assist she in any way in he power very well then say mr keswick just sit down on that bench and when we have get through you horse can be take and you can rest a while though it seem a very curious thing that you should want to stop here to rest well madam say mr brandon seat himself as comfortably as possible on a wooden bench i shall be happy to hear anything you have to say the old lady do not sit down but stand up in front of he lean on she umbrella with which faithful companion she have be about to set out on she walk when my son junius come home a while ago -- she begin do you still call he you son interrupted mr brandon indeed i do be the very prompt answer that be just what he be and as i be go to say when he write I a short time ago that he be come here i believe from he letter that he have some scheme on hand in regard to you niece and i make up my mind i would not stay in the house to hear anything more say on that subject i have tell he that i never want he to say another word about it and it make my blood boil sir to think that he have come again to try to cozen I into the vile compact madam exclaim mr brandon the next day continue mr keswick a lady arrive and as soon as i see she drive into the gate i feel sure it be roberta march and that the two have hatch up a plot to come and work on my feeling and so i would not come near the house madam exclaim mr brandon how could you dream such a thing of my niece you do not know she madam no say the old lady i do not know she but i know she belong to you family and so i be not to be surprise at anything she do but i find out i be mistake a old negro woman recognize this young person as the daughter of my younger sister you know there be three of we the child be bear and raise here but i have not see and have scarcely hear of she since she be eight year old that be very extraordinary madam say mr brandon no it be not when you consider the stubbornness the obstinacy and the wickedness of some people my sister sicken when the child be about six year old and she husband harvey peyton -- i have frequently hear of he madam say mr brandon and i wish i never have say she well he be travel most of the time a thing my sister could not do but he come here then and stay off and on till she die and not long afterward just because i tell he that i intend to consider the child as my child and that she should have the name of keswick instead of he name and should know I as she mother and live with I always he get angry and flare up and actually take the child away i give it to he hot i can tell you before he leave and i never see he again he be so eat up with rage because i want to take the little annie for my own that he fill she mind with such prejudice against I that when he die a year or two ago she actually go to work to get she own living instead of apply to I for help but now she have come down here and i be really fill with joy to have she again and carry out the plan on which my heart have long be set -- that be to marry she to she cousin junius and let they have this farm when i be go -- at this mr brandon raise he eyebrow and lower the corner of he mouth but i suddenly discover continue the old lady that the little wretch be marry -- actually marry at this mr brandon lower he eyebrow and raise the corner of he mouth do she husband come with she he ask pleasantly and he give a few long free breath as if he have just pass in safety a very dangerous and unsuspected rock no he do not reply the old lady i do not know where he be and from what i can make out he be a utterly good-for-nothing fellow allow he wife to go where she please and take care of herself now this abominable marriage stand square in the way of the plan which again rise up in my mind the moment i hear that the girl be in my house if junius and she should marry there would be no more danger for I to look out for but the existence of a husband say mr brandon blandly put a end to all thought of such a alliance no it do not say the old lady bring she umbrella down with force on the porch not a bit of it such a outrageous marriage should not be suffer to exist they should be divorce he do nothing for she and neglect and desert she absolutely there be every ground for a divorce or enough grounds at any rate all that be necessary be for a lawyer to take it up i do not know any lawyer and when i see you ride up from the road gate i say to myself : ` here be the very man i want -- and it be full time i should get something from people who have take nearly everything from I ' mr brandon bow and now continue the old lady i be go to put the case into you hand the man be evidently a good-for-nothing scoundrel and have probably spend the little money that she miserable father leave she it be a clear case of desertion and there should be no trouble at all in get the divorce mr brandon look down upon the floor of the porch and smile this be a pretty case he think to put into he hand here be a marriage which be the strongest protection in the promotion of he own plan and he be ask to annul it very good thought mr brandon very good and he smile again but he be a old-fashioned gentleman and not use to refuse request make to he by lady i will look into it madam say he i will look into it and see what can be do something must be do say the old lady and the right thing too how long do you intend to stay here i thought of spend the night madam as my horse and myself be scarcely in condition to continue we journey to-day stay as long as you like say mr keswick i turn nobody from my door even if they belong to the brandon family i want you to talk to my niece and get all you can out of she about this thing and then you can go to work and blot out this contemptible marriage as soon as possible the first thing say mr brandon will be to talk to the lady this reply be satisfactory to mr keswick uncle isham be call to take the horse and attend to he while the master be invite into the house mr brandon first meet mr null at supper time and she appearance very much pleased he it be not likely he say to himself that the man live who would willingly give up such a charming young creature as this they be oblige to introduce themselves to each other as the lady of the house have not yet appear after a while letty who be in attendance advise they to sit down as de light bread a ' de batter-bread be gittin ' cole we could not think of such a thing as sit at table before mr keswick arrive say mr brandon oh dar 's no knowin ' when she 'll come say the bloom letty she may be h ` yar by breakfus time but dar be not nobuddy in dis yere worl '

gyardin ' ` tai not no use waitin ' fur ole miss she nebber do come when de bell ring she come when she git ready a ' not afore mr brandon now feel quite sure that it be the intention of he hostess not to break bread with one of he family and so he seat himself mr null take the head of the table and pour out the tea and coffee it have be a long time madam since you be in this part of the country say the old gentleman as he draw the smoking batter-bread toward he and begin to cut it yes say mr null not since i be a little girl i suppose you have hear sir that aunt keswick and my father be on very bad term and would not have anything to do with each other oh yes say mr brandon i have hear that but my father be not live now and i be down here again and you husband he do not accompany you say mr brandon no reply mrs null very quickly we be both very sorry that it be not possible for he to come with I mr brandon 's spirit begin to rise this do not look quite like desertion i have no doubt you have a very good husband i be sure you deserve such a one he say with the air of a father and the purpose of a lawyer good exclaimed mr null she eye sparkling he could not be better if he try will you have sweet milk or buttermilk buttermilk if you please say mr brandon of course you aunt be delighted to have you with she again oh say mr null with a laugh she be not at home when i arrive but when she return nothing could be too good for I why she have be here scarcely half a hour and have not take off she sun-bonnet before she tell I i be to marry junius and we two be to have this farm a very pleasant plan truly say mr brandon but then you see continue the young girl mr null stand dreadfully in the way of such a arrangement and when aunt keswick hear about he you can not imagine what a change come over she oh yes i can yes i can exclaim mr brandon -- i can imagine it very well but she do not give up a bit say mr null i do not think she ever do give up you be right there say mr brandon quite right but what do she propose to do i do not know i be sure but she say i have no right to marry without the consent of my survive relative and that she be go to look into it i can not think what she mean by that mr brandon make no immediate answer he give mr null some damson preserve and he take some himself and then he help himself to a great hot roll from a plate that letty have just bring in and carefully open it he butter it on the inside and cover one-half of it with the damson preserve this he begin slowly to eat drinking at time from the foam glass of buttermilk at the side of he plate from which the coffee-cup have be remove when he have finish the half roll he again speak i think my dear young lady that you aunt be desirous of have you marriage set aside how can she do that exclaim the girl she face flushing have she be talk to you about it i can not deny that she have speak to I on the subject he answer i be a lawyer but i will say to you in strict confidence please that if you and you husband be sincerely attach to each other there be nothing on earth she can do to separate you attach exclaimed mr null it would be impossible for we to be more attach than we be we never have have the slightest difference even of opinion since we wedding day why i believe that we be more like one person than any married couple in the world i be very glad to hear it say mr brandon finish he buttermilk -- very glad indeed and feeling as you do i be certain that nothing you aunt can say will make any impression on you in regard to seek a divorce i should think not say mr null sit up very straight divorce indeed i fully uphold you in the stand you have take say mr brandon but i beg you will not mention this conversation to you aunt it would only annoy she be you cousin expect here shortly i believe so she say to be sure my aunt leave the house the last time he come but she have he address and have write for he i think she want we to get acquaint as soon as possible so that no time will be lose in marry we after poor mr null be dispose of very good very good say mr brandon with a laugh and now my dear young friend i want to give you a piece of advice stay here as long as you can you aunt will soon perceive the absurdity of she idea in regard to you husband and will cease to annoy you make a friend of you cousin junius whom i know and respect highly and he certainly will be of advantage to you above all thing endeavor to thoroughly reconcile he and mr keswick so that she will cease to oppose he wish and to interfere with he future fortune if you can bring back good feeling between these two you will be the angel of the family thank you say mr null as they rise from the table the next morning after mr brandon and mr null have breakfast together the mistress of the house have apparently finish the performance of the duty which have keep she from the breakfast-table have some conversation with she visitor in this he repeat very little of what he have say to the younger lady the night before but he assure mr keswick that he have discover that it would be a very delicate thing to propose to she niece a divorce from she husband a thing to which she be not at all incline as he have find of course not of course not exclaim mr keswick she can not be expect to see what a wretched plight she have get herself into by marry this straggler from nobody know where but madam say mr brandon if you worry she about it she will leave you and then all will be at a end now let I advise you as you lawyer keep she here as long as you can do everything possible to foster friendship and good feeling between she and junius and to do this you must forget as far as possible all that have go by and be friendly with both of they yourself humph say the widow keswick i do not ask you for advice of that sort it be all a part of the successful working of the case madam say mr brandon a thorough good feeling must be establish before anything else can be do i suppose so say the old lady she must learn to like we before she begin to hate he and how about you niece be you go to send she down here to help on in the good feeling i have not bring my niece into this affair reply mr brandon with dignity well then see that you do not be the widow keswick 's reply and the interview terminate when mr brandon ride away on he good horse albemarle he look at the post of the road gate from which he be lift the latch by means of the long wooden handle arrange for the convenience of rider and say to himself : john keswick be a good man but i do not wonder he come out here and shoot himself it be a great pity though that it be not he wife who do it instead of he that would have be a blessing to all of we but he add contemplatively as he close the gate the people in this world who ought to blow out they brain never do soon after he have go mrs null go up pine top hill and sit down on the rock to have a think now then freddy she say everything depend on you if you do not stand by I i be lose -- that be to say i must go away from here before junius come and you know i do not want to do that i want to see he on my account and on he account too but i do not want he cram down my throat for a husband the moment he arrive and that be just what will happen if you do not do you duty mr null even if it be not for you i do not want to look at he from the husband point of view because of course he be a very different person from what he use to be and be a total stranger to I it be actually more than twelve year since i have see he and besides that he be just as good as engage to that niece of mr brandon 's who be a horrible mixture of a she-wolf and a female mule if i be to believe aunt keswick but i expect she be truly a very nice girl though to be sure she can not have much spirit if she consent to break off she marriage just on account of the back-handed benediction which aunt keswick tell I she offer she as a wedding gift if i have want to marry a man i would have let the old lady curse the heel off she boot before i would have pay any attention to she cursing do not hurt anybody but the curser what i want of junius be to make a friend of he if he turn out to be the right kind of a person and to tell he about this mr croft who be so anxious to find he the only person i have meet yet who seem like a ordinary christian be old mr brandon and he be a sly one i be afraid aunt keswick think he stop here on he way somewhere but i do not believe a word of it i believe he come for reason of he own and go right straight back again you be almost as much to he freddy as you be to I it would have make you laugh if you could have see how he face light up when he hear we be happy together and that i would not listen to a divorce and yet i be sure he have promise aunt keswick to see what he can do about get one he want I to stay here and make friend of aunt keswick and junius but he would not like that if it be not for you mr null you make everything safe for he and now freddy i tell you again that all depend upon you if i be to stay here -- and i want to do that for a time any way for although aunt keswick be so awfully queer she be my own aunt and that be more than i can say for anybody else in the world -- you must stiffen up and stand by I it will not do to give way for a minute if necessary you must take tonic and have a steel rod down you back if you can not keep yourself erect without it you must have you leg pad and you chest throw out and you must stand up very strong and sturdy freddy and not let they push you a inch this way or that and now that we have make up we mind on this subject we 'll go down for it be get a little cool on the top of this hill chapter ix on the morning of she uncle 's departure from midbranch roberta come out on the porch and take she seat in a large wooden arm-chair put down she key basket on the floor beside she the day be bright and sunny and the shadow of two or three turkey buzzard who be circle in the air move over the field in front of the house in this field also move not so fast nor so gracefully as the shadow two plough one near by and the other at quite a distance the wood which shut out a great part of the horizon show many a bit of color but the scene although bright enough in some of its tone be not a cheer one to roberta and she need cheer have it not be for the delay of she father in make he winter visit to new york she would now be in that city but if thing have go on as she expect they would she would have be perfectly satisfy to remain several week longer at midbranch junius keswick who have not visit the house for a long time have come to they again and now that the subject of love and marriage have be set aside it be charming to have he there as a friend they not only walk in the wood but they take long ride over the country mr brandon have waive he objection in regard to he niece ride about with gentleman she have even be please with the unexpected return of lawrence croft for for reason of she own she wish very much to have a talk with he but he have not fulfil he promise to she and have go away in a very unsatisfactory manner this morning she feel a little lonely too for junius have leave the place before breakfast and she do not know where he have go and she uncle have actually ridden away to see that horrible widow keswick merely state that he errand be a business one and that he would be back the next day roberta know that there have be a great deal of business particularly that of a unpleasant kind between the two family but she do not believe that there be any ordinary affair concern dollar and cent which would require the presence of she uncle at the house of he old enemy she be very much afraid that he have go there to try to smooth up matter in regard to junius and herself the thought of this make she indignant she do not know what she uncle would say and she do not want he to say anything he could not make the horrible old creature change she mind in regard to the marriage and if this be not do there be no use discuss the matter at all and she do not wish people to think she be anxious for the match it be plain however that she uncle 's desire for it have experience a strong revival and the unexpected return of lawrence croft have probably have a great effect on he he have not object to the visit of that gentleman during the summer but he have never show any strong liking for he and roberta say to herself that she could not see for she part why this should be mr croft be a thorough gentleman a exceedingly well educate and agreeable man as to junius she be afraid that he have not the spirit which she use to think he possess there be something about he she could not understand in former day when junius be in new york she compare he with the young man there very much to he advantage but now mr croft seem to throw he somewhat in the background when croft want to do anything he do it even he failure to come to she when he say he would do so show strength of will if junius have promise to come he would have come even if he have not want to do so and there would have be something weak about that while she thus sit thinking and gaze over the landscape she see afar off on a portion of the road which run along-side the wood a vehicle slowly make its way to the house roberta have large and beautiful eye but they be not of the kind which would enable she to discover at so great a distance what sort of vehicle this be and who be in it as the road lead nowhere but to midbranch she be naturally desirous to know who be come she step into the hall and take a small bell ring it vigorously and in a moment she youthful handmaiden peggy appear upon the scene peggy 's habit of project she eye into the far away could often be turn to practical account for she vision be in a measure telescopic what be that

arise keswick who do not wish to be at the house or indeed about the place while roberta be have she conference with mr croft have say that he have conclude not to go up to the house at present but would take a walk through the wood instead lawrence who think he divine he reason feel a honorable indisposition to accept this advantage at the hand of a man who be most indisputably he rival if they go together it would not appear as if he have wait for keswick 's absence to return and there would still be no reason why he should not have he private walk and talk with miss march at all event it seem to he unfair to leave keswick at the gate while he go up to the house by himself and the notion of it do not please he at all keswick however be very resolute in he opposition he object even to see roberta and croft together he think besides if he and croft come to the house at the same time it would appear very much as if he junius have bring the other and this be a appearance he wish very much to avoid he have walk away and lawrence have jump from the buggy to continue the friendly argument which be not finish when peggy arrive almost immediately after this event keswick positively insist that he would go for a walk and lawrence reluctantly turn toward the vehicle peggy 's mind be fill with horror master junius have be frighten away and the other man be come up to the house she

borrow one of the midbranch horse and ride away he do not wish to be at the house when mr croft should come and besides he be very anxious and disturbed in regard to matter at the keswick farm of all place in the world why should mr brandon go there it be not a very pleasant ride that junius keswick take that morning he have anxiety in regard to what he would meet with at he aunt 's house and he have even greater anxiety as to what he be leave behind he at midbranch it be quite evident that roberta be angry with he and this be enough to sadden the soul of a man who love she as he love she who would have marry she at any moment in spite of all opposition all threat all curse he be not in the habit of look at himself after the manner of lawrence croft but on this occasion he could not help a little self-survey be it a purely disinterested motive he ask himself that take he over to the spring to bring back lawrence croft do he not believe in he soul that roberta would never have speak so freely to he in regard to what the gentleman from the north would probably say to she if she have not intend to decline that gentleman 's offer and be there not a wish in he heart that this matter might be definitely and satisfactorily settle before roberta and mr croft go to new york for the winter he could not deny that this issue to the affair have be in he mind and yet he feel that he could conscientiously assure himself that if he have think thing would turn out otherwise he still would have endeavor to make the man perform the duty expect of he by roberta in whose service junius always feel himself to be but apparently he have not benefit himself or anybody else except perhaps croft by this service which he have perform it be late in the forenoon when junius meet mr brandon return to midbranch in answer to he expression of surprise mr brandon who appear in a exceptionally good humor inform junius of he reason for the visit to the widow keswick and what he have find when he arrive there you little cousin say he be a most charming young creature and on interested motive i should oppose you go to you aunt 's house be it not for the fact that she be marry and therefore of no danger to you i be very glad to find she there she influence over you aunt will i think be highly advantageous and the first fruit of it be that the old lady will now welcome you with open arm would you believe it she have already announce that she wish to make a match between you and this little cousin and in order to do so have actually engage I to endeavor to bring about a divorce between the young lady and she absent husband the widow keswick have as many crank and crotchet in she head as there be seed in a tobacco pod but this be the queerest and the wildest of they all the couple seem very much attach to each other and nothing can be say against the husband except that he do not accompany he wife on she visit to she relative and if he know anything about the old lady i do not blame he a bit now you course my dear boy be perfectly plain let you aunt talk as much as she please about this divorce and you union with the little annie it will not hurt anybody and she must talk herself out in time in the mean time take advantage of the present circumstance to mollify and tone down so to speak the good old lady make she understand that we be all she friend and that there be no one in the connection who would wish to do she the slightest harm this would be we christian duty at any time but it be more particularly we duty now i would like you to bring you cousin over to see we before roberta go away i invite she to come and tell she that my niece would first call upon she be it not for the peculiar circumstance but if the family can be in a measure bring together -- and i shall make it a point to ride over there occasionally -- if you aunt can be make to understand the kindly feeling we really have toward she and can be induce to set aside even in a slight degree the violent prejudice she now hold against we all may yet turn out well now go my boy and may the best of success go with you do not trouble yourself about send back the horse keep he as long as you want he mr brandon ride on leave junius to pursue he way it be very pleasant think the young man who have say scarcely a word during the interview to hear mr brandon talk about all turn out well but when he get home he may discover that there be something to be do at midbranch as well as on the keswick place mr brandon 's reflection be very different from those of junius it appear to he that a reconciliation between the two family even though it should be a partial one be reasonably to be expect that newly arrive cousin be a angel she be bind to do good a marriage between he niece and junius keswick be the great object of the old gentleman 's heart and he long to see the former engagement between they re-establish before roberta go to new york where she beauty and attractiveness would expose he cherish plan to many danger the road he be on lead directly north and it be join about a quarter of a mile above by the road which run through the wood to the green sulphur spring on this road at a point nearly opposite to he he could see through the foliage a horseman ride toward the point of junction something about this person attract he attention and mr brandon take out a pair of eye-glass and put they on as soon as he have obtain another good view of the horseman he recognize he as mr croft the old gentleman take off he glass and return they to he vest pocket and he face begin to flush in he early acquaintance with mr croft he have not object to he because he wish he niece to have company and he have a firm belief in the enduring quality of she affection for junius but latterly he idea in regard to the new york gentleman have change he have think he somewhat too assiduous and when he have unexpectedly return from the north mr brandon have not be at all pleased although he have be careful not to show he displeasure this condition of thing make he feel uneasy and have prompt he visit to the widow keswick and now that everything look so fair and promising here be that man whom he have suppose to have leave this part of the country ride toward he house mr brandon be a easy-going man but he have a backbone which could be greatly stiffen on occasion he sit up very straight on he horse and urge the animal to a better pace so that he arrive first at the point where the road meet here he await mr croft who soon ride up the old gentleman 's greet be very courteous you be on the way to my house i presume he say mr croft assure he that he be and hope that miss march be quite well i have be from home for a little while say mr brandon but i believe my niece enjoy she usual health i have have a long ride this morning he continue and feel a little tired would it inconvenience you sir if we should dismount and sit for a time on yonder log by the roadside it would rest I and i would like to have a little talk with you lawrence wonder very much that the old gentleman should want to rest when he be not a mile from he own house but of course he consent to the propose plan and imitate mr brandon by ride under a large tree and fasten he bridle to a low-hanging bough the two gentleman seat themselves on the log and mr brandon without preface begin he remark may i be pardon for suppose sir he say that you present visit to my house be intend for my niece lawrence look at he a little earnestly and reply that it be so intended then sir i think i have the right to ask as my niece 's present guardian and almost indeed as she father whether or not you visit be connect in any way with matrimonial overture toward that lady not wish to foolishly and dishonorably deny that such be he purpose in go to midbranch and feeling that it would be as unwise to decline answer the question as it would be unmanly to resort to subterfuge about it lawrence reply that he object in visit miss march that day be to make matrimonial overture to she i think say mr brandon that you will be oblige to I if i make you acquaint with the present condition of affair between miss march and mr junius keswick have not they engagement be break off interrupted lawrence only conditionally answer the old gentleman they love each other they wish to be marry with one exception all they relative desire that they should marry it would be a union not only congenial in the highest degree to the party concerned but of the greatest advantage to we family and we family fortune there be but a single obstacle to this most desirable union and that be the unwarrantable opposition of one person but i be happy to say that this opposition be on the point of be remove i consider it to be but a matter of day when my niece and mr keswick with the full approbation of the relative on either side will renew in the eye of the world that engagement which i consider still exist in fact if this be so say lawrence grind he heel very deeply into the ground why be i not tell of it my dear sir exclaimed mr brandon have you ever intimate to I or to any of my family that you intention in visit midbranch be other than those of a ordinary friend or acquaintance lawrence admit that he have never make any such intimation then sir say mr brandon what reason could we have for mention this subject to you -- a subject that would not have be refer to now have it not be for you admission of you intended object in visit my house lawrence have no answer to make to this but it be not easy to turn he from he purpose excuse I sir he say but i think a matter of this sort should be leave to the lady if she be not incline to receive my address she will say so and there be a end of it the face of mr brandon slightly reddened but he voice remain as quiet and courteous as before you do not comprehend sir the state of affair or you would see that a procedure of that kind would be extremely ill-judged at this time be it know that at this critical moment miss march be address by another suitor it would seriously jeopardize the success of plan which we all have very much at heart lawrence do not immediately reply to this crafty speech he tooth be very firmly set and he look steadfastly before he i do not understand all this he say presently nor do i see that there be any need for my understand it in fact i have nothing to do with it i wish to propose marriage to miss march if she decline my offer there be a end of the matter if she accept I then it be quite proper that all you plan should fall to the ground she be the principal in the affair and it be due to she and due to I that she should make the decision in this case mr brandon have not quite so many tooth as he younger companion but the very fair number which remain with he be set together quite as firmly as those of lawrence have be he remark speak very distinctly but without any show of emotion : i see sir that it be quite impossible for we to think alike on this subject and there be therefore nothing leave for I to do but to ask you -- and i assure you sir that the request be as destitute of any intention of discourtesy as if it be base upon the presence of sickness or family affliction -- that you will not visit my house at present lawrence rise to he foot with a good deal of color in he face that settle the matter for the present he say of course i shall not go to a house which be forbid to I i wish you good-morning sir and he stalk to he horse and endeavor to pull down the limb to which its bridle be attach mr brandon follow he you must mount before you can unfasten you bridle he say and allow I to assure you sir that as soon as this little affair be settle i shall be very happy indeed to see you again at my house lawrence have succeed in loosen he bridle from the tree make answer with a bow and gallop away to the green sulphur spring mr brandon now mount and ride home this be the first time in he life that he have ever forbid any one to visit midbranch and yet he do not feel that he have be either discourteous or inhospitable there be time he say to himself when a man must stand up for he own interest and this be one of the time chapter xi in the little dining-room of the cottage at the green sulphur spring sit that evening lawrence croft a perturb and angry but a resolute man he have be quite a long time come to the conclusion to propose to roberta march and now that he have make up he mind to do so even in spite of certain conviction it naturally arouse he indignation to find himself suddenly stop short by such a insignificant person as mr brandon a gentleman to whom in this affair he have give no consideration whatever the fact that the lady wish to see he add much to he annoyance and discomfiture he have no idea what reason she have for desire a interview with he but whatever she should say to he he intend to follow by a declaration of he sentiment he have not the slightest notion in the world of give up the prosecution of he suit but have be request not to come to midbranch what be he to do he might write to miss march but that would not suit he in a matter like this he would wish to adapt he word and he manner to the mood and disposition of the lady and he could not do this in a letter when he woo a woman he must see she and speak to she to any clandestine approach any whisper conversation beneath she window he would give no thought have be ask by the master of the house not to go there he would not go but he would see she and tell he love and more than that he would win she that morning while wait for the time to approach when it would be proper for he to go to midbranch he have be read in a bind volume of a old english magazine which be one of the five book the cottage possess a account of a battle which have interested he very much the commander of one army have mass he force along and below the crest of a line of low hill the extreme right of he line be occupy by a strong force of cavalry the army oppose to he be much stronger than he own and it be not long before the battle begin to go very much against he he position on the leave be carry by the combined charge of the larger portion of the enemy 's force and in spite of a vigorous resistance he line be force back down the hill and into the valley it be quite evident he could make no stand and be badly beaten thereupon he send order to he general on the leave to retreat in as good order as possible across a small river in they rear while this movement be in progress and the enemy be make the greatest effort to prevent it the commander put himself at the head of he cavalry and lead they swiftly from the scene of battle he take they diagonally over the crest of the hill down the other side and then charge with this fresh body of horse upon the rear and camp of the enemy he swiftly capture the general-in-chief he staff and the minister of war who have come down to see how thing be go on with these important prisoner he dash away leave the acephalous enemy to capture he broken column if he could this be the kind of thing lawrence croft would like to do for a hour or more he puzzle he brain as to how he should make such a cavalry charge and at last he come to a determination he would ask junius keswick to assist he there be something odd about this plan which pleased croft keswick be he rival with the powerful backing of mr brandon and a whole tribe of relative and it might naturally be suppose that he be the last man in the world of whom he would ask assistance but look at it from he point of view lawrence think that not only would he be take no undue advantage of the other in ask he to help he in this matter but that keswick ought not and would not object to it if miss march really preferred croft keswick should feel himself bind in honor to do everything he could to let the two settle the affair between themselves this be draw the point very fine but lawrence persuade himself that if the case be reverse he would not marry a girl who have not choose another man simply because she have have no opportunity of do so he have a strong belief that keswick be of he way of thinking and before he go to bed he write he rival a note ask he to call upon he the follow day early the next morning the note be carry over to midbranch by a messenger who return say that mr keswick have go away and that he present address be howlett 's in the same county this piece of information cause lawrence croft to open he eye very wide a few day before he have receive a letter from mr null write at howlett 's and now keswick have go there he have be very much surprise when he find that the cashier have so successfully carry on the search for keswick as to come into the very county in virginium where he be and he intend to write to she that he have no further occasion for she service but he have not do so and here be the pursuer and the pursue in the same town or village or whatever howlett 's be he give mr null credit for be one of the best detective he have ever hear of for apparently she have not only be able to successfully track the man she be in search of but to find out where he be go and have reach the place in question before he do but he also berate she soundly in he mind for she over-officiousness he have not wish she to swoop down upon the man but only to inform he of he whereabouts the next thing that would probably happen would be the appearance of mr null at the green sulphur spring hold keswick by the collar he deeply regret that he have ever intrust this young woman with the investigation not because he have since meet keswick himself but for the reason that she be entirely too energetic and imprudent if keswick should find out from she that she have be in search of he and why it might bring about a very unpleasant state of affair croft saw now quite plainly what he must do he must go to howlett 's as quickly as possible perhaps keswick and the cashier have not yet meet and in that case all he would have to do would be to remunerate the young woman and she husband -- for she have inform he that she intend to combine this business with a wedding tour -- and send they off immediately he could then have he conference with keswick there as well as at the spring if any mischief have already be do he do not know what course he might have to pursue but it be highly necessary for he to be on the spot as soon as possible he greatly dislike to leave the neighborhood of roberta march but he absence would only be temporary after a early dinner he mount the horse which he have hire from he host of the spring and with a valise strap behind he set out for howlett 's he have make careful inquiry in regard to the road and after a ride somewhat tiresome to a man not use to such protracted horseback exercise arrive at he destination about sundown when he reach the scatter house which form as he suppose the outskirts of the village for such he have be tell it be he ride on but soon find that he have leave howlett 's behind he and that those suppose outskirts be the place itself hewlett 's be nothing in fact but a collection of eight or ten house quite widely separate from each other and the only one of they which exhibit any public character whatever be the store a large frame building stand a little back from the road turn he horse lawrence ride up to the store and inquire if there be any house in the neighborhood where he could get lodge for the night the storekeeper who come out to he be a very little man whose appearance recall to croft the fact that he have notice in this part of the state a great many man who be extremely tall and a great many who be extremely small which peculiarity he think might assist a physiologist in discover the different effect of hot bread upon different organization he be quite as cordial however as the biggest burliest and jolliest host who ever welcome a guest to he inn as he inform mr croft that there be no house in the village which make a business of entertaining stranger but if he choose to stop with he he would keep he and he horse for the night and do what he could to make he comfortable lawrence eat supper that night with the storekeeper he wife and five of he child but as he be very hungry and the meal be a plentiful one he enjoy the experience i suppose you be goin ' on to westerville in the mornin ' say the little host no reply croft i be not go any farther than this place do you know if a gentleman name keswick arrive here recently why yaa say the man if you mean junius keswick certainly he do say mr storekeeper he ride through here yesterday and he stop at the store to see if we have any of that lynchburg tobacco he use to smoke when he live here he be go on to he aunt 's where be that ask croft it be about two mile out on the westerville road say the little man if i would know you want to see he i would ' a tell you to keep right on and you could ' a stop with mr keswick over night lawrence wish to ask some question about mr null but he be afraid to do so lest he might excite suspicion by connect she with keswick if the latter have go two mile out of town perhaps she have not yet see he the room in which lawrence sleep that night be to he a very odd one it be a long apartment at one end of which be a clean comfortable bed a couple of chair and a table on which be a basin and pitcher at the other end be pile of new-looking box contain grocery of various kind roll of cotton cloth and other dry goods and what attract he attention more than anything else a vast number of bright tin can bear on they side brilliant picture of tomato peach green corn and other preservable eatables these be evidently the reserved store of the establishment and they be so different from the bedroom decoration to which he be accustom that it quite pleased lawrence to think that with all he experience in life he be now lodge in a manner entirely novel to he as he lay awake look at the moonlight glittering on the side of the multitude of can the thought come into he mind that this have probably be the room of the null when they be here as this be the only house in the place where traveller be entertain he say to himself of course they must have come to it and as they be not here now it be quite plain that they must have go away i be very glad of it especially if they leave before keswick arrive for they departure probably prevent a awkward situation but i shall ask the storekeeper no question about these people there be no better way of give inquisitive folk the _ entre _ to you affair than by ask question of course there be no reason why they should stay here after they have successfully trace keswick to this part of the country and every reason if they want to enjoy themselves why they should go away but i can not help be sorry that i do not meet the young woman and have a opportunity of pay she for she trouble and give she a few word of advice in regard to she action or rather non-action in this matter she have a fine head for business but i should like to feel certain that she understand that she business with I be over and he turn he eye from the glitter can and sleep the next morning lawrence croft ride on to mr keswick 's house and when he reach the second or inner gate he see on the other side of it a elderly female wear a purple sun-bonnet and carry a purple umbrella there be something very eccentric about the garb of this elderly personage and many a inexperienced city man would have take she for a retired nurse or some other domestic retainer of the family but there be a steadfastness in she gaze and a fire in she eye which indicate to lawrence that she be one much more accustomed to give order than to take they he raise he hat very politely and ask if mr keswick be to be find there if the commander of the army about whom mr croft have recently be read have behold in the earlier stage of the battle a strong friendly force advance to he aid he would not have be more delighted than lawrence would have be have he known what a powerful ally to he cause stand beneath that purple sun-bonnet do you mean junius keswick say the old lady yes madam answer croft he be here and you will find he at the house the gate be partly open and lawrence ride in the old lady step aside to let he pass do you want to see he on business she say how do you know he be here i inquire at howlett 's madam mr keswick would have like to ask some further question but there be something about lawrence 's appearance that deter she you can tie you horse under that tree over there she say point to a spot more trample by hoof than the old lady wish any other portion of she house-yard to be when lawrence have tie he bridle to a hook suspend by a strap from one of the lower branch of the indicate tree he advance to the house and a very much astonished man be he to see sit side by side on the porch junius keswick and mr candy 's cashier they be seat in the shade of a mass of honeysuckle vine and be so busily engage in conversation that they have not perceive he approach even now lawrence have time to look at they for a few moment before they turn they eye upon he equally astonished be the two people on the porch who now arise to they foot junius keswick naturally wonder very much why mr croft should come to see he here and as for the young lady she be almost as much terrify as surprised have this man come down from new york to swoop upon she cousin have it be possible that she could have give he any idea of the whereabouts of junius in she last note to he she have be very careful to promise information but not to give any hope thus to gain time to get a insight into the matter and to keep she cousin out of danger if indeed any danger threaten but here the pursuer have find junius in less than a day after she have first meet he herself but when she see junius advance and shake hand in a very friendly way with mr croft she terror begin to decrease although she surprise continue at the same high-water mark and keswick find himself in a flood of the same emotion when croft very politely salute he cousin by name which salutation be return in a manner which indicate that the party be acquaint at first croft have be prompt to ignore all knowledge of the cashier and meet she as a stranger but he better sense prevent this for how could he know what she have be say about he i be about to introduce you to my cousin say keswick but i see that you already know each other i have have the pleasure of meeting mr null in new york say lawrence to whom the word cousin give what might be call a more important surprise than anything with which this three-sided interview have yet furnished its participant he give a quick glance at the lady and discover she very steadfastly gaze at he i hope he say that you and you husband have have a very pleasant trip mr null do not come with I she quietly reply lawrence croft be a man to whom it give pleasure to deal with problematic situation unexpected development and the like but this be too much of a conundrum for he that the man whose address he have employ this girl to find out should prove to be she cousin and that she should start on she bridal trip without she husband be point on which he reason have no power to work one thing however he quickly determine upon he would have a interview with madam cashier and have she explain these mystery she be virtually he agent and have no right to conceal from he what she have be do and why she have do it it be necessary however that he should waste no time in thought of this kind but should immediately state to mr keswick the reason of he visit for it could not be suppose he have call in a merely social way i wish to speak to you he say on a little matter of business at these word mr null excuse herself and go into the house she mind be trouble as she wonder what the business be which have make this new york gentleman so extraordinarily desirous to find she cousin be it anything that would injure junius she look back as she enter the door but the object of she solicitude be sit with a face so calm and compose that it show very plainly he do not expect any communication which would be harmful to he it be a satisfaction think mr croft a very great satisfaction that i can enter upon the object of my visit know that my affair and my action have not be discuss by this gentleman and mr null chapter xii old mr keswick would willingly have follow the strange gentleman to the house in order to know the object of he visit but as he have come to see junius she refrain for she know she nephew would not like any appearance of curiosity on she part she reception of junius have be very different indeed from that she have previously accord he when she decline to be find under the same roof with he now he be here under very different auspices and for he the very plumpest poultry be slay and everything be do to make he comfortable and willing to stay and become acquaint with he cousin mr null a match between these two young people be the present object of the old lady 's existence and she set about make it with as much determination and confidence as if there have be no such person as mr null of this individual she have the most contemptible opinion she have never ask many question about he because in she intercourse with she niece she wish as far as possible to ignore he have mentally picture he in various mean condition of life she have finally settle it in she mind that he be a agent for some patent fertilizer a man of this kind be a very obnoxious person to she this avocation however constitute in the old lady 's mind no excusable reason for he protracted absence and if ever a wife be desert she believe that she niece annie be such a wife if he should stay away much longer she say to herself we shall have no more trouble in get a divorce than to have he funeral sermon preach and if there be any talk of he come here or of she go to he i 'll put my foot down on that sort of thing if i have a foot leave to do it with when she have first perceive the approach of mr croft a fear have seize she that this might be the recreant husband but the gentlemanly appearance of the stranger soon dispel this idea from she prejudiced mind apart from the fact that she have no business at the house with she nephew 's visitor she have positive business in the garden with old uncle isham and there she repair there be some work to be do in regard to a flower pit in which some of she choicest plant be to be domicile during the winter and this she wish personally to oversee although the autumn be well advance the day be somewhat warm and as the pair whom mr croft have see on the porch have be glad to shelter themselves in the shade of the honeysuckle vine so mr keswick seat herself on a little bench behind a large arbor still cover by heavy vine which stand on the boundary line between the garden and the front yard and open on the latter this bench which be always shady in the morning she have have place there that she might comfortably direct the labor of old isham the boy plez or whoever for the time be happen to be she gardener mr croft do not immediately begin the statement of the business which have bring he to see junius keswick several window of the house open on the porch and he do not wish what he have to say to be hear by any one except the person he be address i desire to talk to you on some private matter he say could we not walk a little away from the house certainly say junius rise we will step over to that arbor by the garden we shall be quite comfortable and secluded there this be the place say junius as they seat themselves in the arbor where when a boy i use to come to smoke my aunt do not allow this diversion but i manage to do a good deal of puff before i be find out then you use to live here ask croft oh yes say keswick my parent die when i be quite a little fellow and my aunt have charge of I until i have grow up be that you aunt whom i meet at the gate there be something about she bearing and general appearance which greatly interested I she be a most estimable lady return junius and not wish further to discuss he relative he add : and now what be it sir that i can have the pleasure of do for you the matter regard miss march say croft i presume so remark the other i will state it as briefly as possible continued croft in consequence of you visit to I at the the spring i set out the day before yesterday to make another attempt to call on miss march the first one have be frustrate as you may remember by the information we receive at the gate in regard to miss march 's indisposition which as i have hear nothing more of it i hope be of no importance of none whatever say junius when i be within a mile or so of midbranch continued croft i meet mr brandon who request I not to come to he house and in fact to cease my visit altogether what cry keswick very much surprise that be not at all like mr brandon what reason could he have for treat you in such a manner the very best in the world say croft have as the guardian of he niece ask I the object of my visit to miss march and have be inform by I that it be my intention to propose matrimony to the lady he request that i would not visit at he house on what ground do he base he objection to you visit ask keswick he make no objection to I he simply state that he do not desire I to come because he wish he niece to marry you quite plainly speak remark keswick nothing could be more so reply croft i could not expect any one to be franker with I than he be he go on to inform I that a match between the lady and yourself be greatly desire by the whole family connection with a single exception which however he do not name and while he give I to understand that he have no reason to fear that so far as the lady be concerned my proposal would interfere with you prospects still be it know that there be another aspirant in the field a very undesirable state of thing might ensue what this state of affair be he do not state but i presume it have something to do with the exceptional opposition to which he refer and what do you say to all that ask junius i say very little when a man ask I not to come to he house i do not go but nevertheless i have fully make up my mind to propose to miss march as soon as i can get a opportunity i have nothing to do with family arrangement or family opposition you have tell I that you be not engage to she and i be go to try to be engage to she she be the one to decide this matter and now i have call upon you mr keswick to see if there be any way in which you can assist I in obtain a interview with miss march do not you think say junius that it be rather cool in you to ask I to assist you in this matter not at all reply the other if it have not be for you i should now be in new york with no thought of present proposal of marriage but you come to I and insist that i should see the lady that be simply because she have express a strong desire to see you very good say lawrence i try to go to she as you know and be prevent now all i ask of you be to help I to do what you so strongly urge I to do there be nothing particularly cool in that i think keswick do not immediately reply i be not sure he say that miss march still wish to see you that may be reply croft speak a little warmly none of we exactly know what she think or wish but i want to find out what she think about I by distinctly ask she and i should suppose you would consider it to you advantage as well as mine that i should do so i have my own opinion on that point say keswick which it be not necessary to discuss at present if i be to assist you to a interview with miss march it would be on the lady 's account not on yours or mine but apart from the fact that i do not know if she now desire a interview i would not do anything that would offend or annoy mr brandon i do not ask that of you say croft but could not you use you influence with he to give I a fair chance with the lady that be all i ask and whether she accept I or reject I i be sure everybody ought to be satisfied keswick smile you do not leave any margin for sentiment he say but i suppose it be just as well to deal with this matter in a practical way i do not think however that any influence i can exert on mr brandon would induce he to allow you to address he niece if he be oppose to it and i be sure he would have a very strange opinion of I if i attempt such a thing at present i do not see that i can help you at all but i will think over the matter and we will talk of it again thank you say croft rise and when shall i call upon you to hear you decision it be rather difficult for junius keswick to answer a question like this on the spur of the moment he arise and walk with croft out of the arbor he first impulse as a virginium gentleman be to invite he visitor to stay at the house until the matter should be settle but he do not know what extraordinary freak on the part of he aunt might be cause by such a invitation but before he have decide what to say they be meet by mr keswick come from the garden junius thereupon present mr croft who be welcome by the old lady with extended hand and exceed cordiality i be very glad she say to meet a friend of my nephew but where be you go sir certainly not toward you horse you must stay and dine with we lawrence hesitate he have no claim on the hospitality of these people but he wish very much to have a opportunity to speak to mr null thank you he say but i be stay down here at the village and it be but a short ride stay at hewlett 's exclaimed mr keswick at which hotel may i ask lawrence laugh i be stop with the storekeeper he say that settle it say the old lady give she umbrella a jab into the ground tom peckett 's accommodation may be good enough for pedler and travel agent but they be not fit for gentleman especially one of my nephew 's friend you must stay with we sir as long as you be in this neighborhood i insist upon it junius be very much astonished at he aunt 's speech and manner the old lady be not at all inhospitable so far be it otherwise the case that rather than deprive a objectionable visitor of the shelter of she roof she would go from under it herself but he have never know she to gush in this manner upon a stranger he now feel at liberty however to obey he own impulse and urge mr croft to stay with they you be very kind indeed say lawrence and i shall be glad to defer for the present my return to my ` hotel ' this will give I the additional pleasure of renew my acquaintance with mr null what exclaim mrs keswick do you know she too and to think of you stop at peckett 's you home sir while you stay in these part be here before the three reach the house mr keswick have inquire how long mr croft have know she niece and have discover much to she disappointment that he have

of leave the neighborhood of howlett 's until keswick have make up he mind what he be go to do and until he have have a private talk with mr null and as it be quite evident that the family would be offend if a visitor to they should lodge at peckett 's store he accept the invitation to spend the night at the keswick house and in the afternoon junius ride with he to howlett 's where he get he valise and pay he account but no opportunity occur that day for a _ tte-a-tte _ with mr null keswick be with he nearly all the afternoon and in the evening the family sit together in the parlor where the conversation be a general one occasionally very much brighten by some of the caustic remark of the old lady in regard to particular man and woman as well as society at large of course he have many opportunity of judge to the best of he capacity of certain phase of character appertaining to mr candy 's cashier and among other thing he come to the conclusion that probably she be a young woman who would get up early in the morning and he therefore determine to do that thing himself and see if he could not have a talk with she before the rest of the family be astir early rising be not one of croft 's accustomed habit but the next morning he arise a good hour before breakfast time he find the lower part of the house quite desert and when he go out on the porch he be glad to button up he coat for the morning air be very cool while walk up and down with he hand in he pocket and look in at the front door every time he pass it in hope that he might see mr null come down the stair he be greet with a cheery good morning by a voice in the front yard turn hastily he behold mr keswick wear she purple sun-bonnet but without she umbrella glad you like to be up betime sir say she that be my way and i find it pay nobody work as well and i do not believe the plant and stock grow as well while we be asleep lawrence reply that in the city he do not get up so early but that the morning air in the country be very fine and pretty sharp too say mrs keswick come down here in the sunshine and you will find it pleasanter step back a little this way sir she say when lawrence have join she and give I you opinion of that locust tree by the corner of the porch i be thinking of have it cut down locust be very apt to get diseased inside and break off and i be afraid that one will blow over some day and fall on the house lawrence say he think it look like a very good tree and it would be a pity to lose the shade it make i might plant one of another sort say the old lady but tree grow too slow for old people though plenty fast enough for young one i reckon i 'll let it stand awhile yet you be talk last night of midbranch sir there use to be fine tree there though it be many year since i have see they have you be long acquaint with the family there lawrence reply that he have know miss march a good while have meet she in new york she be say to be a right smart young lady say mr keswick well educate and have travel in europe i be tell that she be not only a regular town lady but that she make a first-rate house-keeper when she be down here in the country lawrence reply that he have no doubt that all this be very true i have never see she continue the old lady for there have not be much communication between the two family of late year although they use to be intimate enough but my nephew and niece have be away a great deal and old people can not be expect to do much in the way of visit but i have a notion she say after gaze a few moment in a reflective way at the corner of the house that it would be well now to be a little more sociable again my niece have no company here of she own sex except I and i think it would do she good to know a young lady like miss march mr brandon have ask I to let annie come there but i think it would be a great deal better for he niece to visit we mrs null be the latest comer lawrence speak much more earnestly than when discuss the locust tree reply that he think this would be quite proper i think i may invite she to come here next week say mr keswick still meditatively and without apparent regard to the presence of croft probably on Friday and ask she to spend a week and by the way sir she say turn to she companion if you be still in this part of the country i would be glad to have you ride over and stay a day or two while miss march be here i will have a little party of young folk in honor of mr null i have do nothing of the kind for she so far lawrence say he have no doubt that he would stay at the green sulphur a week or two longer and that he would be most happy to accept mr keswick 's kind invitation they then move toward the house but suddenly stop as if she have just think of something mr keswick remark : i shall be oblige to you sir if you will not say anything about this little plan of mine just now i have not speak of it to any one have scarcely make up my mind to it and i suppose i should not have mention it to you if we have not be talk about midbranch there be nothing i hate so much as to have people hear i be go to give they a invitation or that i be go to do anything in fact before i have fully make up my mind about it lawrence assure she that he would say nothing on the subject and she promise to send he a note to the green sulphur in case she finally determine on have the little company at she house now triumphantly think croft it matter not what keswick decide to do for i do not need he assistance a elderly angel in a purple sun-bonnet have come to my aid she be about to do ever so much more for I than i could expect of he and i prefer she assistance to that of my rival altogether it be the most unexpected piece of good luck after breakfast there come to lawrence the opportunity of a private conference with mr null he be stand alone on the porch when she come out of the door with she hat on and a basket in she hand and say she be go to see a very old color woman who live in the neighborhood who be consider a very interesting personage and perhaps he would like to go there with she nothing could suit croft better than this and off they start as soon as they be outside the yard gate the lady remark : i have be try hard to give you a chance to talk to I when the other be not by i know you must be perfectly wild to ask I what this all mean why i never tell you that mr keswick be my cousin and the rest of it i can not say say lawrence that i be absolutely untame and ferocious in regard to the matter but i do really wish very much that you would give I some explanation of you very odd doings in fact that be the only thing that now keep I here i think so say mr null as i suppose you have get through with you business with junius i do not wish to detain you here any longer than be necessary thank you say lawrence you be welcome she say and when i see you stand on the porch by yourself the idea of be generous to old aunt patsy come into my mind and here we be now what do you want to know first well say mr croft i would like very much to know how a young lady like you come to be mr candy 's cashier i suppose you would want to know that she say it be a dreadfully long story and as it be a strictly family matter i have almost make up my mind last night that i ought not to tell it to you at all but as i do not know how much you be mix up with the family i afterward think it best for my own sake to explain the matter to you so i will give you the principal point my mother be a sister of mr keswick and junius ' mother be another sister both he parent die when he be a boy and aunt keswick bring he up my mother die here when i be quite small and i stay until i be eight year old aunt keswick and my father be not very good friend and when she come to look upon I as entirely she own child and wish to deprive he of all rights and privilege as a parent he resent it very much and at last take I away i do not remember exactly how this be do but i know there be a tremendous quarrel and my father and aunt never meet again he take I to new york and there we live very happily until about two year ago when my father die he be a lawyer by profession but at that time hold a salaried position in a railroad company and when he die of course we income cease the money that be leave do not last very long and then i have to decide what i be to do it would have be natural for I to go to my only relative aunt keswick and junius but my father have be so oppose to my aunt have anything to do with I that i could not bear to go to she he have really be so much afraid that she would try to win I away from he or in some way gain possession of I that he would not even let she know we address and never answer the few letter from she which reach he and which he tell I be nothing but demand that she sister 's child should be give back to she junius have write to I how many time i do not know but two letter have come to I that be very good and affectionate quite different from my aunt 's but even these my father would not let I answer it would be all the same thing he say as if i open communication with my aunt keswick therefore out of respect to my father and also in accordance with my own wish i give up all idea of come down here and go to work to support myself i try several thing and at last through a friend of my father who be a regular customer of mr candy i get the position of cashier in the information shop it be a awfully queer place but the work be very easy and i soon get use to it then you come make inquiry for a address at first i do not know that the person you want be junius keswick and my cousin but after i begin to look into the matter i find that it must be he who you be after then i become very much trouble for i like junius who be the only one of my blood whom i have any reason to care for and when one see a person set a detective -- for it be all the same thing -- upon the track of another person one be very apt to think that some harm be intend to the person that be be look up i do not know what business junius be in nor what he condition be but even if he have be do wrong i do not wish you to find he until i have first see he and then if i find you could do he any harm i would warn he to keep out of you way do you think that be fair treatment of I ask croft you be nothing to I and junius be a great deal she answer and yet i think i be fair enough the only money you pay be what mr candy charge and when i speak of receive money for my service when the affair be finish i only do it that it might all be more business like and that you should not drop I and set somebody else look after junius that be the great thing i be afraid of so i do all i could to make you satisfy with I i do not see how you conscience could allow you to do all this say croft my conscience be very much pleased with I be the answer what i do be a stratagem and perfectly fair too if i have find that it be right for you to see junius i would have do everything i could to help you communicate with he but when i do at last see he down you swoop upon we before i have a opportunity of say a word about you you marriage be a very fortunate thing for you say mr croft for if it have not be for that i should never have allow you to go about the country look up a gentleman in my behalf but how do you get over you repugnance to you aunt i do not get over it she say i conquer it for i find that this be the most likely place to meet junius and aunt keswick have certainly treat I in the kindest manner although she be very angry about mr null but when i first come and she do not know who i be she behave in the most extraordinary manner what do she do ask croft never you mind she answer with a little laugh you can not expect to know all the family affair they have now arrive at aunt patsy 's cabin and mr null enter follow at a little distance by croft the old woman have see they as they be walk along the road and she little black eye sparkle with peculiar animation behind she great spectacles she granddaughter happen not to be at home but aunt patsy get up and with she apron rub off the bottom of two chair which she place in convenient position for she expect visitor when they come in they find she in a very perturb condition she answer mr null 's question with a very few word and a great many grunt and keep she eye fix nearly all the time upon mr croft endeavor to find out perhaps if he have yet be subject to any kind of conjure when all the question which young people generally put to old servant have be ask by mr null and croft have make as many remark as might have be expect of he in regard to the age and recollection of this interesting old negress aunt patsy begin to be much more disturbed fear that the interview be about to come to a end she actually get up and go to the back door to look for eliza do you want she anxiously inquire mr null go to the old woman 's side yaa i want she say aunt patsy i ` spec ' she at aggy 's house -- dat cabin ober dar -- but i can not holler loud ` nuf to make she h ` yere I i 'll run over there and tell she you want she say mr null step out of the door dat 's a good chile say aunt patsy with more warmth than she have yet exhibit dat 's you own mudder 's good chile and then she turn quickly into the room croft have rise as if he be about to follow mr null or at least to see where she have go but aunt patsy stop he jus ' you stay h ` yar one little minute she say hurriedly i get one word to say to you sah and she stand up before he as erect as she could fix she great spectacles directly upon he you look out sah fur ole miss she say in a voice naturally shrill but now heavily handicap by age and emotion ole miss keswick i mean she boun ' to do you harm sah she tole I so wid she own mouf mr keswick exclaim croft why you must be mistaken good aunty she can have no ill feeling towards I don ' you b ` lieve dat

have be slip into the side-pocket of mr croft 's coat by the old woman and as she do so she whisper in a tone that could not but have its effect upon he now nebber tell she honey here be eliza say mrs null as she come in follow by the great granddaughter and i think she say to mr croft it be time for we to go good-bye aunt patsy you can send back the basket by eliza when the two leave the cabin croft walk thoughtfully for a few moment wonder what in the world the old woman could have mean by she strange word and gift to he conclude however that they could have be nothing but the driveling of weak-minded old age he dismiss they from he mind and turn he attention to he companion we be speak he say of mr null do you expect he shortly well no say the lady i can not say that i do that be odd say lawrence i think this be you wedding journey so it be in a measure say she but there be no necessity of he come here do not i tell you that my aunt be oppose to the marriage but she might as well make up she mind to it now he say she be not in the habit of make up she mind to thing she do not like do you know she add look around with a half smile as if she take pleasure in astonishing he that aunt keswick be go to try to have we divorce what exclaim croft divorce be there any ground for it she have other matrimonial plan for I that be all what a extraordinary individual she must be he exclaim but she can never carry out such a ridiculous scheme as that i do not know she say she have already consult mr brandon on the subject what nonsense cry croft if you and mr null be satisfied nobody else have anything to do with it mr null and i be of one mind say she and agree perfectly but do not you think it be a terrible thing to know you must always face a irritated aunt oh say croft look around at she very coldly and sternly i begin to see i suppose a separation would improve you prospects in life but it can not be do if you husband be oppose to it mr croft say the lady she face flush a good deal you have no right to speak to I in that way and attribute such motive to I no matter whom i have marry i would never give he up for the sake of money or a farm or anything you think my aunt could give I i beg you pardon say croft if i make a mistake but i do not see what else i could infer from you remark my remark say she be -- well they have a different meaning from what you suppose she walk on in silence for a few moment and then look up to she companion she say : i have a great mind to tell you something if you will promise at least for the present not to breathe it to a living soul instantly the lookout on the bow of lawrence croft 's life action call out : breaker ahead and almost instantly its engine be stop and every faculty of its commander be on the alert i do not know he say that i be entitle to you confidence would it be of any advantage to you to tell I what you propose it would be of advantage and you be entitle she add quickly it be about mr null and you ought to know it for you instigate my wed life i instigate -- exclaim mr croft and then he stop short both in he speech and walk yes say the lady stop also and turn to face he you do and you ought to remember it you say if i have a husband to travel about with I you would like very much to employ I in the search for mr keswick and it be solely on that account that i go and get marry observe the look of blank and utter amazement on he face she smile and say : please do not look so horribly astonished mr null be void as she make this remark the lady look up at she companion with a smile and a expression of curiosity as to how he would take the announcement lawrence gaze blankly at she for a moment and then he break into a laugh you do not mean to say he exclaim that mr null be a imaginary be entirely so she reply my dear freddy be nothing but a fanciful idea with no attribute whatever except the name you be a most extraordinary young person say lawrence almost as extraordinary as you aunt what in the world make you think of do such a thing and why do you wish to keep up the delusion among you relative even so far as to drive you aunt to the point of get you divorce from you airy husband and he laugh again i tell you how i come to think of it she say as they walk on again it be very plain that if i want to travel about as you agent i must be marry and i have find a husband quite a protection and a advantage even when he do not go about with I and as to keep up the delusion as you call it in my own family i have find that to be absolutely necessary at least for the present my aunt even when i be a little girl determine to take my marriage into she own hand and since i have return to she this desire have come up again in the most astonishing way it be she principal subject of conversation with I be it not for the protection which my dear freddy null give I i should be throw bodily into the arm of the person whom my aunt have select and he would be oblige to take I whether he want to or not or be cast forth forever so you see how important it be that my aunt should think i be marry and i do hope you will not tell anybody about mr null of course i will keep you secret say croft you may rely upon that but do not you think -- do you believe that this sort of thing be altogether right she do not answer for a few moment and then she say : i suppose you must consider I a very deceptive sort of person but you should remember that these thing be not do for my own good and as far as i can see they be the only thing that could be do do you suppose i be go to let you pounce down on my cousin and do he some injury for as you keep you object such a secret i do not suppose it could be anything but a injury you intend he a fine opinion of I say croft and then do you suppose she continue that i would allow my aunt to quarrel with junius and disinherit he as she say she will should he decline to marry I i expect to drop my married name when i come here but i have not be with my aunt fifteen minute before i see that it would never do for I to be a single woman while i stay with she and so i keep my freddy by I i do not intend at all to tell you all these thing about my cousin and i only do it because i do not wish you to think that i be a sly mean creature deceive other for my own good well say croft although i can not say you be right in make you relative believe you be marry when you be not still i see you have very fair reason for what you do and you certainly show a great deal of ingenuity and pluck in carry out you remarkable scheme by-the-way he continue somewhat hesitatingly i be in you debt for you service to I not a bit of it she exclaim quickly i never do a thing for you it be all for myself or rather for my cousin the only money due be that which you pay to mr candy before i take charge of the matter lawrence feel that this be rather a sore subject with he companion and he drop it do you still hold the position of cashier in the information shop no she say when i start out on my lonely wedding tour i give up that and if i should go back to new york i do not think i should want to take it again do you propose soon to return to new york he ask no at least i have make no plan in regard to it i think it would grieve my aunt very much if i be to go away from she now and as long as i have mr null to protect I from she matrimonial scheme i be glad to stay with she she be very kind to I i think you be entirely right in decide to stay here he say look around at she and contrast in he mind the bright-faced and somewhat plump young person walk beside he with the thin-faced girl in black whom he have see behind the cashier 's desk now say she with a vivacious little laugh i have pour out my whole soul before you and in return i want you to gratify a curiosity which be fairly eating I up why be you so anxious to find my cousin junius and how do you happen to come here the very day after he arrive and more than that how be it that you have see he at midbranch so recently you be talk about it last night it could not have be my letter from howlett 's that bring you down here no say lawrence my meeting with mr keswick at midbranch be entirely accidental when i arrive there a few day ago i have no reason to suppose that i should meet he but i must ask you to excuse I from give my reason for wish to find you cousin and for come to see he here the matter between we have now become one of no importance and will be drop the lady 's face flush oh indeed she say and during the short remainder of they walk to the house she make no further remark chapter xiv when lawrence and he companion reach the house they find on the porch mr keswick and she nephew and after a little general conversation the latter remark to mr croft that he have find it would not be in he power to attend to that matter he have speak of to which croft reply that he be very much oblige to he for think of it and that it be of no consequence at all as he would probably make other arrangement he then state that he would be oblige to return to the green sulphur spring that day and that as it be a long ride he would like to start as soon as he horse could be bring to he but this procedure be condemn utterly by the old lady who insist that mr croft should not leave until after dinner which meal should be serve earlier than usual in order to give he plenty of time to get to the spring before dark and as lawrence have nothing to oppose to she very urgent protest he consent to stay before dinner be ready he find out why the protest be make the old lady take he aside and make inquiry of he in regard to mr null he have already inform she that he be not acquaint with that gentleman but she think as mr croft seem to be go about the country a good deal he might possibly meet with she niece 's husband and if he should do so she would be very glad to have he become acquaint with he to this lawrence reply with much gravity that he would be happy to do so mr null have not yet come to my house say mr keswick and it be very natural that one should desire to know the husband of she only niece who be or should be the same as a daughter to she a very natural wish indeed say lawrence i be not quite sure in what business mr null be engage she continue and although i ask my niece about it she answer in a very evasive way which make I think he occupation be one she be not proud of i have reason to suppose however that he be a agent for the sale of some fertilize compound at this lawrence could not help smile very broadly it may appear very odd and ridiculous to you she say that a person connect with my family should be engage in a business like that for those fertilizer as you ought to know be all humbug of the vilest kind the only time i buy any it take my whole wheat crop to pay for it and as for the clover i get afterward a grasshopper could have eat the whole of it i be afraid he do not tell she he business before he marry she and i be glad she be ashamed of it as far as i can find out it do not seem as if mr null have any intention of come here for some time and as i say before i do very much want to know something about he -- that be from a disinterested outsider one can not expect a recently marry young woman to give a correct account of she husband i do not believe say mr croft that there be any probability that i shall ever meet the gentleman -- we walk in life be so different i should hope so indeed interrupted mr keswick but people of all sort do run across each other but if i do meet with he he continue i shall take great pleasure in give you my impression by letter or in person of you nephew-in-law do not call he that exclaim the old lady with much asperity i do not acknowledge the title but i will not say any more about he with a grim smile or you may think i do not like he some of these day he say you may come to be of the opinion that he be exactly the husband you would wish you niece to have never she cry if he be a angel in broadcloth but i must not talk about these thing i mention mr null to you because you be the only person of my acquaintance who i suppose be likely to meet with he in regard to that little company i speak of to you i have not quite make up my mind about it and therefore have not mention it but if i carry out the plan i will write to you at the spring and shall certainly expect you to be one of we that would give I great pleasure say lawrence in a tone which indicate to the quick brain of the old lady that he would like to make a condition but be too polite to do so if miss march should agree to come she say it might be pleasant for you to make one of she party and ride over at the same time however i 'll let you know if she be come and then you can join she or not as suit you convenience thank you very much say lawrence in a tone which betray no reserve as he ride away that afternoon lawrence croft as he habit be on such occasion revolve in he mind what he have hear and say and do during this little visit to the keswick family nothing could have turn out better he think to be sure the young man could not or would not be of any assistance to I which be probably what i ought to have expect but the strong-tempered old lady he aunt promise to be of tenfold more service than he could possibly be as to that very odd young lady mr keswick 's niece i imagine that she do not regard I very favorably for she be quite cool after i refuse to let she into the secret of my desire to find she cousin but as i do not ask for she confidence she have no right to expect a return for they and by-the-way it be odd how many confidence have be repose in I since i have be down here keswick begin it then old brandon take up the strain after that mr candy 's ex-cashier tell I the story of she life and entrust I with the secret of she marriage with a man of wind -- that most useful mr null after that she aunt make I understand how much she hate mr null and how she would like I to find out something disreputable about he and then -- by george i forget the old negro woman in the cabin at this he put he hand in the side-pocket of he coat and draw out the pair of little blue shoe why in the name of common sense do the old hag give I these and why should she suppose that mr keswick intend I a harm the old lady never see or hear of I until yesterday and she manner certainly indicate no dislike of I but of course aunt patsy 's brain be crack and she do not know what she be talk about i shall keep the shoe however and if ever the venerable purple sun-bonnet run afoul of I i shall hold they up before it and see what happen and so very well satisfy with the result of he visit to hewlett 's he ride on to the green sulphur spring on the afternoon of the next day miss march receive a invitation from mr keswick to spend a few day with she and make the acquaintance of she niece who have recently return to the home of she childhood the letter for it be much more than a note of invitation be cordial and in part pathetic it dwelt upon the sundered pleasant relation of the two family and express the hope that mr brandon 's visit to she might be the beginning of a renewal of the old intimacy mr keswick take occasion to incidentally mention that the house would be particularly dull for she niece just now as junius be on the point of start for washington where he would be detain some week on business and she hope most earnestly that miss roberta would accept this invitation to make she acquaintance and that of she niece and she designate Thursday of the follow week as the day on which she would like she to come as may reasonably be suppose this letter greatly astonished miss march who carry it to she uncle and ask he to explain if he could what it mean the old gentleman be a good deal surprise when he read it but it delight he in a far greater degree he perceive in it the first fruit of he diplomacy mr keswick saw that it would be to she interest for a time at least to make friend with he and this be the way she take to do it she would not come to midbranch herself and bring the niece but she would have roberta come to she in the pathos and cordiality mr brandon believe not at all what the old hypocrite probably want be to enlist he grateful sympathy in that ridiculous divorce case but whatever she motive might be he would be very glad to have he niece go to she for if anything could make a impression upon that time-hardened and seasoned old chopping-block of a woman it be roberta 's personal influence if mr keswick should come to know roberta that knowledge would do more than anything else in the world to remove she objection to the marriage he so greatly desire he say nothing of all this to he niece but he most earnestly counsel she to accept the invitation and make a visit to the two lady of course roberta do not care to go but as she uncle appear to take the matter so much to heart she consent to gratify he and write a acceptance she find also when she have think more on the matter that she have a good deal of curiosity to see this mr keswick of whom she have hear so much and who have have such a important influence on she life chapter xv on the afternoon of the day on which mr keswick 's letter arrive at midbranch peggy have great news to communicate to aunt judy the cook : miss rob 's gwine to mah ' junius ' house in de kerridge a ' i 's gwine ` long wid she to set in front wid sam mah '

in the house and a monthly ghost on the gate-post outside the keswick residence do not appear as attractive to peggy as it have do before but she mentally determine that while she be there she would be very careful to look put sharp for herself a performance for which she be very well adapt it be on a pleasant autumn morning that mr brandon very carefully ensconce he niece in the family carriage with peggy and a trusty negro man sam on the outside front seat i would gladly go with you my dear he say even without the formality of a invitation but it be far better for you to go by yourself my very presence would provoke a antagonism in the old lady while with you personally it be impossible that any such feeling should exist i hope you visit may do away with all ill feeling between we family i want you to understand uncle say miss roberta that i be make this visit almost entirely to please you and i shall do everything in my power to make mr keswick feel that you and i be perfectly well disposed toward she but you can not expect I to exhibit any great warmth of friendship toward a person who once use such remarkable and violent expression in regard to I but those feeling my dear say mr brandon if we be to believe mr keswick 's letter have entirely disappear it be quite natural that they should do so say roberta as there be no longer any reason for they and there be another thing i want to impress on you mind uncle robert you must expect no result from this visit except a renewal of amity between yourself and mr keswick i understand it perfectly say the old gentleman feeling quite confident that if he family and mr keswick should once again become friendly the main object of he desire would not be difficult of accomplishment and now my dear i will not detain you any longer i hope you may have a very pleasant visit and i advise you to cultivate that young mr null whom i take to be a very sensible and charming person and then he kiss she good-bye and shut the carriage door it be about the middle of the afternoon when sam drive through the outer keswick gate and peggy who have jump down to open say gate have make herself positively sure that at present there be no ghost sit upon the post before she reach the house roberta begin to wonder a good deal if she should find mr keswick the woman she have picture in she mind but when the carriage draw up in front of the porch there come out to meet she not the mistress of the estate but a much younger lady who trip down the step and reach roberta as she descend from the carriage we be very glad to see you miss march she say my aunt be not here just now but will be back directly this be mrs null be not it say roberta and as the other smile and answer with a slight flush that it be roberta stoop just the little that be necessary and kiss she mr keswick 's niece have not expect so warm a greet from this lady to whom she be almost a stranger and instantly she say to herself : in that kiss freddy die to you for some day she have be turn over and over in she mind the question whether or not she should tell roberta march that she be not mrs null she greatly dislike keep up the deception where it be not necessary and with roberta if she would keep the secret there be no need of this aerial matrimony besides she natural desire to confide in a person of she own sex and age she do not wish mr croft to be the only one who share she secret and so she have determine that she decision would depend on what sort of girl roberta prove to be if i like she i 'll tell she if i do not i will not be the final decision and when roberta march look down upon she with she beautiful eye and kiss she freddy null depart this life so far as those two be concerned mr keswick have apparently make a very great miscalculation in regard to the probable time of arrival of she guest for miss march and peggy and even sam and the horse have be properly receive and care for and miss march have be sit in the parlor for some time and still the old lady do not come into the house she niece have grow very anxious about this absence and have begin to fear that she aunt have treat miss march as she have treat she on she arrival and have go away to stay but plez whom she have send to tell he mistress that she visitor be in the house return with the information that ole miss be in one of the lower field direct some man who be digging a ditch and that she would return to the house in a very short time thus assure that no permanent absence be intend she go into the parlor to entertain miss march and to explain as well as she could the state of affair when as she enter the door she see that lady suddenly arise and look steadfastly out of the window can that be mr croft miss march exclaim the younger girl make a dash forward and also look out of the window yes there be mr croft ride across the yard toward the tree where horse be commonly tie do you expect he ask roberta quickly no more than i expect the man in the moon be the impulsive and honest answer of she companion i be very glad to see you mrs null say lawrence when that lady meet he on the porch and when he be show into the parlor he greet miss march with much cordiality but no surprise but when he inquire after other member of the family he be much surprised to find that mr keswick have go to washington be not this very unexpected mr null he ask why no she answer junius tell we almost as soon as he come here that he would have to be in washington by the first of this week mr croft do not pursue this subject further but presently remark : be you and i the first comer miss march roberta look from one of she companion to the other and remark : i do not understand you lawrence now perceive that he be tread a very uncertain and perhaps dangerous path of conversation and the sooner he get out of it the better but before he could decide what answer to make a silent and stealthy figure appear at the door beckon and nod in a very mysterious way this prove to be the plump black maid letty who have attract the attention of the company whisper loudly miss annie whereupon that young lady immediately leave the room what other comer do you expect then ask roberta of mr croft i certainly suppose there would be a small company here he say probably neighborhood people but if i be mistake of course i do not wish to say anything more about it to the family be you invite yourself ask roberta croft wish very much that he could say that he have accidentally drop in but this he could not do and he answer that mr keswick ask he to come about this time he do not consider it necessary to add that she have write to he at the spring renew she invitation very earnestly and mention that miss march have consent to make one of the party this be as far as roberta see fit to continue the subject on the present occasion and she begin to talk about the charming weather and the pretty way in which the foliage be redden on the side of a hill opposite the window mr croft be delighted to enter into this new channel of speech and discuss with considerable fervor the attractiveness of autumn in virginium miss annie find letty in a very disturbed state of mind the dinner have be postpone until the arrival of miss march and now it have be still further delay by the non-arrival of the mistress of the house and everything be become dry up and unfit to eat this will never do exclaimed miss annie i will go myself and look for aunt she must have forget the time of day and everything else put on she hat she run out of the back door but she do not have to go very far for she find the old lady in the garden earnestly regard a bed of turnip where have you be my dear aunt cry the girl miss march have be here ever so long and mr croft have come and dinner have be wait until it have all dry up i be afraid that you have forget that company be come to-day forget say the old lady glare at the turnip it be not a easy thing to forget i invite the girl and i expect she to come but i tell you annie when i see that carriage come along the road all the old feeling come back to I i remember what its owner have do to I and mine and what they be still try to do and i feel i could not go into the house and give she my hand it would be like take hold of a snake a snake cry she niece with much warmth she be a lovely woman and she coming show what kindly feeling she have for you but no matter what you think about it aunt you have ask she here and you must come in and see she dinner be wait and i do not know what more to say about you absence go in and have dinner say mr keswick do not wait for I i 'll come in and see she after a while but i have not yet get to the point of sit down to the table and eating with she oh aunt exclaim annie you ought never to have ask she if you be go to treat she in this way and what be i to say to she what excuse be i to make be you not sick be not something the matter with you you can tell they i be flustrate say the old lady and that be all that be the matter with I but i be not come in to dinner and there be no use of say anything more about it annie look at she the tear of mortification still stand in she eye i suppose i must go and do the best i can she say but aunt please tell I one thing do you invite any other people here mr croft speak as if he expect to see other visitor and if they ask anything more about it i do not know what to say the only other people i invite say the old lady with a grim grin be the king of norway and the prime minister of spain and neither of they could come annie say no more but hurry back to the house she order dinner to be serve immediately at first the meal be not a very lively one the young hostess _ pro tempore _ explain the absence of the mistress of the house by state that she have have a nervous attack -- which be quite true -- and that she beg they to excuse she until after dinner the two guest express they regret at this unfortunate indisposition but each feel a degree of embarrassment at the absence of mr keswick roberta who have hear many story of the old woman guess at the true reason and if the distance have not be so great she would have go home that afternoon lawrence croft of course could imagine no reason for the old lady 's absence except the one that have be give they but he suspect that there must be some other he do he best however to make pleasant conversation and roberta who begin to have a tender feeling for the little lady at the head of the table who she could easily see have be place in a unpleasant position second he effort with such effect that when the little party have conclude they dinner with a course of hot pound cake and cream sauce they be chat together quite sociably in about ten minute after they have all go into the parlor miss annie excuse herself and presently return with a message to miss march that mr keswick would be very glad to see she in another room this be a very natural message from a elderly lady who be not well but roberta arise and walk out of the parlor with a feeling as if she be about to enter the cage of a erratic tigress but she meet with no such creature she see in the back room into which she be usher a small old woman dress very plainly who come forward to meet she extend both hand into one of which roberta place one of she own i may as well say at once roberta march say mr keswick that the reason i do not come to meet you when you first arrive be that i could not get over all of a sudden the feeling i have have against you family for so many year why then mr keswick say roberta very coldly do you ask I to come because i want you to come say mr keswick and because i think i be stronger than i turn out to be but you must make allowance for the stiffness which get into old people 's disposition as well as they back i want you to understand however that i mean all i say in that letter and i be very glad to see you if anything in my conduct have seem to you out of the way you must set it down to the fact that i be make a very sudden turn and start out on a new track in which i hope we shall all keep for the rest of we life roberta could not help think that the sudden turn in the new track begin with the visit of she uncle to this house and that the old lady need not have inflict upon she the disagreeable necessity of witness a hostess take a very repulsive cold plunge but all she say be that she hope the family would now live together in friendly relation and that she be sure that if this be to be it would give she uncle a great deal of pleasure she very much want to ask mr keswick how mr croft happen to be here at this time but she feel that she very brief acquaintance with the lady would not warrant the discussion of a subject like that she be very much the kind of woman i think she be say roberta to herself when after some further hospitable remark from mr keswick the two go to the parlor together to find mr croft but that gentleman have be desert by all the lady be walk up and down the greensward in front of the house smoking a cigar mr keswick go out to he and greet he very cordially beg he to excuse she for not be able to see he as soon as he come lawrence set all this aside in he politest manner but declare himself very much disappoint in not see mr keswick and also remark that from what she have say to he on he last visit he have expect to find quite a little party here i be sorry say the old lady that junius be away for he would be very glad to see you and it never come into my mind to mention to you that he be oblige to be in washington at this time and as for the party i think afterwards that it would be a great deal cosier just to have a few person here oh yes say lawrence most certainly a great deal cosier mr keswick eat supper with she guest and behave very well during the evening she sustain the main part of the conversation give the company a great many anecdote and reminiscence of old time and old family relate they in a odd and peculiar way that be very interesting especially to croft to whom the subject matter be quite new but although she three companion listen to the old lady with deferential attention intersperse with appropriate observation each one make she the object of severe mental scrutiny and endeavor to discover the present object of she scheming old mind roberta be quite sure that she invitation and that of mr croft be a piece of artful management on the part of the old lady and imagine though she be not quite sure about it that it be intend as a bit of match-making to get she marry to somebody else would be of course the best possible method of prevent she marry junius and this she have reason to believe be the prime object of old mr keswick 's existence but why should mr croft be choose as the man with whom she be to be throw she have learn that the old lady have see he before but be quite certain that she acquaintance with he be slight could junius have tell he aunt about the friendship between herself and mr croft it be not like he but a great many unlikely thing take place as for lawrence he know very well there be a trick beneath he invitation but he could not at all make out why it have be play he have be give a admirable opportunity of offer himself to miss march but there be no reason apparent to he why this should have be do miss annie watch she aunt very carefully and speak but seldom quite promptly make up she mind in regard to the matter she know very well the bitter opposition of the old woman to a marriage between junius and miss march and see as plainly as she see the lamp on the table that roberta have be bring here on purpose to be sacrifice to mr croft everything have be make ready the altar clear and as well as the old lady 's grindstone would act the knife sharpen but say miss annie to herself she need not suppose that i be go to sit quiet and see all this go on with junius away off there in washington know nothing about any of it miss roberta retire quite early to she room have be fatigue by she long drive and she be just about to put out she light when she hear a little knock at the door open it slightly she see there junius keswick 's cousin who also appear quite ready for bed may i come in for a minute say annie certainly reply miss march admit she and close the door after she i have something to tell you say the younger lady admire as she speak the length of she companion 's braided hair i intend to keep it until to-morrow but since i come up stair i feel i could not let you sleep a night under the same roof with I without know it i be not mrs null what exclaim roberta in a tone which make annie lift up she hand and implore she not to speak so loud for fear that she aunt should hear she i know she have not come up stair yet for she sit up dreadfully late but she can hear thing almost anywhere no i be not mr null there be no such person as mr null or at least he be a mere gaseous myth whom i marry for the sake of the protection he name give I this be the most extraordinary thing i ever hear say roberta you must tell I all about it i do not want to keep you up say annie you must be tired i be not tire say roberta for every particle of fatigue have fly away and with this she make annie sit down beside she on the lounge now you must tell I what this mean she say can it be that you aunt do not know about it indeed she do not say annie i married freddy null in new york for reason which we need not talk of now for that matter be all past and go but when i come here i find almost immediately that he would be more necessary to I in this house than anywhere else i can not imagine say roberta why a gaseous husband should be necessary to you here it be not a very easy thing to explain say the other that be it be easy enough but -- oh say roberta catch the reason of she companion 's hesitation i do not think you ought to object to tell I you reason do it relate to you cousin junius well say annie not altogether and not so much to he as to my aunt i think i see say roberta a marriage between you two would suit she very well be you afraid that she would try to force he on you oh no say annie that would be bad enough but it would not be so embarrassing and so dreadfully unpleasant as force I on he and that be what aunt want to do and you can easily see that in that case i could not stay in this house at all i scarcely know my cousin as a man my strongest recollection of he be that of a big and very nice boy who use to climb up in the apple-tree to get I apple and then come down to the very lowest branch where he could drop the ripest one right into my apron and not bruise they but even if i have be acquaint with he all these year and like he ever so much i could not stay here and have aunt make he take I whether he want to or not and unless you know my aunt very well you could not conceive how unscrupulously straightforward she be in carry out she plan and so say roberta you have quite baffle she by this little ruse of a marriage not altogether say annie with a smile for she vow she be go to get I divorce from mr null that be funnier than the rest of it say roberta laughing and they both laugh together but in a subdue way so as not to attract the attention of the old lady below stair and now you see say annie why i must be mrs null while i stay here and you will promise I that you will never tell any one you may be sure i shall keep you queer secret but have you not tell it to any one but I yes say annie but i have only tell it to one other mr croft but please do not speak of it to he mr croft exclaim roberta how in the world do you come to tell he do you know he so well as that well say annie it do seem out of the way i admit that i should tell he but i can not give you the whole story of how i come to do it it would not interest you -- at least it would but i ought not to tell it it be a twisty sort of thing twisty say roberta drawing herself up and a little away from she companion annie look up and catch the glance by which this word be accompany and the tone in which it be speak go straight to she soul now say she if you be go to look at I and speak in that way i 'll tell you every bit of it and she do tell the whole story from she first meeting with mr croft in the information shop down to the present moment what be you name anyway say roberta when the story have be tell my name say the other be annie peyton and now do you know annie peyton say roberta pass she finger gently among the short light-brown curl on she companion 's forehead that i think you must have a very very kindly recollection of the boy who use to come down to the lowest branch of the tree to drop apple into you apron chapter xvi shortly after peggy arrive with she mistress at the keswick residence she mind begin to be a good deal disturbed she have be surprise when the carriage draw up to the door that mah ' junius have not rush down to meet he intended bride and when she find he be not in the house and have indeed go away from home she do not at all know what to make of it if miss rob take the trouble to travel all the way to the home of the man that the midbranch people have decide she should marry it be a very wonderful thing indeed that he should not be there to meet she and while these thought be turn themselves over in the mind of this meditative girl of color and the outgoing look in she eye be extend itself farther and farther as if in search of some solution of the mystery up ride mr croft dar _ he _ exclaim peggy as she stand at the corner of the house where she have be pursue she meditation he she continue in a voice that would have be quite audible to any one standing near upon my libin ' soul wot brung he h ` yar miss rob don ' wan ' he round nohow i do druv he off wunst upon my libin ' soul he be do brung he bag behin ' he on de saddle a ' i reckon he be gwine to stay as mr croft dismount and go into the house peggy glower at he sundry expression sound very much like odds and end of imprecation which she have pick up in the course of a short but investigative existence gurgle from she lip i wish dat ole miss keswick kunjer he ef she know how miss rob hate he she curl he leg up a ' gib he mis ` ry spranglin ' down he back the hope of see this intruder well kunjer by the old lady be the only thing that give a promise of peace to the mind of peggy and though she nature be by no mean a social one she determine to make the acquaintance of some one or other in the house hope to find out how mr keswick conduct she conjuration at what time of day or night they be generally put into operation and how person could be bring under they influence the breakfast hour in the keswick house be a variable one sometimes the mistress of the establishment rise early and want she morning meal before she go out of door at other time she would go off to some distant point on the farm to see about something that be do or ought to be do and breakfast would be keep wait for she the delay however be not all due to the old lady 's irregular habit very often letty would come up stair with the information that the bread be not riz and as a virginium breakfast without hot bread would be a impossibility the meal would be postpone until the bread do conclude to rise or until some substitute such as beaten biscuit have be provide on the morning after he arrival lawrence croft come down stair about eight o'clock and find the lower part of the house desert and glance into the dining-room as he pass its open door he see no sign of breakfast the house be cool but the sun appear to be shine warmly outside and he step out of the open back door into a small flower garden with a series of broad board down the walk which lay along the middle of it up and down this board walk lawrence stride breathe the fresh air and think over matter he be not at all satisfied at be here during keswick 's absence feeling that he be enjoy a advantage which although it be quite honorable do not appear so what he have to do be to get a interview with miss march as soon as possible and have that matter over when he have be definitely accept or reject he would go away and whatever the result might be he would write to he rival as soon as he return to the spring and inform he of it and would also explain how he have happen to be here with miss march while he be engage in plan these honorable intention there come from the house mr keswick 's niece with a basket in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other and she immediately apply herself to cut some geranium and chrysanthemum which be about the last flower leave bloom at that season in the garden good morning say croft from the other end of the walk i be glad to see you out so early good morning she reply with a look which indicate that she be not at all glad to see he but i do not think it be early croft have notice on the precede day that she coolness towards he still continue but it do not suit he to let she know that he perceive it he go up to she and in a very friendly way remark : there be something i wish very much you would tell I what be you name it be very odd that during all the time i have be acquaint with you i have never know you name you must have take a immense interest in it she say as she snip some dry leave off a twig of geranium she have cut it be not that i do not take any interest say croft but at first you name never come forward and i soon begin to know you by the title which you remarkable condition of wedlock give you and that be the name say the lady very decidedly by which i be to be know in this house i be very proud of my maiden name but i be not go to tell it to you for fear that some time you will use it oh ejaculate mr croft then i suppose i be to continue even to think of you as mr null you need not think of I at all say she but when you speak to I i most certainly expect you to use that name it be only by a sort of accident that you come to know it be not my name i do not consider it a accident at all say croft i look upon it as a piece of very kindly confidence miss annie give a little twist to she mouth which seem to indicate that if she speak she should express she contempt of such a opinion and croft continue : i be very sorry that upon that occasion i should have feel myself oblige to refuse you request that i should make you acquaint with my reason for desire to know mr keswick 's whereabouts but i be sure if you understand the matter you would not be in the least degree -- oh you need not trouble yourself about that she interrupt i do not want you to tell I anything at all it be quite easy now to see why you wish to know where my cousin be it be impossible that you should know exclaimed croft we will say no more about it reply annie i be quite satisfied i would give a good deal say lawrence after look steadily at she for a few moment to know what you really do think annie have cut all the flower she want or rather all she could get and she now stand up and look she companion full in the face mr croft she say it have be necessary and it be necessary now for I to have some concealment and i be sorry for it but it be not at all necessary for I to conceal my opinion of you reason for want to know about junius you be really in pursuit of miss march and know that he be in love with she you want to make sure that when you go to she he would not be there it be my firm opinion that be all there be about it and the fact of you turn up here just after my cousin leave prove it miss annie exclaim croft -- i have hear you call by that name and i vow i will not call you mrs null when there be no need for it -- you be never more mistaken in you life and i be very sorry that you should have such a low opinion of I as to think i would wish to take advantage of you cousin during he absence then why do you do it ask miss annie with a little upward pitch of she chin at this moment the breakfast-bell ring and mr keswick appear in the back door evidently somewhat surprised to see these two converse in the garden i be very much vex say lawrence as he follow he companion who have suddenly turn towards the house that you should think of I in this way but to this remark miss annie have no opportunity to reply after breakfast mr keswick prove the truth of what she niece have say about she unscrupulous straightforwardness when carry out she project she have invite mr croft and miss march to she house in order that the former might have the opportunity which she have discover he want and could not get of offer himself in marriage to the lady and she now make it she business to see that mr croft 's opportunity should stand up very clear and definite before he and that all interfere circumstance should be carefully remove she inform she niece that she wish she to go with she to a thicket on the other side of the wheat field which that young lady have advise should be plough for pickle to look for a turkey-hen which she have reason to believe have be ridiculous enough to hatch out a brood of young at this improper season annie demur for she do not want to go to look for turkey nor do she want to give mr croft any opportunity but the old lady insist and carry she off croft feel that there be something very bare and raw-boned about the position in which he be leave with miss march and he think that lady might readily suppose that mr keswick 's object be to leave they together he imagine that himself though why she should be so kind to he he could not feel quite certain however he path lay straight before he and if the old lady have whitewash it to make it more distinct he do not intend to refuse to walk in it i have be look at that hill over yonder say he with a cluster of pine tree on the brow of it i should think there would be a fine view from that hill would you not like to walk up there lawrence feel that this proposition be quite in keep with the bareness of the previous proceedings but he do not wish to stay in the house and be subject to the unexpected return of the old lady and she niece certainly say miss march nothing would please I better and so they walk up pine top hill when they reach this elevated position they sit down on the rock on which mr null have once converse with freddy and admire the view which be indeed a very fine one after about five minute of this which lawrence think be quite enough he turn to he companion and say : miss march i do not wish you to suppose that i bring you up here for the purpose of view those roll hill and distant forest you do not exclaim roberta in a tone of surprise no say he i bring you here because it be a place where i could speak freely to you and tell you i love you that be not at all necessary say miss march we have the lower floor of the house entirely to ourselves and i be sure that mr keswick would not have return until you have wave a handkerchief or give some signal from the back of the house that it be all over croft look at she with a troubled expression miss march say he do you not think i be in earnest do you not believe what i have say i have not the slightest doubt you be in earnest she answer the magnitude of the preparation prove it i be glad you say that for it give I the opportunity for make a explanation say lawrence we meeting at this place may be a carefully contrived stratagem but it be not contrived by I i be very well aware that mr keswick also wish to marry you -- do you see that in the richmond _ dispatch _ or in one of the new york papers interrupted miss march that be a point say lawrence overlook the ridicule which we need not discuss i be perfectly aware that mr keswick be my rival but i wish you to understand that i be not voluntarily take any undue advantage of he absence i believe he to be a very fair and generous man and i would wish to be as open and generous as he be when i come i expect to find he here and stand on equal ground with he i intend to ask you to accept my love well then say roberta would it not be more fair and generous for you to go away now and postpone this proposal until some time when you would each have a equal chance no it would not say lawrence vehemently i have now a opportunity of tell you that i love you ardently passionately and nothing shall cause I to postpone it will you not consider what i say will you make no answer to this declaration of most true and honest love i be consider what you have say she answer and i be very glad to hear that you do not know of this cunning little trap that mr keswick have lay for I it be all very plain to I but i do not know why she should have select you as one of the actor in the plot have you ever tell she that you be a suitor for my hand never exclaim lawrence she may have imagine it for she hear i be a frequent visitor to midbranch but let we set all that aside i be on fire with love for you will you tell I that you can return that love or that i must give up all hope this be the most important question of my whole life i beg you from the bottom of my heart to decide it mr croft say she when you use to come nearly every day to see I at midbranch and we take those long walk in the wood you never talk in this way i consider you as a gentleman whose prudence and good sense would not allow he to step outside of the path of perfectly conventional social intercourse this be not conventional and not prudent i love you then and i love you now exclaim lawrence you must have know that i love you for my declaration do not in the least surprise you once -- it be the last time you visit midbranch -- i suspect just a little that you mind might be affect somewhat in the way you speak of but i suppose that attack of weakness have pass away i know what you mean say lawrence but i can not endure to talk of such trifle i love you roberta -- miss march she interrupt and i want you to tell I if you love I in return miss march rise from the rock where she have be sit and she companion rise with she after a moment 's silence during which he watch she with intense eagerness she say : mr croft i be go to give you you choice would you prefer be refuse under a cherry tree or under a sycamore there be a little smile on she lip as she say this which lawrence could not interpret i decline be refuse under any tree he say with vehemence i prefer the cherry tree say she there be a very pretty one over there on the ridge of this hill and its leaf be nearly all go which would make it quite appropriate -- but what be the meaning of this there come peggy it be not possible that she think it be time for I to give out something to aunt judy croft turn and there be the wooden peggy march steadily up the hill and almost upon they what do you want peggy asked miss roberta dar 's a man down to de house dat want he point to mr croft lawrence be very much surprise a man who want I he exclaim you must be mistaken no sah reply peggy you be de one for a moment lawrence hesitate he disposition be to let any man in the world be he president or king wait until he have settle this matter with miss march but with peggy present it be impossible to go on with the love-making he might indeed send she back with a message but the thought come to he that it would be well to postpone for a little the press of he suit for the lady be certainly in a very untoward humor and he be not altogether sorry to have a excuse for break off the interview at this point he have not yet be discard and he would like to think over the matter and see if he could discover any reason for the very disrespectful manner to say the least of it with which miss march have receive he amatory advance i suppose i must go and see the man he say though i can not imagine who it can possibly be will you return to the house no say miss roberta i will stay here a little longer and enjoy the view chapter xvii as lawrence croft walk down pine top hill he mind be in a good deal of a hubbub the mind of almost any lover would be stir up if he come fresh from a interview in which he lady have pin he to use a cruel figure in various place on the wall to see how he would spin and buzz in different light but the disdainful pin have not yet go through a vital part of lawrence 's hope and they have strength to spin and buzz a good deal yet as soon as he should have a opportunity he would rack he brain to find out what it be that have put roberta march into such a strange humor no one who simply desire to decline the address of a gentleman would treat she lover as miss march have treat he it be quite evident that she wish to punish he but what have be he crime but the immediate business on he hand be to go and see what man it be who wish to see he ordinarily the fact that a man have call upon he would not be consider by lawrence a matter for cogitation but as he walk toward the house it seem to he very odd that any one should call upon he in such a out-of-the-way place as this where so few people know he to be he be not a business man but a large portion of he fund be invest in a business concern and it might be that something have go wrong and that a message have be send he he address at the green sulphur spring be know and the man in charge there know that he be visit mr keswick these consideration make he a little anxious and help to keep he mind in the hubbub which have be mention when he reach the front of the house lawrence see a lean gray horse tie to a tree and a man sit upon the porch and as soon as he make he appearance the latter come down the step to meet he i do not go into the house sir he say because i think you would just as lief have a talk outside what be you business ask croft the man move a few step farther from the house and lawrence follow he be it anything secret you have to tell I he ask well yes sir i should think it be reply the other a tall man with sandy hair and beard and dress in a checkered business suit which have lose a good deal of the freshness of its early youth i may as well tell you at once who i be i be a anti-detective never hear of that sort of person i suppose never say lawrence curtly well sir the organization which i belong to be one which be fill a long feel want you know very well sir that this country be full of detective officer not only those who belong to a regular police force but lot of private one who if anybody will pay they for it will go to jericho to hunt a man up now sir we object be to protect society against these people when we get information that a man be go to be hound down by any of these detective -- and we have private way of know these thing -- we just go to that man and if he be willing to become one of we client we take he into we charge and we business after that be to keep he inform of just what be be do against he he can stay at home in comfort with he wife settle up he account and do what he like and the day before he be to be swoop down on he get notice from we and comfortably go to chicago or jacksonville where he can take he ease until we post he of the next move of the enemy if he want to take extra precaution and write a letter to anybody in the place where he live date from london or hong kong and send that letter under cover to we we 'll see that it be mail from the place it be date from and that it get into the hand of the detective there have be case where a gentleman have have six month or a year of perfect comfort by the detective be throw off by a letter like this that be only one of the way in which we help and protect person in difficulty who if it be not for we would be drag off hand-cuffed from the bosom of they family and who even if they never get convict would have to pay a lot of money to get out of the scrape now i have put myself a good deal out of the way sir to come to you and offer you we assistance I exclaim croft what be you talk about the man smile of course it be all right to know nothing about it and it be just what we would advise but i assure you we be thoroughly post in you affair and to let you know that we be i 'll just mention that the case be that of croft after keswick through candy stuff and nonsense exclaim lawrence get red in the face there be no such case he be about to say more when a few word from the anti-detective stop he suddenly look here mr keswick say the man level a long fore-finger at he and speak very earnestly do not you go and flatter yourself that this thing have be drop because you have not hear of it for a month or two and if you 'll take my advice you 'll make up you mind on the spot either to let thing go on and be nab or to put yourself under we protection and live in entire safety until this thing have blow over without any trouble except a little travel at the mention of keswick 's name lawrence have see through the whole affair at a single mental glance the man be after junius keswick and he business be to lawrence more startling and repugnant than it could possibly be to any one else it be necessary to be very careful if he immediately avow who he be the man might yet find keswick before warn and explanation could be get to he and not only put that gentleman in a very unpleasant state of mind but do a lot of mischief besides he do not believe that mr candy have recommence he investigation without consultation with he but this person evidently know that such a investigation have be set on foot and that would be sufficient for he purpose lawrence decide to be very wary and he say to the man do you ask for I here by name no _ sir _ say the other i have information that you be here and that you be the only gentleman who live here and although you be in you own home i do not know but this be one of those case in which name be drop and servant change to suit a emergency i ask the little darkey i see at the front of the house if she live here and she tell I she have only just come that put I on my guard and so i merely ask if the gentleman be in and she go and get you we be very careful about call name and you need not be afraid that any of we people will ever give you away on that line lawrence reflect for a moment and then he say : what be you term and arrangement for carry on a affair of this kind they be very simple and moderate say the man take a wallet from he pocket there be one of we print slip which we show but do not give away to become a client all you have to do be to send fifteen dollar to the office or to pay it to I if you think no time should be lose that will entitle you to protection for a year after that we make the nominal charge of five dollar for each letter send you give you information of what be go on against you for extra service such as mail letter from distant point of course there will be extra charge lawrence glance over the print slip which contain information very similar to that the man have give he and as he do so he come to the conclusion that there would be nothing dishonest in allow the fellow to continue in he mistake and to endeavor to find out what mischief be about to be do in he lawrence 's name and under he apparent authority i will become a subscriber say he take out he pocket-book and request that you give I all the information you possess here and immediately that be the best thing to do say the man take the money for in my opinion no time be to be lose i 'll give you a receipt for this do not trouble yourself about that say lawrence let I have you information you be very right say the man it be a great deal better not to have you name on anything and now for the point candy who have charge of croft 's job be go more into the detective business than he use to be and we have information that he have lately take up you affair in good solid earnest he find out that croft have put somebody else on you track without regularly take the business out of he hand and this make he mad and i do not wonder at it for croft as i understand have plenty of money and if he conclude to throw candy over he ought to have do it fair and square and pay he something handsome in consideration for have take the job away but he do not do anything of the kind and candy consider himself still in he employment and vow he be go to get hold of you before the other party do so you see you have get two set of detective after you and they 'll be mighty sharp for the first one that get you will make the money where be candy 's detective now ask lawrence that i can not tell you positively as i be so far from we new york office to which all information come but now that you be a subscriber i 'll communicate with head-quarter and the necessary point will be immediately send to you by telegraph if necessary all that you have to do be to stay here until you hear from we from the way you speak just now say lawrence i suppose the detective would be here to-day or to-morrow oh no say the other candy have not the facility for find people that we have but it take some time for I to communicate with head-quarter and for you to hear from there and so as i say before there be not a hour to be lose but you be all right now i expect you to give I more definite information than this say lawrence but now i suppose i must wait until i hear from new york at five dollar a message my business be to enlist subscriber say the other you could not expect I to tell you anything definite when i be in a out-of-the-way place like this do you come down to virginia on purpose to find I ask lawrence no say the man i be on my way to mobile and i only lose one train by stop here to attend to you business how do you know i be here ah say the anti-detective with a smile as i tell you we have facility i know you be at this house and i come here straight as a die it be truly wonderful say lawrence how accurate you information be and now i will tell you something you can have grati you have make one of the most stupid blunder that i ever hear of mr keswick go away from here nearly a week ago and i be the mr croft whom you suppose to be in pursuit of he the man start and give vent to a unpleasant ejaculation to prove it say lawrence there be my card and put he hand into he pocket here be several letter address to I and i want to let you know that i be not in pursuit of mr keswick that he and i be very good friend and that i have frequently see he of late and so you can just drop this business at once and as for candy he have no right to take a single step for which i have not authorize he i merely employ he to get mr keswick 's address which i wish for a very friendly motive i shall write to candy at once the man 's face be not a agreeable study he look angry he look baffle and yet he look incredulous now come say he if you be not keswick what do you pay I that money for i pay it to you say lawrence because i want to find out what dirty business you be do in my name i have have the worth of my money and you can now go the man do not go but stand gaze at lawrence in a very peculiar way if mr keswick be not here he say i believe you be here wait for he and i be go to stay and warn he people do not set private detective on other man 's track just for friendly motive lawrence 's face flush and he make a step forward but suddenly check himself he look at the man for a moment and then say : i suppose you want I to understand that if i become one of you subscriber in my own name you will be willing to withhold the information you intend to give mr keswick well say the man relapse into he former confidential tone business be business if i could see mr keswick i do not know whether he would employ I or not i have no reason to work for one person more than another and of course if one man come to I and another do not i be bind to work for the man who come that be business you have say quite enough say lawrence now leave this place instantly no i will not say the man shut he mouth very tightly as he draw himself up and fold he arm on he chest lawrence be young well-made and strong but the other man be taller heavier and perhaps stronger to engage in a personal contest to compel a fellow like this to depart would be a very unpleasant thing for lawrence to do even if he succeed he be a visitor here the lady would probably be witness of the conflict and although the natural impulse of he heart predominant over everything else at that moment prompt he to spring upon the impudent fellow and endeavor to thrash he still he instinct as a gentleman forbid he to enter into such a contest which would probably have no good effect no matter how it result never before do he feel the weakness of the moral power of a just cause when oppose to brutal obstinacy still he do not retreat from he position do you hear what i say he cry leave this place you be not master here say the other still preserve he defiant attitude and you have no right to order I away i be not go despite he inferiority in size despite he gentlemanly instinct and despite he prudent desire not to make a exhibition of himself before miss march and the household it be probable that lawrence 's anger would have assume some form of physical manifestation have not mrs keswick appear suddenly on the porch it be quite evident to she from the aspect of the two man that something be wrong and she call out : who be that that madam say lawrence step a little back be a very impertinent man who have no business here and whom i have order off the place and as he have refuse to go i propose -- stop cry the old lady and turn she rush into the house before either of the man could recover from they surprise at she sudden action she reappear upon the porch carry a double-barreled gun take she position on the top of the flight of step with a quick movement of she thumb she cock both barrel then draw herself up and rest firmly on she right leg with the left advanced she raise the gun she right elbow well against she side and with she extended left arm as steady as one of the beam of the roof above she she hook she forefinger around one of the trigger she eagle eye glance along the barrel straight at the head of the anti-detective and in a clarion voice she sing out go the man stare at she he see the open muzzle of the gun barrel beyond they he see the bright top of the two percussion cap and still beyond they he see the bright and determine eye that be take sight along the barrel all this he take in at a glance and without word or comment he make a quick dodge of he head jump to one side make a dash for he horse and untie the bridle with a jerk he mount and gallop out of the open gate turn as he do so to find himself still cover by the muzzle of that gun when he have nearly reach the outer gate and feel himself out of range he turn in he saddle and look back at lawrence who be still stand where he have leave he he violently shake he fist in the air which mean say lawrence to himself that he intend to make trouble with keswick that settle he say the old lady with a grim smile as she lower the muzzle of the gun and gently let down the hammer madam say lawrence advance toward she may i ask if that gun be load i should say so reply the old lady in each barrel be two thimbleful of powder and half-a-box of windfall 's teaberry tonic pill each one of they as big and as hard as a buckshot they be bring here by a travel agent who sell some of they to my people and i tell you sir that those pill make they so sick that one man be not able to work for two day and another for three i vow if that agent ever come back i would shoot he abominable pill into he and i have keep the gun load for the purpose be this a pill man i scarcely think he be a fertilizer because it be rather late in the season for those bandit he be a man say lawrence come up the step who belong to a class much worse than those you have mention he be what be call a blackmailer be that so cry the old lady she eye flash as she bring the butt of the gun heavily upon the porch floor i be very glad i do not know it very glad indeed for i might have be tempt to give he what belong to another without wait for he to disobey my order to go i be very much troubled sir that this annoyance should have happen to you in my house pray do not allow it to interfere with the enjoyment of you visit here which i hope may continue as long as you can make it convenient the word and manner convinced lawrence that that they do not merely indicate a conventional hospitality the old lady mean what she say she want he to stay that morning he have become convinced that he have be invite there because mr keswick wish he to marry miss march and she have do this not out of any kind feeling toward he because that would be impossible consider the shortness of they acquaintance but because she be oppose to she nephew 's marriage with miss march and because he lawrence be the only available person who could be bring forward to supplant he but whatever she motive be think lawrence she invitation come in admirably for I and i hope i shall get the proper advantage from it shortly after this lawrence sit in the parlor by himself write a letter it be to junius keswick and in it he relate the fact of he search for he in new york and the reason why he desire to make he acquaintance he conceal nothing but the fact that keswick 's cousin have have anything to do with the affair if she want he to know that he think she can tell he herself it be not my business to make any revelation in that quarter he conclude the letter by inform mr keswick of the visit of the anti-detective and warn he against any attempt which that individual might make upon he pocket assure he that the man could tell he nothing in regard to the affair that he now do not know after dinner during which meal miss march appear in a very good humor and talk rather more than she have yet do in the bosom of that family lawrence have he horse saddle and ride to the railroad station about six mile distant where he post he letter and also send a telegram to mr junius keswick warn he to pay no attention to any man who might call upon he on business connect with croft and keswick and state that a explanatory letter have be send the anti-detective have leave on a train a hour before but lawrence feel certain that the telegram would reach keswick before the man could possibly get to he especially as the latter have probably not yet find out he intended victim 's address chapter xviii as lawrence croft ride back to mr keswick 's house after have post to he rival the fact in the case of croft after keswick he do not feel in a very happy or triumphant mood the visit of the anti-detective have compel he to write to keswick at a time when it be not at all desirable that he should make any disclosure whatever in regard to he love affair with miss march except that very important disclosure which he have make to the lady herself that morning of course there be no great danger that any intimation would reach miss march of mr croft 's rather eccentric search for he predecessor in the position which he wish to occupy in she affection but the matter be particularly unpleasant just now and lawrence wish to occupy he time here in business very different from that of send explanation to rival and ward off unfriendly entanglement threaten by a blackmailer it be absolutely necessary for he to find out what he have do to offend miss march offend that lady certainly be and he even feel that she be glad of the opportunity he declaration give she to inflict punishment upon he but still he do not despair when she have make he pay the penalty she think proper for whatever error he have commit she might be willing to listen to he he have not say anything to she in regard to he failure to make she the promise visit at midbranch for during the only time he have be alone with she here the subject of a immediate statement of he feeling toward she have wholly occupy he mind but it now occur to he that she have reason to feel aggrieved at he failure to keep he promise to she and she must have show that feeling for otherwise she most devoted friend mr junius keswick would never have make that rather remarkable visit to he at the green sulphur spring of course he would not allude to that visit nor to she wish to see he for she have send he no message nor do he know what object she have in desire a interview but it be quite possible that she might have take umbrage at he failure to come to she when expect and that this be the reason for she present treatment of he to this treatment lawrence might have take exception but now he do not wish to judge she in any way he only desire in regard to she be to possess she and therefore instead of condemn she for she unjust method of show she resentment he merely consider how he should set himself right with she cruel or kind just or unjust he want she and then as he slowly trot along the lonely and uneven road it suddenly flash upon he as if in mount a hill a far-reaching landscape hitherto unseen have in a moment spread itself out before he that perhaps miss march have divine the reason of he extremely discreet behavior toward she be it possible that she have see he motive and know the truth and that she resent the prudence and caution he have show in he intercourse with she if she have read the truth he feel that she have good reason for she resentment and lawrence do not trouble himself to consider if she have show too much of it or not he remember the story of the defeat general and feeling that so far he have be thoroughly defeat he determine to admit the fact and to sound a retreat from all the position he have hold but at the same time to make a bold dash into the enemy 's camp and if possible capture the commander-in-chief and the minister of war he would go to roberta tell she all that he have think and explain all that he have do there should be no bit of truth which she could have reason out which he would not plainly avow and set before she then he would declare to she that he love for she have become so great that rush over every barrier whether of prudence doubt or indecision it have carry he with it and lay he at she foot when he have come to this bold conclusion he cheer up he horse with a thump of he heel and canter rapidly over the rest of the road peggy have nothing else to do be stand by the yard gate when he come in sight and she watch he approach with feeling of surprise and disgust she have see he ride away and not consider the fact that he do not carry he valise with he she suppose he have take he final departure she have conceive a violent dislike to mr croft look upon he in the light of a interloper and a robber who have come to break up that expect marriage between master junius and miss rob which the servant at midbranch look forward to as necessary for the prosperity of the family and the preliminary stage of which she have take upon herself the responsibility of describe with so much minuteness of detail with the politeness natural to the southern negro she open the gate for the gentleman but as she close it behind he she cast after he a look of earnest malevolence ef dot ole miss keswick don ' kunjer you sah she say in a undertone i 's gwine to do it myse ' f so dar and she give she foot a stamp on the ground lawrence all ignorant of the malignant feeling he have excite in this to he very unimportant and uninteresting black girl tie he horse and go into the house as he pass the open door of the parlor he see a lady reading by a window in the farthest corner hang up he hat he enter hope that the reader whose form be partially conceal by the back of the large rock chair in which she be sit be miss march but it be not it be mrs keswick 's niece deeply engross by a large-paged novel she turn she head as he enter and say : good evening good evening miss annie say lawrence seat himself in a chair opposite she on the other side of the window mr croft say she lay she book on she lap and incline herself slightly toward he you have no right to call I miss annie and i wish you would not do it the servant in the south call lady by they first name whether they be marry or not but people would think it very strange if you should imitate they my name in this house be mrs null and i wish you would not forget it the trouble with I be say lawrence with a smile that i can not forget it be not mr null but of course if you desire it i will give you that name i tell you before how much i desire it say she and why when my aunt find out the exact state of this affair i shall wish to stay no longer in this house and i do not want my stay to come to a end at present i be very happy here with the only relative i have in the world who be ever so much nicer people than i suppose they be and you have no right to come here and drive I away my dear young lady say croft i would not do such a thing for the world i admit that i be very sorry that it be necessary or appear to you to be so that you should be here under false color but -- _ appear _ to be say she with much emphasis on the first word why can not you see that it would be impossible for I as a young unmarried woman to come to the house of a man whose proprietor as aunt keswick consider herself to be have be try to marry to I even before i be grow up for the letter that use to make my father most angry be about this i hate to talk of these family affair and i only do it so that you can be make understand thing mr null say lawrence do not think i wish to blame you you have have a hard time of it and i can see the peculiarity of you residence here do not be afraid of I i will not betray you secret while i be here i will address you and will try to think of you as a very grave young matron but i wish very much that you be not quite so grave and severe when you address I when i be here last week you manner be very different we be quite friendly then i see no particular reason say annie why we should be friendly mr null say lawrence after a little pause during which he look at she attentively i do not believe you approve of I no say she i do not he could not help smile at the earnest directness of she answer though he do not like it i be sorry he say that you should have so poor a opinion of I and now let I tell you what i be go to say this morning that my only object in find you cousin be to know the man who have be engage to miss march so that you could find out what she probably object to in he and could then try and not let she see anything of that sort in you mr null say lawrence you be unjust there be no reason why you should speak to I in this way i would like to know she say what cause there could possibly be for you want to become acquaint with a man who have be engage to the lady you wish to marry if you do not intend to study he up and try to do better yourself my motive in desire to become acquaint with mr keswick say lawrence be one you could scarcely understand and all i can say about it be that i believe that if i know the gentleman who have formerly be the accept lover of a lady i should better know the lady you must be awfully suspicious say she no i be not he answer and i know you would not understand I my only desire in speak to you upon this subject be that you may not unreasonably judge I but i be not unreasonable say annie you be try to get miss march away from my cousin and i do not think it be fair and i do not want you to do it when you be here before i think you two be good friend but now i do not believe it how friendly might be the relation between himself and keswick when the latter should read he letter about the candy affair and should know that he be in this house with miss march lawrence could not say but he do not allude to this point in he companion 's remark i do not think he say that you have any reason to object to my endeavor to win miss march even if she accept I it will be to the advantage of you cousin because if he still hope to obtain she the sooner he know he can not do so the better it will be for he my course be perfectly fair i be aware that the lady be not at present engage to any one and i be endeavor to induce she to engage herself to I if i fail then i step aside entirely aside and out of the way ask mrs null entirely answer lawrence well say annie lean back in she chair in which before she have be sit very upright you have at last give I a good deal of you confidence almost as much as i give you some of the thing you say i believe other i do not lawrence be annoyed but he would not allow himself to get angry i be not accustom to be disbelieve he say gravely it be a very unusual experience i assure you which of my statement do you doubt i do not believe say annie that you will give she up if she reject you while you be here you be too wilful you will follow she and try again mrs null say lawrence i do not feel justified in speak to a third person of these thing but this be a peculiar case and therefore i assure you and request you to believe I that if miss march shall now positively refuse I i shall feel convinced that she affection be already occupy and that i have no right to press my suit any longer would you like to begin now say annie she be come down stair you be entirely too matter-of-fact say lawrence smile in spite of himself and in a moment roberta enter the room if the young lady in the high-backed rocking-chair have any idea of give mr croft and miss march a opportunity of express they sentiment toward each other she take no immediate step to do so for she gently rock herself she talk about the novel she have be read she blame miss march for stay so long in she room on such a beautiful afternoon and she be the primary cause of a conversation among the three upon the difference between new york weather and that of virginium and this continue until old mr keswick join the party and change the conversation to the consideration of the fact that a fertilizer agent a pill man or a blackmailer would find out a person 's whereabouts even if he be attend the funeral of he grandmother on a desert island the next morning about a hour after breakfast lawrence be walk up and down on the grass in front of the house smoking a cigar and trouble he mind he have have no opportunity on the previous evening to be alone with miss march for the little party sit together in the parlor until they separate for bed and so of course nothing be yet settle he be overstay the time he have expect to spend here and he feel nervous about it he have hope to see miss march after breakfast but she seem to have withdraw herself entirely from observation perhaps she consider that she have sufficiently reject he on the previous morning and that she now intend except when she be sure of the company of the other to remain in she room until he should go away but he have no such opinion in regard to they interview on pine top hill he believe that he have be punish not reject and that when he should be able to explain everything to she he would be forgive that at least be he earnest hope and hope make we believe almost anything but although there be so many difficulty in he way lawrence have a friend in that household who still remain true to he mr keswick with sun-bonnet and umbrella come out upon the porch and say cheerily : i should think a gentleman like you would prefer to be with the lady than to be walk about here by yourself they have go to take a walk in the wood i should have say that miss march have go on ahead with she little maid peggy my niece be go with she but i call she back to attend to some housekeeping matter for I and i think she will be keep longer than she expect for i have just send letty to she to be show how to cut out a frock but you need not wait you can go right through the flower-garden and take the path over the field into the wood and have conclude this bit of conscienceless and transparent management the old lady remark that she herself be go for a walk and leave he lawrence lose no time in follow she suggestion throw away he cigar he hurry through the house and the little flower-garden a gate at the back of which open into a wide pasture-field this field slope down gently to a branch or little stream which run through the middle of it and then the ground ascend until it reach the edge of the wood follow the well-defined path he look across the little valley before he and could see just inside the edge of the wood -- the tree and bush be much more thinly attire than in the summer time -- the form of a lady in a light-colored dress with a red scarf upon she shoulder sometimes move slowly sometimes stop this be roberta and those wood be a far better place than the expose summit of pine top hill in which to plight he troth if it should be so that he should be able to do it and there be doubtless path in those wood through which they might afterwards wander if thing should turn out propitiously at all event in those wood would he settle this affair he intention be still strong to make a very clean breast of it to roberta if she have blame he for he prudent reserve she should have full opportunity to forgive he all that he have be she should know but far more important than that he would try to make she know better than he have do before what he be now abandon all he previous position and mount on these strong resolution thus would he dash into she camp and hope to capture she reach the little ravine at the bottom of which flow the branch now but two or three foot wide he run down the rather steep slope and step upon the stout plank which bridge the stream the instant he do so the plank turn beneath he as if it have be hang on pivot and he fall into the stony bed of the branch it be a awkward fall for the leg which be undermost come down at a angle and he foot strike a slippery stone turn under he in a moment he be on he foot and scramble up the side of the ravine down which he have just come when he reach the top he sit down and put both he hand on he right ankle in which he feel considerable pain in a few minute he arise and begin to walk toward the house but he have not take a dozen step before he sit down again the pain in he ankle be very severe and he feel quite sure that he have sprain it he know enough about such thing to understand that if he walk upon this injured joint he would not only make the pain worse but the consequence might be serious he be very much annoy not only that this thing have happen to he but that it have happen at such a inauspicious moment of course he could not now go on to the wood and he must get somebody to help he to the house look about he see at a distance uncle isham and he call loudly to he as soon as lawrence be well away from the edge of the ravine there emerge from some thick bush on the other side of it and at a short distance from the crossing-place a negro girl who slip noiselessly down to the branch move with quick step and crouch body to the plank remove the two round stone on which it have be skilfully poise and replace it in its usual firm position this do she slip back into the bush and by the time isham have hear the call of mr croft she be slowly walk down the opposite hill as if she be come from the wood to see why the gentleman be shout miss march also hear the call and come out of the wood and when she see lawrence sit on the grass on the other side of the branch with one hand upon he ankle she know that something have happen and come down toward he lawrence see she approach and before she be even near enough to hear he he begin to shout to she to be careful about cross the branch as the board be unsafe peggy join she and walk on in front of she and when miss march understand what lawrence be say she call back that she would be careful when they reach the ravine peggy run down step upon the plank jump on the middle of it walk over it and then back again and assure she mistress that it be just as good as ever it be and that she reckon the city gentleman do not know how to walk on plank and that he je ' do fall off miss march cross step a little cautiously and reach lawrence just as uncle isham with strong arm and many word of sympathy have assist he to he foot what have happen to you mr croft she exclaim i be come to you he say and in cross the stream the plank turn under I and i be afraid i have sprain my ankle i can not walk on it i be very sorry she say because i be come to you he say grimly or because i hurt myself you ought to be ashamed to speak in that way she answer but i will not find fault with you now that you be in such pain be there anything i can do for you no thank you say lawrence i will lean on this good man and i think i can hop to the house peggy say miss roberta walk on the other side of the gentleman and let he lean upon you shoulder i will go on and have something prepare to put on he ankle with one side support by the stout isham and he other hand rest on the shoulder of the good little peggy who bear up as strongly under it as if she have be a big walking-stick lawrence slowly make he way to the house miss march get there sometime before he do and be very glad to find that mr keswick have not yet go out on the walk for which she be prepare that circumspect old lady have find this and that to occupy she while she so manage she household matter that one thing should follow another to detain she niece but when she hear what have happen all other impulse give way to those which belong to a head nurse and a mistress of emergency she set down she umbrella shout a order to letty to put a kettle of water on the fire bring from she own room some flannel and two bottle of embrocation and then stop a moment to reflect order that the office should be prepare for mr croft for it would be a shame to make a gentleman with a sprain ankle clamber up stair the office be a small building in the wide front yard not very far from the house and opposite to the arbor which have be before mention it be one story high and contain one large and comfortable room such building be quite common on virginian farm and although call office be seldom use in a official way be generally appropriate to the bachelor of the family or they gentleman visitor this one be occupy by junius keswick when he be at home and a good many of he belongings be now in it but as it be at present unoccupied nothing could be more proper than that mr croft should have it chapter xix about noon of the day of mr croft 's accident uncle isham have occasion to go to the cabin of the venerable aunt patsy and of course he tell she what have happen to the gentleman whom he and aunt patsy still suppose to be miss annie 's husband the news produce a very marked effect upon the old woman she put down the crazy quilt upon the unfinished corner of which she be make a few feeble stitch and look at uncle isham with a troubled frown she be certain that this be the work of old mr keswick who have succeed at last in conjure the young husband and the charm she have give he and upon which she have rely to avert the ill will of ole miss have prove unavail the conjuring have be accomplish so craftily and slyly the bewitch plank in one place and mr keswick far off in another that there have be no chance to use the counteract charm and yet aunt patsy have think it a good charm a very good one indeed early in she married life mr keswick have be the mother of a little girl it have die when it be very small and it be the only child she ever have of this infant she preserve as a memento a complete suit of its clothes which she regard with a feeling almost religious year ago however aunt patsy in order to protect herself against the conjure power of the mistress of the house in which she then serve as a sort of supervise cook have possess herself of the shoe belong to the cherish suit of clothes she know the sacred light in which they be regard by they owner and she feel quite sure that if ole miss ever attempt in one of she fit of anger to exercise she power of limb twist or back contortion upon she that the sight of those little blue shoe would create a revulsion of feeling and as she put it to herself stop she mighty short the shoe have never be miss for the box contain the suit be only open on one day of the year and then all the old lady could endure be a peep at the little white frock which cover the rest of the contents and aunt patsy well know that the sight of those little blue shoe would be to she mistress like two little foot come back from the grave patsy have be much too old to act as nurse to the infant annie peyton then regard as the daughter of the house but she have always feel for the child the deepest affection and now that she herself be so near the end of she career that she have little fear of be bewitch she be willing to give up the safeguard she have so long possess in order that they might protect the man whom miss annie have love and marry but they have fail or rather it have be impossible to use they and miss annie 's husband have be stricken down it be pow ` ful hard to git roun ' ole miss she groan she too much fur ole folk like i be at this remark uncle isham fire up although the conduct of he mistress trouble he at time very much he be intensely loyal to she and he instantly catch the meaning of this aspersion against she now look h ` yar aun ' patsy he exclaim wot you talkin ' ` bout wot ole miss get to do wid mister crof ' sprainin ' he ankle ole miss war not dar a ' when i do fotch he up to de house she cut roun ' a ' do more fur he dan anybody else she get de hot water a ' she dip de flannel in it a ' she wrop up de ankle all herse ' f a ' when she get he all fix comfable in de offis she say to I say she ` now isham you wait on mister crof ' a ' you gib he eberythe he want a ' when de cool ob de ebenin ' come on you make a fire in dat fireplace a ' stay whar he kin call you wheneber he want you to wait on he ' i do not eben come down h ` yar till i ax he would he want I fur half a hour well say aunt patsy she eye soften a little p ` rap she do not do it dis time it mout a be he own orkardness i hope to mussiful goodness dat dat be so but wot fur you call he mister crof ' be dat he fus ' name i reckon so say isham he one ob de fam ` ly now a ' i reckon dey call he by he fus ' name a ' now look h ` yar aun ' patsy i want you not to disremember di h ` yar don ' you go imaginin ' ebery

till somebody find out you 's dar a ' let 's you in aunt patsy turn she great spectacles full upon he and then she say : you isham ef eber you git a call to preach to folk you jus ' sing out : ` oh lor ' i aint fit ' and den you go crack you head wid a mill-stone fur fear you git call agin fru mistake uncle isham make no answer to this piece of advice but take up some clothes which aunt patsy 's great granddaughter have wash and iron for he he leave the cabin he be a man much give to attend to he own business and pay very little attention to those affair of he mistress 's household with which he have no personal concern when mr croft first come to the house he as well as aunt patsy have be tell that it be mr null the husband of miss annie and although not think much about it he have always suppose this to be the case but now it strike he as a very strange thing that miss annie do not attend to she husband but allow he mistress and himself to do everything that be do for he it be a question which he mind be totally incapable of solve but when he reach the house he speak to letty on the subject bress you soul exclaim that well-nourished person dat 's not mister null wot marry miss annie dat 's mister crof ' a ' he aint marry to nobody mister null he aint come yet but i reckon he 'll be along soon well den exclaim isham much surprised how come aun ' patsy to take he for

b ` lieve aint gwine to hurt she and isham remember he frequent ill success in endeavor to make aunt patsy think as she ought to think conclude that this be good advice at the time of the conversation just mention lawrence be sit in a large easy chair in front of the open door of the room of which he have be put in possession he injured foot be rest upon a cushion stool a small table stand by he on which be he cigar and match case a pitcher of iced water and a glass and a late copy of a semi-weekly paper through the doorway which be but two step higher than the grass sward before it he eye fall upon a very please scene to the right be the house with its vine-covered porch and several great oak tree overhang it which still retain they heavy foliage although it be begin to lose something of its summer green in front of he at the opposite end of the grassy yard be the pretty little arbor in which he have tell mr junius keswick of the difficulty in the way of he speak he mind to miss march beyond the large garden at the back of this arbor stretch a wide field with a fringe of wood at its distant edge gay with the color of autumn the sky be bright and blue and fair white cloud move slowly over its surface the air be sunny and warm with bumble-bee hum about some late-flowering shrub and high in the air float two great turkey-buzzard with a beauty of motion surpass by no other fly thing with never a movement of they wide-spread wing except to give they the necessary inclination as they rise with the wind and then turn and descend in a long sweep only to rise again and complete the circle sailing thus for hour around and around they shadow move over the field below they fear that he have sustain some injury more than a mere sprain lawrence have have the howlett 's doctor summon and that general practitioner have come and go after have assure mr croft that no bone have be break that mr keswick 's treatment be exactly what it should be and that all that be necessary for he be to remain quiet for a few day and be very careful not to use the injured ankle thus he have the prospect of but a short confinement he feel no present pain and there be nothing of the sick-room atmosphere in he surroundings for he position close to the door almost give he the advantage of sit in the open air of this bright autumnal day but lawrence 's mind dwelt not at all on these ameliorate circumstance it dwell only upon the fact that he be in one house and miss march be in another it be impossible for he to go to she and he have no reason to believe that she would come to he under ordinary circumstance it would be natural enough for she to look in upon he and inquire into he condition but now the case be very different she know that he desire to see she that he have be come to she when he meet with he accident and she know too exactly what he want to say and it be not to be suppose that a lady would come to a man to be woo especially this lady who have be in such a unfavorable humor when he have woo she the day before but it be quite impossible for lawrence at this most important crisis of he life to sit without action for three or four day during which time it be not unlikely that miss march might go home but what be he to do it would be rediculous to think of send for she she know for what purpose she be want and as for write a letter that do not suit he at all there be too much to be explain too much to be urge too much to be avowed and probably too many contingency to be meet for he to even consider the subject of write a letter a proposal on paper would most certainly bring a rejection on paper he could think of no plan he must trust to chance if he lucky star and it have shine a good deal in he life should give he a opportunity of speak to she he would lose not a instant in broach the important subject he be happy to think he have a friend in the old lady perhaps she might bring about the desire interview but although this thought be encourage he could not but tremble when he remember the very plain and unvarnished way she have of do such thing while these thought be pass through he mind a lady come out upon the porch and descend the step at the first sight of she through the vine lawrence have think it might be miss march and he heart have give a jump but it be not it be mrs null and she come over the grass toward he and stop in front of he door how be you feel now she ask do you foot still hurt you oh no say lawrence i be in no pain the only thing that trouble I be that i have to stay just here it might have be better on some account say she if you have be take into the house but it would have hurt you dreadfully to go up stair unless uncle isham carry you on he back which i do not believe he could do of course it be a great deal better out here say lawrence in fact this be a perfectly charming place to be lay up in but i want to get about i want to see people many people ask she with a significant little smile lawrence smile in return you must know mrs null from what i have tell you he say that there be one person i want to see very much and that be why i be so annoyed at be keep here in this chair you must be of a uncommonly impatient turn of mind she say for you have not be here three hour altogether and hundred of person sit still that long just because they want to i do not want to sit still a minute say lawrence i very much wish to speak to miss march could not you contrive a opportunity for I to do so it be possible that i might she say but i will not have not i tell you that i do not approve of this affair of yours my cousin be in love with miss march and all i should do for you would be directly against he aunt so manage thing this morning that i be actually oblige to give you a opportunity to be with she but i have intend go with roberta to the wood as she have ask I to do you be very cruel say lawrence no i be not say she i be only just i explain to you yesterday say he that you course of think and act be not just and be of no possible advantage to anybody how can it injure you cousin if miss march refuse I and i go away and never see she again and if she accept I then you should be

feel if we want any credit and now be not there something i can do for you besides bring another man 's sweetheart to you lawrence smile i do not believe she be he sweetheart he say and i want to find

blood boil in this way would inflame you joint the doctor do not tell I what to think about say lawrence he only say i must not walk i have not hear yet say miss annie what you would like to have to eat i do not wish to give the slightest trouble answer lawrence what do you generally give people in such scrape as this tea and toast annie laugh nonsense say she what you want be the best meal you can get aunt say if there be anything you particularly like she would have it make for you do not think of such a thing say lawrence give I just what the family have would you like miss march to bring it out to you she ask the word cruel can not express you disposition say lawrence i pity mr null poor man say she but it would be a good thing for you if you could keep you mind as quiet as he be and with that she go into the house after dinner miss march do come out to inquire into mr croft 's condition but she be accompany by mr keswick lawrence invite the lady to come in and be seat but roberta stand on the grass in front of the door as miss annie have do while mr keswick enter the room look into the ice-water pitcher and examine thing generally to see if uncle isham have be guilty of any sin of omission do you feel quite at ease now say miss march my ankle do not trouble I say lawrence but i never feel so uncomfortable and dissatisfied in my life and with these latter word he give the lady a look which be intend to be and which probably be full of mean to she would not you like some book say mr keswick now appear from the back of the room you have not anything to read there be plenty of book in the house but they be all old i think those be the most delightful of book say miss march i have be look over the volume on you shelf mr keswick i be sure there be a good many of they mr croft would like to read even if he have read they before there be lot of queer old-time history and biography and set of bind magazine some of they over a hundred year old would you like I to select some for you mr croft or shall i write some of the title on a slip of paper and let you select for yourself i shall be delight say lawrence to have you make a choice for I and i think the list would be the better plan because book would be so heavy to carry about i will do it immediately say miss march and she walk rapidly to the house now then say mr keswick i 'll put a chair out here on the grass close to the door it be shady there and i should think it would be pleasant for both of you if she would sit there and read to you out of those book she be a fine woman that miss march -- a much finer woman than i think she could be before i know she she be indeed say lawrence i suppose you think she be the finest woman in the world say the old lady with a genial grin what make you suppose so asked lawrence have not i eye say mr keswick but you need not make any excuse you have make a excellent choice and i hope you may succeed in get she perhaps you have succeed she add give lawrence a earnest look with a question in it lawrence do not immediately reply it be not in he nature to confide he affair to other people and yet he have do so much of it of late that he do not see why he should make a exception against mr keswick who be indeed the only person who seem incline to be friendly to he suit he might as well let she know how matter stand no he say i have not yet succeed and i be very sorry that this accident have interfere with my effort to do so do not let it interfere say the old lady she eye sparkling while she purple sun-bonnet be suddenly and severely bob you have just as good a chance now as you ever have and all you have to do be to make the most of it when she come out here to read to you you can talk to she just as well as if you be in the wood or on top of a hill nobody 'll come here to disturb you i 'll take care of that you be very kind say lawrence somewhat wonder at she enthusiasm i intend to go away and leave she here with you continue mr keswick if i could find a good opportunity to do so but she hit on the best plan herself and now i 'll be off and leave the coast clear i will come again before dark and put some more of that stuff on you ankle if you want anything ring this bell and if isham do not hear you somebody will call he he have order to keep about the house you be put I under very great obligation to you madam say lawrence but the old lady do not stop to hear any thanks and hasten to clear the coast lawrence have to wait a long time for he list of book but at last it come and much to he surprise and chagrin mr null bring it miss march ask I to give you this she say so that you can pick out just what book you want lawrence take the paper but do not look at it he be deeply disappointed and hurt he whole appearance show it you do not seem glad to get it say miss annie lawrence look at she he face darken do you persuade miss march he say to stay in the house and let you bring this now mr croft say the young lady a very decide flush come into she face that be go too far you have no right to accuse I of such a thing i be not go to help in you love affair but i do not intend to be mean about it either miss march ask I to bring that list and at first i would not do it for i know just as well as i know anything that you expect she to come to you with it and i be very sure you want to see she more than the paper i refuse two or three time but she say at last that if i do not take it she would send it by some one in the house so i just pick it up and bring it right along i do not like she as much as i do why not ask lawrence you need not accept a man if you do not want he say miss annie but there be no need of be cruel to he especially when he be lay up if she do not intend to come out to you again she ought not to have make you believe so you do expect she to come do not you most certainly say lawrence in rather a doleful tone yes and there be the chair she be to sit in say miss annie while you say seven word about the book and ten thousand about the way you heart be throbbing i see aunt keswick 's hand in that as plain as can be i do not say i would put she in that chair if i could do it but i certainly be sorry she disappoint you so would you like to have any of those book if you would i 'll get they for you i be much obliged mr null say lawrence but i do not think i care for any book and let I say that i be very sorry for the way i speak to you just now oh do not mention that say she if i would be in you place i should have be mad enough to say anything but it be no use to sit here and be grumpy you would better let I go and get you a book the critical magazine for 1767 and 1768 be on that list and i know there be lot of queer interesting thing in it but it take a good while to hunt they out from the other thing for which you would not care at all and then there be all the spectator and rambler and the world display in eight volume which from what i see when i look through it seem to be a different kind of world from the one i live in and there be other that you will see on you list but there be one book which i have be read lately which i think you will find odder and funnier than any of the rest it be the geographical grammar by mr salmon suppose i bring you that it be a description of the whole world write more than a hundred year ago by a irish gentleman who i think never go anywhere thank you say lawrence i shall be oblige to you if you will be kind enough to bring I that one he be glad for she to go away even for a little time that he might think the smart of the disappointment cause by the non-appearance of miss march be begin to subside a little look at it more quietly and reasonably he could see that in she position it would be actually unmaidenly for she to come to he by herself it be altogether another thing for this other girl and therefore perhaps it be quite proper to send she but in spite of whatever reasonableness there might have be in it he chafe under this propriety it would have be far better he think if she have come and tell he that she could not possibly accept he and that nothing more must be say about it but then he do not believe if she have give he time to say the word he wish to say that she would have come to such a decision and as he call up she lovely face and figure as it stand frame in the open doorway with a background of the sunlit arbor and field the gorgeous distant foliage with the blue sky and its white cloud and circle bird he think of the rapture and ecstasy which would have come to he if she have listen to he word and have give he but a smile of encouragement but here come mrs null with a fat brown book in she hand one of the funniest thing she say as she come to the door be mr salmon 's chapter on paradox he think it would be quite improper to issue a book of this kind without allude to geographical paradox listen to this one and then she read to he the elucidation of the apparent paradox that there be a certain place in this world where the wind always blow from the south and another explain the statement that in certain cannibal island the people eat themselves there be something he say about virginia say she turn over the page which i want you to be sure to read will not you sit down say lawrence and read to I some of those extract you know just where to find they that chair be not put there for I say miss annie with a smile nonsense say lawrence will not you please sit down i ought to have ask you before perhaps it be too cool for you out there oh not at all say she the air be still quite warm and she take she seat on the chair which be place close to the door-step and she read to he some of the surprising and interesting fact which mr salmon have hear in a dublin coffee-house about virginium and the other colony and also some of those relate to the kindly way in which slave-holder in south america when they kill a slave to feed they hound would send a quarter to a neighbor expect some day to receive a similar favor in return when they have laugh over these she read some very odd and surprising statement about southern europe and the people of far-away land and so she go on from one thing to another talk a good deal about what she have read and always on the point of stop and give the book to lawrence until the short autumnal afternoon begin to draw to its close and he tell she that it be grow too chilly for she to sit out on the grass any longer very well say she close the book and hand it to he you can read the rest of it yourself and if you want any other book on the list just let I know by uncle isham and i will send they to you he be come now to see after you i wonder she say stop for a moment as she turn to leave if miss march have be sit in that chair if you would have have the heart to tell she to go away or if you would have let she sit still and take cold lawrence smile but very slightly that subject say he be one on which i do not joke goodness exclaimed miss annie clasp she hand and gaze with a air of comical commiseration at mr croft 's serious face i should think not and away she go just before supper time when lawrence 's door have be close and he lamp light there come a knock and mr keswick appear that plan of mine do not work she say but i will bring miss march out here and manage it so that she 'll have to stay till i come back i have a idea about that all that you have to do be to be ready when you get you chance lawrence thank she and assure she he would be very glad to have a chance although he hope without much ground for it that roberta would not see through the old lady 's scheme mr keswick lotioned and rebandage the sprain ankle and then she say i think it would be pleasant if we be all to come out here after supper and have a game of whist i use to play whist and should not mind take a hand you could have the table draw up to you chair and -- let I see -- yes there be three more chair it will not be like have she alone with you she say with the cordial grin in which she sometimes indulge but you will have she opposite to you for a hour and that will be something lawrence approve heartily of the whist party and assure mr keswick that she be he guardian angel not much of that she say but i have be tell often enough that i be a regular old matchmaker and i expect i be if you make this match say lawrence you will have my eternal gratitude the supper send out to lawrence be a very good one and the anticipation of what be to follow make he enjoy it still more for he passion have now reach such a point that even to look at he love although he could only speak to she of trump and of trick would be a refreshing solace which would go down deep into he thirsty soul but bedtime and old isham come and the whist player come not it need no one to tell lawrence whose disinclination it be that have prevent they coming i reckon say uncle isham as he look in at letty 's cabin on he way to he own dat dat ar mister crof ' aint much use to gittin ' hisse ' f hurt all de time i be helpin ' he to go to bed he be a growlin ' like de bery debbil chapter xx although October in southern virginium can generally be count upon as a very charming month it must not be expect that she face will wear one continuous smile on the day after lawrence croft 's misadventure the sky be gray with low-hanging cloud there be a disagreeable wind from the north-east and the air be fill with the slight drizzle of rain the morning be so cool that lawrence be oblige to keep he door shut and uncle isham have make he a small wood fire on the hearth as he sit before this fire after breakfast he foot still upon a stool and vigorously puff at a cigar he say to himself that it matter very little to he whether the sun shone or all the rain of heaven descend so long as roberta march would not come out to he and that she do not intend to come rain or shine be just as plain as the mark on the side of the fireplace probably make by the heel of mr junius keswick during many a long reflective smoke on second thought however lawrence conclude that a rainy day be worse for he prospects than a bright one if the sun shone and everything be fair miss march might come across the grassy yard and might possibly stop before he open door to bid he good morning and to tell he that she be sorry that a headache have prevent she from come to play whist the evening before but this last he presently admit be rather too much to expect for he do not think she be subject to headache or to make excuse at any rate he might have catch sight of she and if he have he certainly would have call to she and would have have he say with she even have she persist in stand six foot from the door-step but now this dreary day have shut he door and put a interdict upon stroll across the grass therefore it be that he must resign any opportunity for that day at least of soothing the harrowing perturbation of he passion by either the comforting warmth of hope or by the deadening frigidity of a consummate despair this last in truth he do not expect but still if it come it would be better than perturbation they must be soothe at any cost but how to incur this cost be a difficult question altogether so puff gaze into the fire and knit he brow he sit and think as a good-looking young man as a well-dressed young man as a educate and culture man as a man of the club and of society and when occasion require as a very sensible man of business mr croft might be look upon as essentially a commonplace personage and in we walk abroad we meet a great many like he but there dwell within he a certain disposition which at time remove he to quite a distance from the arena in which commonplace people go through they prescribe performance he would come to a determination generally quite suddenly to attain a desire end in he own way without any reference to traditionary or conventional method and the more original and startling these plan the better he like it this disposition it be which make lawrence read with so much interest the account of the defeat general who make the cavalry charge into the camp of he victorious enemy defeat have be he all through he short campaign and it now seem that the time have come to make another bold effort to get the better of he bad luck as he could not woo miss march himself he must get some one else to do it for he or if not actually to woo the lady to get she at least into such a frame of mind that she would allow he to woo she even in spite of he present disadvantage this would be a very bold stroke but lawrence put a good deal of faith in it if miss march be properly talk to by one of she own sex she might see as perhaps she do not now see how cruel be she line of conduct toward he and might be persuade to relent at least enough to allow he voice to reach she and that be all he ask for he have not the slightest doubt that the widow keswick would gladly consent to carry any message he choose to send to miss march and more than that to throw all the force of she peculiar style of persuasion into the support of he cause but this he know very well would finish the affair and not at all in the way he desire the person he want to act as he envoy be mrs null to be sure she have refuse to act for he but he think he could persuade she she be quiet she be sensible and could talk very gently and confidingly when she choose she would say just what he tell she to say and if a contingency demand that she should add anything she would probably do it very prudently but then it would be almost as difficult to communicate with she as with miss march while he be thus think in come the old lady very cross you do not get any rubber of whist last night do you say she without salutatory preface but i can tell you it be not my fault i do all that i could and more than i ought to make she come but she just put she foot down and would not stir a inch and at last i get mad and go to bed i do not know whether she see it or not but i be as mad as hop and i be that way yet i have a plan that would have give you a chance to talk to she but that be not any good now that it be rain let I look at you ankle i hope that be get along all right any way while the old lady be engage in minister to he need he tell she of he plan he say he wish to send a message to miss march by some one and if he could get the message properly deliver it would help he very much i 'll take it say she look up suddenly from the piece of soft old linen she be folding i 'll go to she this very minute and tell she just what you want I to mr keswick say lawrence you be as kind as you can possibly be but i do not think it would be right for you to go on a errand like this miss march might not receive you well and that would annoy I very much and besides to speak frankly you have take up my cause so warmly and have be such a good friend to I that i be afraid you earnest desire to assist I might perhaps carry you a little too far please do not misunderstand I i do not mean that you would say anything imprudent but as you be kind enough to say that you really desire this match it will be very natural for you to show you interest in it to a degree that would arouse miss march 's opposition yes i see say the old lady reflectively she would suspect what be at the bottom of my interest she be a sharp one i have find that out i reckon it will be better for I not to meddle with she i come very near quarrel with she last night and that would not do at all you see madam say lawrence well satisfy that he have succeed in ward off the old lady 's offer without offend she that i do not want any one to go to miss march and make a proposal for I i could do that in a letter but i very much object to a letter in fact it would not do at all all i wish be that some one by the exercise of a little female diplomacy should induce she to let I speak to she now i think that mr null might do this very well that be so say the old lady who have now finish she bandaging be seat on a chair by the fireplace my niece be smart and quick and could do this thing for you just as well as not but she have she quip and she crank like the rest of we i call she out of the room last night to know why she do not back I up better about the whist party and she say she could not see why a gentleman who have not be confine to the house for quite a whole day should be so desperately lonely that people must go to he room to play whist with he it seem to I exactly as if she think that mr null would not like it mr null indeed as if he wish and desire be to be consider in my house i never mention that man now and annie do not speak of he either what i want be that he shall stay away just as long as he will and if he will only stay away long enough to make he absence what the law call desertion i 'll have those two divorce before they know it can you tell I sir how long a man must stay away from he wife before he can be legally charge with desertion no madam i can not say lawrence the law i believe differ in the various state well i be go to make it my business to find out all about it say mrs keswick mr brandon have promise to attend to this matter for I and i must write to he to know what he have be do well mr null and miss march seem to be very good friend and i dare say my niece could manage thing so as to give you the chance you want i 'll go to the house now and send she over to you so that you can tell she what you want she to say or do do you think she will come madam ask lawrence the old lady rise to she foot and knit she brow until something like a perpendicular mouth appear on she forehead no say she now i come to think of it i do not believe she will in fact i know she will not bother take it all sir what these young woman want be a good whipping nothing else will ever bring they to they sens what possible difference could it make to mr null whether she come to you and take a message for you or whether she do not come especially in a case like this when you can not walk or go to anybody i do not think it ought to make any difference whatever say lawrence in fact i do not believe it would it be no use talk about it mr croft say the old lady move toward the door i can go to my niece and talk to she but the first thing i would know i would blaze out at she and then as like as not she would blaze back again and then the next thing would be that she would pack up she thing and go off to hunt up she fertilizer agent and that must not be i do not want to get myself in any snarl just now there be nothing for you to do mr croft but to wait till it clear off so that dainty young woman can come out of door and then i think i can manage it so that you can get a chance to speak to she i be very much oblige to you say lawrence i suppose i must wait i 'll see that isham bring you a lot of dry hickory so that you can have a cheerful fire even if you can not have cheerful company say mr keswick as she close the door after she lawrence look through the window at the sky which give no promise of clearing and then he gaze into the fire and consider he case he have spend a large portion of he life in consider he case and therefore the operation be a familiar one to he this time the case be not a satisfactory one everything in this love affair with miss march have go on in a manner in which he have not intend and of which he greatly disapprove no one in the world could have plan the affair more prudently than he have plan it he have be so careful not to do anything rash that he have at first conceal even from the lady herself the fact that he be in love with she and nothing could be farther from he thought and desire than that any one else should know of it and yet how have it all turn out he have take into he confidence mr junius keswick mr brandon old mr keswick mr null as she wish to be call and almost lastly the lady herself if i should lay bare my heart to the color man isham he say to himself and the old centenarian in the cabin down there i believe there would be no one else to tell oh yes there be candy and the anti-detective by rights they ought to know he do not include the good little peggy in this category because he be not aware that there be such a person after about a hour of these doleful cogitation he again turn to look out of he front window which command a view of the larger house when he see come down the step of the porch a not very tall figure wrap in a waterproof cloak with the hood draw over its head he do not see the face of the figure but he think from the light way in which it move that it be mrs null and when it step upon the grass and turn its head he see that he be right can she aunt have induce she to come to I be lawrence 's first thought but he second be very different for she begin to walk toward the large gate which lead out of the yard instantly lawrence rise and hop on one foot to the window where he tap loudly on the glass the lady turn and then he throw up the sash will not you step here please he call out without answer she immediately come over the wet grass to the window i have something to say to you he say and i do not want to keep you stand in the rain will not you come inside for a few minute no thank you say she i do not mind a slight rain like this i have live so long in the city that i can not imagine how country people can bear to shut themselves in when it happen to be a little wet i can not stand it and i be go out for a walk it be a very sensible thing to do say lawrence and i wish i could go with you and have a good long talk what about say she about miss march well i be rather tire of that subject she say and so i reckon it be just as well that you should stay here by you fire -- i see you have one there -- and that i should take my walk by myself mr null say lawrence i want to implore you to do a favor for I i do not see how it can be disagreeable to you and i be sure it will confer the greatest possible obligation upon I what be it she ask i want you to go to miss march and endeavor in some way -- you will know how better than i can tell you -- to induce she to let I have a few word with she if it be only here at this open window it will do mr null laugh imagine she say a woman put on a waterproof and overshoe and come out in the rain to stand with a umbrella over she head to be propose to that would be the funniest proceeding i ever hear of lawrence could not help smile though he be not in the mood for it it may seem amusing to you he say but i be very much in earnest i be in constant fear that she will go away while i be confine to this house do you know how long she intend to stay she have not tell I be the answer if you will carry it he say i will give you a message for she why do not you write it say miss annie i do not want to write anything he say i should not know how it have be receive nor would it be likely to get I any satisfaction i want a live sympathetic medium such as you be will not you do this favor for I no i will not say miss annie she very decide tone appear to give a shade of paleness to she feature how often must i tell you that i will not help you in this thing i would not ask you say lawrence if i could help myself it be not right that you should ask I any more she say i be not in favor of you come here to court miss march while my cousin be away and i should feel like a traitor if i help you at all especially if i be to carry message to she of course i be very sorry for you shut up here and i will do anything i can to make you more comfortable and contented but what you ask be too hard for I and as she say this a little air of trouble come into the large eye with which she be steadfastly regard he i do not want to seem unkind to you and i wish you would ask I something that i can do for you i 'll walk down to howlett 's and get you anything you may like to have i 'll bring you a lot of novel which i find in the house and which i expect anyway you will like better than those old-time book and i 'll cook you anything that be in the cook-book but i really can not go woo for you and if you ask I to do that every time i come near you i really must -- my dear mr null interrupted lawrence i promise not to say any more to you on this subject i see it be distasteful to you and i beg you pardon for have mention it so often you have be very kind to I indeed and i should be exceedingly sorry to do anything to offend you it would be very bad for I to lose one of my friend now that i be shut up in this box and feel so very dependent oh indeed say miss annie but i suppose if you be able to step around as you use to do it would not matter whether you offend I or not mr null say lawrence you know i do not mean anything like that do you intend to be angry with I no matter what i say not a bit of it she answer with a little smile that bring back to she face that warm brightness which have grow upon it since she have come down here i have not the least wish in the world to be angry with you and i promise you i will not be provide you 'll stop everlastingly ask I to go about help you to make love to people lawrence laugh very good say he i have promise to ask nothing more of that sort let we shake hand on it he stretch he hand from the window and miss annie withdraw from the fold of she waterproof a very soft and white little hand and put it into he and now i must be off she say be you certain you do not want anything from the store at howlett 's surely you be not go as far as that he say not if you do not want anything she answer have you tobacco enough to last through you imprisonment they keep it now miss say lawrence do you want to make I angry by suppose i would smoke any tobacco that they sell in that country store it ought to be better than any other say miss annie they grow it in the field all about here and the storekeeper can get it perfectly fresh and pure and a great deal better for you no doubt than the stuff they manufacture in the city when you learn to smoke say lawrence you opinion concern tobacco will be more valuable thank you she say and i will wait till then before i give you any more of it good morning and away she go lawrence shut down the window and hop back to the fire there be my last chance go say he to himself i suppose i may as well take old mr keswick 's advice and wait for fair weather but even then who can say what sort of sky roberta march will show and not be able to answer this question he put two fresh stick on the fire and then sedately sit and watch they gradual annihilation as for miss annie she take she walk and step along the road as lightly and blithely as if the sky have be blue and the sun shine and almost before she know it she have reach the store at howlett 's ascend the high step to the porch quite desert on this damp unpleasant morning she enter the store the proprietor of which immediately jump up from the mackerel kit at the extreme end of the room where he have be sit in converse with some of he neighbor and hurry behind the counter have you any tea say miss annie better than the kind which you usually sell to mr keswick no ma'am say he we send she the very best tea we have i be not find fault with it she say but i think you might have some extra kind more expensive than people usually buy for common use no ma'am say he there be fancy tea of that kind but you would have to send to philadelphium or new york for they how long would that take she ask i reckon it would be four or five day before you would get it ma'am say the storekeeper i be afraid say miss annie look reflectively along the counter that that would be too long and then she turn to go but suddenly stop have you any guava jelly she ask the man smile we do not have no call for anything as fancy as that ma'am he say be there anything else not to-day answer miss annie after throw a despairing glance upon the roll of calico the coil of clothes-line the battered tin box of tea and sugar the dusty and chimneyless kerosene lamp and the long row of can goods with they gaudy label and then she depart when she have go the storekeeper return to he seat on the mackerel kit and be accost by a pensive neighbor in high boot who sit upon the upturned end of a case of brogan you do not make no sale that time peckett say he no say the storekeeper she idee be a little too fancy for we stock of goods whar 's she husband anyway ask a stout elderly man in linen trousers and fade alpaca coat who be seat on two box of pearl starch one on top of the other i have hear that he be a member of the legislatur ' be that so he be not that you can take my word for it say tom peckett old miss keswick give I to understand that he be in the fertilize business that ought to be a good

enough the sky retain its sombre covering of cloud and the rain come down in a melancholy capricious way as if it be tear shed by a child who be cry because it be bad the monotony of the slowly move hour be break only by a very brief visit from the old lady who be go somewhere in the covered spring wagon and who look in before she start to see if she patient want anything and by the arrival of a bundle of old novel send by mr null these book lawrence look over with indifferent interest hope to find one among they that be not a love story but he be disappoint they be all base upon and most of they permeate with the tender passion and lawrence be not in the mood for read about that sort of thing a person afflict with a disease be not apt to find agreeable occupation in read hospital report upon he particular ailment the novel be put aside and although lawrence feel that he have smoke almost too much during that day he be about to light another cigar when he hear a carriage drive into the yard turn to the window he see a barouche evidently a hire one draw by a pair of horse very lean and bony but with they head rein up so high that they have a appearance of considerable spirit and drive by a color man sit upon a very elevated seat with a jaunty air and a well-worn whip the carriage drive over the grass to the front of the house -- there be no roadway in the yard the short crisp tough grass have long resist the occasional action of wheel and hoof -- and there stop a gentleman with a valise get out he pay the driver who immediately turn the vehicle about and drive away the gentleman put he foot upon the bottom step as if he be about to ascend and then apparently change he mind he pick up he valise and come directly toward the office draw a key from he pocket as he walk it be junius keswick and in a few minute he key be hear in the lock as it be not lock the key merely rattle and lawrence call out : come in the door open and junius look in evidently surprised i beg you pardon say he i do not know you be in here please walk in say lawrence i know i be occupy you room and it be i who should ask you pardon but you see the reason why it be think well that i should not have stair to ascend and he point to he bandaged foot have you hurt yourself ask junius with a air of concern and then lawrence give a account of he accident express at the same time he regret that he find himself occupy the room which belong to the other oh do not mention that say junius who have take a seat near the window there be room enough in the house and i shall be perfectly comfortable it be quite right in my aunt to have you bring in here and i should have insist upon it myself if i have be at home i expect to be away for a week or more but i have now come back on account of you letter do that need explanation ask lawrence not at all say junius i have no difficulty in understand it although i must say that it surprise I but i come because i be not satisfy with the condition of thing here and i wish to be on the spot i do not understand why you and miss march should be invite here during my absence that i do not understand either say lawrence quickly and i wish to impress it on you mind mr keswick that when i come here i not only expect to find you but a party of invite guest i will say however that i come with the express intention of meeting miss march and have that interview with she which i could not have in she uncle 's house i be not entirely correct say junius when i say that i do not know why these rather peculiar arrangement have be make my aunt be a very manage person and i think i perceive she purpose in this piece of management she be oppose to a marriage between you and miss march most decidedly say junius have she tell you so no say lawrence but it have gradually dawn upon I that such be the case i believe she would be glad to have miss march married and out of you way junius make no answer to this remark but sit silent for a few moment then he say : well have you settle it with miss march no i have not say lawrence if the matter have be decide one way or the other i should not be here i have no right to trespass on you aunt 's hospitality and i should have depart as soon as i have discover miss march 's sentiment in regard to I but i have not be able to settle the matter at all i have one opportunity of see the lady and that be not a satisfactory interview yesterday morning i make another attempt but before i could get to she i sprained my ankle and here i be i can not go to she and of course she will not come to I you can not imagine how i chafe under this harassing restraint i can imagine it very easily say junius the only thing i have to hope for say lawrence be that to-morrow may be a fine day and that the lady may come outside and give I the chance of speak to she at this open door junius smile grimly it appear to I he say as if it be likely to rain for several day but now i must go into the house and see the family i hope you believe I sir when i say i be sorry to find you in you present predicament yes say lawrence smile although he do not feel at all gay for otherwise i might have be finally reject and far away if you have be reject say junius i should have be very glad indeed to have you stay with we thank you say lawrence i will look in upon you again say junius as he leave the room lawrence 's mind which have be in a very unpleasant state of troubled restiveness for some day be now throw into a sad turmoil by this arrival of junius keswick as he see that tall and good-looking young man go up the step of the house porch with he valise in he hand he clinch both he fist as they rest on the arm of he chair and objurgate the anti-detective if it have not be for that rascal he say to himself i should not have write to keswick and he would not have think of come back at this untimely moment the only advantage i have be a clear coast and now that be go of course keswick be frighten when he find i be stay in the same house with roberta march and hurry back to attend to he own interest the first thing he will do now will be to propose to she himself and as they have be engage once it be as like as not she will take he again if i could use this foot i would go into the house this minute and have the first word with she at this he rise to he foot and make a step with he sprained ankle but the sudden pain occasion by this action cause he to sit down again with a groan lawrence croft be not a man to do himself a physical injury which might be permanent if such do could possibly be avoid and he give up the idea of try to go into the house i tell you what it be letty say uncle isham when he return to the kitchen after have carry lawrence 's supper to he dat ar mister croft in de offis be a gittin wuss a ' wuss in he min ' ebery day i neber seed a man more pow ` ful glowerin ' dan he be dis ebenin i reckin ' he j' int be healin ' up say letty dey tell I dat de healin ' pain mo ' gen ` rally run into de min ' about nine o'clock in the evening junius keswick pay lawrence a visit and take a seat by one side of the fireplace accept the offer of a cigar how be thing go on in the house ask lawrence well say keswick speaking slowly as you know so much of we family affair i might as well tell you that they be in a somewhat upset condition when i go in i see at first no one but my cousin and she seem so extraordinarily glad to see I that i think something must be wrong somewhere and when my aunt return -- she be not at home when i arrive -- she be throw into such a state of mind on see I that i do not know whether she be go to order I out of the house or go herself but she restrain herself wonderfully consider she provocation for of course i have entirely disorder she plan by appear here when she have arrange everything for you to have miss march to yourself but so far the peace have be keep between we although she scarcely speak to I and miss march say lawrence you have see she yes say junius i see she at supper and for a short time afterwards but she soon retire to she room do you think she be disturb by you return ask lawrence i will not say that say junius but she be certainly not herself mr null tell I that she expect to go home to-morrow morning have write to she uncle to send for she that be bad bad very bad say lawrence after that there be a pause in the conversation during which mr croft with brow very much knit gaze steadfastly into the fire mr keswick he say presently what you tell I fill I with consternation it be quite plain that i shall have no chance to see miss march and as there be no one else in the world who will do it for I i be go to ask you to go to she to-morrow morning and speak to she in my behalf when this have be say junius keswick drop he cigar upon the floor and sit up very straight in he chair gaze fixedly at lawrence upon my word he say i know you be a cool man but that request freeze my imagination i can not conceive how any man can ask another to try to win for he a lady whom he know the other man desire to win for himself you have make some request before that be rather astounding but this one overshadow they all i admit say lawrence that what i ask be somewhat out of the way but you must consider the circumstance suppose i have meet you in mortal combat and i have drop my sword where you could reach it and i could not would you pick it up and give it to I or would you run I through i do not think that comparison be altogether a good one say junius yes it be say lawrence and cover the case entirely i be here disabled and if you pick up my sword as i have just ask you to do it be not to be assume that you action give I the victory it merely give I a equal chance with yourself do you mean say junius that you want I to go to miss march and deliberately ask she if she will marry you no say lawrence i have do that myself but there be certain point in regard to which i want to be set right with miss march and now i wish you to understand I mr keswick i speak to you not only as a generous and honorable man which i have find you to be but as a rival i can not believe that you would be willing to profit by my present disadvantage and as i have say two or three time before it would certainly be for you interest as a suitor for the lady to have this matter settle would not it be better then say junius if i be to go immediately and speak to she for myself no say lawrence i do not think that would settle the affair at all from what i understand of you relation with miss march she know you be she lover and yet she neither accept nor decline you if you be to go to she now it be not likely she would give you any definite answer but in regard to I it would be different she would say yes or no and if she make the latter answer i think you could walk over the course i be not vain enough to say that i have be a obstacle to you success but i assure you that i have try very hard to make myself such a obstacle it seem to I say junius imitate he companion in the matter of knit he brow and gaze into the fire that this affair could be manage very simply miss march be not go at the break of day why do not you contrive to see she before she start and say for yourself what you have to say nothing would please I better than that say croft but i do not believe she would give I any chance to speak with she since my accident she have persistently and pointedly refuse to grant I even the shortest interview that ought to prove to you say keswick that she do not desire you attention you should consider it as a positive answer not at all say lawrence not at all and i do not think you would consider it a positive answer if you be in my place i think she have take some offence which be entirely groundless and if you will consent to act for I it will enable I to set straight this misunderstanding confound it exclaim keswick can not you write to she or get some one else to take you love message no say lawrence i can not write to she for i be not sure that under the circumstance she would answer my letter and i have already ask mrs null the only other person i could ask to speak for I but she have decline by the lord harry exclaimed junius you be the rarest wooer i ever hear of i assure you say lawrence he face flush somewhat that it be not my desire to carry on my woo in this fashion my whole soul be oppose to it but circumstance will have it so and as i do not intend if i can help it to have my life determine by circumstance i must go ahead in despite of they although i admit that it make the road very rough i should think it would say junius and then there be a pause in the conversation well mr keswick say lawrence presently will you do this thing for I be i to understand say junius that if i do not do it it will not be do yes say lawrence you be positively my last chance i have rack my brain to think of some other way of present my case to miss march but there be no other way i might stand at my door and call to she as she enter the carriage but that would be the height of absurdity i might hop on one foot into the house but even if i wish to present myself in that way i do not believe i could get up that long flight of step it would be worse than useless to write for i should not know what be think of my letter or even if it have be read mr keswick can not carry my message mr null will not and i have only you to call upon i know it be a great deal to ask but it mean so much to I -- to both of we in fact -- that i ask it you be kind enough to say a little while ago say junius that you consider I a honorable man i try to be such and therefore will frankly state to you that i can think of but three motive satisfactory to myself for undertake this business for you and not one of they be a generous one in the first place i might care to do it in order to have this matter settle for you be such a extraordinary suitor that i do not know in what form you may turn up the next time secondly from what you tell I of miss march 's repugnance to meet you i do not believe my mission will have a issue favorable to you and the more unfavorable it be the better i shall like it my third reason for act for you be that the whole affair be such a original one that it will rather interest I to be engage in it this last reason would not hold however if i have the least expectation of be successful you consent then say lawrence quickly turn towards the other you 'll go to miss march for I yes i think i will say junius if you will accept the service of a man who be decidedly oppose to you interest of course i never expect you to favor they say lawrence nor be it necessary that you should all i ask be that you carry a message to miss march and if she need any explanation of it that you will explain in the way that i shall indicate that you shall tell I how she receive my message and that you shall bring I back she answer there be no need of you make any proposition to she that have already be do what i want be that she should not go away from here with a misunderstanding between we and that she shall give I at least the promise of a hearing very good say junius now what be it that you want I to say this be not a easy question for lawrence to answer he know very well what he want to say if he have a chance of say it himself he want to pour he whole heart out to roberta march and show she its present passion to ask she to forgive those day in which he mind only have appear to be engage he believe he could say thing that would force from she the pardon of he previous short-coming if she consider they as such she have be very gracious to he in time past and he do not see why she should not be still more gracious now if he could remove the feeling of resentment which he believe be occasion by she womanly insight into the motive of he conduct toward she during those delightful summer day at midbranch but to get another person to say all this be a very different thing he be sure however that if it be not say now it would never be say it would be death to all he hope if miss march go away feel towards he as she now feel therefore he stiffen he purpose which be quite use to be stiffen harden he sensibility and take he plunge gaze steadfastly at the back of the fireplace while he speak he endeavor to make junius keswick understand the nature and the probable force of the objection to he line of action as a suitor which have grow up in the mind of miss march and he also endeavor to show how completely and absolutely he have be change by the vigor and ardor of he present affection and how he be entitle to be consider by miss march as a lover who have but one thought and purpose and that be to win she and as such he ask she to give he a opportunity to renew he proposal to she now then say lawrence i have place the case before you and i beg you will present it as nearly as possible in the form in which i have give it to you mr croft say junius this case of yours be worse than i think it be what woman of spirit would accept a man who admit that during the whole of he acquaintance with she he have have he doubt in regard to suitability etc but who when a crisis arrive and another man turn up have determine to overlook all he objection and take she anyway that be a very cold-blooded way of put it say lawrence and i do not believe at all that she will look upon it in that light if you will set the matter before she as i have put it to you i believe she will see it as i wish she to see it very well say junius rise and take out he watch i will make you statement as accurately as i can and without any interpretation of my own and now i must bid you good-night i have no idea it be after twelve o'clock and you will observe she mood ask lawrence yes say junius as he open the door i will carefully observe she mood when junius have go lawrence turn he face again toward the fireplace where the last smouldering stick have just break apart in the middle and the two end have wearily fall over the andiron as if they wish it understand that they could do no more burning that night take this as a hint lawrence prepare to retire old isham must have go to bed long ago he say but as i have ask for so much assistance to-day i think it be well that i should try to do some thing for myself it be indeed very late but behind the partially close shutter of a lower room of the house sit old mr keswick gaze at the light that be streaming from the window of the office and wonder what those two man be say to each other that be keep they sit up together until after midnight annie peyton too have not go to bed and look through she chamber window at the office she hope that cousin junius would come away before he lose he temper of course she think he must have be very angry when he come home and find mr croft here at the only time that roberta march have ever visit the house and it be quite natural that he should go to he rival and tell he what he think about it but he have be there a long long time and she do hope they would not get very angry with each other and that nothing would happen one think comfort she very much mr croft be disabled and junius would scorn to take advantage of a man in that condition at a upper window at the other end of the house sit roberta march ready for bed but with no intention of go there until junius keswick have come out of the office know the two man as she do she have no fear that any harm would come to either of they during this long conference whatever its subject might be that she herself be that subject she have not the slightest doubt and although it be of no earthly use for she to sit there and gaze upon that light streaming into the darkness of the yard but reveal to she no more of what be go on inside the room than if it have be the light of a distant star still she sit and speculate at last the office door open and junius come out turn to speak to the occupant of the room as he do so the brief vision of he which the watcher catch as he stand for a moment in the light doorway before step out into the darkness show that he demeanor be as quiet and compose as usual and one of the three woman go to bed very much relieved chapter xxii from breakfast time the next morning until ten o'clock in the forenoon at which hour the midbranch carriage arrive junius keswick have be vainly endeavor to get a opportunity to speak with miss march that lady have remain in she own room nearly all the morning where he cousin have be with she and he aunt who have she own peculiar way of speed the parting guest have retire to some distant spot on the estate either to plan out some farming operation for the ensue season or to prevent she pent-up passion from boil over in she own house thus junius have the lower floor to himself and he stride about in much disquietude debate whether he ought to send a message to roberta or whether he should wait till she have finish she packing or whatever it be that be keep she up-stair he last private interview with she have not be a pleasant one and if he have intend to speak to she for himself he would not have feel much encourage by she manner of the precede evening but he be now engage on the affair of another and he believe that a failure to attend to they would be regard as a breach of faith when mr brandon 's carriage drive into the yard he begin to despair but now roberta come run down stair to speak to sam the driver and ask he how long it would be necessary to rest he horse sam think a hour would be long enough as they would have a good rest when they get home and this matter have be settle junius come forward and request roberta to step in the parlor as he have something to say to she without reply she follow he into the room and he close the door they sit down one on one side of the round center table and one on the other and junius begin he statement he be by profession a lawyer and he have give a great deal of attention to the art of put thing plainly and with a view to a just effect he have carefully prepare in he mind what he should say to roberta he wish to present this man 's message without the slightest exhibition of desire for its success and yet without any tendency to that cold-blooded way of state it to which croft have object he have indeed pick up he adversary 's sword and while he do not wish in hand it to he to prick he with it or do he some such underhand injury he do not think it at all necessary to sharpen the weapon before give it back what junius have to say occupy a good deal of time he express himself carefully and deliberately and as nearly as a skilfully stuff and prepare animal in a museum resemble its wild original of the forest so do he remark resemble those that lawrence would have make have he be there roberta listen to he in silence until he have finish and then she rise to she foot and she manner be such that junius rise also junius keswick she say you have deliberately come to I and offer I the hand of another man in marriage not that say junius i merely come to explain -- do not split hair she interrupt you do exactly that you come to I because he could not come himself and offer he to I now go to he from I and tell he that i accept he and with that she sweep out of the room and come down stair no more until bonnet and accompany by miss annie she hurry to the front door and enter the carriage which be there wait for she with peggy by the driver with some quick good-bye and kiss to annie but never a word to junius or anybody else she drive away if junius keswick have be nervous and anxious that morning as he stride about the house wait for a opportunity to speak to miss march it may well be suppose that lawrence croft shut up in he little room at the end of the yard would be more so he have sit at he window wait and wait he have occasionally see mr keswick come out on the porch and with long stride pace backward and forward and he know by that sign that he have yet no message to bring he he have see the midbranch carriage drive into the yard he have see miss march come out on the porch and speak to the driver and then go in again he have see the carriage drive under a large tree where the horse be take out and lead away to be refresh in a hour or more he see they bring back and harness to the vehicle which be turn and drive up again to the door when some baggage be bring down and strap on a little platform behind shortly afterwards peggy come round the end of the house with a hat on and a little bundle under she arm and approach the carriage make however a wide turn toward the office at which and a mile or two beyond she far-off gaze be steadily direct lawrence throw up the sash and call to she and he guardian imp approach the window be you miss march 's maid i think i have see you at midbranch yaa sah you be do see I offen say peggy do miss march intend to start immediately he ask yaa sah say the good peggy she 'll be out in a minute soon as she do kissin ' mah 's junius good-bye in de parlor and then notice a look of astonishment on the gentleman 's face she add : dey 's gwine to be mar ` ed chris ` mus what exclaim lawrence good-bye mister crof ' say peggy i 's get to hurry up lawrence make no answer but mechanically toss she a coin which pick up she give he a farewell grin and hasten to take she seat by the driver very soon afterward lawrence see roberta come out accompany only by mr null and hurry down the step forget he injured ankle he spring to he foot and step quickly to the door open it and stand on the threshold but miss march do not even look he way he gaze at she with wide-open eye as she hastily kiss mr null and spring into the carriage which be immediately drive off as mr null turn to go into the house she look toward the office and nod to he he believe that she would have come to he if he have call she but he do not call he mind be in such a condition that he would not have be capable of frame a question have she come he feel that he could speak to no one until he have see keswick close the door he go back to he chair and as he do so he ankle pained he sadly but of this he scarcely think he do not have to wait long for junius keswick for in about ten minute that individual enter lawrence turn as he visitor open the door and he see a countenance which have undergo a very noticeable change it be not dark or lower it be not pale but it be gray and hard and the eye look larger than lawrence have remember they without preface or greet junius approach he and say : i have take you message to miss march and have bring you one in return you be accept lawrence push back he chair and stare blankly at the other what do you mean he presently ask i mean what i say say keswick miss march have accept you a crowd of emotion rush through the brain of lawrence croft joy be among they but it be a joy that be jostle and shake and push this way and that i do not understand he say i do not expect such a decisive message i suppose she might send I some encouragement some -- why do not she see I before she leave i be not here to explain she action if i could say junius who have not sit down she say : ` tell he i accept he ' that be all good morning but stop cry lawrence on he foot again you must tell I more than that do you say to she only what i say to you how do it affect she oh say junius turn suddenly at the door i forget that you ask I to observe she mood well she be very angry with I cry lawrence with I say junius and close the door behind he he stride away the accept lover sit down he have never speak more truly than when he say he do not understand it be she really mine he exclaim and with he eye fix on the blank wall over the mantel-piece he repeat over and over again : be she mine be she really mine he have well develop mental power but the work of set this matter straight and plain be too difficult for he if she have send he some such message as this : i be very angry with you but some day you can come and explain yourself to I he heart would have leap for joy he would have believe that he peace have be make and that he have only to go to she to call she he own now he heart desire to leap with joy but it do not seem to know how to do it the situation be such a anomalous one after such a message as this why have she not let he see she why have she be angry with keswick be that pique and then a dark thought cross he mind have he be accept to punish the other no he could not believe that no woman such as roberta march would give herself away from such a motive have keswick be joke with he no he could not believe that no man could joke with such a face even the fact that mr keswick have not bid miss march farewell trouble the mind of lawrence it be true that she might not yet know that the match which she have so much encourage have be finally make but something must be very wrong or she would not have be absent at the moment of she guest 's departure and what do that beastly little negro mean by tell he that keswick and miss march be to be marry at christmas and that the two be kiss each other good-bye in the parlor why the man have not even come out to put she in the carriage and the omission of this courtesy be very remarkable these question be entirely too difficult for he to resolve by himself it be absolutely necessary that more should be tell to he and explain to he see the negro boy plez cross the yard he call he and ask he to tell mr keswick that mr croft wish to see he immediately mah ' junius say the boy he do go to de railroad to take de kyars he do take he knapsack on he back a ' walk ` cross de fiel 's when about a hour or two afterwards uncle isham bring mr croft he dinner the old negro appear to have lose that air of attentive geniality which he usually put on while wait on the gentleman lawrence however take no notice of this but before the man reach the table on which he be to place the tray he carry he ask : be it true that mr keswick have go away by train yaa sah answer isham and where be mrs keswick ask lawrence be not she in the house no sah do gwine vis ` tin i ` spec when will she return dunno say isham she nebber come to I a ' tell I whar she gwine a ' when she comin ' back and then after satisfy himself that nothing more be need of he for the present isham leave the room and when he reach the kitchen he address himself to its plump mistress : letty say he when dat ar mister crof have get froo wid he dinner you go a ' fotch back de plates a ' dish he ax too many question to suit I dis day you be poh ` ly to-day uncle isham say letty yaa say the old man i 's right much on the careen uncle isham perhaps be not more loyal to the widow keswick than many old servant be and be to they former mistress but he loyalty be peculiar in that it related principally to he regard for she character this regard he wish to be very high and it always trouble and unsettle he mind when the old lady herself or anybody else interfere with he effort to keep it high for year he have be hope that the time would come when she would cease to rar and chawge but she have continue at interval to indulge in that most unsuitable exercise and now that it appear that she have rear and charge again she old servant be much depressed she have go away from the house and for all he know she might stay away for day or week as she have do before and uncle isham be never so much on the careen as when he find himself force to believe that he old mistress be still a woman who could do a thing like that letty have no objection to answer question but much to she disappointment lawrence ask she none he have have enough of catechising negro but he request she to ask mr null if she would be kind enough to step out for a few minute and speak to he when very shortly thereafter that lady appear lawrence be seat at he open door ready to receive she how be you she say and how be you ankle to-day you have have nobody to attend to it it have hurt I a good deal he answer i think i must have give it a wrench this morning but i put on it some of the lotion mr keswick leave with I and it feel better it be too bad say mr null that you have to attend to it yourself not at all say lawrence now that i know how i can do it perfectly well and i do not care a snap about my ankle except that it interfere with more important affair why do you suppose miss march go away without speak to I or take leave of I in any way i think that would trouble you say she and to speak honestly i do not think it be right but roberta be in a very agitate condition when she leave here and i do not believe she ever think of take leave of you or any one except I she and i be very good friend but she do not confide much in I but one thing i be pretty sure of and that be that she be dreadfully angry with my cousin junius and i be very sorry for that how do he anger she asked lawrence wish to find out how much this young woman know i have not the least idea say miss annie all i know be she have quite a long talk with he in the parlor and after that she come fly up-stair just as indignant as she could be she do not say much but i could see how she soul rage within she and now the young lady stop speak and look straight into lawrence 's face it be not possible she say that you have be send my cousin to propose to she for you this be not a pleasant question to answer and besides lawrence have make up he mind that the period have pass for make confidant of other person in regard to he love affair do you suppose i would do that he say no i do not miss annie answer cousin junius would never have undertake such a thing and i do not believe you would be cruel enough to ask he thank you for you good opinion say lawrence and now can you tell I when mr keswick be expect to return he have go back to washington and he tell I he should stay there some time and why have not mrs keswick be out to see I ask lawrence you be dreadfully inquisitive say miss annie but to tell you the simple truth mr croft i do not believe aunt keswick take any further interest in you now that roberta have go she have set she heart on make a match between you two and do it here without delay and i think that everything go wrong about this have put she into the state of mind she be in now have she really go away ask lawrence oh that do not amount to anything say miss annie she go over the field to howlett 's to see the postmistress who be a old friend to whom she often go for comfort when thing be not right at home but i be go after she this afternoon in the spring wagon i 'll take plez along with I to open the gate i be sure i shall bring she back i must admit mr null say lawrence that i be very inquisitive but you can easily understand how much i be troubled and perplexed i expect miss march 's go away trouble you more than anything else say she that be true he answer but then there be other thing which give I a great deal of anxiety i come here to be for a day or two the guest of a lady on whom i have no manner of claim for prolonged hospitality and now here i be compel to stay in this room and depend on she kindness or forbearance for everything i have i would go away immediately but i know it would injure I to travel the few step i take yesterday have probably set I back for several day oh it would never do for you to travel say she with such a sprain ankle as you have it would certainly injure you very much to be drive all the way to the green sulphur spring i be tell the road be very rough between here and there but perhaps you do not notice it have come over on horseback yes i do notice it and i could not stand that drive and even if i could be get to the train to go north i should have to walk a good deal at the station you simply must not think of it say miss annie and now let I give you a piece of advice i be a practical person as you may know and i like to do thing in a practical way the very best thing that you can do be to arrange with aunt keswick to stay here as a boarder until you ankle be well she have take boarder and in this case i do not think she would refuse as i tell you before you must not expect she to take the same interest in you that she do when you first come but she be really a kind woman though she have such dreadfully funny way and she would not have neglect you to-day if it have not be that she mind be entirely wrap up in other thing if you like i 'll propose such a arrangement to she this afternoon you be very kind indeed say lawrence but be there not danger of offend she by such a proposition yes i think there be answer miss annie and i have no doubt she will fly out into a passion when she hear that the gentleman whom she invite here as a guest propose to stay as a boarder but i think i can pacify she and make she look at the matter in the proper way but why mention it at all and put yourself to all that trouble about it say lawrence why of course because i think you will be so much better satisfied and content to keep quiet and get well if you feel that you have a right to stay here if aunt keswick be not so very different from other people i would not have mention this matter for really there be no necessity for it but i know very well that if you be to drop out of she mind for two or three day and should not see anything of she that you would become dreadfully nervous about stay here you be certainly very practical mr null and very sensible and very very kind and nothing could suit I better under the circumstance than the plan you propose but i be extremely anxious not to give offence to you aunt she have treat I with the utmost kindness and hospitality oh do not trouble yourself about that say miss annie with a little laugh i be get to know she so well that i think i can manage a affair like this very easily and now i must be off or it will be too late for I to go to howlett 's this afternoon and i be a very slow driver be you sure there be nothing you want i shall go directly past the store and can stop as well as not thank you very much say lawrence but i do not believe that howlett 's possess a article that i need one thing i will ask you to do for I before you go i want to write a letter and i find that i be out of paper therefore i shall be very much oblige to you if you will let I have some and some envelope why certainly say miss annie and she go into the house she look over the stock of paper which she aunt keep in a desk in the dining-room but she do not like it i do not believe he will want to write on such ordinary paper as this she say to herself whereupon she go up-stair and get some of she own paper and envelope which be much finer in material and more correct in style i do not like it a bit she think to give this to he to write that letter on but i suppose it be bind to be write anyway so he might as well have the satisfaction of good paper you must excuse these little sheet she say when she take it to he but you could not expect anything else in a amazonian household like ours cousin junius have manly stationery of course but i suppose it be all lock up in that secretary in you room oh this will do very well indeed say lawrence and i wish i could come out and help you into you vehicle regard the spring wagon which now stand at the door with plez at the head of the solemn sorrel thank you say miss annie that be not at all necessary and she trip over to the spring wagon and mount into its altitude without the least trouble in the world she take up the rein with these firmly grasp in she little hand which be stretch very far out and hold very wide apart she give the horse a great jerk and tell he to get up as she move off lawrence from he open door call out : _ bon voyage _ and in a full clear voice she thank he but do not dare to look around so intent be she upon she charioteering slowly turn the horse toward the yard gate which plez stand hold open she whole soul be absorb in the act of guide the equipage through the gateway quickly glance from side to side and then at the horse 's back which ought to occupy a medium position between the two gatepost she safely steer the front wheel through the dangerous pass although a grin of delight cover the face of plez as he notice that the hub of one of the hind wheel almost graze a post then the observant boy run on to open the other gate and with many jerk and cluck miss annie induce the sorrel to break into a gentle trot as lawrence look after she a little pang make itself noticeable in he conscience this girl be certainly very kind to he and most remarkably considerate of he in the plan she have propose and yet he feel that he have prevaricate to she and in fact deceive she in the answer he have make when she ask he if he have send she cousin to speak for he to miss march would she have such friendly feeling toward he and be so willing to oblige he if she know that he have in effect do the thing which she consider so wrong and so cruel but it could not be help the time have pass for confidence he must now work out this affair for himself without regard to person who really have nothing whatever to do with it close he door he hop back to he table and seat himself at it he open he travel inkstand and prepare to write to miss march it be absolutely necessary that he should write this letter immediately for after the message he have receive from the lady of he love no time should be lose in put himself in communication with she but before begin to write he must decide upon the spirit of he letter under the very peculiar circumstance of he acceptance he do not feel that he ought to indulge in those rapturous expression of ecstacy in which he most certainly would have indulge if the lady have personally deliver she decision to he he do not doubt she for what woman would play a joke like that on a man -- upon two man in fact even if there be no other reason she would not dare to do it nor do he doubt keswick it would have be impossible for he to come with such a message if it have not be deliver to he and yet lawrence could not bring himself to be rapturous if he have be accept in cold blood and a hand and not a heart have be give to he he would gladly take that hand and trust to himself to so warm the heart that it also would soon be he but he do not know what roberta march have give he on the other hand he know very well if in he first letter as a accept lover he should exhibit any of that caution and prudence which in the course of he courtship have prove to be shoal on which he have very nearly run aground that roberta 's resentment which have show itself very mark in this regard would probably be rouse to such a extent that the affair would be bring to a very speedy and abrupt termination if she have be oblige to forgive he once for this line of conduct he could not expect she to do it again to write a letter which should err in neither of these respects be a very difficult thing to do and require so much preparatory thought that when toward the close of the afternoon miss annie drive in at the yard gate with mr keswick on the seat beside she not a line have be write mr keswick descend from the spring wagon and go into the house but miss annie remain at the bottom of the step for the apparent purpose of speak to plez perhaps to give he some instruction in regard to the lead of a horse to its stable or to instil into he mind some moral principle or other but the moment the vehicle move away she run over to the office and tap at the window which be quickly open by lawrence i have speak to she about it she say and although she blaze up at first so that i think i should be burn alive i make she understand just how matter really be and she have agree to let you stay here as a boarder you be extremely good say lawrence and must be a most admirable manager this arrangement make I feel much better satisfied than i could have be otherwise then lean a little further out of the window he ask : but what be i to do for company while i be shut up here oh you will have uncle isham and aunt keswick and sometimes I but i hope that you will soon be able to come into the house and take you meal and spend you evening with we you have nothing but good wish for I he say and i believe if you could manage it you would have I cure by magic and send off well and whole to-morrow of course say miss annie very promptly good night just before supper mr keswick come in to see lawrence she be very grave almost severe and she conversation be confine to inquiry as to the state of he ankle and he general comfort but lawrence take no offence at she manner and be very gracious say some exceedingly neat thing about the way he have be treat and after a little she manner slightly mollify and she remark : and so you let miss march go away without settle anything now lawrence consider this a very incorrect statement but he have no wish to set the old lady right he know it would joy she heart and make she more he friend than ever if he should tell she that miss march have accept he but this would be a very dangerous piece of information to put in she hand he do not know what use she would make of it or what damage she might unwittingly do to he prospects and so he merely answer : i have no idea she would leave so soon well say the old lady i suppose after all that you need not give it up yet i understand that she be not go to new york before the end of the month and you may be well enough before that to ride over to midbranch i hope so most assuredly say he lawrence devote that evening to he letter it be a long one and be write with a most earnest desire to embrace all the merit of each of the two kind of letter which have before be allude to and to avoid all they fault when it be finish he read it tear it up and throw it in the fire chapter xxiii the next day open bright and clear and before ten o'clock the thermometer have rise to seventy degree instead of sit in front of the fireplace lawrence have he chair and table bring close to he open doorway where he could look out on the same beautiful scene which have greet he eye a few day before but what be the good he think of this green grass this sunny air that blue sky those white cloud and the distant tinted foliage without that figure which a few day ago stand in the foreground of the picture but as the woman to whom in he soul 's sight the whole world be but a background be not there he turn he eye from the warm autumnal scene and prepared again to write to she he have scarcely take up he pen however when he be interrupt by the arrival of miss annie who come to bring he a book she have just finish read a late english novel which she think might be more interesting than those she have send he the book be one which lawrence have not see and want to see but in talk about it to the young lady he discover that she have not read all of it do not let I deprive you of the book say lawrence if you have begin it you ought to go on with it oh do not trouble you mind about that she say with a laugh i have finish it but i have not read a word of the beginning i only look at the end of it to see how the story turn out i always do that before i read a novel this remark much amuse lawrence do you know say he that i would rather not read novel at all than to read they in that way i must begin at the beginning and go regularly through as the author wish he reader to do and perhaps when you get to the end say miss annie you 'll find that the wrong man get she and then you 'll wish you have not read the story as you appear to be satisfy with this novel say lawrence i wish you would read it to I and then i would feel that i be not take a uncourteous precedence of you i 'll read it to you say she or at least as much as you want I to for i feel quite sure that after you get interested in it you will want to take it yourself and read straight on till it be finish instead of wait for some one to come and give you a chapter or two at a time that would be the way with I i know i shall be delighted to have you read to I say lawrence when can you begin now she say if you choose but perhaps you wish to write not at this moment say lawrence turn from the table unfortunately i have plenty of leisure where will you sit and he reach out he hand for a chair oh i do not want a chair say annie take she seat on the broad door-step this be exactly what i like i be devote to sit on step do not you think there be something dreadfully stiff about always be perch up in a chair yes say lawrence on some occasion and forthwith she begin upon the first chapter and have read five line of this she go back and read the title page suddenly remember that mr croft like to begin a book at the very beginning miss annie have be accustom to read to she father and she read aloud very well and like it as she sit there shaded by a great locust tree which have drop so many yellow leaf upon the grass that now and then it could not help let a little fleck of sunshine come down upon she sometimes gilding for a moment she light-brown hair sometimes touch the end of a crimson ribbon she wear and again rest for a brief space on the toe of a very small boot just visible at the edge of she dress lawrence look at she and say to himself : be it possible that this be the rather pale young girl in black who give I change from behind the desk of mr candy 's information shop i do not believe it that young person spring up temporarily and be defunct this be some one else she read three chapter before she consider it time to go into the house to see if it be necessary for she to do anything about dinner when she leave he lawrence turn again to he write that afternoon he send mrs null a little note on the back of a card ask she if she could let he have a few more sheet of paper lawrence find this request necessary as he have use up that day all the paper she have send he and the small torn piece of it now litter the fireplace he must be write a diary letter say miss annie to herself when she receive this message such as we girl use to write when we be at school and bring down a little the corner of she mouth she take from she stationery box what she think would be quite paper enough to send to a man for such a purpose but although the means be thus make abundant the letter to miss march be not then write lawrence finally determine that it be simply impossible for he to write to the lady until he know more what keswick have tell he have be absurdly little and he have hurry away before there have be time to ask further question instead of send a letter to miss march he would write to keswick and would put to he a series of interrogation the answer to which would make he understand better the position in which he stand then he would write to miss march the next day miss annie could not read to he in the morning because as she come and tell he she be go to howlett 's on a errand for she aunt but there would be time to give he a chapter or two before dinner when she come back would it be any trouble say lawrence for you to mail a letter for I oh no say miss annie but not precisely in the same tone in which she would have tell he that it would be no trouble to read to he two or three chapter of a novel and yet she would pass directly by the residence of miss harriet corvey the post-mistress as miss annie walk along the narrow path which run by the roadside to howlett 's with the blue sky above she and the pleasant October sunshine all about she and follow at a little distance by the boy plez carry a basket she do not seem to be take that enjoyment in she walk which be she wont she brow be slightly contract and she look straight in front of she without see anything in particular after the manner of person whose attention be entirely occupy in look into they own mind at something they do not like it be too much she say almost loud she brow contract a little more as she speak it be bad enough to have to furnish the paper but for I to have to carry the letter be entirely too much and at this she involuntarily glance at the thick and double stamped missive which have no pocket she carry in she hand she have not look at it before and as she eye fall upon the address she stop so suddenly that plez who be doze as he walk nearly run into she what she exclaim ` junius keswick five q street washington district of columbium ' be it possible that mr croft have be write to he all this time she now walk on and although she still seem to notice not the material object around she the frown disappear from she brow and she mental vision seem to be fix upon something more pleasant than that which have occupy it before as it will be remembered she have refuse positively to have anything to do with lawrence 's suit to miss march and it be a relief to she to know that the letter she be carry be not for that lady but why think she should he be write for two whole evening to junius i expect that he would write to she to find out why she go off and leave he in that way but i do not suppose he would want to write to junius it seem to I they have time enough that night they be together to talk over everything they have to say and then she begin to wonder what they have to say and gradually the conviction grow upon she that mr croft be a very very honorable man of course it be wrong that he should have come here to try to win a lady who if one look at it in the proper light really belong to another but it now come into she mind that mr croft must by degree have see this for himself and that it be the subject of he long conference with junius and also most probably of this letter the conference certainly end amicably and in that case it be scarcely possible that junius have give up he claim he be not that kind of a man if mr croft have become convinced that he ought to retire from this contest and have do so and roberta have be inform of it that would explain everything that have happen roberta 's state of mind after she have have the talk in the parlor with junius and she hurry departure without take the slightest notice of either of the gentleman be quite natural what woman would like to know that she have be bargain about and that she two lover have agree which of they should have she it be quite to be expect that she would be very angry at first though there be no doubt she would get over it so far as junius be concerned have thus decide entirely to she own satisfaction that this be the state of affair she think it be a grand thing that there be two such young man in the world as she cousin and mr croft who could arrange such a affair in so kindly and honorable a manner without feeling that they be oblige to fight -- that horribly stupid way in which such thing use to be settle this vision of masculine high-mindedness which miss annie have call up seem very pleasant to she and she mental satisfaction be denote by a pretty little glow which come into she face and by a certain increase of sprightliness in she walk now then -- she say to herself and although she do not finish the sentence even in she own mind the sky increase the intensity of its beautiful blue the sun begin to shine with a more golden radiance the little bird who have not yet go south chirp to each other as merrily as if it have be early summer the yellow and purple wild flower of autumn throw into they blossom a richer coloring and even the blade of grass seem to stretch themselves upward green tender and promising and when the young lady skip up the step of the post-office she drop the letter into miss harriet corvey 's little box with the air of a mother-bird feeding a young one with the first ripe cherry of the year a day or two after this lawrence find himself able by the aid of a cane and a rude crutch which uncle isham have make for he and the top of which mr keswick have carefully pad to make he way from the office to the house and after that he take he meal and pass the greater part of he time in the larger edifice sometimes he ransack the old library sometimes miss annie read to he and sometimes he read to she in the evening there be game of card in which the old lady would occasionally take a hand although more frequently miss annie and mr croft be oblige to content themselves with some game at which two could play but the pleasantest hour perhaps be those which be spend in talk for lawrence have travel a good deal and have see so many of the thing in foreign land which miss annie have always wish that she could see lawrence be wait until he should hear from mr keswick so that with some confidence in he position he could write to miss march he trunk have be send over from the green sulphur spring and he be much better satisfied to wait here than at that desert watering-place it be indeed a very agreeable spot in which to wait and quite near enough to midbranch for he to carry on he desire operation when the time should arrive he be a little annoyed that keswick 's answer should be so long in come but he resolve not to worry himself about it the answer be probably a difficult letter to write and one which keswick would not be likely to dash off in a hurry he remember too that the mail be send and receive only twice a week at howlett 's old mr keswick be kind to he but grave and rather silent once she pass the open door of the parlor by the window of which sit miss annie and lawrence deeply engage they head together in study out something on a map and as she go up-stair she grimly grin and say to herself : if that null could look in and see they now i reckon we young man would wish he have the use of all he arm and leg but if mr null should disapprove of he wife and that gentleman from new york spending so much of they time together old mr keswick have not the least objection in the world she be well satisfied that mr croft should find it interesting enough to stay here until the time come when he should be able to go to midbranch when that period arrive she would not be slow to urge he to he duty in spite of any obstacle mr brandon might put in he way so for the present she possess she soul in as much peace as the soul of a headstrong and very wilful old lady be capable of be possess chapter xxiv the letter which lawrence croft have write to junius keswick be not answer for more than a week and when the answer arrive it do not come through the howlett 's post-office but be bring from a mail station on the railway by a special messenger in this epistle mr keswick state that he would have write much sooner but for the fact that he have be away from washington and have just return have find mr croft 's letter wait for he the answer be write in a tone which lawrence do not at all expect it breathe the spirit of a man who be determine and almost defiant it tell mr croft that the writer do not now believe that miss march 's acceptance of the say mr croft should be consider of any value whatever it be the result of a very peculiar condition of thing in which he regret have take a part and it be give in a moment of pique and indignation which give miss march a right to reconsider she hasty decision if she choose to do so it would not be fair for either of they to accept as conclusive word say under the extraordinary circumstance which surround miss march when she say those word you ask I to do you a favor write junius keswick and very much against my inclination and against what be now my judgment i do it i now ask you to do I a favor and i do not think you should refuse it i ask you not to communicate with miss march until i have see she and have obtain from she a explanation of the acceptance in question i have a right to this explanation and i feel confident that it will be give to I you ask I what i truly believe miss march mean by she message to you i answer that i do not know but i intend to find out what she mean and as soon as i do so i will write to you i think therefore consider what you have ask I to do and what you have write to I about what i have do that you can not refuse to abstain from any further action in the matter until i be enable to answer you i can not leave washington immediately but i shall go to midbranch in a very few day this letter be very far from be a categorical answer to lawrence 's question and it disappointed and somewhat annoy that gentleman but after he have read it for the second time and carefully consider it he put it in he pocket and say to himself this end all discussion of this subject mr keswick may be right in the position he take or he may be wrong he may go to midbranch he may get he explanation and he may send it to I but without any regard to what he do or say or write i shall go to miss march as soon as i be able to use my ankle and whether she be at she uncle 's house or whether she have go to new york or to any other place i shall see she and myself obtain from she a explanation of this acceptance this be due to I as well as to mr keswick and if he think he ought to get it for himself i also think i ought to get it for myself the good result of lawrence 's great care in regard to he injured ankle soon begin to show themselves the joint have slowly but steadily regain its strength and usual healthy condition and lawrence now find that he could walk about without the assistance of he rude crutch he be still prudent however and take but very short walk and in these he lean upon he trusty cane the charming autumn day which often come to virginia in late October and early November be now at they best day after day the sun shone brightly but there be in the air a invigorating coolness which make its radiance something to be seek for and not avoid it be just after dinner and it be Saturday afternoon when miss annie announce that she be go to see old aunt patsy whom she have somewhat neglect of late may i go with you say lawrence miss annie shake she head doubtfully i should be very glad to have you company she say but i be afraid it will be entirely too much of a walk for you the day be so short that the sun will be low before we could get back and if you should be tire it would not do for you to sit down and rest at that time of day i believe say lawrence that my ankle be quite strong enough for I to walk to aunt patsy 's and back without sit down to rest i would be very glad to go with you and i would like too to see that venerable color woman again well say miss annie if you really think you can walk so far it will be very nice indeed to have you go but you ought to feel very sure that it will not hurt you come along say lawrence take up he hat and cane after a man have be shut up as lawrence have be a pleasant ramble like this be a most delightful change and he do not hesitate to manifest he pleasure this touch the very sensitive soul of he companion and with such a sparkle of talk do she evince she gratification that almost any one would have be able to see that she be a young lady who have a earnest sympathy with those who have undergo affliction but be now free from they aunt patsy be glad to see she visitor particularly glad it seem to see mr croft she be quite loquacious consider the great length of she day and the proverbial shortness of she tongue why aunt patsy say miss annie you seem to have grow

very earnest voice : i reckon dat dat ar sprain ankle be nuffin but a acciden ' but you look out sah you look out hab you get dem little shoe handy oh yes say lawrence i have they in my trunk keep 'em whar you kin put you han ' on 'em say aunt patsy impressively you may want 'em yit you min ' my wud i shall be sure to remember say lawrence as he hasten out to rejoin annie what in the world have aunt patsy to say to you ask that somewhat surprised young lady then lawrence tell she how some time before aunt patsy have give he a pair of blue shoe which she say would act as a preventive charm in case mr keswick should ever wish to do he harm and that she have now call he back to remind he not to neglect this mean of personal protection i can not imagine say lawrence that you aunt would ever think of such a thing as do I a harm or how those little shoe would prevent she if she want to but i suppose aunt patsy be crack-brain on some subject and so i think it best to humor she and take the shoe do you know say miss annie after walk a little distance in silence that i be afraid aunt patsy have do a dreadful thing and one i never should have suspect she of aunt keswick have a little baby once and it die very young she keep its clothes in a box and i remember when i be a little girl that she once show they to I and tell I i be to take the place of that little girl and that frightened I dreadfully because i think that i would have to die and have my clothes put in a box i recollect perfectly that there be a pair of little blue shoe among these clothes and aunt patsy must have steal they that surprise I say lawrence i suppose from what i have hear of the old woman that she be perfectly honest so she be say annie she have be a trust servant in we family nearly all she life but some negro have very queer idea about take certain thing and i suppose aunt patsy have some particular reason for take those shoe for of course they could be of no value to she i be very sorry say lawrence that such sacred relic should have come into my possession but i must admit that i would not like to give they back to you aunt oh no say annie that would never do and i would not dare to try to find she box and put they in it it would seem like a desecration for any hand but she own to touch those thing that be true say lawrence and you might get yourself into a lot of trouble by endeavor to repair the mischief before i leave here we may think of some plan of dispose of the little trotter it might be well to give they back to aunt patsy and tell she to restore they i do not know say miss annie with a slowness of reply and a irrelevance of demeanor which indicate she be not thinking of the word she be speak the sun be now very near the horizon and that evening coolness which in the autumn come on so quickly after the sunshine fade out of the air make lawrence give a little shrug with he shoulder he propose that they should quicken they pace and as he companion make no objection they soon reach the house the next day be Sunday breakfast be rather later than usual and as lawrence look out on the bright morning with the mist just disengage themselves from the many-hued foliage which crown the top of the surround hill and on the recently rise sun hang in a atmosphere of gray and lilac with the smile of indian summer on its face he think he would like to take a stroll before that meal but either the length of he walk on the previous day or the rapidity of the latter portion of it have be rather too much for the newly-recovered strength of he ankle which now feel somewhat stiff and sore when he mention this at the breakfast table he receive a good deal of condolence from the two lady especially mr keswick and at first it be think that it might be well for he to give up he propose attendance at the negro church but to this lawrence strongly object for he very much desire to see some of the peculiar religious service of the negro he have be talk on the subject the evening before with mr keswick who have tell he that in this part of the country which lay in the black belt of virginium where the negro population have always be thickest these ceremony be more characteristic of the religious disposition of the african than in those section of the state where the white race exert a greater influence upon the manners and custom of the color people but it will not be necessary to walk much say miss annie we can take the spring-wagon and you can go with we aunt the old lady permit herself a little grin when i go to church she say i go to a white folk ' church and try to see what i can of white folk ' christianity though i must say that christianity of the other color be often just as good as far as work go but it be natural that a stranger should want to see what kind of service the color people have so you two might as well get into the spring-wagon and go along but shall we not deprive you of the vehicle say lawrence i never go to church in the spring-wagon say the old lady so long as i be able to walk and besides this be not we Sunday for preach it seem to lawrence that a elderly person who go about in a purple calico sun-bonnet and with a umbrella of the same material might go to church in a wheelbarrow so far as appearance be concerned but he have long cease to wonder at mr keswick 's idiosyncrasy i remember very well say miss annie after the old lady have leave the table which she always do as soon as she have finish a meal when aunt keswick use to go to church in a big family carriage which be now sleep itself to piece out there in the barn but then she have a pair of big gray horse one of they name doctor and the other colonel but now she have only one horse and i be go to tell uncle isham to harness that one up before he go to church himself you know he be to take aunt patsy in the ox-cart so he will have to go early they go to the negro church in the spring-wagon lawrence drive the jogging sorrel and miss annie on the seat beside he when they reach the old frame edifice in the wood beyond howlett 's they find gather there quite a large assemblage for this be one of those very attractive occasion call a big preach horse and mule and wagon of various kind many of the latter contain basket of refreshment be stand about under the tree and mr keswick 's cart and ox tethered to a little pine tree give proof that aunt patsy have arrive the inside of the church be nearly full and outside around the door stand a large number of man and boy the white visitor be look upon with some surprise but way be make for they to approach the door and as soon as they enter the building two of the officer of the church come forward to show they to one of the uppermost seat but this honor miss annie strenuously decline she prefer a seat near the open door and therefore she and mr croft be give a bench in that vicinity of which they have sole possession to lawrence who have never see anything of the sort the service which now begin be exceedingly interesting and as annie have not be to a negro church since she be a little girl and very seldom then she give very earnest and animated attention to what be go on the singing as it always be among the negro be powerful and melodious and the long prayer of brother enoch hine be one of those spirited and emotional statement of personal condition and wild and ardent supplication which generally pave the way for a most powerful awaken in a assemblage of this kind another hymn sing in more vigorous tone than the first one warm up the congregation to such a degree that when brother hine open the bible and make preparation for he discourse he look out upon a audience as anxious to be move and stir as he be to move and stir it the sermon be intend to be a long one for have it be otherwise brother hine have lose he reputation and therefore the preacher after a few prefatory statement deliver in a grave and solemn manner plunge boldly into the midst of he exhortation know that he could go either backward or forward present with equal acceptance fresh subject matter or that already use so long as he strength hold out he have not preach half a hour before he hearer be so stir and move that a majority of they find it utterly impossible to merely sit still and listen in different way they awakening be manifest some begin to sing in a low voice other gently rock they body while fervent ejaculation of various kind be hear from all part of the church from this beginning arise gradually a scene of religious activity such as lawrence have never imagine each individual allow he or she fervor to express itself accord to the method which best please the worshipper some keep to they seat and listen to the word of the preacher interrupt he occasionally by fervent ejaculation other sing and shout sometimes stand up clap they hand and stamp they foot while a large proportion of the able-bodied member leave they seat and push they way forward to the wide open space which surround the preacher 's desk and prepare to engage in the exhilarating ceremony of the jerusalem jump two concentric ring be form around the preacher the inner one compose of woman the outer one of man the face of those form the inner ring be turn towards those in the outer as soon as all be in place each brother reach forth he hand and take the hand of the sister opposite to he and then each couple begin to jump up and down violently shake hand and singing at the top of they voice after about a minute of this the two circle move one one way and one another so that each brother find himself opposite a different sister hand be again immediately seize and the jump hand-shaking and singing go on minute by minute the excitement increase faster the worshipper jump and louder they sing through it all brother enoch hine keep on with he sermon it be very difficult now to make himself hear and the time for explanation or elucidation have long since pass all he could do be to shout forth certain important and moving fact and this he do over and over again hold he hand at the side of he mouth as if he be hail a vessel in the wind much of what he say be lose in the din of the jumper but ever and anon could be hear ring through the church the announcement : de wheel ob time be a turnin ' roun ' in a group by themselves in a upper corner of the congregation be four or five very old woman who be able to manifest they pious enthusiasm in no other way than by rock they body backwards and forwards and singing with they crack voice a gruesome and monotonous chant this rude song have something of a wild and uncivilized nature as if it have come down to these old people from the savage rite of they african ancestor they do not sing in unison but each squeak or pipe out she yus wiho yus hoo accord to the strength of she lung and the degree of she exaltation prominent among these be old aunt patsy she little black eye sparkling through she great iron-bound spectacles she head and body moving in unison with the wild air of the unintelligible chant she sing she long skinny hand clap up and down upon she knee while she foot encase in they great green baize slipper unceasingly beat time upon the floor so many person be absent from they seat the group of old woman be clearly visible to annie and lawrence and aunt patsy also could easily see they whenever she head in its ceaseless move from side to side allow she eye to fall upon the two white visitor she ardor and fervency increase and she seem to be express a pious gratitude that miss annie and he whom she suppose to be she husband be still together in peace and safety annie be much affect by all she see and hear she face be slightly pale and occasionally she be move by a little nervous tremor mr croft too be very attentive he soul be not move to enthusiasm and he do not feel as he companion do now and then that he would like to jump up and join in the dancing and the shout but the scene make a very strong impression upon he around and around go the two ring of man and woman jump singing and hand-shaking out from the center of they come the stentorian shout : de wheel ob time be a turnin ' roun ' from all part of the church rise snatch of hymn exultant shout groan and prayer and in the corner the shrill chant of the old woman be fitfully hear through the storm of discordant worship in the midst of all the wild din and hubbub the soul of aunt patsy look out from the habitation where it have dwell so long and without give the slightest notice to any one or attract the least attention by its movement it silently slip away the old habitation of the soul still sit in its chair but no one notice that it no longer sing or beat time with its hand and foot not long after this lawrence look round at he companion and notice that she be slightly tremble do not you think we have have enough of this he whisper yes she answer and they rise and go out they think they be the first who have leave chapter xxv when mr croft and miss annie get into the spring-wagon and the head of the sorrel be turn away from the church lawrence look at he watch and remark that as it be still quite early there might be time for a little drive before go back to the house for dinner the face of the young lady beside he be still slightly pale and the thought come to he that it would be very well for she if she mind could be divert from the abnormally inspiriting scene she have just witness dinner will be late to-day she say for i see letty do she best among the jerusalem jumper very well say he we will drive and now where shall we go if we take the cross-road at the store say miss annie and go on for about half a mile we can turn into the wood and then there be a beautiful road through the tree which will bring we out on the other side of aunt keswick 's house junius take I that way not long ago so they turn at the store much to the disgust of the plod sorrel who think he be go directly home and they soon reach the road that lead through the wood this be hard and sandy as be many of the road through the forest in that part of the country and it would have be a very good drive road have it not be for the occasional protrusion of tree root which give the wheel a little bump and for the branch which now and then hang down somewhat too low for the comfort of a lady and gentleman ride in a rather high spring-wagon without a cover but lawrence drive slowly and so the root bump be not notice and when the low-hanging bough be on he side he lift they so that he companion 's head could pass under and when they happen to be on she side annie duck she head and she hat be never brush off but at time they drive quite a distance without overhang bough and the pine tree surround by they smooth carpet of brown spine give forth a spicy fragrance in the warm but sparkling air the oak tree stand up still dark and green while the chestnut be all dress in rich yellow with the chinquepin bush by the roadside imitate they in color as they try to do in fruit sometimes a spray of purple flower could be see among the tree and great patch of sunlight which here and there come through the thin foliage fall now upon the brilliantly scarlet leaf of a sweet-gum and now upon the polished and brown-red dress of a neighbor black-gum the wood be very quiet there be no sound of bird or insect and the occasional hare or molly cotton-tail as annie delightedly call it who hop across the road make no noise at all a gentle wind among the top of the taller tree make a sound as of a distant sea but besides this little be hear but the low crunching noise of the wheel and the voice of lawrence and miss annie reach a place where the road branch lawrence stop the horse and look up each leafy lane they be completely desert white people seldom walk abroad at this hour on Sunday and the negro of the neighborhood be at church be not this a frightfully lonely place he say one might imagine himself in a desert i like it reply annie it be so different from the wild exciting tumult of that church i be glad you take I away at first i would not have miss it for the world but there seem to come into the stormy scene something oppressive and almost terrifying i be glad i take you away say lawrence but it seem to I that you impression be not altogether natural i think that amid all that mad enthusiasm you be over-excited not depress a solemn solitude like this would to my think be much more likely to lower you spirit i do not like solitude myself and therefore i suppose it be that i think a impressible nature like yours would find something sad in the loneliness of these silent wood annie turn and fix on he she large blue eye but i be not alone she say as lawrence look into she eye he see that they be as clear as the purest crystal and that he could look through they straight into she soul and there he see that this woman love he the vision be as sudden as if it have be a night scene light up by a flash of lightning but it be as clear and plain as if it have be that same scene under the noonday sun there be time in the life of a man when the goddess of reasonable impulse raise she arm above she head and allow herself a little yawn then she take off she crown and hang it on the back of she throne after which she rest she sceptre on the floor and rise stretch herself to she full height and go forth to take a long refreshing walk by the water of unreflection then she minister prudence stretch himself upon a bench and with he handkerchief over he eye compose himself for a nap discretion worldly wisdom and other trust officer of she court and even sometimes that agile page call memory no sooner see they royal mistress depart than by various door they leave the palace and wander far away then silently with sparkling eye and part lip come that fair be unthinking love she put one foot upon the lower step of the throne she look about she and with a quick bind she seat herself upon she tumbled curl she hastily put the crown with she small white hand she grasp the sceptre and then rise wave it and issue she command the crowd of emotion which serve as she satellite seize the great seal from the sleep prudence and the new queen reign all this now happen to lawrence never before have he look into the eye of a woman who love he and lean over towards this one he put he arm around she and draw she towards he and never shall you be alone he say she look up at he with tear start to she eye and then she put she head against he breast she be too happy to say anything and she do not try it be about a minute after this that the sober sorrel who take no interest in what have occur behind he and a great deal of interest in he stable at home start in a uncertain and hesitating way and finding that he be not check begin to move onward lawrence look up from the little head upon he breast and call out whoa to this however the sorrel pay no attention lawrence then put forth he right hand to grasp the rein but have lately forget all about they they have fall out of the spring-wagon and be now drag upon the ground it be impossible for he to reach they and so seize the whip he endeavor with its aid to hook they up fail in this he be about to jump out and run to the horse 's head but perceive he intention annie seize he arm do not you do it she exclaim you 'll ruin you ankle lawrence could not but admit to himself that he be not in condition to execute any feat of agility and he also feel that annie have a very charming way of hold fast to he arm as if she have a right to keep he out of danger and now the sorrel break into the jog-trot which be he usual pace it be very provoke say lawrence i do not think i ever allow myself to drop the rein before it do not make the slightest difference say annie comfortingly this old horse know the road perfectly well and he do not need a bit of drive he will take we home just as safely as if you hold the rein and now do not you try to get they for you will only hurt yourself very well say lawrence put he arm around she again i be resigned but i think you be very brave to sit so quiet and compose under the circumstance she look at he with a smile such a little circumstance do not count just now she say you must stop that she add presently when we get to the edge of the wood before long they come out into the open country and find themselves in a lane which lead by a wide circuit to the road pass mr keswick 's house the old sorrel certainly behave admirably he hold back when he descend a declivity he walk over the rough place and he trot steadily where the road be smooth it seem like we fate say annie who now sit up without a arm around she the protect wood have be leave behind he just take we along without we have anything to do with it he be not much of a horse say lawrence clasping in a unobservable way the little hand which lay by he side but the fate be charming fortunately there be no one upon the road to notice the reinless plight in which these two young people find themselves and they be quite as well satisfied as if they have be do they own driving after a little period of thought annie turn a earnest face to lawrence and she say : do you know that i never believe that you be really in love with roberta march lawrence squeeze she hand but do not reply he know very well that he have love roberta march and he be not go to lie about it i think so she continue because i do not believe that any one who be truly in love would want to send other people about to propose for he as you do that be not exactly the state of the case he say but we must not talk of those thing now that be all pass and go but if there ever be any love she persist be you sure that it be all go go he answer earnestly as utterly and completely as the day of last summer and now the sorrel of he own accord stop at mr keswick 's outer gate and lawrence get down take up the rein open the gate and drive to the house in quite a proper way when mr croft help annie to descend from the spring-wagon he do not squeeze she hand nor exchange with she any tender glance for old mr keswick be stand at the top of the step have you see letty she ask letty say miss annie oh yes she add as if she suddenly remember that such a person exist letty be at church and she be very active well say the old lady she must have take more interest in the exercise than you do for it be long past the time when i tell she she must be home i do not believe madam say lawrence that any one could have take more interest in the exercise of this morning than we have at this annie could not help give he a little look which would have provoke reflection in the mind of the old lady have she not be very earnestly engage in gaze out into the road in the hope of see letty when lawrence have go into the office and have close the door behind he he stand in a meditative mood before the empty fireplace he be make inquiry of himself in regard to what he have just do he be not accuse himself nor indulge in regret he be simply investigate the matter here he stand a man accept by two woman if he have ever hear of any other man in a like condition he would have call that man a scoundrel and yet he do not deem himself a scoundrel the fact in the case be easy enough to understand for the first time in he life he have look into the eye of a woman who love he and he have discover to he utter surprise that he love she there have be no plan no prudent outlook into she nature and feeling no cautious insight into he own he have take part in a most unpremeditated act of pure and simple love and that it be real and pure love on each side he no more doubt than he doubt that he live and yet have he be a impostor when on that hill over there he tell roberta march he love she no he have be honest he have love she and since the time that he have be rouse to action by the discovery of junius keswick 's intention to renew he suit it have be a love full of a rare and alluring beauty but its charm its fascination its very existence have disappear in the first flash of he knowledge that annie peyton love he have he love for roberta be a perfect one have he be sure that she return it then it could not have be overthrow but it have go and a love complete and perfect stand in its place he have see that he be love and he love that be all but it would stand forever this be the state of the case and now lawrence set himself to discover if in all way he have act truly and honestly he have be accept by miss march but what sort of acceptance be it should he as a man true to himself accept such a acceptance what be he to think of a woman who very angry as he have be inform have send he a message which mean everything in the world to he if it mean anything and have then dash away without allow he a chance to speak to she or even give he a nod of farewell the last thing she have really say to he in this connection be those cruel word on pine top hill with which she have ask he to choose a spot in which to be reject could he consider himself engage would a woman who care for he act towards he in such a manner after all be that acceptance anything more than the result of pique and could he not quite as justly accept the rejection which she have profess herself anxious to give he a short time before lawrence have do he best to explain to he advantage these peculiarity of he status in regard to miss march he have say to himself that she have threaten to reject he because she wish to punish he and he have intend to implore she pardon and expect to receive it over and over again have he argue with himself in this strain and yet in spite of it all he have not be able to bring himself into a state of mind in which he could sit down and write to she a letter which in he estimation would be certain to seal and complete the engagement how very glad i be he now say to himself that i never write that letter and this be the only decision at which he have arrive when he hear mr keswick call to he from the yard he immediately go to the door when the old lady inform he that as letty have not come back and do not appear to be intend to come back and that as none of the other servant on the place have make they appearance he might as well come into the house and try to satisfy he hunger on what cold food she and mr null have manage to collect the most biting and spicy condiment of the little meal to which the three sit down be supply by mr keswick who revile without stint those utterly thoughtless and heedless color people who once in the midst of they crazy religious exercise totally forget that they owe any duty whatever to those who employ they lawrence and annie do not say much but there be something peculiarly piquant in the way in which annie bring and pour out the tea she have make and which with the exception of the old lady 's remark be the only warm part of the repast and there be a element of buoyancy in the manner of mr croft as he take he cup to drink the tea although he say little at this meal he think a great deal listen not at all to mr keswick 's tirade what a charmingly inconsiderate affair this have be he say to himself nothing plan nothing provide for or against all spontaneous and from we very heart i never think to tell she that she must say nothing to she aunt until we have agree how everything should be explain and i do not believe the idea that it be necessary to say anything to anybody have enter she mind but i must keep my eye away from she if i do not want to bring on a premature explosion whatever might be the result of the reasoning which this young man have to do with himself it be quite plain that he be abundantly satisfy with thing as they be it be begin to be dark when letty and uncle isham return and explain why they have be so late in return old aunt patsy have die in church chapter xxvi lawrence say annie on the forenoon of the next day as they be sit together in the parlor with the house to themselves mr keswick have go to aunt patsy 's cabin to supervise proceedings there lawrence do not you feel glad that we do not have a chance to speak to dear old aunt patsy about those little shoe perhaps she have forget that she have steal they and so go to heaven without that sin on she soul that be a very comfortable way of look at it say lawrence but would not it be better to assume that she do not steal they i be very sorry say annie but that be not easy to do but do not let we think anything more about that and do not you feel very glad that the poor old creature who look so happy as she sit singing and clap she hand on she knee do not die until after we have leave the church if it have happen while we be there i do not believe -- do not believe what ask lawrence well that you now would be sit with you arm on the back of my chair lawrence be quite sure from what have be tell he that aunt patsy 's demise have take place before they leave the church but he do not say so to annie he merely take he arm from the back of she chair and place it around she and do you know say she that letty tell I something this morning that be so funny and yet in a certain way so pathetic that it make I laugh and cry both she say that aunt patsy always think that you be mr null at this lawrence burst out laughing but annie check he and go on and she tell letty in church when she see we two come in that she believe she could die happy now since she have see miss annie marry to such a peart gentleman and that it look as if old miss have get over she grudge against he and do not letty undeceive she asked lawrence no she say it would be a pity to upset the mind of such a old woman and she do not do it then the good aunt patsy die say lawrence thinking i be that wretched tramp of a bone-dust pedler which the fancy of you aunt have conjure up that explain the interest the venerable color woman take in I it be now quite easy to understand for if you aunt abuse you mythical husband to everybody as she do to I i do not wonder aunt patsy think i be in danger poor old woman say annie look down at the floor i be so glad that we help she to die happy as she be oblige to anticipate the truth say lawrence in order to derive any comfort from it i be glad she do it but although i be delighted more than my word can tell you to take the place of you mr null you must not expect I to have any of he attribute now just listen to I sir say annie i do not want you to say one word against mr null if it have not be for that good freddy thing would have be very different from what they be now if you care for I at all you owe I entirely to freddy null entirely ask lawrence of course i mean in regard to opportunity of find out thing and say they if aunt keswick have suppose i be only annie peyton she would not have allow mr croft to interfere with she plan for junius and I i expect mr null to be of service to I but no one could have imagine that he would have bring about anything like this bless be null exclaimed lawrence annie ask he to please to be more careful for how do he know that one of the servant might not be sweep the front porch and of course they would look in at the window but my dear child say lawrence push back he chair to a prudent distance we must seriously consider this null business we shall have to inform you aunt of the present state of affair and before we do that we must explain what sort of person frederick null esquire really be -- i be not willing to admit that he exist even as a myth oh dear oh dear exclaimed annie we shall have a dreadful time when aunt keswick know that there never be any mr null and then hear that you and i be engage it will throw she into the most dreadful state of mind that she have ever be in in she life and father have tell I of some of the awful family earthquake that aunt keswick have bring about when thing go wrong with she we must be very cautious say lawrence and neither of we must say a word or do anything that may arouse she suspicion until we have settle upon the best possible method of make the fact know to she the case be indeed a complicated one and what make it more so say annie be aunt keswick 's belief that you be in love with miss march and that you want to get a chance to propose to she she do think that do not she yes say lawrence i must admit that she do and she must be make to understand that that be entirely at a end continue annie all this will be a very difficult task lawrence and i do not see how it be to be do but we shall do it he answer and we must not forget to be very prudent until it be fully settle how we shall do it when lawrence retire to he room and sit down to hold that peculiar court in which he be judge jury lawyer and witness as well as the prisoner at the bar he have to do with a case a great deal more complicated and difficult than that which perplex the mind of miss annie peyton he begin by the very unjudicial act of pledge himself to himself that nothing should interfere with this new this true love in spite of all that might be say do or think annie peyton should be he wife there be no indecision whatever in regard to the new love the only question be : what be to be do about the old one lawrence could not admit for a moment that he could have speak to roberta march as he have speak if he have not love she but he could now perceive that that love have be in no small degree impaired and weaken by the manner of its acceptance the action of miss march on she last day here have much more chill he ardor than she word on pine top hill he have not before examine thoroughly into the condition of that ardor after the departure of the lady but it be plain enough now there be therefore no doubt whatever in regard to he love for miss march he be quite ready and able to lay that aside but what about she acceptance of it how could he lay that aside this be the real case before the court the witness could give no available testimony the lawyer argue feebly the jury disagree and lawrence in he capacity of judge dismiss the case in he effort to conduct he mind through the channel of law and equity lawrence have not satisfied himself and he thought begin to be move by what might be term he military impulse i make a charge into the camp he say with a little downward drawing of the corner of he mouth and i do not capture the commander-in-chief and now i intend to charge out again he sit down to he table and write the following note : my dear miss march : i have be wait for a good many day hope to receive either from you or mr keswick a explanation of the message you send to I by he i now believe that it will be impossible to give a satisfactory explanation of that message i therefore recur to we last private interview and wish to say to you that i be ready at any time to meet you under either a sycamore or a cherry tree and then he sign it and address it to miss march at midbranch this be do he put on he hat and step out to see if a messenger could be find to carry the letter to its destination for he do not wish to wait for the semi-weekly mail near the house he meet annie what have you be do all this time she ask i have be write a letter he say and be now look for some color boy who will carry it for I who be it to she ask miss march be he answer let I see it say annie at this lawrence look at she with wide-open eye and then he laugh never since he have be a child have there be any one who would have think of such a thing as ask to see a private letter which he have write to some one else and that this young girl should stand up before he with she straightforward expectant gaze and make such a request of he in the first instance amuse he you do not mean to say she add that you would write anything to miss march which you would not let I see this letter say lawrence be write for miss march and no one else it be simply the wind up of that old affair give it to I say annie and let I see how you wind it up lawrence smile look at she in silence for a moment and then hand she the letter i do not want you to think she say as she take it that i be go to ask you to show I all the letter you write but when you write one to a lady like miss march i want to know what you say to she and then she read the letter when she have finish she turn to lawrence and with she countenance full of amazement exclaim : i have not the least idea in the world what all this mean what message do she send you and why should you meet she under a tree these question go so straight to the core of the affair and be so peculiarly difficult to answer that lawrence for the moment find himself in the very unusual position of not know what to say but he presently remark : do you think it be of any advantage to either of we to talk over this affair which be now past and go i do not want to talk over any of it say annie very promptly except the part of it which be refer to in this letter but i want to know about that that cover the most important part of it say lawrence very good she answer and so you can tell it to I and now that i think of it you can tell I at the same time why you want to find my cousin junius you refuse once to tell I that you know i remember say lawrence and if you have the least feeling about it i will relate the whole affair from begin to end that perhaps will be the best thing to do after all say annie and suppose we take a walk over the field and then you can tell it without be interrupted but lawrence do not feel that he ankle would allow he to accept this invitation for it have hurt he a good deal since he walk to aunt patsy 's cabin he say so to annie and excite in she the deepest feeling of commiseration you must take no more walk of any length she exclaim until you be quite quite well it be my fault that you take that tramp to aunt patsy 's i ought to have know better but then she say look up at he you be not under my charge i shall take very good care of you now for my part he say i be glad i have this little relapse for now i can stay here longer i be very very sorry for the relapse say she but awfully glad for the stay and you must not stand another minute let we go and sit in the arbor the sun be shine straight into it and that will make it all the more comfortable while you be tell I about those thing they sit down in the arbor and lawrence tell annie the whole history of he affair with miss march from the begin to the end that be if the end have be reach although he intimate to she no doubt upon this point this avowal he have never expect to make in fact he have never contemplate its possibility but now he feel a certain satisfaction in tell it every item as it be related seem throw aside forever and now then my dear annie he say when he have finish what do you think of all that well she say in the first place i be still more of the opinion than i be before that you never be really in love with she you do entirely too much planning and investigate and calculate and when at last you do come to the conclusion to propose to she you do not do it so much of you own accord as because you find that another man would be likely to get she if you do not make a pretty quick move yourself and as to that acceptance i do not think anything of it at all i believe she be very angry at junius because he consent to bring you message when he ought to have be he own messenger and that she give he that answer just to rack he soul with agony i do not believe she ever dream that he would take it to you and to tell the simple truth i believe from what i saw of she that morning that she be think very little of you and a great deal of he to be sure she be fiery angry with he but it be better to be that way with a lover than to pay no attention to he at all this be a view of the case which have never strike lawrence before and although it be not very flattering to he it be very comforting he feel that it be extremely likely that this young woman have be able to truthfully divine in a case in which he have fail the motive of another young woman here be a further reason for congratulating himself that he have not write to miss march and as to the last part of the letter say annie you be not go under any cherry tree or sycamore either to be refuse by she what she say to you be quite enough for a final answer without any signing or seal under tree or anywhere else i think the best thing that can be do with this precious epistle be to tear it up lawrence be amuse by the piquant earnestness of this decision but what be i to do he ask i can not let the matter rest in this unfinished and unsatisfactory condition you might write to she say annie and tell she that you have accept what she say to you on pine top hill as a conclusive answer and that you now take back everything you ever say on the subject you talk of that day and do you think it would be well to put in anything about you be otherwise engage at this lawrence laugh i think that expression would hardly answer he say but i will write another note and we shall see how you like it that will be very well say the happy annie and if i be you i would make it as gentle as i could it be of no use to hurt she feeling oh i do not want to do that say lawrence and now that we have the opportunity let we consider the question of inform you aunt of we engagement oh dear dear dear say annie that be a great deal worse than inform miss march that you do not want to be engage to she that be true say lawrence it be not by any mean a easy piece of business but we might as well look it square in the face and determine what be to be do about it it be simple enough just as we look at it say annie all we have to do be to say that know that aunt keswick have write to my father that she be determine to make a match between cousin junius and I i be afraid to come down here without put up some insurmountable obstacle between I and a man that i have not see since i be a little girl of course i would say very decidedly that i would not have marry he if i have not want to but then consider aunt keswick 's very open way of carry out she plan it would have be very unpleasant and indeed impossible for I to be in the house with he unless she see that there be no hope of a marriage between we and for this reason i take the name of mr null or mrs nothing and come down here secure under the protection of a husband who never exist and then we could say that you and i be a good deal together and that although you have suppose when you come here that you be in love with miss march you have discover that this be a mistake and that afterwards we fall in love with each other and be now engage that would be a straightforward statement of everything just as it happen but the great trouble be : how be we go to tell it to aunt keswick you be right say lawrence how be we go to tell it it need not be tell thunder a strong voice close to they ear and then there be a noise of break lattice-work and crack vine and through the back part of the arbor come a old woman wear a purple sun-bonnet and beat down all obstacle before she with a great purple umbrella you need not tell it cry mr keswick standing in the middle of the arbor she eye glisten she form tremble and she umbrella quiver in the air you need not tell it it be tell graphic and vivid description have be write of those furious storm of devastate wind and deluging rain which suddenly sweep away the beauty of some fair tropical scene and we have read too of dreadful cyclone and tornado which rush in mad rage over land and sea bury great ship in a vast tumult of frenzied wave or crush to the earth forest building everything that may lie in they awful path but no description could be write which could give a adequate idea of the storm which now burst upon lawrence and annie the old lady have see these two standing together in the yard converse most earnestly she have then see annie read a letter that lawrence give she and then she have perceive the two in close converse enter the arbor and sit down together without the slightest regard for the rights of mr null mr keswick look upon all this as somewhat more out-of-the-way than the usual proceedings of these young people and there come into she mind a curiosity to know what they be say to each other so she immediately repair to the large garden and quietly make she way to the back of the arbor in which advantageous position she hear the whole of lawrence 's story of he love-affair with miss march annie 's remark upon the same and the fact of this young lady 's propose confession in regard to she marriage with mr null and she engagement to mr croft then she burst in upon they the tornado and the cyclone rage the thunder roll and crash and the white lightning of she wrath flash upon the two as if it would scathe and annihilate they as they stand before she neither of they have ever know or imagine anything like this it have be long since mr keswick have have a opportunity of exercise that power of vituperative torment which have drive a husband to the refuge of a revert pistol which have banish for life relative and friend and which in the shape of a promissory curse have hold apart those who would have be husband and wife and now like the long store up venom of a serpent it burst out with the direful force give by concentration and retention at the first outburst annie have turn pale and shrink back but now she cling to the side of lawrence who although he face be somewhat blanched and he form tremble a little with excitement still stand up bravely and endeavor but ineffectually to force upon the old lady 's attention a denial of she bitter accusation with face almost as purple as the bonnet she wear or the umbrella she shake in the air the old lady first address she niece with scorn and condemnation she speak of the deceit which the young girl have practice upon she but this part of the exercise be soon over she seem to think that although nothing could be viler than annie 's conduct towards she still the fact that mr null no longer exist put annie again within she grasp and control and make it unnecessary to say much to she on this occasion it be upon lawrence that the main cataract of she fury pour it would be wrong to say that she could not find word to express she ire towards he she find plenty of they and use they all he have deceive she most abominably he have come there the express and avow lover of miss march he have connive with she niece in she deceit he have take advantage of all the opportunity she give he to attain the legitimate object of he visit to inveigle into he snare this silly and absurd young woman and he have dare to interfere with the plan which by day and by night she have be mature for year in vain do lawrence endeavor to answer or explain she stop not nor listen to one word and you need not imagine she scream at he that you be go to turn round when you like and marry anybody you please you be engage body and soul to roberta march and have no right by law of man or heaven to marry anybody else if you breathe a word of love to any other woman it make you a vile criminal in the eye of the law and render you liable to prosecution sir you affianced bride know nothing of what she double-faced snake of a lover be do here but she shall know speedily that be a matter which i take into my own hand out of my way both of you and with these word she charge by they and rush out of the arbor and into the house chapter xxvii they be not a happy pair lawrence croft and annie peyton as they stand together in the arbor after old mr keswick have leave they they be both a good deal shake by the storm they have pass through lawrence say annie look up to he with she large eye full of earnestness there surely be no truth in what she say about you be legally bind to miss march none in the least say lawrence no man under the circumstance would consider himself engage to a woman at any rate there be one thing which i wish you to understand and that be that i be not engage to miss march and that i be engage to you no matter what be say or do you and i belong to each other annie make no answer but she press he hand tightly as she look up into he face he kiss she as she stand notwithstanding he belief that old mr keswick be fully capable of bound down on he umbrella in hand from a upper window what do you think she be go to do annie ask presently my dear annie say he i do not believe that there be a person on earth who could divine what you aunt keswick be go to do as to that we must simply wait and see but for my part i know what i must do i must write a letter to miss march and inform she plainly and definitely that i have cease to be a suitor for she hand i think also that it will be well to let she know that we be engage yes say annie for she will be sure to hear it now but she will think it be a very prompt proceeding that be exactly what it be say lawrence smile prompt and determine there be no doubt or indecision about any part of we affair be there little one not a bit of it say annie proudly at dinner that day annie take she place at one end of the table and lawrence he at the other but the old lady do not make she appearance she be so erratic in she going and coming and have so often tell they they must never wait for she that annie cut the ham and lawrence carve the fowl and the meal proceed without she but while they be eat mr keswick be hear come down stair from she room the front door be open and slam violently and from the dining-room window they see she go down the step across the yard and out of the gate i do hope ejaculate annie that she have not go away to stay if annie have remember that the boy plez in a clean jacket and long white apron officiate as waiter she would not have say this but then she would have lose some information ole miss not go to stay he say with the license of a untrained retainer she go to howletts a ' she do tole aun ' letty she 'll be back agin di ebenin ' if aunt keswick do not come back say annie when the two be in the parlor after dinner i shall go after she i do not intend to drive she out of the house do not you trouble yourself about that my dear say lawrence she be too angry not to come back there be one thing say annie after a while that we really ought to do to-morrow aunt patsy be to be bury and before she be put into the ground those little shoe should be return to aunt keswick it seem to I that justice to poor aunt patsy require that this should be do perhaps now she know how wicked it be to steal they yes say lawrence i think it would be well to put they back where they belong but how can you manage it if you will give they to I say annie i will go up to aunt 's room now that she be away and if she keep the box in the same place where it use to be i 'll slip they into it i hate dreadfully to do it but i really feel that it be a duty when lawrence with some little difficulty walk across the yard to get the shoe from he trunk annie run after he and wait at the office door you must not take a step more than necessary she say and so i will not make you come back to the house when lawrence give she the shoe and she hand a little squeeze at the same time he tell she that he should sit down immediately and write he letter and i say annie will go and see what i can do with these with the shoe in she pocket she go up stair into she aunt 's room and after look around hastily as if to see that the old lady have not leave the ghost of herself in charge she approach the closet in which the sacred pasteboard box have always be keep but the closet be lock turn away she look about the room there be no other place in which there be any probability that the box would be keep then she become nervous she fancy she hear the click of the yard gate she would not for anything have she aunt catch she in that room nor would she take the shoe away with she hastily place they upon a table she slip out and hurry into she own room it be about a hour after this that mr keswick come rapidly up the step of the front porch she have be to howlett 's to carry a letter which she have write to miss march and have there make arrangement to have that letter take to midbranch very early the next morning she have wish to find some one who would start immediately but as there be no moon and as the messenger would arrive after the family be all in bed she have be oblige to abandon this more energetic line of action but the letter would get there soon enough and if it do not bring down retribution on the head of the man who lodge in she office and who she say to herself have work himself into she plan like the rot in a field of potato she would ever after admit that she do not know how to write a letter all the way home she have con over she method of action until mr brandon or a letter should come from midbranch she have already attack together the unprincipled pair who find shelter in she house and she now determine to come upon they separately and torment each soul by itself annie of course would come in for the lesser share of the punishment for the fact that the wretched and depraved null be no more have in a great measure mitigate she offence she be safe and she aunt intend to hold she fast and do with she as she would when the time and junius come but upon lawrence she would have no mercy when she have deliver he into the hand of mr brandon or those of roberta 's father or the clutch of the law she would have nothing more to do with he but until that time she would make he bewail the day when he deceive and impose upon she by cause she to believe that he be in love with another when he be in reality try to get possession of she niece there be a great many thing which she have not think to say to he in the arbor but she would pour the whole hot mass upon he head that evening stamp up the stair and thump she umbrella upon every step as she go hot vengeance breathing from between she parted lip and she eye flash with the delight of prospective fury she enter she room the light of the afternoon have but just begin to wane and she have not make three step into the apartment before she eye fall upon a pair of fade light blue shoe which stand side by side upon a table she stop suddenly and stand pale and rigid she grasp upon she umbrella loosen and unnoticed it fall upon the floor then she eye still fix upon the shoe she move slowly sidewise towards the closet she try the door and find it still lock then she put she hand in she pocket draw out the key look at it and drop it with falter step she draw near the table and stand support herself by the back of a chair any one else would have see upon that table merely a pair of baby 's shoe but she see more she see the top of the little sock which she have fold away for the last time so many year before she see the first short dress she child have ever worn it be tie up with pink ribbon at the shoulder from which hang two white plump little arm there be a little neck around which be a double string of coral fasten by a small gold clasp above this be a face a baby face with soft pale eye and its head cover with curl of the lightest yellow not arrange in artistic negligence but smooth even and regular as she so often have turn twisted and set they it be indeed she baby girl who have come to she as clear and vivid in every feature limb and garment as be the real shoe upon the table for many minute she stand she eye fix upon the little apparition then slowly she sink upon she knee by the chair she sun-bonnet which she have not remove be bow so the pale eye of the little one could not see she face and from she own eye come the first tear that that old woman have shed since she baby 's clothes have be put away in the box \* \* \* \* \* lawrence 's letter to miss march be a definitely express document intend to cover all the ground necessary and no more but it could not be say that it be entirely satisfactory to himself he case to say the least of it be a difficult one to defend he be aware that he course might be look upon by other as dishonorable although he assure himself that he have act justly it might have be better to wait for a positive declaration from miss march that she have not truly accept he before engage himself to another lady but then he say to himself true love never wait for anything at all event he could write no better letter than the one he have produce and he hope he should have a opportunity to show it to annie before he send it he need not have trouble himself in this regard for he and annie be not disturb during the rest of that day by the appearance of mr keswick but after the letter have be duly consider and approve he find it difficult to obtain a messenger there be no one on the place who would undertake to walk to midbranch and he could not take the liberty of use mr keswick 's horse for the trip so it be find necessary to wait until the morrow when the letter could be take to howlett 's where if no one could be find to carry it immediately it would have to be entrust to the mail which go out the next day lawrence of course know nothing of mr keswick 's message to midbranch or he would have be still more desirous that he letter should be promptly dispatch the evening be not a very pleasant one the lover do not know at what moment the old lady might descend upon they and the element of unpleasant expectancy which pervade the atmosphere of the house be somewhat depressing they talk a good deal of the probability of mr keswick 's action lawrence expect that she would order he away although annie have stoutly maintain that she aunt would have no right to do this as he be not in a condition to travel this argument however make little impression upon lawrence who be not the man to stay in any house where he be not wanted besides he know very well that for any one to stay in mr keswick 's house when she do not want he would be a impossibility but he do not intend to slip away in any cowardly manner and leave annie to bear alone the brunt of the second storm he feel sure that such a storm be impending and he be also quite certain that its greatest violence would break upon he he would stay therefore and meet the old lady when she next descend upon they and before he go away he would endeavor to utter some word in defense of himself and annie they separate early and a good deal of thinking be do by they before they go to sleep the next morning they have only each other for company at breakfast but they have just rise from that meal when they be startle by the entrance of mr keswick have expect she appearance during the whole of the time they be eat they have no reason to be startle by she come now but for they subsequent amazement at she appearance and demeanor they have every reason in the world she face be pale and grave with a air of rigidity about it which be not common to she for in general she possess a very mobile countenance without speak a word she advance towards lawrence and extend she hand to he he be so much surprise that while he take she hand in he he could only murmur some unintelligible form of morning salutation then mr keswick turn to annie and shake hand with she the young girl grow pale but say not a word but some tear come into she eye although why this happen she could not have explain to herself have finish this little performance the old lady walk to the back window and look out into the flower garden although there be really nothing there to see now annie find voice to ask she aunt if she would not have some breakfast no say mr keswick my breakfast be bring up-stair to I and with that she turn and go out of the room she close the door behind she but scarcely have she do so when she open it again and look in it be quite plain to the two silent and astonished observer of she action that she be engage in the occupation very unusual with she of control a excited condition of mind she look first at one and then at the other and then she say in a voice which seem to meet with occasional obstruction in its course : i have nothing more to say about anything do just what you please only do not talk to I about it and she close the door what be the meaning of all this say lawrence advance towards annie what have come over she i be sure i do not know say annie and with this she burst into tear and cry as she would have scorn to cry during the terrible storm of the day before that morning lawrence croft be a very much puzzle man what have happen to mr keswick he could not divine and at time he imagine that she changed demeanor be perhaps nothing but a artful cover to some new and more ruthless attack annie take occasion to be with she aunt a good deal during the morning but she report to lawrence that the old lady have say very little and that little related entirely to household affair mr keswick eat dinner with they she manner be grave and even stern but she make a few remark in regard to the weather and some neighborhood matter and before the end of the meal both lawrence and annie fancy that they could see some little sign of a return to she usual humor which be pleasant enough when nothing happen to make it otherwise but expectation of a early return to she ordinary manner of life be fallacious she do not appear at supper and she spend the evening in she own room lawrence and annie have thus ample opportunity to discuss this novel and most unexpected state of affair they do not understand it but it could not fail to cheer and encourage they only one thing they decide upon and that be that lawrence could not go away until he have have a opportunity of fully comprehend the position in relation to mr keswick in which he and annie stand about the middle of the evening as lawrence be think that it be time for he to retire to he room in the little house in the yard letty come in with a letter which she say have be bring from midbranch by a color man on a horse the man have say there be no answer and have go back to howlett 's where he belong the letter be for mr croft and from miss march very much surprise at receive such a missive lawrence open the envelope he letter to miss march have not yet be send for the new state of affair have not only very much occupy he mind but it also seem to render unnecessary any haste in the matter and he have conclude to mail the letter the next day this therefore be not in answer to anything from he and why should she have write it be with a decidedly uneasy sensation that lawrence begin to read the letter annie watch he anxiously as he do so the letter be a somewhat long one and the purport of it be as follow : the writer state that have receive a most extraordinary and astounding epistle from old mr keswick which have be send by a special messenger she have think it she duty to write immediately on the subject to mr croft and have detain the man that she might send this letter by he she do not pretend to understand the full purport of what mr keswick have write but it be evident that the old lady believe that a engagement of marriage exist between herself -lrb- miss march -rrb- and mr croft that that gentleman have give such information to mr keswick she could hardly suppose but if he have it must have be in consequence of a message which very much to she surprise and grief have be deliver to mr croft by mr keswick in order that this message might be understand miss march have determine to make a full explanation of she line of conduct towards mr croft during the latter part of they pleasant intercourse at midbranch during the past summer she have reason to believe that mr croft 's intention in regard to she be become serious but she have also perceive that he impulse however earnest they might have be be control by a extraordinary caution and prudence which although it sometimes amuse she be not in the least degree complimentary to she she could not prevent herself from resent this somewhat peculiar action of mr croft and this resentment grow into a desire which gradually become a very strong one that she might have a opportunity of decline a proposal from he that opportunity come while they be both at mr keswick 's and she have intend that what she say at she last interview with mr croft should be consider a definite refusal of he suit but the interview have terminate before she have state she mind quite as plainly as she have purpose do she have not however wish to renew the conversation on the subject and have conclude to content herself with what she have already say feeling quite sure that she word have be sufficient to satisfy mr croft that it would be useless to make any further proposal when on the eve of she departure from the house mr keswick have bring she mr croft 's message she be not only amaze but indignant not so much at mr croft for send it as at mr keswick for bring it miss march be not ashamed to confess that she be irritated and incensed to a high degree that a gentleman who have hold the position towards she that mr keswick have hold should bring she such a message from another man she be therefore seize with a sudden impulse to punish he and without in the least expect that he would carry such a answer she have give he the one which he have take to mr croft have until the day on which she be write hear nothing further on the subject she have suppose that she expectation have be realize but on this day the astonishing letter from mr keswick have arrive and it make she understand that not only have she impulsive answer be deliver but that mr croft have inform other person that he have be accept she wish therefore to lose no time in state to mr croft that what she have say to he with she own lip be to be receive as she final resolve and that the answer give to mr keswick be not intend for mr croft 's ear miss march then go on to say that it might be possible that she owe mr croft a apology for the somewhat ungracious manner in which she have treat he at mr keswick 's house but she assure herself that mr croft owe she a apology not only for the manner of he attention but for the peculiar publicity he have give they in that case the apology neutralize each other miss march have no intention of answer mr keswick 's letter under no circumstance could she have consider for a moment its absurd suggestion and recommendation and it contain allusion to mr croft and another person which if not found upon the imagination of mr keswick certainly concerned nothing with which miss march have anything to do the proud spirit of lawrence croft be a good deal ruffle when he read this letter but he make no remark about it would you like to read it he say to annie she greatly desire to read it but there be something in she lover 's face and in the tone in which he speak which make she suspect that the reading of that letter might be in some degree humiliating to he she be certain from the expression of he face as he read it that the letter contain matter very unpleasant to lawrence and it might be that it would wind he to have another person especially herself read they and so she say : i do not care to read it if you will tell I why she write to you and the point of what she say thank you say lawrence and he crumple the letter in he hand as he speak she write he continue in consequence of a letter she have have from you aunt what exclaim annie do aunt keswick write to she yes say lawrence and send it by a special messenger she must have tell she all the heinous crime with which she charge you and I particularly I and this must have be the first intimation to miss march that she cousin have give I the answer she make to he therefore miss march write in haste to let I know that she do not intend that that answer should be give to I and that she wish it generally understand that i have no more connection with she than i have with the queen of spain that be the sum and substance of the letter i know as well as i know anything in the world say annie that that message junius bring you mean nothing and take the crumpled letter from he hand she throw it on the few ember that remain in the fireplace and as it blaze and crumble into black ash she say : now that be the end of roberta march yes say lawrence emphasize he remark with a encircle arm so far as we be concern that be the end of she chapter xxviii on the next day old aunt patsy be bury mr keswick and annie attend the ceremony in the cabin but they do not go to the burial after a time it might be in a week or two or it might be in a year the funeral sermon would be preach in the church and they would go to hear that aunt patsy never finish she crazy quilt several piece be want to one corner of it but in the few day precede she burial two old woman of the congregation with tremble hand and uncertain eye sew in these piece and finish the quilt in which the body of the venerable sister be wrap accord to she well-known wish and desire it be customary among the negro to keep the remains of they friend a very short time after death but aunt patsy have live so long upon this earth that it be generally concede that she spirit would not object to she body remain above ground until all necessary arrangement should be complete and until all people who have know or hear of she have have a opportunity of take a last look at she as she have be so very well know to almost everybody be grandparent a good many people avail themselves of this privilege after mr keswick 's return from aunt patsy 's cabin where accord to she custom she make herself very prominent it be noticeable that she have drop some of the grave reserve in which she have wrap herself during the precede day it be impossible for she at least but for a very short time to act in a manner unsuited to she nature and reserve and constraint have never be suit to she nature she therefore begin to speak on general subject in she ordinary free manner to the various person in she house but it must not be suppose that she exhibit any contrition for the outrageous way in which she have speak to annie and lawrence or give they any reason to suppose that the laceration of they soul on that occasion be a matter which at present need any consideration whatever from she a angel bear of memory and imagination might come to she from heaven and so work upon she superstitious feeling as to induce she to stop short in she course of reckless vengeance but she would not on that account fall upon anybody 's neck or ask forgiveness for anything she have do to anybody she do not accuse herself nor repent she only stop after this she say you all can do as you please i have no further concern with you affair only do not talk to I about they she tell lawrence in a manner that would seem to indicate a moderate but courteous interest in he welfare that he must not think of leave she house until he ankle have fully recover its strength and she even go so far as to suggest the use of a patent lotion which she have see at the store at howlett 's she resume she former intercourse with annie but it seem impossible for she to entirely forget the deception which that young lady have practice upon she the only indication however of this resentment be the appellation which she now bestow upon she niece in speaking of she to lawrence or any of the household she invariably call she the late mr null and this title so pleased the old lady that she soon begin to use it in address she niece annie occasionally remonstrate in a manner which seem half playful but be in fact quite earnest but she aunt pay no manner of attention to she word and continue to please herself by this half-sarcastic method of allude to she niece 's fictitious matrimonial state letty and the other servant be at first much astonish by the new title give to miss annie and the only way in which they could explain it be by suppose that mr null have go off somewhere and die and although they could not understand why miss annie should show so little grief in the matter and why she have not put on mourning they imagine that these be custom which she have learn in the north lawrence advise annie to pay no attention to this whim of she aunt it do not hurt either of we he say and we ought to be very glad that she have let we off so easily but there be one thing i think you ought to do you should write to you cousin junius and tell he of we engagement but i would not refer at all to the other matter you be not suppose to have anything to do with it and miss march can tell he as much about it as she choose mr keswick write I that he be go to midbranch and that he would communicate with I while there but as i have not since hear from he i presume he be still in washington a letter be therefore write by annie and address to junius in washington and lawrence drive she to the railroad station in the spring-wagon where it be post the family mail come bi-weekly to howlett 's as the post-office at the railroad station be entirely too distant for convenience and as Saturday approach it be evident from mr keswick 's occasional remark and question that she expect a letter it be quite natural for lawrence and annie to surmise that this letter be expect from miss march for mr keswick have not hear of any rejoinder have be make to she epistle to that lady when late on Saturday afternoon the boy plez return from howlett 's mr keswick eagerly take from he the well-worn letter-bag and look over its contents there be a letter for she and from midbranch but the address be write by junius not by miss march there be another in the same hand-writing for annie as the old lady look at the address on she letter and then on its post-mark she be evidently disappointed and displeased but she say nothing and go away with it to she room annie 's letter be in answer to the one she have send to washington which have be promptly forward to midbranch where junius have be for some day it begin by express much surprise at the information he cousin have give he in regard to she assumption of a married title and although she have assure he she have very good reason he could not admit that it be right and proper for she to deceive he aunt and himself in this way if it be indeed necessary that other person should suppose that she be a married woman she nearest relative at least should have be tell the truth at this passage annie who be read the letter aloud and lawrence who be listen both laugh but they make no remark and the reading proceed junius next allude to the news of he cousin 's engagement to mr croft he guard remark on this subject show the kindness of he heart he do not allude to the suddenness of the engagement nor to the very peculiar event that have so recently precede it but read between the line both annie and lawrence think that the writer have probably give these point a good deal of consideration in a general way however it be impossible for he to see any objection to such a match for he cousin and this be the impression he endeavor to give in a very kindly way in he congratulation but even here there seem to be indication of a hope on the part of the writer that mr croft would not see fit to make another short tack in he course of love like the polite gentleman he be mr keswick allow he own affair to come in at the end of the letter here he inform he cousin that he engagement with miss march have be renew and that they be to be marry shortly after christmas as it must have be very plain to those who be present when miss march leave he aunt 's house that she leave in anger with he he feel impel to say that he have explain to she the course of action to which she have take exception and although she have not admit that that course have be a justifiable one she have forgive he he wish also to say at this point that he himself be not at all proud of what he have do that be intend for I interrupted lawrence well if you understand it it be all right say annie junius go on to say that the renewal of he engagement be due in great part to miss march 's visit to he aunt and to a letter she have receive from she a few day of intercourse with mr keswick whom she have never before see and the tenor and purpose of that letter have persuade miss march that he aunt be a person whose mind have pass into a condition when its opposition or its action ought not to be consider by person who be intent upon they own welfare he own arrival at midbranch at this juncture have result in the happy renewal of they engagement i do not know junius half as well as i wish i do say annie as she finish the letter but i be very sure indeed that he will make a good husband and i be glad he have get roberta march -- as he want she do you emphasize ` he ' ask lawrence i will emphasize it if you would like to hear I do it say she it be very queer remark annie after a little pause that i should have be so anxious to preserve poor junius from you clutch and that after all i do to save he i should fall into those clutch myself whereupon lawrence much to she delight tell she the story of the anti-detective mr keswick sit down in she room and read she letter she have no intention of abandon she resolution to let thing go as they would and therefore do not expect to follow up with further word or action anything she have write in she letter to roberta march but she have have a very strong curiosity to know what that lady would say in answer to say letter and she be therefore disappointed and displeased that the missive she have receive be from she nephew and not from miss march she do not wish to have a letter from junius she know or rather very much fear that it would contain news which would be bad news to she and although she be sure that such news would come to she sooner or later she be very much averse to receive it he letter to she merely touch upon the point of mr null and he cousin 's engagement to mr croft but it be almost entirely fill with the announcement and most earnest defense of he own engagement to roberta march he say a great deal upon this subject and he say it well but it be doubtful if he fervid and often affectionate expression make much impression upon he aunt nothing could make the old lady like this engagement but she have make up she mind that he might do as he please and it do not matter what he say about it he have do it and there be a end of it but there be one thing that do matter : that unprincipled and iniquitous old man brandon have have he own way at last and she and she way have be set aside this be the last of a series of injury to she and she family with which she charge mr brandon and he family but it be the crowning wrong the injury itself she do not so much deplore as that the injurer would profit by it arrest in she course of rage passion by a sudden flood of warm and irresistible emotion she have resign as impetuously as she have take they up she purpose of vengeance and consequently she plan for she nephew and niece but she be a keen-minded as well as passionate old woman and when she have consider the altered state of affair she be able to see in it advantage as well as disappointment and defeat from what she have learn of lawrence croft 's circumstance and position and she have make a good many inquiry on this subject of roberta march he be certainly a good match for annie and although she hate to have anything to do with midbranch it could not be a bad thing for junius to be master of that large estate and that mr brandon have repeatedly declare he would be if he marry roberta thus in the midst of these reverse there be something to comfort she and reconcile she to they but there be no balm for the wound cause by mr brandon 's success and she failure with the letter of junius open in she hand she sit for a long time in bitter meditation at length a light gradually spread itself over she gloomy countenance she eye sparkle she sit up straight in she chair and a broad smile change the course of the wrinkle on she cheek she arise to she foot she give she head a quick jerk of affirmation she clap one hand upon the other and she say aloud : i will bless not curse and with that she go happy to bed chapter xxix on the follow Monday lawrence announce that he ankle be now quite well enough for he to go to new york where he affair require he presence neither he nor the late mr null regard this parting with any satisfaction but they very natural regret at the necessary termination of these happy autumn day be a good deal temper by the fact that lawrence intend to return in a few week and that then the final arrangement would be make for they marriage it be not easy to decide what these arrangement would be for in spite of the many wrongness of the old lady 's head and heart annie have conceive a good deal of affection for she aunt and feel a strong disinclination to abandon she to she lonely life which would be more lonely than before now that junius be to be marry on the other hand lawrence although he have discover some estimable point in the very peculiar character of mr keswick have no intention of living in the same house with she this whole matter therefore be leave in abeyance until the lover should meet again some time in December lawrence and annie have desire very much that junius should visit they before mr croft 's departure for the north for they both have a high esteem for he and both feel a desire that he should be as well satisfy with they matrimonial project as they be with he but they need not have expect he junius have conceive a dislike for mr croft which be base in great part upon disapprobation of what he himself have do in connection with that gentleman and this manner of dislike be not easily set aside the time would come when he would take lawrence croft and annie by the hand and honestly congratulate they but for that time they must wait lawrence depart in the afternoon and the next day mr keswick set about that general renovation and rearrangement of she establishment which many good housewife consider necessary at certain epoch such as the departure of guest the come in of spring or the advent of winter these arrangement occupy two day and on the evening that they be finish to she satisfaction the old lady inform she niece that early the next morning she be go to start for midbranch and that it be possible nay quite probable that she would stay there over a night i might go and come back the same day she say but thirty mile a day be too much for billy and besides i be not sure i could get through what i have to do if i do not stay over i would take you with I but this be not to be a mere visit i have important thing to attend to and you would be in the way you get along so well without I when you first come here that i have no doubt you will do very well for one night i shall drive myself and take plez along with I and leave uncle isham and letty to take care of you under ordinary circumstance annie would have be delighted to go to midbranch a place she have never see and of which she have hear so much but she have no present desire to see roberta march and say so further remark that she be very willing to stay by herself for a night she hope much that she aunt would proceed with the conversation and tell she why she have determine upon such a extraordinary thing as a visit to midbranch where she know the old lady have not be for many many year but mr keswick have nothing further to say upon this subject and begin to talk of other matter after a very early breakfast next morning mr keswick set out upon she journey drive the sorrel horse with much steadiness intermingle with severity whenever he allow himself to drop out of he usual jogging pace plez sit in the back part of the spring-wagon and whenever the old lady see a unusually large stone lie in the track of the road she would stop and make he get out and throw it to one side i believe she say on one of these occasion that a thousand man in buggy might pass along this road thrice a day for a year and never think of stop to throw that rock out of the way of people 's wheel they would steer around it every time or bump over it but such a thing as move it would never enter they head the morning be somewhat cool but fine and the smile which occasionally flit over the corrugated countenance of mr keswick seem to indicate that she be in a pleasant state of mind which might have be occasion by the fine weather and the good condition of the road or by cheerful anticipation connect with she visit it be not very long after noonday that with a stifled remark of disapprobation upon she lip she draw up at the foot of the broad flight of step by which one cross the fence into the midbranch yard give billy into the charge of plez with direction to take he round to the stable and tell somebody to put he up and feed he she mount the step and stop for a minute or so on the broad platform at the top look about she as she stand everything the house the yard the row of elm along the fence the wide-spreading field and the farm building and cabin some of which she could see around the end of the house be all on a scale so much larger and more impose than those of she own little estate that although nothing have change for the better since the day when she be familiar with midbranch she be strike with the general superiority of the brandon possession to she own she eye twinkle and she smile but there do not appear to be anything envious about she she present a rather remarkable figure as she stand in this conspicuous position annie have insist when she be help she aunt to array herself for the journey that she should wear a bonnet which for many year have be she head-gear on sunday and important occasion but to this the old lady positively object she be not go on a mere visit of state or ceremony she visit at midbranch would require she whole attention and she do not wish to distract she mind by wonder whether she bonnet be straight on she head or not and she be so unaccustomed to the feel of it that she would never know if it get turn hind part foremost she could never be at she ease nor say freely what she wish to say if she be dress in clothes to which she be not accustomed she be perfectly accustomed to she sun-bonnet and she intend to wear that of course she carry she purple umbrella and she wear a plain calico dress blue spotted with white which be very narrow and short in the skirt barely touch the top of she shoe the stoutest and most serviceable that could be procure in the store at howlett 's she cover she shoulder with a small red shawl which much to annie 's surprise she fasten with a large and somewhat tarnished silver brooch a ornament she niece have never before see attired thus she certainly would have attract attention have there be any one there to see but the yard be empty and the house door close she descend the step cross the yard with what might be term a buoyant gait and mount the porch knock on the door with the handle of she umbrella after some delay a color woman appear and as soon as the door be open mr keswick walk in where be you master say she forget all about the emancipation act mah ' robert be in the libery say the woman and where be miss roberta march and master junius keswick miss rob go norf day ` fore yestiddy be the answer a ' mah ' junius do go ` long to ` scort she who shall i tell mah ' robert be come there be no need to tell he who i be say mr keswick just take I in to he that be all you have to do a good deal doubtful of the propriety of this proceeding but more doubtful of the propriety of oppose the wish of such a determined-looking visitor the woman step to the back part of the hall and open the door the moment she do so mrs keswick enter and close the door behind she mr brandon be seat in a arm chair by a table and not very far from a wood fire of a size suit to the season he slippered foot be on a cushion stool he eye-glass be carefully adjust on the capacious bridge of he nose and intent upon a newspaper which have arrive by that morning 's mail he present the appearance of a very well satisfied old gentleman in very comfortable circumstance but when he turn he head and see the widow keswick close the door behind she every idea of satisfaction or comfort seem to vanish from he mind he drop the paper he rise to he foot he take off he eye-glass he turn somewhat red in the face and he ejaculate : what madam so it be you mr keswick the old lady do not immediately answer she head drop a little on one side a broad smile bewrinkle the lower part of she well-worn visage and with she eye half-close behind she heavy spectacles she hold out both she hand the purple umbrella in one of they and exclaim in a voice of happy fervor : robert i be yours mr brandon recover from he first surprise have make a step forward to go round the table and greet he visitor but at these word he stop as if he have be shoot perception understanding and even animation seem to have leave he as he vacantly stare at the elderly female with purple sun-bonnet and umbrella blue calico gown red shawl and coarse boot who hold out she arm towards he and who gaze upon he with a air of tender though decrepit fondness do not you understand I robert she continue do not you remember the day many a good long year ago it be true when we walk together down there by the branch and you ask I to be yours i refuse you robert and although you go down on you knee in the damp grass and beseech I to give you my heart i would not do it but i do not know you then as i know

with these word she make a step forward at this demonstration mr brandon appear suddenly to recover he consciousness and he precipitately make two step backwards just miss tumble over he footstool into the fireplace madam he exclaim what be you talk about of the day of we courtship and you love robert she say my love do not come then but it be here now here now she repeat put the hand with the umbrella in it on she breast madam exclaim the old gentleman you must be rave crazy those thing to which you allude happen nearly half a century ago and since that you have be marry and settle and -- robert interrupt the widow keswick you be mistaken it be not quite forty-five year since that morning and why should heart like ours allow the passage of time or the mere circumstance of what might be call a outside marriage but now extinct to come between they there be many a spring robert which do not show when a man first begin to dig but it will bubble up in time and robert it bubble now and with she head bent a little downward although she eye be still fix upon he she make another step in he direction mr brandon now back himself flat against some book-shelf in he rear the perspiration begin to roll from he face and he whole form tremble mr keswick madam he exclaim you will drive I mad the old lady drop the end of she umbrella on the floor rest she two hand on the head of it settle herself into a easy position to speak and with she head throw back fix a steady gaze upon the tremble old gentleman robert she say do not try to crush emotion which always be a credit to you although in those day go by i do not tell you so you hair be black then robert and you look taller for you have not a stoop and you face be very smooth and so be mine and i remember i have on a white dress

and you do not know how happy it make I to think that and to know that i can come to you and find you the same true and constant lover that you be when forty-five year ago you go down on you knee to I by the branch we can not stifle those feeling of by-gone day which well up in we bosom robert after all these year i have learn what a prize you true love be and i return it i be yours at this mr brandon open he mouth with a spasmodic gasp but no word come from he he look to the right and leave and then make a lunge to one side as if he would run around the old lady and gain the door but mr keswick be too quick for he with two sudden spring she reach the door and put she back against it do not leave I robert she say i have not tell you all do not you remember this breastpin unfasten the large silver brooch from she shawl and hold it out to he you give it to I robert there be almost tear of joy in you eye on the first day i wear it although i be careful to let you know it mean nothing where be those tear to-day robert it mean something now i have keep it all these year although in the lifetime of mr keswick it be never clean and i wear it to-day robert that you eye might rest upon it once again and that you might speak to I the word you speak to I the day after i let you pin it on my white neckerchief you wait then robert a whole day before you speak but you need not wait now let you heart speak out dear robert but dear robert appear to have no power to speak on this or any other subject he be half sit half lean on the corner of a table which stand by a window out of which he give sudden agonize and longing glance as if have he strength enough he would raise the sash and leap out the old lady however have speech enough for two robert she exclaim how happy may we be yet if you wish to give up to a younger couple this spacious mansion these fine grounds and noble elm and come to my humble home i shall only say to you ` robert come ' i shall be alone there robert and shall welcome you with joy i have nobody now to give anything to the late mr null by which i mean my niece will marry a man who if report do not lie be rich enough to make she want nothing that i have and as for junius he be to have you property as we all know so all i have be yours if you choose to come to I robert but if you would rather live here i will come to you and the young people can board with we until you decease after that i 'll board with they and i be not sure robert but i like the plan of come here best there be lot of improvement we could make on this place with you to furnish the money and I to advise and direct the first thing i would do would be to have down those abominable step over the front fence and put a decent gate in its place and then we would have a gravel walk across the yard to the porch wide enough for you and I robert to walk together arm-in-arm when we would go out to look over the plantation or stroll down to that spot on the branch robert where the first plighting of we troth begin the word of tender reminiscence and of fond though rather late devotion with which mr keswick have stab and gash the soul of the poor old gentleman have at first deranged he sens and then drive he into a state of abject despair but the practical remark which succeed seem to have a more direful effect upon he the idea of the be with the sun-bonnet and the umbrella enter into he life at midbranch tear down the broad step which he honor father have build cut a gravel path across the green turf which have be the pride of generation and do no man could say what else of advice and direction seem to strike a chill of terror into he very bone the quick perception of mr keswick tell she that it be time to terminate the interview i will not say anything more to you now robert she say of course you have be surprise at my come to you to-day and accept you offer of marriage and you must have time to quiet you mind and think it over i do not doubt you affection robert and i do not want to hurry you i be go to stay here to-night so that we can have plenty of time to settle everything comfortably i 'll go now and get one of the servant to show I to a room where i can take off my thing i 'll see you again at dinner and with a smile of antiquated coyness she leave the room chapter xxx mr brandon be not a weak man nor one very susceptible to outside influence but in the whole course of he life nothing so extraordinarily nerve-stirring have occur to he as this visit of old mr keswick endeavor to appear in the character of the young creature he have woo some forty-five year before for a long time mr keswick have be the enemy of himself and he family and many a bitter onslaught she have make upon he both by letter and by word of mouth these he have bear with the utmost bravery and coolness and there be time when they even afford he entertainment but this most astounding attack be something against which no man could have be prepare and mr brandon suddenly pounce upon in the midst of he comfortable bachelordom by a malevolent sorceress and hurl back to the day of he youth be show himself kneel not at the foot of a fair young girl but before a horrible old woman this amazing and startling state of affair be too much for he immediately to comprehend it stunned and bewildered he such indeed be the effect upon he that the first act of he mind when he be leave alone and it begin to act be to ask of itself if there be really any grounds upon which mr keswick could with any reason take up she position the absolute absurdity of she position however become more and more evident as mr brandon 's mind begin to straighten itself and stand up and now he grow angry anger be a passion with which he be not at all unfamiliar and the exercise of it seem to do he good when he have walk up and down he library for a quarter of a hour he feel almost like he natural self and with many nod of he head and shake of he fist he declare that the old woman be crazy and that he would bundle she home just as soon as he could by dinner-time he have cool down a good deal and he resolve to treat she with the respect due to she age and former condition of sanity but to take care that she should not again be alone with he and to arrange that she should return to she home that day mr keswick come to the table with a smile face and wear a close-fitting white cap which look like a portion of she night gear tie under she chin with broad stiff string in this she appear to she host as far more hideous than when wear she sun-bonnet mr brandon have arrange that two servant should wait upon the table so that one of they should always be in the room but in he supposition that the presence of a third person would have any effect upon the expression of mr keswick 's fond regard he be mistake the meal have scarcely begin when she look around the room with wide-open eye and exclaim : robert if we should conclude to remain here i think we will have this room re-papered with some light-colored paper i like a light dining-room this be entirely too dark the two servant one of whom be we old friend peggy actually stop short in they duty at this remark and as for mr brandon he appetite immediately leave he to return no more during that meal he be oblige to make some answer to this speech and so he briefly remark that he have no desire to alter the appearance of he dining-room and then hasten to change the conversation by make some inquiry about that interesting young woman she niece who he have be inform be not a married lady as he have suppose she to be at this intelligence peggy drop two spoon and a fork she have never hear it before the late mr null say mr keswick be a young woman who like to cut she clothes after she own pattern they may be become to she when they be make up or they may not be but i be incline to think she have get a pretty good head on she shoulder and perhaps she know what suit she as well as any of we i can not say it be easy to forgive the trick she play on I she own aunt and just the same in fact as she mother but robert and as she say this the old lady lay down she knife and fork and look tenderly at mr brandon i have determine to forgive everybody and to overlook everything and i do this as much for you sake dear robert as for my own it would not do for a couple of we age to be keep up grudge against the young people for they way of get out of marriage or get into they we will have my niece and she husband here sometimes will not we robert mr brandon straighten himself and remark : mr croft whom i have hear you niece be to marry will be quite welcome here with he wife then put he napkin on the table and push back he chair he say : now madam you must excuse I for i have order to give to some of my people which i have forget until this moment but do not let I interfere with you dinner pray continue you meal never before have mr brandon be know to leave he dinner until he have finish it and he be not at all accustom to give such a poor reason for he action as the one he give now but it be simply impossible for he to sit any longer at table and have that old woman talk in that shocking manner before the servant robert cried mr keswick as he leave the room i 'll save some dessert for you and we 'll eat it together mr brandon 's first impulse when he find himself out of the dining-room be to mount he horse and ride away but there be no place to which he wish to ride and he be a man who be very loath to leave the comfort of he home no he say she must go and not i and then he go into he parlor and stride up and down as soon as mr keswick have finish she dinner he would see she there and speak he mind to she he have determine that he would not again be alone with she but since the presence of other be no restraint whatever upon she it have become absolutely necessary that he should speak with she alone it be not long before the widow keswick with a brisk blithe step enter the parlor i could not eat without you robert she cry and so i really have not half finish my dinner do you have to come in here to speak to you people mr brandon step to the door and close it madam he say it will be impossible for I in the absence of my niece to entertain you here to-night and so it would be prudent for you to start for home as soon as possible as the day be short it would be too much of a journey for you horse to go back again to-day and you vehicle be a open one therefore i have order my carriage to be prepare and you may trust my driver to take you safely home even if it should be dark before you get there if you desire it there be a young maid-servant here who will go with you robert say mr keswick approach the old gentleman and gaze fondly upward at he you be so good and thoughtful and sweet but you need not put yourself to all that trouble for I i shall stay here to-night and in you house dear robert i can take care of myself a great deal better than any lady could take care of I madam exclaimed mr brandon i want you to stop call I by my first name you have no right to do so and i will not stand it robert say the old lady look at he with a air of tender upbraid you forget that i be yours now and forever never since he have arrive at man 's estate and probably not before have mr brandon speak in improper language to a lady but now it be all he could do to restrain himself from the ejaculation of a oath but he do restrain himself and only exclaim : confound it madam i can not stand this why do you come here to drive I crazy with you senseless ravings robert say mr keswick very composedly i do not wonder that my come to you and accept the proposal which you once so heartily make to I and from which you have never go back should work a good deal upon you feeling it be quite natural and i expect it therefore do not hesitate about speak out you mind i shall not be offend so that we belong to each other for the rest of we day i do not mind what you say now when it be all new and unexpected to you you and i have have many a difference of opinion robert and you plan be not my plan but thing have turn out as you wish and you have what you have always want and with the other good thing robert you can take I and as she finish speak she hold out both hand to she companion with a stamp of he foot and a kick at a chair which stand in he way mr brandon precipitately leave the room and slam the door after he and if peggy have not nimbly spring to one side he would have stumble over she and have have a very bad fall for a man of he age it be not ten minute after this that look out of a window mr keswick see a saddle horse bring into the back yard she hasten into the hall and find peggy run to mr brandon she say and bid he good-bye for I i be go up stair to get ready to go home and have not time to speak to he myself before he start on he ride at the receipt of this message the heart of mr brandon give a bind which actually help he to get into the saddle but he do not hesitate in he purpose of instant departure if he staid but for a moment she might come out to he and change she mind so he put spur to he horse and gallop away merely stop long enough as he pass the stable to give order that the carriage be prepare for mr keswick and take round to the front as he ride through the cool air of that fine November afternoon the spirit of mr brandon rise he feel a serene satisfaction in assure himself that although he have be very angry indeed with mr keswick on account of she most unheard of and outrageous conduct yet he have not allow he indignation to burst out against she in any way of which he would afterward be ashamed some hasty word have escape he but they be of no importance and under the circumstance no one could have avoid speak they but when he have address she at any length he have speak dispassionately and practically and she be at bottom a practical woman have see the sense of he advice and have go home comfortably in he carriage whether she take she insane fancy home with she or drop they on the road it matter very little to he so that he never see she again and he do not intend to see she again if she come again to he house he would leave it and not return until she have go but he have no reason to suppose that he would be force into any such exceedingly disagreeable action as this he do not believe she would ever come back for unless she be really crazy -- crazy -- and in that case she ought to be put in the lunatic asylum -- she could not keep up for any length of time the extraordinary and outrageous delusion that he would be willing to renew the feeling that he have entertain for she in she youth mr brandon ride until nearly dark for it take a good while to free he mind from the effect of the excitement and torment of that day but when he enter the house and take he seat in he library chair by the fire he have almost regain he usual compose and well satisfied frame of mind then through the quietly open door come mr keswick and stealthily step towards he in the fitful light of the blaze log she put she hand on he arm and say : dear robert how glad i be to see you back the next morning about ten o'clock mr keswick send she eighteenth or twentieth message to mr brandon who have shut himself up in he room since a little before supper-time on the previous evening the message be send by peggy and she be instruct to shout it outside of she master 's door until he take notice of it its purport be that it be necessary that mr keswick should go home to-day and that she horse be harness and she be now ready to go but that she could not think of leave until she have see mr brandon again she would therefore wait until he be ready to come down mr brandon look out of the window and see the spring-wagon at the outside of the broad stile with plez standing at the sorrel 's head he remember that the venerable demon have say at the first that she intend to stay but one night and he could but believe that she be now really go know she as he do however he be very well aware that if she have say she would not leave until she have see he she would stay in he house for a year unless he sooner go down to she therefore he open he door and slowly and feebly descend the stair my dear dear robert exclaimed mr keswick totally regardless of the fact that peggy be stand at the front door with she valise in she hand and that there be another servant in the hall how pale and haggard and worn you look you must be quite unwell and i do not know but that i ought to stay here and take care of you at these word a look of agony pass over the old man 's face but he say nothing but i be afraid i can not stay any longer this time continue the widow keswick for my niece would not know what have become of I and there be thing at home that i must attend to but i will come again do not think i intend to desert you dear robert you shall see I soon again but while i be go she say turn to the two servant i want you maid to take good care of you master you must do it for he sake for he have always be kind to you but i also want you to do it for my sake do not you forget that and now dear robert good-bye as she speak she extend she hand towards the old gentleman without a word but with a good deal of apparent reluctance he take the long bony hand in he and probably would have instantly drop it again have not mrs keswick give he a most hearty clutch and a vigorous and long-continued shake it be hard dear robert she say for we to part with nothing but a hand-shake but there be people about and this will have to do and then after urge he to take good care of he health so valuable to they both and assure he that he would soon see she again she give he hand a final shake and leave he accompany by peggy she go out to the spring-wagon and clamber into it it almost surpass belief that mr brandon a virginium gentleman of the old school should have stand in he hall and have see a old lady leave he house and get into a vehicle without accompany and assist she but such be the case on this occasion he seem to have forget he tradition and to have lose he impulse he simply stand where the widow keswick have leave he and gaze at she when she be seat and ready to start the old lady turn towards he call out to he in a cheery voice : good-bye robert and kiss she hand to he mr keswick slowly drive away and mr brandon stand at he hall door gaze after she until she be entirely out of sight then he ejaculate : the devil 's daughter and go into he library i wonder say peggy when she return to the kitchen how you all 's gwine to like habin dat ole miss keswick libin h ` yar as you all 's mistiss who be gwine to hab she growl aunt judy you all be sturdily retort peggy dar be not no use tryin ' to git out ob dat dat old miss keswick do go a ' kunjered mah ' robert a ' dey 's boun ' to git mar ` ed i do

for you all you peggy shout the irate aunt judy shut up wid you fool talk when mah ' robert marry dat ole jimpsun weed de angel gabr ` el blow he hohn shuh slowly drive along the road to she home the widow keswick gaze cheerfully at the blue sky above she and the pleasant autumn scenery around she sniff the fine fresh air delicately scented with the odor of fall leaf and settle herself into a more comfortable position on she seat she complacently say to herself : well i reckon the old scapegrace have get he money 's worth this time chapter xxxi there be two reason why peggy could not go to live

say let we go into one of the parlor it will be more comfortable how kind murmured mr keswick as she cling to the arm of mr brandon for you to bring we good friend colonel macon they go into a parlor which be empty and where they be not likely to be disturbed mr brandon walk there without say a word he face be as pallid as its well-seasoned color would allow and he look straight before he with a air which seem to indicate that he be try to remember something terrible or else try to forget it and that he himself do not know which it be colonel macon do not stay long in the parlor there be that in the air of mr keswick which make he understand that there be other place in richmond where he would be much more welcome than in that room he go down into the large hall where the gentleman generally congregate and there in great distress of mind he pace up and down the marble floor exchange nothing but the briefest salutation and answer with the acquaintance he occasionally encounter the clerk behind he desk at one side of the hall have see man walk up and down in that way and he think that the colonel have probably be speculate in tobacco or wheat but he know he be good for the amount of he bill and he retain he placidity in about half a hour there come down the stair at one end of the hall a elderly person who somewhat resemble mr brandon of midbranch the clothes and the hat be the same that that gentleman wear and the same heavy gold chain with dangling seal-ring hang across he ample waistcoat but there be a general air of haggardness and stoop about he which do not in the least suggest the upright and portly gentleman who have write he name in the hotel register the day before yesterday colonel macon make five stride towards he and seize he hand what say he how -- mr brandon do not look at he he let he eye fall where they choose it matter not to he what they gaze upon and in a low voice he say : it be all over over repeat the colonel mr brandon put a feeble hand on he friend 's arm and together they walk into the reading room where they sit down in a corner have you settle it then ask colonel macon with great anxiety be she go it be settle say mr brandon

know that she be not to be frightened but it be needless to talk about that it be all over now and he be as much bind to she as if he have promise before a magistrate but you do not mean to say exclaim the colonel in a voice of anguish that you be really go to marry she sir say mr brandon solemnly there be no way to get out of it if you think there be you do not know the woman i would have die first say the colonel i never would have submit to she i do not submit reply mr brandon that be do when the letter be write i roused myself and i say everything i could say but it be all useless she hold I to my promise i tell she i would fly to the end of the earth rather than marry she and then sir she threaten I with a prosecution for breach of promise and think of the disgrace that that would bring upon I upon my family name and on my niece and she young husband it be a mistake sir to suppose that she merely wish to persecute I she wish to marry I and she be go to do it the colonel bow he face upon he hand and groan mr brandon look at he with a dim compassion in he eye do not reproach yourself sir he say we think we be act for the best but little more be say and two crushed old gentleman retire to they room in the day of she youth mr keswick have be very well know in richmond and there be a good many elderly lady and gentleman now live in that city who remember she as a handsome sparkling and somewhat eccentric young woman and who have since hear of she as a decidedly eccentric old one mr brandon also have a large circle of friend and acquaintance in the city and when it become know that these two elderly person be to be marry -- and the news begin to spread shortly after mr keswick reach the house of the friend with whom she be stay -- it excite a great deal of excusable interest mr keswick accord to she ordinary method of action take all the arrangement into she own hand she appoint the wedding for the eighth of January in order that the happy pair might go to new york and be present at the nuptials of junius and roberta mr brandon have think of write to junius in the hope that the young man might do something to avert he fate but remember how utterly unable junius have always be to move he aunt one inch this way or that he do not believe that he could be of any service in this case in which all the energy of she mind be evidently engage and he readily consent that she should attend to all the correspondence it would indeed have be too hard for he to break the direful truth to he niece and junius he venture to suggest that miss peyton be send for have a faint hope that he might in some manner lean upon she but mrs keswick inform he that she niece must stay at home to take charge of the place there be two woman in the house who be busy sew for she and it would be impossible for she to come to richmond she correspondence keep the widow keswick very busy she decide that she would be marry in a church which she use to attend in she youth and to all of she old friend and to all those of mr brandon whose name she could learn by diligent inquiry invitation be send to attend the ceremony but no one outside of richmond be invite the old lady do not come to the city with a purple sun-bonnet and a big umbrella she wear she best bonnet which have be use for church-going purpose for many year and array herself in a travel suit which be of excellent material although of most antiquated fashion she discuss very freely with she friend the arrangement she have make and protuberant candor be at time one of she most noticeable characteristic she do not leave it altogether to other to say that the match she be about to make be a most remarkably good one for year it have be a hard struggle for she to keep up the keswick farm but now she have fight a battle and win a victory which ought to make she comfortable and satisfied for the rest of she life if mr brandon 's family have take a great deal from she she would more than repay herself by appropriate the old gentleman together with he possession after the depression follow the first shock mr brandon endeavor to stiffen himself there be a great deal of pride in he and if he be oblige to go to the altar he do not wish he old friend to suppose that he be go there to be sacrifice he have bring this dreadful thing upon himself but he would try to stand up like a man and bear it and after all it might not be for long the widow keswick be a good deal older than he be other thought occasionally come to comfort he she could not make he continually live with she and he have plan for visit to richmond and even to new york and better than that she might want to spend a good deal of time at she own farm for the sake of my name and my niece he say to himself i must bear it like a man and in answer to a earnest adjuration colonel pinckney macon solemnly promise that he would never reveal to man or woman that he friend do not marry the widow keswick entirely of he own wish and accord it be the desire of mr keswick that the marriage although conduct in church should be very simple in its arrangement there would be no bridesmaid or groomsman no flower no breakfast and the couple would be dress in travel costume the friend of the old lady persuade she to make considerable change in she attire and a costume be speedily prepare which while it suggest the fashion of the present day be also calculate to recall reminiscence of those of a quarter of a century ago this simplicity be the only thing connect with the affair which satisfied mr brandon and he would have be glad to have the marriage entirely private with no more witness than the law demand but to this mr keswick would not consent she want to have she former friend about she accordingly the church be pretty well fill with old colonel old major old general and old judge with they wife and they sister and in a few case they daughter all the elderly people in richmond who in the day of they youth have know the gay miss matty pettigrew and the handsome bob brandon feel a certain rejuvenation of spirit as they go to the wedding of the couple who have once be these two the old lady look full of life and vigor and despite the circumstance mr brandon preserve a good deal of he usual manly deportment but when in the course of the marriage service the clergyman come to the question in which the bride-groom be ask if he would have this woman to be he wed wife to love and keep she for the rest of they life the answer i will come forth in a feeble tone which be not wholly divest of a tinge of despondency with the lady it be quite otherwise when the like question be put to she she step back and in a loud clear voice exclaim : not i marry that man there she continue in a higher tone and point she finger at the astounded mr brandon not for the world sir before he be bear he family defraud and despoil my people and as soon as he take affair into he own hand he continue the villainous law robbery until we be poor and he be rich and not content with that he basely wreck and destroy the plan i have make for the comfort of my old age in order that he paltry purpose may be carry out after all that do anybody here suppose that i would take he for a husband marry he not i and with these word the old lady turn she back on the clergyman and walk rapidly down the center aisle until she reach the church door there she stop and turn towards the stupefied assemblage she snap she bony finger in the air and exclaim : now mr robert brandon of midbranch we account be balanced she then go out of the door and take a street car for the train that would carry she to she home the end end of project gutenberg 's the late mr null by frank richard stockton
