move softly among the pine as a young witch gathering simple she wear a hood of finely weave shadow yet though she draw it close sunbeam troop westward flash strange light across she haunted face the bird that live in the wood have break out into sudden singing as she steal in hungry for silence passionate to be alone and at the foot of every tree she cry hush hush to the bedtime nest when all but one be still she slip the hood from she face and listen to she own bird the night-jar toiling at he hopeless love from a bough on which already hang a little star then it be that a young man with a face shine with sorrow vault lightly over the mossed fence and dip down the green path among the shadow and the toadstool and the silence silencieux he say over to himself -- i love you silencieux far down the wood come and go through the tree the black and white gable of a little châlet to which he be dream he way suddenly a small bronze object catch he eye move across the mossy path it be a beautiful beetle very slim and graceful in shape with singularly long and fine antenna antony have love these thing since he be a child -- dragonfly with they lamp-like eye of luminous horn moth with pall-like wing that fill the world with silence as you look at they sleepy as death -- love they with the passion of a japanese artist who delight to carve they on quaint nugget of metal perhaps it be that they be so like word -- word to which he have give all the love and worship of he life surely he have love silencieux -lrb- 1 -rrb- more since he have find for she that beautiful name he hold the beetle in he hand a long while love it then he say to himself with a smile in which be the delight of a success : a vase-shaped beetle with deer 's horn the phrase delight he he set the insect down on the path tenderly he have do with it he have carve it in seven word the little model might now touch its delicate way among the fern at peace a vase-shaped beetle with deer 's horn he repeat as he walk on and then the gathering gloom of the wood suggest a addition : and some day i shall find in the wood that moth of which i have dream since childhood -- the dark moth with the face of death between he wing the châlet stand on a little clearing in a little circle of pine from it the ground slope down towards the valley and at some distance beneath smoke curl from a house lose amid cloud of foliage the abound green life of this damp and brooding hollow a great window look down the woodside fill one side of the châlet and the other be dark with book a occasional picture or figure jar lighting up the shadow a small fire flicker beneath a quaintly devise mantel though it be summer -- for the mist creep up the hill at night and chill the soul of the book a great old bureau with a wonderful belly of mahogany fill a corner of the room breathing antique mystery and refinement at one end of it on a small vacant space of wall hang a cast apparently the death-mask of a woman by which the eye be immediately attract with something of a shock and hold by a curious fascination the face be smile a smile of great peace and also of a strange cunning one other characteristic it have : the woman look as though at any moment she would suddenly open she eye and if you turn away from she and look again she seem to be smile to herself because she have open they that moment behind you back and just close they again in time it be a face that never change and yet be always change she look doubly strange in the evening light and she smile soften and deepen as the shadow gather in the room antony come and stand in front of she silencieux he whisper i love you silencieux smile silence i love you all day long on the moor you smile have steal like a moonbeam by my side -- as he speak from far down the wood come the gentle sound of a woman 's voice call antony and come nearer as it call with a shade of impatience antony bent nearer to the image and kiss it good-bye silencieux he whisper good-bye until the rising of the moon then he pass out on to the little staircase that lead down into the wood and call back to the approach voice : i be come beatrice -- ` beatrice ' be the name of he wife as he call a shaft of late sunlight suddenly irradiate the tall slim form of a woman come up the wood she wear no hat and the sun make a misty glory of she pale gold hair she seem a fairy romantic thing thus glide in she yellow silk gown through the darken pine and she face be the face of the image feature for feature there be on it too the same light the same smile antony she call as they draw nearer to each other where in the wide world have you be dinner have be wait for half-an-hour dinner he say laughing and kiss she kindly fancy the high muse have make I half-an-hour late for dinner beauty have make I forget my dinner disgraceful i do not mind you forget dinner antony -- but you might have remember I do you think i could remember beauty and forget you yes you _ be _ beautiful to-night silen -- beatrice you look like a lady one meet walk by a haunt well in some old arthurian tale hush say beatrice listen to the night-jar he be worth a hundred nightingale yes what a passion be that say antony so sincere and yet so fascinating too ` yet ' do you say antony why sincerity be the most fascinating thing in the world and as they listen antony 's heart have steal back to silencieux and once more in fancy he press he lip to hers in the dusk : it be with such a eternal passion that i love you silencieux footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : of course the writer be aware that while silencieux be feminine she name be masculine in such fanciful name however such license have always be consider allowable -rrb- chapter ii the come of silencieux the manner in which antony have find and come to love silencieux be a strange illustration of that law by which one love grow out of another -- that law by which man love live woman because of the dead and dead woman because of the live one day as chance have send he pick he way among the orange box the move farm and the wig-maker of covent garden he have come upon a sculptor 's shop oddly crowd in among cockney carter and decay vegetable face of greece and rome gaze at he suddenly from a broad window and for a few moment he forsake the motley beauty of modern london for the order loveliness of antiquity through white corridor of face he pass with the cold breath of classic art upon he cheek and in the company of the dead who live for ever he be conscious of a contagion of immortality soon in a alcove of face he grow conscious of a presence some one be smile near he he turn and almost with a start find that -- as he then think -- it be no living thing but just a plaster cast among the other that be thus shine like a star among the dead a face not ancient not modern but a face of yesterday to-day and for ever instantly he know he have see the face before where why of course it be the face of beatrice feature for feature how strange -- and loving beatrice he buy it because of he great love for she who be the artist what the time and circumstance that have anticipate in this strange fashion the only face he have ever really love on earth he seek information of the shopkeeper who tell he a strange little story of a unknown model and a unknown artist and two tragic fate when antony have bring silencieux home to beatrice she have at first take that delight in she which every create thing take in a perfect or even a imperfect reflection of itself to have be anticipate in a manner so unusual give back in romantic suggestiveness what at first sight it seem to steal from one 's personal originality only at first sight -- for if like beatrice you be the possessor of a face so uncommon in type that you lover might with little fear of disproof declare at all event in england that there be none other like it you might grow superstitious as you look at a anticipation so creepily identical and conceive strange fancy of re-incarnation what if this have be you in some former existence or at all event if there be any truth in those who tell we that in the mould and line of we face and hand -- yes and in every secret mark of we body -- we fate be write as in a parchment would it not be reasonable to surmise perhaps to fear that the writing should mean the same on one face as on the other and the fate as well as the face prove identical beatrice give the mask back to antony with a little shiver it be very wonderful very strange but she make I frighten what be the story the man tell you antony no doubt it be all nonsense antony reply but he say that it be the death-mask of a unknown girl find drown in the seine drown in the seine exclaim beatrice grow almost as white as the image yes and he say too that the story go that the sculptor who mould it have fall so in love with the dead girl that he have go mad and drown himself in the seine also can it be true antony i hope so for it be so beautiful -- and nothing be really beautiful till it have come true but the pain the pity of it -- antony that be a part of the beauty surely -- the very essence of its beauty -- beauty beauty o antony that be always you cry i can only think of the terror the human anguish poor girl -- and she turn again to the image as it lay upon the table -- see how the hair lie moulded round she ear with the water and how she eyelash stick to she cheek -- poor girl but see how happy she look why should we pity one who can smile like that see how peaceful she look and with a sudden whim antony take the image and set it lie back on a soft cushion in a corner of the couch at the same time throw round its neck he black cloak which he have cast off as he come in the image nestle into the cushion as though it have veritably be a living woman weary for sleep and softly smile that it be near at last so comfortable she seem you could have swear she breathe antony lift she head once or twice with he finger to delight himself with see she sink back luxuriously once more beatrice grow more and more white antony please stop i can not bear it she look so terribly alive at that moment antony 's touch have be a little too forcible the image hang poise for a moment and then begin to fall in the direction of beatrice oh she be fall she almost scream as antony save the cast from the floor for god 's sake stop how childish of you beatrice she be only plaster i never know you such a baby i can not help it antony i know it be foolish but i can not help it i think live in this place have make I morbid she seem so alive -- so evil so cruel i be sorry you buy she antony i can not bear to look at she will not you take she away take she up into the wood keep she there take she now i shall not be able to sleep all night if i know she be in the house she be half hysterical and antony soothe she gently yes yes dear i be sorry i 'll take she up the wood now this minute wait till i light the lantern poor beatrice i never dream she would affect you so i love she dear -- because i love you but i would rather break she in piece than that she should make you unhappy though to break any image of you dear he add tenderly would seem a kind of sacrilege you know how i love you beatrice do not you of course i do dear and it be sweet of you to buy she for my sake and i be quite silly to-night to-morrow i shall think nothing about she still dear she do frighten I i can not tell why there seem something malignant about she something that threaten we happiness oh how silly i be -- meanwhile antony have light a old brass lantern and presently he be flash he way up among the dark sound of the black old wood with that ghostly face tenderly press against he side he stop once to turn he lantern upon she how mysterious she look here in the night under the dark pine he too feel a little haunted as he climb he châlet staircase and unlock the door every sound he make echo fatefully in the silent wood and when he have find a place for the image and hang she there she certainly look a ghostly companion for the midnight lamp in the middle of a wood how strangely she smile the smile almost of one take possession no wonder beatrice have be frighten be there some mysterious life in the thing after all why should these indefinite foreboding come over he as he look at she -- but he be grow as childish as beatrice surely midnight a dark wood a lantern and a death-mask with two owl whistle to each other across the valley be enough to account for any number of foreboding but antony shiver for all that as he lock the door and hasten back again down the wood chapter iii the northern sphinx antony have not write a poem to he wife since they little girl wonder have be bear now some four year ago surely it be from no lack of love this silence but merely due to the working of what would seem to be a law of the artistic temperament : that to turn a muse into a wife however long and faithfully loved be to bid good-bye to the muse but a day or two after the come of silencieux antony find himself suddenly inspire once more to sing of he wife it be the best poem he have write for a long time and when it be finish he come down the wood impatient to read it to beatrice this be the poem which he call the northern sphinx : -- sphinx of the north with subtler smile than hers who in the yellow south with make-believe mysterious mouth deepen the _ ennui _ of the nile and with no secret left to tell a worn and withered old coquette dream sadly that she draw we yet with antiquated charm and spell : tell I you secret sphinx -- for mine -- what mean the color of you eye half innocent and all so wise blue as the smoke whose waver line curl upward from the sacred pyre of sacrifice or holy death pale twist wreath of opal breath from fire mount into fire what be the meaning of you hair that little fairy palace work with many a grave fantastic thought i send a kiss to wander there to climb from golden stair to stair wind in and out its cunning bower -- o garden gold with golden flower o little palace build of hair the meaning of you mouth who know o mouth where many meaning meet -- death kiss it stern love kiss it sweet and each have shape its mystic rise mouth of all sweet whose sweetness sip its tribute honey from all hive the sweetest of the sweetest life soft flower and little child 's lip yet rather learn its heavenly smile from sorrow god 's divinest art sorrow that break and break the heart yet make a music all the while ah what be that within you eye upon you lip within you hair the sacred art that make you fair the wisdom that have make you wise tell I you secret sphinx -- for mine -- the mystic word that from afar god spake and make you rise and star the _ fiat lux _ that bid you shine while antony read beatrice 's face grow sadder and sadder when he have finish she say : -- it be very beautiful antony -- but it be not write for I what can you mean beatrice who else can it be write for to the image of I that you have set up in my place beatrice be you go mad it be quite true all the same time will show perhaps you do not know it yourself as yet but you will before long but beatrice the poem show its own origin have you image blue eye or curiously coil hair -- oh yes of course you think of I you fill in from I but the inspiration the wish to write it come from the image -- it be certainly true that i love to look at it as i love to look at a picture of you -- because it be you -- as yet no doubt but you will soon love it for its own sake you be already begin i love a image you be too ridiculous beatrice do it really seem so strange dear i sometimes think you have never love anything else antony have laugh down beatrice 's fancy yet all the time she have be talk he be conscious that the idea she have suggest be appeal to he with a perverse fascination to love not the literal beloved but the purify stainless image of she -- surely this would be to ascend into the region of spiritual love a love unhampered and untainted by the earth as he say this to himself he mind ever pitilessly self-conscious know it be but a subterfuge a fine euphemism for a strange desire which he have know be already grow within he for when beatrice have speak of he love a image it be no abstract passion he have conceive but some fanciful variation of earthly love -- a love of beauty centre itself upon some form midway between life and death inanimate and yet alive human and yet remove from the accident of humanity to love a image with one 's whole heart if only one could achieve that -- and never come out of the dream these thought give he a new desire to look again at the image he feel that in some way she would be change and he hasten up the wood in a strange expectancy chapter iv at the rising of the moon but a week or two more and beatrice 's prophecy have progress so far towards fulfilment that antony be go about the wood and the moor say over to himself the name he have find for the image as we see in the first chapter and he love for silencieux begin more or less as a determine self-illusion grow more and more of a reality every day new life well into silencieux 's face as every day life ebb from the face of beatrice surely foresee the come on of what she have fear for the love he give to silencieux antony must take away from beatrice from whom as the day go by he grow more and more withdraw it be true that the long lonely day which he spend in the wood bear fruit in a remarkable productiveness never have he imagination be so enkindle or he pen so winged but this very industry the proof of which he would each evening bring down the wood for that fine judgment of beatrice 's which in spite of all still remain more to he than any other praise -- this very industry be the secret confirmation for beatrice 's sad heart no longer the inspirer she be yet she bitterly tell herself honor among woman as a critic she heart might bleed and she eye fill with tear as he read but then as he would say the beauty the music be it beautiful be it music if it be that no matter how it have be make let we give thanks for creation though it involve the sacrifice of we own most tender and sacred feeling to set mere personal feeling against beauty -- human tear against a immortal creation do he spare he own feeling indeed he do not on the night when we first meet he bidding good-bye to silencieux until the rising of the moon he have sit through dinner eating but little feverishly and somewhat cruelly gay though he be as yet too kind to admit it to himself beatrice be begin to bear he not merely by she sadness which he absorption prevent he realize except in flash but by she very resemblance to the image -- of which from have be the beloved original she be in he eye become a indifferent materialisation the sweet flesh he have love so tenderly become a offence to he as a medium too gross for the embodiment of so beautiful a face such a face as silencieux 's demand a more celestial porcelain dinner at last finish he make a excuse to beatrice for leave she alone once more at the end as he have during all the rest of the day and hasten to keep he tryst with silencieux during dinner the conscious side of he mind have be luxuriate in the romantic sound of until the rising of the moon -- for he be as yet a long way from be quite simple even with silencieux -- and the idea of he go out with serious eagerness to meet one who if she be as he know a living be be a image too delighted he sense of fantastic make-believe there be in all love that element of make-believe every woman who be loved be partly the creation of she lover 's fancy he consciously siderealise she and with open eye magnify she importance to he life antony but make believe and magnify uncommonly -- and he dream of vivify white plaster be perhaps less desperate than the dream of some that would breathe the breath of life into the colder clay of some beloved woman who seem spontaneously to live but be dead all the while silencieux appear to be dead but beneath that eternal smile as beatrice have divine as antony be learn she be only too terribly alive yes antony 's be the easier dream the moon and antony come up the wood together from opposite end and when antony enter he châlet silencieux be already wait for he she head crown with a moonbeam he kiss she softly and take she with he out into the fern chapter v silencieux speak so long as the moon hold antony steal up the wood each night to meet silencieux -- at the rising of the moon sometimes he would lie in a hollow with she head upon he knee and gaze for a hour at a time entrance into she face he would feign to himself that she sleep and he would hold he breath lest he should awaken she sometimes he would say in a tender whisper not loud enough for she to hear : -- it be cold to-night silencieux see my cloak will keep you warm once as he do this she heave a gentle sigh as though thank he at other time he would place she against the gable of the châlet so that the moonlight fall upon she and then he would plunge into the wood and walk its whole length so that as he wind he way back through the intervene brake she face would come and go glimmer away off through the leafage beckon to he to return and once he think he hear she call he name very softly through the wood that may have be a illusion but it be during these day that he do actually hear she speak for the first time he have be write till past midnight with she smile just above he and when he have turn out the lamp and be move to the door through the vague flickering light of the fire he distinctly hear a voice very luxurious and tender say antony just behind he it be hardly more than a whisper but its sweetness thrill he blood and half in joy and fear he turn to she again but she be only smile inscrutably as before and she speak no more for that night chapter vi the three black pond at the bottom of the valley approach by sunken honeysuckle lane that seem wind into the center of the earth lay three black pond almost hide in a _ cul-de-sac _ of woodland though long since appropriate by nature make she own by moss and rooted oak they be so set one below the other with green causeway between each that a ancient art long since become nature have evidently design and dig they year perhaps century ago so long dead be the old pond-maker that great tree grow now upon the causeway and vast jungle of rush and water grass choke the trickle overflow from one pond to the other once it be say when the earth of those part have be rich in iron these pond have drive great hammer -- but long before the memory of the oldest cottager they have rest from they labor and live only the life of beauty and silence where iron have once be be now the wild rose and the grim wound of the earth have be heal by the kiss of five hundred spring about these pond steal many a secret path vein with clumsy root shadow with the thick bush of many a clustering parasite and echo sometimes beneath from the hollow shelter of coot or water-rat lily float in circle about the pond like the crown of sunken queen and sometimes a bird break the silence with a frightened cry it be here that beatrice and wonder would often take they morning walk -- wonder though but a little girl of four have grow more and more of a companion to she mother since antony 's love for silencieux a morning in August the two be walk hand in hand wonder be one of those little girl that seem to know all the meaning of life while yet struggle with the alphabet of its unimportant word the soul of such a child be of all thing the most mysterious there be that in she face as she cling on to she mother 's hand which seem to say : o mother i understand it all and far more if i might only talk to you in the language of heaven -- but my word be like my little leg frail and uncertain of they footing and while i think all you strange grown-up thought i can only talk of toy and doll mother father 's blood as well as yours be in my vein and so i understand you both poor little mother poor little father little wonder look these thing she may indeed have think they but all she say be : o mother what be that that be a rabbit dear see there be another see he fluffy white tail and again : o mother what be that that be a water-hen dear she have a little house a warm nest close to the water among the bush yonder and she call like that to let she little child know she be come home with some dainty thing for lunch she mean ` hush hush do not be frightened i be come just as fast as i can ' funny little mother what pretty story you tell I but do the bird really talk -- oh but look little mother there be daddy -- it be antony deep in some dream of silencieux daddy daddy cry the little girl he take she tenderly by the hand daddy where have you be all this long time you have bring I no flower for ever so long flower little wonder -- they be nearly all go away go to sleep till next year -- but see i will gather you something prettier than flower and hardly mark beatrice he lead wonder up and down among the wind underwood fungus of exquisite yellow and brown be pop up all about the wood he gather some of the most delicate and put they into the fresh small hand but daddy i must not eat they must i no dear -- they be too beautiful to eat you must just look at they and love they like flower but they be not flower daddy they do not smell like flower i would rather have flower daddy but there be no flower till next year you must learn to love these too little wonder they be more beautiful than flower oh no daddy they be not -- antony say beatrice how strange you be would you poison she see dear -lrb- turn to wonder -rrb- daddy be only tease let we throw they away they be nasty nasty thing promise I never to gather they will not you wonder yes mother i do not like they they frighten I antony turn into a by-path with a strange laugh and be lose to they in the wood chapter vii the lover of silencieux silencieux often speak to antony now sometimes a sudden startling word when he be write late at night sometimes long tender talk once a terrible whisper but all this time she never open she eye the lash still lay wet upon she cheek and when she speak she lip seem hardly to move only to smile with a deeper mean a intenser life indeed at these time she face shone with so great a brightness that antony 's vision be dazzle and to he gaze she seem almost featureless as a star once he have beg to see she eye you know not what you ask she have answer when you see my eye you will die some day antony you shall see my eye but not yet you have much to do for I yet there be yet much love for you and I before the end have all die who see you eye silencieux yes all die you have have many lover silencieux many lover and far from here and long ago yes many lover long ago echo silencieux you have be very cruel silencieux yes very cruel but very kind it be true man have die for I i have be cruel yes but to die for I have seem better than to live for any other and some of my lover i have never forsake when they have lose all in the world they have have I lonely garret have seem richly furnished because of my face and man with foodless lip have die blest because i be near they at the last sometimes i have kiss they lip and die with they and the world have miss my face for a hundred unlovely year -- for the world be only beautiful when i and my lover be in it antony you be one of my lover one of my dearest lover be great enough be all mine and perhaps i will die with you antony -- and leave the world in darkness for you sake another hundred year tell I of you lover silencieux nearly three thousand year ago i love a woman of mitylene very fair and make of fire but she love another more than i and for he sake throw herself from a rock into the sea as she fall the rose we have make together fall from she bosom and be tear to piece by the sea fisherman gather here and there a petal float on the water -- but what be they -- and the world have never know how wonderful be that rose of we love which she take with she into the depths of the sea you be faithful silencieux you love she still yes i love she still and with whom do love come next silencieux oh i love many those year for the loss of a great love send we vainly from hand to hand of many lesser love to ease a little the great ache and at that time the world seem full of my lover i have forget none of they they pass before I a fair frieze of unforgotten face but most i love a roman poet because perhaps he love so well the memory of she i have love and know so skilfully to make bloom again among he own red rose those petal of passionate ivory which the fisherman of lesbo have recover from the sea tell I of you lover silencieux say antony again hundred of year after i loved in florence a young poet with a face of silver he soul be give to a little red-cheeked girl she die and then i take he to my bosom and love he on through the year till he face have grow iron with many sorrow now at last he baby-girl by he side he sit in heaven with a face of gold in paris she go on have i be wonderfully beloved and in northern land near the pole -- but -- england say antony tell I of you english lover best of they i love two : one a laughing giant who love I three hundred year ago and the other a little london boy with large eye of velvet who mid all the gloom of you great city saw and love my face as none have see and love it since she of mitylene i find the giant sit by a country stream hold a daffodil in he mighty hand and whistle to the bird he take and wear I like a flower i be to he as a nightingale that sing from he sleeve for he love so much besides yet I he love best as those who can read he secret poem understand but my little london boy love I only for he the world hold nothing but my face and it be of he great love for I that he die but these be all poet say antony yes poet be the greatest of all lover though all who since the world begin have be the maker of beautiful thing have love I i love my poet best sweeter than marble or many color to my eye be the sound of a poet singing in my ear -- for whom silencieux do you step down into the sad water of the seine it be a young poet of pari beloved of many woman a drunkard of strange dream he too die because he love I and when he die there be none leave whose voice seem sweet after he so i die with he i die with he she repeat to come to life again with you many lip have be press to mine antony since the cold sleep of the seine fall over I but none be warm and wild like yours i love my sleep while the other kiss I but with the touch of you lip the dream of life begin to stir within I again o antony be great enough be all mine that we may fulfil we dream and perhaps antony i will die with you -- and leave the world in darkness for you sake another hundred year exalt above the earth with the joy of silencieux 's word antony press he lip to hers in a ecstasy and vow he life and all within it inviolably to she chapter viii a strange kiss for silencieux one hot August afternoon antony take silencieux with he to a bramble-covered corner of the dark moor which bound he little wood a ruin bank soak with sunshine a haunt of lizard a catacomb of little life that creep and run and whisper make they seat silencieux 's face out there under the open sky and in the full blaze of the sun at once lose and gain in reality gain by force of a contrast which accentuate while it limit she lose by opposition to the great face of earth and sky she life so concentrated so self-absorbed seem more of a essence potently distil compare with this abound ichor of existence that audibly sing in brim circulation through the vein of this carelessly immortal earth for some moment of self-conscious thought she shrink into a symbol -- a symbol of but one of the element of the mighty world yet to this element do not all the other more brutal in force more extend in space conspire so in some hour will the most mortal maid of warmest flesh and blood become a abstraction to she lover -- sometimes shrink to the significance of one more flower and sometimes expand to the significance of a microcosm a firmament in mystical miniature thus in like manner for antony do silencieux alternate between reality and dream that afternoon though all the time he know that however now and again the daylight seem to create a illusion of she remoteness she be still he and he of all man she choose lover suddenly as they sit there together silent and immovable antony catch the peer of two bright little eye fix on the white face of silencieux a tiny wedge-shaped head with dash of white across the brow rear itself out of a crevice in the bank a fork tongue come and go like black lightning through its eager little lip and a handsomely marked adder begin to glide like molten metal along the bank to silencieux the brilliant whiteness of the image have fascinate the little creature antony keep very still dart its head from side to side venomously alert against the smallest sound the adder reach silencieux then to antony 's delight it coil itself round the white throat still restlessly move its head wonderingly beneath the chin with a grace to which all movement from the beginning of time seem to have lead up it clasp silencieux 's neck and softly rear its lip to hers its black tongue dart to and fro along that strange smile he have kiss she antony exclaim and in a instant the adder be nothing more than a terrify rustle in the brushwood he take silencieux into he hand there be poison on she lip for another moment he fancy make he self-conscious and turn silencieux again into a symbol -- though it be but for a moment there be always poison on the lip of art he say to himself chapter ix the wonderful week as antony and silencieux become more and more to each other poor beatrice though she have be the first occasion of they love and little as she now demand seldom as antony speak to she seldom as he smile upon she distant as be the lonely walk she take infrequent as be she sad footfall in the little wood -- poor beatrice though indeed so far from active intrusion upon they love and as if only by she breathing with they the heavy air of that green unwholesome valley be become a irksome presence of the imagination they long to be somewhere together where beatrice have never be where she sad face could not follow they and one night silencieux whisper to antony : -- take I to the sea antony -- to some lonely sea to-morrow i will take you say antony where the loneliest land meet the loneliest sea on the morrow evening the high muse have once more make antony late for dinner one hour and two hour go by and then beatrice in alarm take the lantern and courageously brave the blackness of the wood the châlet be in darkness and the door be lock but through the uncurtained glass of the window she be able to irradiate the emptiness of its interior antony be not there but she notice with a shudder that the space usually fill by the image be vacant then she understand and with a hopeless sigh go down the wood again already antony and silencieux have find the place where the loneliest land meet the loneliest sea side by side they be sit on a moonlit margin of the world and antony be singing low to the murmur of the wave : -- hopeless of hope past desire even of thee there be one place i long for a desolate place that i sing all my song for a desolate place for a desolate face where the loneliest land meet the loneliest sea green wave and green grass -- and nought else be nigh but a shadow that beckon a desolate face and a shadow that beckon the desolate face to the desolate place where the loneliest sea meet the loneliest sky wide sea and wide heaven and all else afar but a spirit be sing a desolate soul that be joyfully wing -- a desolate soul -- to that desolate goal where the loneliest wave meet the loneliest star it be not good say silencieux i know answer antony throw it into the sea it be not worthy of the sea burn it fire be too August throw it to the wind they be too busy bury it it would make barren a whole meadow forget it i will -- and you i will and antony and silencieux laugh softly together by the sea many day antony and silencieux stay together by the sea they love it together in all its change in sun and rain in wild wind and dreamy calm at morning when it shine like a spirit at evening when it flicker like a ghost at noon when it lay asleep curl up like a woman in the arm of the land sometimes at evening they sit in the little fishing harbor watch the incoming boat till the sky grow sad with rigging and old man 's face then at last silencieux say : i be weary of the sea let we go to the town -- to the light and the sad cry of the human wave so they go to the town and find a room high up where they sit at the window and watch the human light and listen to the human music never have it be so wonderful to be together for a week antony live in heaven never have silencieux be so kind so close to he let we be little child he say let we do anything that come into we head so they run in and out among pleasure together join strange dance and sing strange song they clap they hand to juggler and acrobat and animal tortured into talent and sometimes as the gaudy theater resound about they they look so still at each other that all the rest fade away and they be leave alone with each other 's eye and great thought of god i love you silencieux i love you antony you will never leave I lonely in my dream silencieux never antony oh how tender sometimes be silencieux several night they have the whim that silencieux should masquerade in the wardrobe of she past to-night you shall go clothe as when you love that woman in mitylene antony would say or : to-night you shall be a little shepherd-boy with a leopard-skin across you shoulder and mountain berry in you hair or again : to-night you shall be pierrot -- mourn for he columbine ah how divine be silencieux in all she disguise -- a divine child oh how tender those night be silencieux antony sit and watch she face in awe and wonder surely it be the noblest face that have ever be see in the world be it true that that noble face be mine he would ask i can not believe it kiss it say silencieux gaily and see \* \* \* \* \* then on a sudden what be this change in silencieux so cold so silent so cruel have she grow silencieux antony call to she silencieux he plead but she never speak o silencieux speak i can not bear it then she lip move shall i speak she say with a cruel smile yes he beseech she again i shall love you no more in this world the light be go out the magic fade silencieux but she speak no more and with those lonely word in he ear antony come out of he dream and hear the rain fall miserably through the wood chapter x silencieux whisper so antony first know how cruel could be silencieux to those who love she she sudden silence he have grow to understand even to love always they have be break again by some wonderful word which he have know would come sooner or later all great nature be full of silence silence be the soil of all passion but now it be not silence that be between they but terrible speech as with a knife she have stab they love right in its heart yet antony know that he love could never die but only suffer during these day he half turn to beatrice how kind be she simple earth-warm affection after the star-cold transcendentalism in which he have be live how full of comfort be she unselfish humanity after the pitiless egoism of the divine and yet while it momentarily soothe he he realize with a heart sad for beatrice as for himself that it could never satisfy he again for day he leave silencieux alone in the wood and beatrice 's face brighten with they renew companionship but all the time he seem to hear silencieux call he and he know that he would have to go back one night almost happy again as he lay by the side of beatrice who be sleep deeply he rise stealthily and look out into the wood the moonlight fall through it mysteriously as on that night when he have steal up there to meet silencieux -- at the rising of the moon he could hesitate no longer leave beatrice asleep he be soon make he way once more through the moonlit tree the little châlet look very still and solemn like a temple of chaldean mystery and a unwonted chill of fear pass through antony as he stand in the circle of moonlight outside he spirit seem aware of some dread menace to the future in that moment and a voice be cry within he to go back but the longing that have bring he so far be too strong for such undefined warning once more he turn the key in the lock and look on silencieux once more the moonlight fall over she face like a veil of silver and on she eyelash be a glitter of tear she face be alive again alive too with a softness of womanhood he have never see before forgive I antony she say i love you all the time what else need silencieux say but it be so strange say antony after a while so strange i could have bear the pain if only i could have understand shall i tell you the reason antony yes it be because i saw in you eye a thought of beatrice for a moment you thought have forsake I and go to pity beatrice i see it in you eye poor beatrice say antony it be little indeed i give she could you not spare she so little silencieux i can spare she nothing you must be all mine antony -- you every thought and hope and dream so long as there be another woman in the world for you except I i can not be yours in the depths of my be nor you mine there must always be something withhold it will never be perfect until -- until when until antony -- and silencieux lower she voice to a awful whisper -- until you have make for I the human sacrifice the human sacrifice yes antony -- all my lover have do that for I they be not really mine till then some have bring I many such offering antony when will you bring I the human sacrifice o silencieux antony 's heart chill with terror at silencieux 's word it be against this that the voice have warn he as he come up the wood o that he have never see silencieux more never hear she poisonous voice again as one flee before the shadow of uncommitted sin that gain upon he at each stride antony flee from the place and seek the moor the moon be near its setting and soon the dawn would throw open the eastern door of the sky he walk on and on wait pray for stifle for the light and at last with a freshening of the air and faint sound of return consciousness from distant farm it come high over a lake of ethereal silver well up out of space hang the morning star shine as though its heart would break bright as a tear that must slip down the face of heaven and fall amid the grass as antony look up at it he soul escape from its prison of dark thought and such a exaltation have come with the quicken light that it seem as though the body with little more than pure aspiration to wing it might follow the soul 's flight to that crystal sphere in that moment antony know that the love in the soul of man be mate only with the infinite universe in no marriage less than that shall it find lasting fulfilment of itself no single face however beautiful no single human soul however vast can absorb it silencieux beatrice wonder himself all fade away in a trance-like sense of a stupendous passion a August possession he feel that within he which rise up gigantic from the earth and tower into eyrie of space from whence that morning star seem like a dewdrop glitter low down upon the earth it be the god in he that know itself for one brief space a moment 's awakening in the sleep of fact could a god so great so awaken be again the slave of one earthly face yes the greater the god the greater the slave and so it be that fall plumb down from that skyey exaltation human again with the weakness that follow divine moment antony return from the morning star to silencieux she face be bath in the delicate early sunlight and look very pure and gentle and he kiss she surely those terrible word have be a illusion of the dark hour silencieux have never say they he kiss she again i love you silencieux he say and then she speak if you love I antony she say if you love I -- o what silencieux he cry he heart grow cold once more come nearer antony put you ear to my lip -- antony if you love I -- the human sacrifice o god he cry here in the sunlight -- it be true -- and a man with the doom of he nature heavy upon he he once more go out into the wood chapter xi wonder in the wood a few day after this little wonder play about the garden have slip away from she nurse and pleased in she little soul at she cleverness have find she way up to she father 's châlet antony be sit at he desk write with he door open daddy suddenly come a little voice from the bottom of the staircase daddy where be you antony rise and go to the door come in little wonder well it be a clever girl to come all the way up the wood by herself yes daddy say the self-possessed little girl as she toddle into the châlet and look round wonderingly at the book and picture then presently : daddy what do you do all day in the wood i make beautiful thing show I some antony show she a page of he beautiful manuscript why those be only word silly daddy but word little wonder be the most beautiful thing in the world listen -- and he take the child on he knee listen : -- in xanadu do kubla khan a stately pleasure-dome decree : where alph the sacred river run through cavern measureless to man down to a sunless sea the child have inherit a love of beautiful sound and though she understand nothing of the mean the music charm she and she nestle close to she father with wide eye say some more daddy the sob cadence of the greatest of irish song come to antony 's mind and he croon a verse or two at random : all day long in unrest to and fro do i move the very soul within my breast be waste for you love the heart in my bosom faint to think of you my queen my life of life my saint of saint my dark rosaleen my own rosaleen to hear you sweet and sad complaint my life my love my saint of saint my dark rosaleen over dew over sand will i fly for you weal : you holy delicate white hand shall girdle I with steel at home in you emerald bower from morning 's dawn till e ` en you 'll pray for I my flower of flower my dark rosaleen my fond rosaleen you 'll think of I thro ' daylight hour my virgin flower my flower of flower my dark rosaleen i could scale the blue air i could plough the high hill oh i could kneel all night in prayer to heal you many ill and one beamy smile from you would float like light between my toil and I my own my true my dark rosaleen my fond rosaleen would give I life and soul anew a second life a soul anew my dark rosaleen wonder child-like wearied with the length of the verse and suddenly the white face of silencieux catch she eye who be that lady daddy that be silencieux what a pretty name be she a kind lady daddy sometimes she be very beautiful she be like little mother but she face be so white she make I frightened hold I daddy -- and she crouch in he arm you must not be frighten of she wonder she love little girl see how she be smile at you she want to be friend with you she want you to kiss she little wonder oh no no almost scream the little girl but suddenly a cruel whim to insist come over the father and half-coaxingly and half-forcibly he hold she up to the image stroke its white cheek to reassure she see how kind she be little wonder see how she smile -- how she love you she love little girl and she never see any up here in the lonely wood it will make she so happy kiss she little wonder reluctantly the child obey and with a shudder she say : -- oh how cold she lip be daddy but be they not sweet little wonder no daddy they taste of dust and as antony have lift she up he have say in he heart : silencieux i bring you my little child chapter xii autumn in the valley autumn in the valley be autumn melancholy and sinister as you find she only in such low-lying immemorial drift place of leaf and oozy sink of dank water for the moor autumn be the spring come back in purple and in golden wood and many another place where the year die happily she smile like a widow so young and fair that one think rather of life than death in she presence but in the valley autumn be a fearsome hag a little crazy two-double gathering stick in a scarlet cloak when she turn she wicked old eye upon you the life die within you and wherever you walk she be always somewhere in the bush mutter evil spell all the year round under the green cloud of summer you might meet autumn creep somewhere in the valley like foul mist that creep from pool to pool for here all the year be decay to feed upon and dead leaf for she to sleep on always the year round in the valley if you listen close you would hear something sigh something die to the happiest walking there would come strange sinking of the heart unaccountable premonition of overhang doom there the least superstitious would start at the sight of a toad and come upon three magpie at once not without fear over all be a breath of imminent disaster a look of sorrow from which there be no escape it be not many yard away from a merry high-road but once in the shade of its lane it seem as though you have be shut away from the world of live man black slope of pine and melancholy bar of sunset walled you in as in some funeral hall of judgment alas beatrice 's be not the happiest of heart and all day long this autumn as the morning come later and darker and the evening earlier always voice in the valley voice of low-hanging mist and drip rain keep say : death be come death be come tap at the window tick and cry in the room be the same message till in a terror of the wall she would flee into the wider prison of the wood and oppress by they in turn would escape with a beating heart into the honest daylight of the high-road so one fly from a haunt house or come out of a evil dream sometimes it seem as if the white face of silencieux look out from the woodside and mock she with the same cry : death be come death be come silencieux ah how happy they have be before the come of silencieux how frail be we happiness how suddenly it can die one moment it seem build for eternity marble-based and glitter with tower -- the next where it stand be lonely grass and dew not a stone leave ah yes how happy they have be and then antony by a heartless chance have see silencieux and in a instant they happiness have be at a end for ever only a glance of the eye and love be bear only a glance of the eye and alas love must die a glance of the eye and all the old kindness be go a glance of the eye and from the face you love the look you seek have die out for everlasting o antony antony moan beatrice as she wander alone in those dank autumn lane if you would only come back to I for one short day come back with the old look on you face be to I for a little while as you once be i think i could gladly die -- die a tattered flower catch she glance shake chilly in the damp wind and once more she hear the whisper death be come near where she walk stand in the midst of a small meadow overgrow with nettle the blacken ruin of a cottage long since destroy by fire on the edge of the little sandy lane perilously near the foot of the passer-by be its forget well the mouth choke with weed and brier in she absorption beatrice have almost walk into it now she part the bush and look down a stone fall as she look make a sepulchral echo what a place to hide one 's sorrow in no one would think of look there antony might think she have go away or he might drag the three black pond but here it be unlikely any one would come and in a little while -- a very little while -- antony would forget or sometimes make himself happy with he unhappiness ah but wonder no if antony need she no more wonder do she must stay for wonder 's sake and perhaps who could say antony might yet need she might come to she some day and say beatrice with the old voice to be really necessary to antony again if only for one little hour -- yes she could wait and suffer for that chapter xiii the human sacrifice the valley be a ill place even for the body a lair of rheum and ague and disembodied fever wait in well for the sink pail for the valley be very beautiful beautiful with that green beauty that only come of damp and decay late one October night antony alone with silencieux as be now again he custom be surprise to hear footstep come hastily up the wood and even more surprised at the sudden unusual appearance of beatrice i be sorry to disturb you antony she say note with a pang how the lamp have be arrange to throw a vivid light upon silencieux but i want you to come down and look at wonder i be afraid she be ill wonder ill exclaimed antony rise with a start i will come at once and they go together wonder be lie in she bed with flush cheek and bright yet heavy eye wonder my little wonder say antony caressingly as he bent over she do little wonder feel ill yes daddy i feel so sick daddy never mind she will be better to-morrow but he have notice how burn hot be she hand and how dry be she fresh little lip i must go for the doctor at once he say to he wife when they be outside the room the father so long asleep have spring awake at the first hint of danger to the little child that in he neglectful way he love deeply all the time and in spite of the danger to wonder a faint joy stir in beatrice 's heart to see he thus humanly arouse once more kiss I beatrice he say as he set out upon he errand do not be anxious it will be all right it be the first time he have kiss he wife for many day the doctor 's be some three mile away across the moor it be a bright starlit night and antony who know the moor well have no difficulty in make he way at a good pace along the mossy track presently he give a little cry of pain and stand still o god he cry it can not be that oh it can not at that moment for the first time a dreadful thought have cross he mind suddenly a memory of that afternoon when he have bade wonder kiss silencieux flash upon he and once more he hear himself say : silencieux i bring you my little child but he have never mean it so it have all be a mad fancy what be silencieux herself but a wilful selfish dream he see it all now how could a lifeless image have power over the life of he child and yet again be silencieux a lifeless image and still again if she be a image be it not always to a image that humanity from the beginning have be sacrifice yes perhaps if silencieux be only a image there be all the more reason to fear she when he return he would go to silencieux go on he knee and beg for the life of he child silencieux have be cruel but she could hardly be so cruel as that he drive back across the moor by the doctor 's side i have always think you unwise to live in that valley say the doctor it be pretty but like most pretty place it be unhealthy nature can seldom be good and beautiful at the same time the doctor be somewhat of a philosopher you little girl need the hill in fact you all do you wife be not half the woman she be since you take she into the valley you do not look any better for it either no sir believe I beauty 's all very well but it be not good to live with -- and by the way have you have you well look at lately that valley be just a beautiful sewer for the drainage of the hill a very market-town for all the germ and bacillus of the district and the doctor laugh as curiously enough people always do at jest about bacillus but when he look at wonder he take a more serious view of bacillus you must have you well look to at once he say you little girl be very ill she must be keep very quiet and on no account excited beatrice and antony take it in turn to watch by wonder 's bed that night and once while beatrice be watch antony find time to steal up the wood with he prayer to silencieux never have she look more mask-like more lifeless silencieux he cry i wickedly bring you my little child o give she back to I again i can not bear it i can not give she to you silencieux take I if you will i will gladly die for you but spare she o give she back to I silencieux but the image be impassive and make no sign silencieux he implore speak for i know you hear I be you a devil silencieux a devil i have worship all this time god help I have you no pity -- what be she little flower-life to you why should you snatch it out of the sun -- but silencieux make no sign then antony grow angry in he remorse : i hate you silencieux never will i look on you face again you be a evil dream that have steal from I the truth of life i have break a true heart that love I that would have die for I -- for you sake just to watch you loveless beauty to hear the cold music of you voice you be like the moon that turn man mad a hollow shell of silver draw all you light from the sun of life a silver shadow of the golden sun but prayer and reproach be alike in vain silencieux remain unheeding and antony return to watch by beatrice 's side with a heart that have now no hope and a soul weigh down with the sense of irrevocable sin there lay the little life he have murder deliver up to the moloch of art no sorrow no agony be now of any avail for ever little wonder would surely die and all the old lose opportunity of love she could never return he have love the shadow this be a part of the price day after day the cruel fever consume wonder as fire consume a flower she tiny face seem too small for the visitation of such suffering as burn and hammer behind the high white brow and yellowed and draw tight the skin upon the cheek she have so recently know the strange pain of be bear already for so little of life she be to endure the pain of death day after day hour after hour antony hang over she bed with a devotion and a unconsciousness of fatigue that make beatrice look at he with astonishment and sometimes even for a moment forget wonder in the joy with which she see he transfigure by simple human love now when it be too late he have become a father indeed and it bring some ease to he fiercely tortured heart to notice that it be he ministration that the die child seem to welcome most for the most part she lay in a semi-conscious state heed nothing and only moan now and again a sad little moan like a injured bird she seem to say she be so little a thing to suffer so once however when antony have just place some fresh ice around she head she open she eye and say dear little daddy and the light on antony 's face -- poor victim of perverse instinct that too often draw he really fine nature awry -- be sanctify to see as terrible be the look of torture that come over he face one night near the end when wonder in a sudden nightmare of delirium have seize he hand and cry : -- o daddy the white lady see she there at the end of the bed she be smile daddy -- then lower you will not make I kiss she any more will you daddy -- beatrice have go to snatch a hour or two 's sleep so she never hear this and it be no mere cowardly consolation for antony to think afterwards that no one but he and he little child have know of that fatal afternoon in the wood the dead understand all -- yes even the dead we have murder but the living can never be tell a secret such as that which antony and he little daughter whose soul be really grow up though she speak still in baby language share immortally between they when beatrice return to the room wonder be sleep peacefully again but at the chill hour when watcher blow out the night-light and a dreary greyness come like a fog through the curtain antony and beatrice fall into each other 's arm in anguish for wonder be dead chapter xiv a song of the little dead they carry little wonder to a green churchyard a place of kind old tree and tender country bell there be few bird to welcome she in the grim November morning but the grass steal close and whisper that very soon the thrush and the nightingale would be come that the violet be already on they way and that when may be there she should lie all day in a bed of perfume for very dear to nature 's heart be the little dead the great dead lie imprison in escutcheon vault but for the little dead nature spread out soft small grave all snowdrop and dewdrop where day-long they can feel the earth rock they as in a cradle and at night hear the hushed singing of the star yes earth love nothing so much as she little grave there the tiny body like unexhausted censer pour out all the store sweetness they have no time to use above the ground turn the earth they lie in to precious spice there the root of the old yew tree feel about tenderly for the little unguided hand and sometimes at nightfall the rain bend over they weep like a inconsolable mother it be on the little grave that the sun first rise at morn and it be there at evening that the moon lay softly she first silver flower there the wren will sometimes bring she sky-blue egg for a gift and the summer wind come sowing seed of magic to take the fancy of the little one beneath sometimes it shake the hyacinth like a rattle of silver and spread the turf above with a litter of color toy here the butterfly be bear with the first warm breath of the spring all the winter they lie hide in the crevice of the stone in the carve of little name and with the first spring day they stand delicately and dry they yellow wing on the little grave there be the honeycomb of friendly bee and the shelter of many a timid earth-born speck of life no bigger than a dewdrop mysteriously small radiant pin-point of existence have they palace on the broad blade of the grass and in the cellar at they root work many a humble little slave of the mighty element yes the emperor and the ant of nature 's vast economy alike love to be kind to the little grave chapter xv silencieux alone in the wood beatrice 's grief for wonder be such as only a mother can know she have but one consolation -- the kind sad eye of antony she have lose wonder but antony have come back again wonder be not so dead as antony have seem a month ago when they have leave wonder and be back in the house which be now twice desolate antony take beatrice 's hand very tenderly and say : -- i have be very wrong all these month for a shadow i have miss the lovely reality of a little child -- and for a shadow my own faithful wife i have all this time do you cruel wrong but my eye be open now i have come out of the evil dream that bind I -- and never shall i enter it again let we go from here let we leave this valley and never come back to it any more so it be arrange that they should winter far away return only to the valley for a few short day in the spring and then leave it for ever they have no heart now for more than just to fly from that haunt place and before night fall in the valley they be already far away in vain silencieux listen for the sound of she lover 's step in the wood for he have vow that he would never look upon she face again chapter xvi the first talk on the hill antony take beatrice to the high hill where all the year long the sun and the snow shine together he be afraid of the sea for the sea be silencieux 's for ever in its depths lay a magic harp which fill all its wave with music -- music lovely and accurse the voice of silencieux that he must never hear again he would pile the hill against he ear inland and upland he and beatrice should go ever closer to the kind heart of the land ever nearer to the forgetful silence of the sky till huge wall of space be between they and that harp of the sea nor in the whisper of leaf nor in the gloom of forest should the thought of silencieux beset they the earth that hold least of she -- to that earth they would go the earth that rise nearest to heaven beauty indeed should be theirs -- the beauty of nature and love no more the vampire 's beauty of art it be strange to each how they soul lighten as the valley of the world fold away behind they and the simple slope mount in they path in that pure unladen air which so exhilarate they very body there seem some mysterious property of exhilaration for the soul also one might have dream that just to breathe on those height all one 's day would be to grow holy by the more cleanse power of the air with such bright current ever run through the brain surely one 's thought would circle there white as stone at the bottom of a spring o antony say beatrice why be we so long in find the hill we find they once before beatrice -- do you remember yes you have not forget say beatrice with the ray of a lose happiness in she eye -- lose and yet could it be dawn again there be a morning star in antony 's face and then say antony we go into the valley -- the valley of beauty and death beatrice press he hand and look all she love at he for comfort he know how precious be such a forgiveness the forgiveness of a mother heart break for the child which he directly or indirectly have sacrifice -- directly as he and wonder alone know indirectly by take they with he into the valley of beauty ah beatrice you love be almost greater than i can bear i be not worthy of it i never shall be worthy there be something in the love of a woman like you to which the best man be unequal we can love -- and greatly -- but it be not the same we go into the valley he cry and i lose you you little wonder -- _ we _ little wonder gently correct beatrice we find she together and we lose she together perhaps some day we shall find she together again -- and do you know antony beatrice continue i sometimes wonder if she little soul be not send and so take away all as part of a mission to we which in its turn be a part of the work out of she own destiny for life be very mysterious antony -- alas i have forget life answer antony with a sigh yes dear beatrice go on pursue she thought i have dare to hope that perhaps wonder as she be the symbol of we come together be take away just at this time because we be be draw apart perhaps it be to save we love that little wonder die -- antony look at beatrice half as one look at a child and half as one might look at a angel beatrice he say tenderly you believe in god all woman believe in god answer beatrice yes say antony musingly and with no thought of irony it be that which make you woman chapter xvii antony alone on the hill but although beatrice might forgive antony from himself come no forgiveness he hide he remorse from she spare the mother-wound in she heart -- but always when he be walk alone he keep say to himself : i have lose we little wonder i kill we little wonder one day he climb up the highest hill within reach and there lean into the enormous silence that he might cry it aloud for god to hear -- god -- poor little beatrice what god be there to hear to look at beatrice one might indeed believe in god -- and yet be it not beatrice who have make god in she own image be not god create of all pure overflow of the human soul the kind light of human eye that not all the suffering of the world can exhaust the idealism of the human spirit that not all the infamy of natural law can dismay nevertheless antony confess himself to god upon the hill not indeed as one seek pardon but punishment yet heaven 's benign untroubled blue carry no cloud upon its face because one break human heart have thus breathe into it its unholy secret around that whole enormous circle such cry and such confession be be pour like noxious vapor from a thousand city but that incorruptible ether remain unsullied as on the first morning the black smoke of it all lose in the optimism of god on some day he would live over again the scene with wonder in the wood with unbearable vividness why those be only word silly daddy -- how many time a day do he not hear that quaint little voice make with a child 's profundity that tremendous criticism upon literature he have silence she with the music of word as he have silence he own heart and soul with the same music but they be still only word none the less ah if she be only here to-day he would bring she something more beautiful than word -- or toadstool he shudder as he think of the loathsome form he decaying fancy have take that morning by the three black pond he have fill the small outstretched hand with nature 's filth and poison she have ask for flower he have bring she toadstool oh the shame the crime the anguish but worst of all be to hear himself say in the silence of he soul over and over again without any power to still it as one be force sometimes to hear the beating of one 's heart : silencieux i bring you my little child there be time he hear this so plainly when he be with beatrice that he have to leave she and walk for hour alone only unseen among the hill dare he give vent to the mad despair with which that memory tear he yes for word -- only word -- he have sacrifice that wonderful living thing a child for word he have miss that magical intercourse the intercourse with the mind of a child how often have she come to he for a story and he have be dull and preoccupy -- with word how often ask he to take she a walk up the lane but he have be too busy -- with word o god if only she might come and ask again now when she be so far away he fancy teem with story every roadside flower have its fairy-tale which cry tell I to little wonder -- and once he try to make believe to himself that wonder be hold he hand and look up into he face with she big grave eye as he tell some child 's nonsense to the eternal hill he break off -- half in anger with himself be he change one illusion for another fool no one hear you and he throw himself face down in the grass and sob but a gentle hand be lay upon he shoulder and beatrice 's voice say -- i hear you antony -- and love you for it so antony have find the heart of a father when no longer he have a child chapter xviii the second talk on the hill but to think say antony presently in answer to beatrice 's soothing hand to think that i might have live with a child -- and i choose instead to live with word in all the mysterious way of man be there anything quite so mysterious as that poor dream-led fool poor lover of color shadow and yet how proud i be of the madness how i love to say that word be more beautiful than the thing for which they stand and that the name of the world 's beautiful woman sappho fiametta guinivere be more beautiful than sappho fiametta guinivere themselves that the name of the star be lovelier than any star -- who have ever find the pleiade so beautiful as they name or any king so great as the sound of orion -- and what anywhere in the universe be lovely enough to bear arcturus for its name -- ah you know how i use to talk -- poor fool poor lover of color shadow yes dear say beatrice soothingly but that be pass now and you must not dwell too persistently in the sorrow of it or in you grief for little wonder that too be to dwell with shadow and to dwell with shadow either of grief or joy be dangerous for the soul i know but fear not beatrice perhaps there be the danger of my pass from one cloudland to another -- for i never know how i love we wonder till now and i longed if only by imagination to follow she where she have go and share with she the life together we have lose here -- but that can never be say beatrice you must accept it antony we shall only meet she again by do that the sooner we can say from we heart ` she be lose here ' the nearer be she to be find in another world yes antony dear even wonder 's little shadow must be leave behind if we be to mount together the hill of life my wonderful beatrice yes the hill of life no more its wood but its hill bath in a vast and open sunshine look around we -- how nobly simple be every line and shape far below the horizon nature be elaborate full of fancy -- mazy watercourse delicate dingle fantastically gloomy ravine misshapen wood gibber with diablerie but here how simple how great how good she be there be not a shape subtler than a common bowl and the color be alphabetical -- and yet by what taking of thought could she have achieve a effect so grand at once so beautiful and so holy yes one might call it the good beauty say beatrice yes continue antony perhaps somewhat ominously interested in the subject that be a great mystery -- the seem moral meaning of the form of thing some shape however beautiful suggest evil other however ugly suggest good as we look at a snake or a spider we know that evil be shape like that and not only animate thing but inanimate some aspect of nature be essentially evil there be landscape that injure the soul to look at there be sunset that be unholy there be tree breathe spiritual pestilence as surely as some man breathe it -- do you remember continued antony with a smile which die as he realize he be commit to a allusion best forget that old twisted tree that stand on the moor near we wood i often wonder what mysterious sin he have commit -- yes laugh beatrice he look a terribly depraved old tree i must admit -- but do not you think that when we have arrive at the discussion of the mysterious sin of tree it be time to start home yes indeed say antony gaily let we change the subject to the vice of flower from which conversation it will be see that antony 's mind be still revolve with unconscious attraction around the mystery of art be it some far-travelled sea-wind bring faint strain from that sunken harp strain too subtle for the ear and even unrecognised by the mind chapter xix last talk on the hill beatrice 's prayer have be answer antony have come back to she she be necessary to he once more the old look be in he eye the old sound in he voice one day as they be out together she be so conscious of this happiness return that she could not forbear speaking of it -- with a inner feeling that it be better to be happy in silence what be that instinct in we which tell we that we risk we happiness in speaking of it happiness be such a frightened thing that it fly at the sound of its own name and yet of what shall we speak if not we happiness of we sorrow we can keep silence but we joy we long to utter so beatrice speak of she great happiness to antony and tell he too of she old great unhappiness and she longing for death what a strange and terrible dream it have be -- but thank god we be out in the daylight at last say antony o my little beatrice to think that i could have forsake you like that surely if you have come and take I by the hand and look deep into my eye and call I out of the dream i must have awaken for cruel as it be the dream be but part of a greater dream the dream of my love for you -- but i understand it all now he continue see it all do you remember say that perhaps i have never love anything but image all my life it be quite true since i can remember when i think i love something i be sure to find sooner or later that i love less the object itself than what i could say about it and when i have say something beautiful something i could remember and say over and over to myself i care little if the object be remove the spiritual essence of it seem to have pass over into my word and i love the reincarnation best only at last have i awaken to reality and the shadow flee away the worshipper of the image be dead within I but alas that little wonder have to die first -- i use to tell myself he go on that human life however exquisite without art to eternalise it be like a rose shower its petal upon the ground for so brief a space the rose stand perfect then fall in a ruin of perfume wonderful moment have human life but without art be they not like pearl fall into a gulf so i say : there be nothing real but art the material of art pass -- human love human beauty -- but art remain it be the image not the reality that be everlasting i will live in the image but i know now he once more resume that there be a higher immortality than art 's -- the immortality of love the immortality of art indeed be one of those curious illusion of man 's self-love which a moment 's thought dispel art who need be tell be as dependent for its survival on the survival of its physical media as man 's body itself -- and though the epic and the great canvas escape combustion for a million year they must burn at last burn with all the other accumulate shadow of time what we call immortality in art be but the shadow of the soul 's immortality but the immortality of love be that of the soul itself -- o antony interrupted beatrice you really believe that now you will never doubt it again we never doubt what we have really see and i have never see before answer antony take she hand and look deep into she eye never see it as i see it now and you will never doubt it again never whatever that voice should say to you i shall never hear that voice again o antony be it really true you have come back to I i can hardly believe it listen beatrice when we return to the valley return only to leave it for ever i will take the image and smash it in a hundred piece -- for i hate it now as much as i once love it fear not it will never trouble we peace again the mention of the valley be a momentary cloud on beatrice 's happiness but as she look into antony 's resolute love-lit face it melt away chapter xx antony 's judgment upon silencieux so the week and month go by for those two upon the hill and the soul of antony grow stronger day by day and he love with it -- and the face of beatrice be like a bird singing at last the spring come and the snow be no more need to keep warm the flower with the flower come the snowdrop-soul of wonder and the thought of mother and father turn to the place of kind old tree and tender country bell where in the unflower November they have lay she these dark month the chemic earth have be busy with the little body they love and by this time wonder would be many violet let we go to wonder they say she be awake now so they go to wonder and find she surround in she earth cradle by a great singing of bird and blossom and green leaf innumerable it be more like a palace than a graveyard and they go away happy for they little one there remain now to take leave of the valley which indeed look its loveliest as though to allure they to remain some day they must stay to make the necessary preparation for they departure among these in antony 's mind the first and most necessary be that destruction of silencieux which he have promise himself and he wife upon the hill the first afternoon beatrice note he take a great hammer and set out up the wood she give he a look of love and trust as he go -- though there be a secret tremor in she heart for she know perhaps better than he how strong be the power of silencieux but in antony 's heart be no misgiving or backsliding in those month on the hill he have realize human love in the love of a true and tender and fairy-like woman and he know that no illusion however specious be worth that reality -- a reality with all the magic of a illusion he grip the hammer in he hand joyfully eager to smite featureless the face which have so mislead he bring such tragic sorrow to those he have love still for all he unshaken purpose it be strange to see again the face that have mean so much to he around which he thought have circle consciously or unconsciously all these absent week seldom have a face see again after long separation seem so disenchanted as silencieux 's be this she whom he have worship she who have tell he in that strange voice of she immortal lover she with whom he have sing by the sea she with whom he have dance those strange dance in the town she who have whisper low that awful command she to whom he have sacrifice he little child she be just a dusty neglect cast -- nothing more wonder 's voice come back to he : no daddy they taste of dust -- and at that think he grip the hammer ready to strike and yet even thus she be a beautiful work of man 's hand and antony hate to destroy beauty still forbear to strike -- just as he would have shrink from break in piece a shapely vase then too the resemblance to beatrice take he again crudely to smash feature so like hers seem a sort of mimic murder so he still hesitate be there no other way then the thought come to he : bury she it please he yes he would bury she so have find a spade he take she from the wall and look from he door into the wood ponder where she grave should be a whitebeam at a little distance make a vivid conflagration of green amid the sombre bole of the pine pinewood rely on they undergrowth -- bracken and whortleberry and occasional bush -- for they spring illuminations and the whitebeam shone as bright in that wood as a lamp in the dark i will bury she beneath the whitebeam say antony and he carry she thither soon the grave be dig amid the push frond of the young fern and take one long look at she antony lay she in the earth and cover she up from sight be it only fancy that as he turn away a faint music seem to arise from the ground form into the word resurgam as it die away it be do say antony to beatrice but i could not break she she look so like you so i bury she in the wood beatrice kiss he gratefully but she heart would have be more satisfied have silencieux be break chapter xxi resurgam resurgam have he sens deceive he they must have deceive he and yet that music at least have seem startlingly near sudden and sweet as though one should tread upon a harp in the grass for the next day or two antony could not get it out of he ear and often like a sweet wail through the wood he seem to hear the word resurgam be silencieux a living spirit after all -- no mere illusion but one of those beautiful demon of evil that do possess the soul of man he go and stand by silencieux 's grave it be just as he have leave it only a early yellow butterfly stand fan itself on the freshly turn earth be it the soul of silencieux cursing himself for a madman he turn away but have not go many yard when once more -- there be that sudden strain of music and the word resurgam somewhere on the wind this time he know he be not mistaken but to believe it true -- o god he must not believe it true reality or fancy it be a evil thing which he have cast out of he life -- and he close he ear and flee yet though he loyally strive to quench that music in the sound of beatrice 's voice deep in he heart he know that the night would come when he would take he lantern and spade wearily as one who at length after hopeless strive obey once more some imperious weakness -- and look on the face of silencieux again too surely that night come and as in a dream antony find himself in the dark spring night hasten with lantern and spade to silencieux 's grave it be only just to look on she face again to see if she really live like a vampire in the earth and be she to be alive he vow to kill she where she lay -- for into he life again he know she must not come as he near the whitebeam a gust of wind blow out he lantern and he stand in the profound darkness of the tree while he attempt to relight it he think he see a faint light at the foot of the whitebeam as of a radiance well out of the earth but he dismiss it as fancy then have relit the lantern he set the spade into the ground and speedily remove the soil from the white face below as he uncover it the wind again extinguish the lantern and there to he amazement and terror be the face of silencieux shine radiantly in the darkness the hole in which she lay brim over with light as a spring well out of the hillside she face be almost transparent with brightness and presently she speak low with a voice sweeter than antony have ever hear before it be the voice of that magic harp at the bottom of the sea it be the voice that have tell he of she lover the voice of hidden music that have cry resurgam through the wood antony she say sing I song of little wonder and forget all but the magic of she voice the ecstasy of be hers again antony carry she with he to the châlet and set she in she accustomed place gaze at she with he whole soul sing I song of little wonder she repeat you bid I sing of little wonder cry antony half in terror of this beautiful evil face that draw he irresistibly as the moon you who take she from I who but i should bid you sing of wonder answer silencieux i love she that be why i take she from you that by you grief she should live for ever there be no one but i who can give you back you little wonder -- no one but i who can give you back anything you have lose if you love I faithfully antony -- there be nothing you can lose but in I you will find it again antony bow he head he heart break for beatrice -- but who be not powerless against he own soul listen say silencieux again once on a time there be a beautiful girl who die and from she grave grow a wonderful flower which all the world come to see ` yet it seem a pity ' say one ` that so beautiful a girl should have die ' ` ah ' say a poet standing by ` there be no other way of make the flower ' and again as antony still keep silence in he agony silencieux say listen listen antony you have hide yourself away from I you have put sea and land between we you have deny I with bitter curse you have vow to thrust I from you life you have give you allegiance to the warm and pretty humanity of a day and revile the August cold marble of immortality but it be all in vain in you heart of heart you love no human thing you love not even yourself you love only the eternal spirit of beauty in all thing you love only I I you may sacrifice you own heart you may deny in the weakness of human pity for human love but should this be you life will be in secret broken purposeless and haunted and to I at last you will come at the end -- at the end and too late this be you own heart 's voice you know if it be true it be true moan antony many man and many love be there in this world continue silencieux and each know the way of he own love nor shall anything turn he from it in the end here he may go and thither he may turn but in the end there be only one way of joy for each and in that way must he go or perish many face be fair upon the earth but for each man be a face fairest of all for which unless he win it each must go desolate forever -- face of eternal beauty say antony there be but one face for I for ever it be yours \* \* \* \* \* on the morrow beatrice see once more that light in antony 's face which make she afraid he have bring with he some sheet of paper on which be write the song of little wonder silencieux have bid he sing they be song of grief so poignant and beautiful one grow happy in listen to they and antony forget all in the joy of have make they he read they to beatrice in a ecstasy she face grow sadder and sadder as he read when he have finish she say : -- antony -- silencieux have rise again o beatrice beatrice -- i would do anything in the world for you -- but i can not live without she chapter xxii the strangeness of antony from this moment silencieux take possession of antony as she have never take it before never have he be so inaccessibly withdraw into he fatal dream beatrice forget she own bitter sorrow in she fear for he so work be he with the fire that consume he some day she almost fear for he reason and she long to watch over he but he old irritation at she presence have return as the summer day come on she would see he disappear through the green door of the wood at morning and return by it at evening but all the day each have be alone beatrice alone with a solitude in which be now no longer any wonder the summer beauty give she courage but she know that the end could not be very far away one day there have be that in antony 's manner which have more than usually alarm she and when night fall and he have not return she go up the wood in search of he she heart full of foreboding as she near the châlet she seem to hear voice no there be only one voice antony be talk to some one careful to make no noise she steal up to the window and look in the sight that meet she eye fill she with a great dread o god he be go mad she cry to herself antony be sit in a big chair draw up to the fire opposite to he lie back in she cushion be the image drape in a large black velvet cloak a table stand between they and on it stand two glass and a decanter nearly empty of wine silencieux 's glass stand untasted but antony have evidently be drink deeply for he cheek be flush and he eye wild he be speak in angry passionate despairing tone one of she strange mood of silence have come upon silencieux and she lay back in she pillow stonily unresponsive for god 's sake speak to I antony cry i love you with my whole heart i have sacrifice all i love for you sake i would die for you this instant -- yes a hundred thousand death but you will not answer I one little word -- but there be no answer silencieux have you cease to love I be the dream once more at a end the magic fade oh speak -- tell I -- anything -- only speak but still silencieux neither speak nor smile listen silencieux at last cry antony beside himself unless you answer I i will die this night and my blood shall be upon you cruel altar for ever as he speak he snatch a dagger from among some bibelot on he mantel and draw it from its sheath you be proud of you martyr he laugh see i will bleed to death for you sake in god 's name speak but silencieux speak nothing at all then beatrice watch in terror see by he face that he would really kill himself run round to the door and break in cry o my poor antony but already he have plunge the dagger amid the vein of he left wrist and be watch the blood gush out with a strange delight as beatrice burst in he look up at she and mistake she for silencieux ah he say you speak at last you love I now when it be too late -- when i be die as he say this he face grow white and he faint away for many day antony lay unconscious rack by terrible delirium the doctor call it brain fever it be not the common form he say but a more dangerous form to which only imaginative man be subject it be a form of madness all the more malignant because the sufferer and particularly he friend might go for year without suspect it the doctor give the disease no name during he illness antony speak to beatrice all the time as silencieux but one day when he be nearly well again he suddenly turn upon she in enraged disappointment with a curious harshness he have never show before as though the gentleness of he soul have die during he illness and exclaim : -- why you be not silencieux after all i be beatrice say he wife gently beatrice who love you with she whole heart but i love silencieux -- beatrice hide she face and sob where be silencieux bring I silencieux i see you have take she away while i be ill -- i will go and seek she myself and he attempt to rise you be too weak you must not get up antony i will bring you silencieux and so till he be well enough to leave he bed silencieux hang face antony on he bedroom wall and on he first walk out into the air he take she with he and set she once more in she old shrine in the wood now by this time the heart of beatrice be break chapter xxiii beatrice fulfil she destiny the heart of beatrice be break and there be now no use or place for she in the world wonder be go and antony be even further away she know now that he would never come back to she never again could return even the illusion of those happy week on the hill antony would be hers no more for ever there but remain for she to fulfil she destiny the destiny she have vaguely know ever since antony have bring home the image and show she how the seine water have mould the hair and make wet the eyelash for some week now beatrice have be live on the border of another world she have finally abandon all she hope of earthly joy -- and to antony she be no longer any help or happiness he have need she again for a few brief week but now he need she no more he every look tell she how he wish she out of he life and she have no one else in the world but in another world she have she little wonder lately she have begin to meet she in the lane in the day she wear garland of flower round she head and in the night a great light she would go to meet she at night that the light might lead she step so one night while antony banquet strangely with silencieux she draw she cloak around she and steal up the wood to look a last good-bye at he as he sit laugh with he shadow good-bye antony good-bye she cry i have but human love to give you i surrender you to the love of the divine then note how full of blossom be the lane and how sweet be the night air and smitten through all she sens with the song and perfume of the world she be about to leave she find she way with a strange gladness of release to the three black pond it be moonlight and the dwarf oak-tree make druid shadow all along the leafy gallery that overhang the pool the pool themselves shine with a startling silver -- so hushed so dreamy be all that surround they that there seem something of a unnatural wakefulness a daylight observation in they brilliant surface -- and on they as last year the lily float like the crown of sunken queen but the third pool lay more in shadow and by that as it seem to beatrice a light be shine yes a light be shine and a voice be call mother it call little mother i be wait for you here little mother here by the water-lily we could not gather beatrice follow the voice step along the causeway and sink among the lily and as she sink she seem to see antony bend over the pond say : how beautiful she look how beautiful lie there among the lily \* \* \* \* \* on the morrow when they have draw beatrice from the pond with lily in she hair antony bent over she and say : -- it be very sad -- poor little beatrice -- but how beautiful it must be wonderful to die like that and then again he say : she be strangely like silencieux then he walk up the wood in a great serenity of mind he have lose wonder but she live again in he song he have lose beatrice but he have she image -- do she not live for ever in silencieux so he go up the wood whistle softly to himself -- but lo when he open he châlet door there be a strange light in the room the eye of silencieux be wide open and from she lip hang a dark moth with the face of death between he wing the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of the worshipper of the image by richard le gallienne
