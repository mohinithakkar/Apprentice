dear sir percy as i know no man who surpass yourself either in combine a love of the most romantic fiction with the coolest good sense or in pass from the driest metaphysical question to the heartiest enjoyment of humor -- i trust that even a modesty so true as yours will not grudge I the satisfaction of inscribe these volume with you name that you should possess such variety of taste be no wonder consider what a abundance of intellectual honor you inherit nor might the world have be the better for it have they be taste and nothing more but that you should inherit also that zeal for justice to mankind which have become so christian a feature in the character of the age and that you should include in that zeal a special regard for the welfare of you father 's friend be subject of constant pleasurable reflection to you obliged and affectionate leigh hunt preface the purpose of these volume be to add to the stock of tale from the italian writer to retain as much of the poetry of the original as it be in the power of the writer 's prose to compass and to furnish careful biographical notice of the author there have be several collection of story from the novellist of italy but none from the poet and it strike I that prose version from these of the kind here offer to the public might not be unwillingly receive the story be select from the five principal narrative poet dante pulci boiardo ariosto and tasso they comprise the most popular of such as be fit for translation be reduce into one continuous narrative when diffuse and interrupt as in the instance of those of angelica and armida be accompany with critical and explanatory note and in the case of dante consist of a abstract of the poet 's whole work the volume be furthermore intersperse with the most favorite _ morceaux _ of the original follow sometimes with attempt to versify they and in the appendix for the furtherance of the study of the italian language be give entire story also in the original and occasionally render in like manner the book be particularly intend for such student or other lover of the language as be pleased with any fresh endeavor to recommend it and at the same time for such purely english reader as wish to know something about italian poetry without have leisure to cultivate its acquaintance i do not intend in the first instance to depart from the plan of selection in the case of dante but when i consider what a extraordinary person he be -- how intense be every thing which he say -- how widely he have re-attract of late the attention of the world -- how willingly perhaps he poem might be regard by the reader as be itself one continue story -lrb- which in fact it be -rrb- related personally of the writer -- and lastly what a combination of difficulty have prevent he best translator in verse from give the public a just idea of he almost scriptural simplicity -- i begin to think that a abstract of he entire work might possibly be look upon as supply something of a desideratum i be aware that nothing but verse can do perfect justice to verse but besides the imperfection which be pardonable because inevitable in all such metrical endeavor the desire to impress a grand and worshipful idea of dante have be too apt to lead he translator into a tone and manner the reverse of he passionate practical and creative style -- a style which may be say to write thing instead of word and thus to render every word that be put out of its place or bring in for help and fill up a misrepresentation i do not mean to say that he himself never do any thing of the sort or do not occasionally assume too much of the oracle and the schoolmaster in manner as well as matter but passion and the absence of the superfluous be the chief characteristic of he poetry fortunately this sincerity of purpose and utterance in dante render he the least pervertible of poet in a sincere prose translation and since i ventured on attempt one i have have the pleasure of meeting with a express recommendation of such a version in a early number of the _ edinburgh review _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- the abstract of dante therefore in these volume -lrb- with every deprecation that become I of be suppose to pretend to give a thorough idea of any poetry whatsoever especially without its metrical form -rrb- aspire to be regard as at all event not exhibit a false idea of the dantesque spirit in point of feeling and expression it be true i have omit long tedious lecture of scholastic divinity and other learn absurdity of the time which be among the bar to the poem 's be read through even in italy -lrb- which foscolo tell we be never the case -rrb- and i have compress the work in other passage not essentially necessary to the formation of a just idea of the author but quite enough remain to suggest it to the intelligent and in no instance have i make addition or alteration there be warrant -- i hope i may say letter -- for every thing put down dante be the greatest poet for intensity that ever live and he excite a corresponding emotion in he reader -- i wish i could say always on the poet 's side but he ferocious hate and bigotry too often tempt we to hate the bigot and always compel we to take part with the fellow-creature whom he outrage at least such be they effect on myself nor will he or he worshipper suffer we to criticise he fault with mere reference to the age in which he live i should have be glad to do so but the claim make for he even by himself will not allow it we be call upon to look on he as a divine a prophet a oracle in all respects for all time such a man however be the last whom a reporter be incline to misrepresent we respect he sincerity too much ferocious and arrogant though it be and we like to give he the full benefit of the recoil of he curse and malediction i hope i have not omit one on the other hand as little have i close my feeling against the lovely and enchanting sweetness which this great semi-barbarian sometimes so affectingly utter on those occasion he be like a angel enclose for penance in some furious giant and permit to weep through the creature 's eye the story from goodnatured pulcus i have be oblige to compress for other reason -- chiefly they excessive diffuseness a paragraph of the version will sometimes comprise many page those of boiardo and ariosto be more exact and the reader will be good enough to bear in mind that nothing be add to any of the poet different as the case might seem here and there on comparison with the original a equivalent for whatever be say be to be find in some part of the context -- generally in letter always in spirit the least characteristically exact passage be some in the love-scene of tasso for i have omit the play upon word and other corruption in style in which that poet permit himself to indulge but i have notice the circumstance in the comment in other respects i have endeavor to make my version convey some idea of the different style and genius of the writer -- of the severe passion of dante of the overflow gaiety and affect sympathy of pulcus several of whose passage in the battle of roncesvalle be masterpiece of pathos of the romantic and inventive elegance of boiardo the great cheerful universality of ariosto like a healthy _ anima mundus _ and the ambitious irritability the fairy imagination and tender but somewhat effeminate voluptuousness of the poet of armida and rinaldo i do not pretend that prose version of passage from these writer can supersede the necessity of metrical one suppose proper metrical one attainable they suffice for they in some respects less than for dante the manner in they case be of more importance to the effect but with all due respect to such translator as harrington rise and wiffen they book be not ariosto and tasso even in manner harrington the gay godson of queen elizabeth be not always unlike ariosto but when not in good spirit he become as dull as if she majesty have frown on he rise be a man of wit and a scholar yet he have undoubtedly turn the ease and animation of he original into inversion and insipidity and wiffen though elegant and even poetical do a unfortunate thing for tasso when he give a additional line and a number of paraphrastic thought to a stanza already tend to the superfluous fairfax himself who upon the whole and with regard to a work of any length be the best metrical translator we language have see and like chapman a genuine poet strangely aggravate the sin of prettiness and conceit in he original and add to they a love of tautology amounting to that of a lawyer as to hoole he be below criticism and other version i have not happen to see now if i have no acquaintance with the italian language i confess i would rather get any friend who have to read to I a passage out of dante tasso or ariosto into the first simple prose that offer itself than go to any of the above translator for a taste of it fairfax except and we have see with how much allowance he sample would have to be take i have therefore with some restriction only venture to do for the public what i would have have a friend do for myself the _ critical and biographical notice _ i do not intend to make so long at first but the interest grow upon I and i hope the reader will regard some of they -- dante 's and tasso be in particular -- as be story themselves after they kind -- story alas too true romance of real life the extraordinary character of dante which be personally mix up with he writings beyond that of any other poet have lead I into reference to he church and creed unavoidable at any time in the endeavor to give a thorough estimate of he genius and singularly demand by certain phenomenon of the present day i hold those phenomenon to be alike feeble and fugitive but only so by reason of they be openly so proclaimed for mankind have a tendency to the absurd if they imagination be not properly direct and one of the use of poetry be to keep the faculty in a healthy state and cause it to know its duty dante in the fierce egotism of he passion and the strange identification of he knowledge with all that be knowable would fain have make he poetry both a sword against individual and a prop for the support of the superstition that corrupt they this be reverse the duty of a christian and a great man and there happen to be exist reason why it be salutary to chew that he have no right to do so and must not have he barbarism confound with he strength machiavellus be of opinion that if christianity have not revert to its first principle by means of the poverty and pious life of st franci and st dominic -lrb- 2 -rrb- the faith would have be lose it may have be but such be not the secret of its preservation in time of science and progression when the spirit of inquiry have establish itself among all class and nothing be take for grant as it use to be a few person here and there who confound a small superstitious reaction in england with the reverse of the fact all over the rest of europe may persuade themselves if they please that the world have not advance in knowledge for the last three century and so get up and cry aloud to we out of obsolete horn-book but the community laugh at they every body else be inquire into first principle while they be dogmatise on a forty-ninth proposition the irish themselves as they ought to do care more for they pastor than for the pope and if any body wish to know what be think of he holiness at head-quarter let he consult the remarkable and admirable pamphlet which have lately issue from the pen of mr mazzinus -lrb- 3 -rrb- i have the pleasure of know excellent roman catholic i have suffer in behalf of they emancipation and would do so again to-morrow but i believe that if even they external form of christianity have any chance of survival three hundred year hence it will have be owe to the appearance meanwhile of some extraordinary man in power who in the tooth of worldly interest or rather in charitable and sage inclusion of they shall have proclaim that the time have arrive for live in the flower of christian charity instead of the husk and thorn which may have be necessary to guard it if it be possible for some new and wonderful pope to make this change and draw a line between these two christian epoch like that between the old and new testament the world would feel inclined to prostrate itself again and for ever at the foot of rome in a catholic state of thing like that delighted should i be for one to be among the humblest of its communicant how beautiful would they organ be then how ascend to a unperplexing heaven they incense how unselfish they salvation how intelligible they talk about justice and love it would be far more easy however for the church of england to do this than the church of rome since the former would not feel itself hamper with pretension to infallibility a church once reform may reform itself again and again till it remove every blemish in the way of its perfection and god grant this may be the lot of the church of my native country its beautiful old ivied place of worship would then want no harmony of accordance with its gentle and tranquil scenery no completeness of attraction to the reflect and the kind but if charity -lrb- and by charity i do not mean mere toleration or any other pretended right to permit other to have eye like ourselves but whatever the delightful greek word imply of good and lovely -rrb- if this truly and only divine consummation of all christian doctrine be not think capable of take a form of belief strong enough apart from threat that revolt alike the heart and the understanding superstition must look out for some new mode of dictation altogether for the world be outgrow the old \* \* \* \* \* i can not in gratitude for the facility afford to myself as well as for a more obvious and public reason dismiss this preface without congratulating man of letter on the establishment and increase prosperity of the _ london library _ a institution found for the purpose of accommodate subscriber with such book at they own house as could only be consult hitherto at the british museum the sole objection to the museum be thus do away and the literary world have a fair prospect of possess two book-institution instead of one each with its distinct claim to regard and present in combination all that the student can wish for while it be highly desirable that author should be able to have standard work at they command when sickness or other circumstance render it impossible for they to go to the museum it be undoubtedly requisite that one great collection should exist in which they be sure to find the same work unremoved in case of necessity -- not to mention curious volume of all sort manuscript and a world of book of reference -lrb- footnote 1 : it be probable that a prose translation would give a better

power to lead and enlighten the world and he live in a semi-barbarous age as favourable to the intensity of he imagination as it be otherwise to the rest of he pretension party zeal and the fluctuation of moral and critical opinion have at different period over-rated and depreciate he memory and if in the follow attempt to form its just estimate i have find myself compel in some important respects to differ with precede writer and to protest in particular against he be regard as a proper teacher on any one point poetry except and as far as all such genius and energy can not in some degree help be i have not be the less sensible of the wonderful nature of that genius while act within the circle to which it belong dante be indeed so great a poet and at the same time exhibit in he personal character such a mortifying exception to what we conceive to be the natural wisdom and temper of great poet in other word he be such a bigoted and exasperated man and sully he imagination with so much that be contradictory to good feeling in matter divine as well as human that i should not have think myself justified in assist however humbly to extend the influence of he writings have i not believe a time to have arrive when the community may profit both from the marvel of he power and the melancholy absurdity of its contradiction dante alighierus who have always be know by he christian rather than surname -lrb- partly owe to the italian predilection for christian name and partly to the unsettled state of patronymic in he time -rrb- be the son of a lawyer of good family in florence and be bear in that city on the 14th of may 1265 -lrb- sixty-three year before the birth of chaucer -rrb- the stock be say to have be of roman origin of the race of the frangipanus but the only certain trace of it be to cacciaguida a florentine cavalier of the house of the eliseus who die in the crusade dante give a account of he in he _ paradiso _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- cacciaguida marry a lady of the alighierus family of the valdipado and give the name to one of he child they subsequently retain it as a patronymic in preference to they own it would appear from the same poem not only that the alighierus be the more important house but that some blot have darken the scutcheon of the eliseus perhaps they have be poor and transplant -lrb- as he seem to imply -rrb- from some disreputable district perhaps they be know to have be of ignoble origin for in the course of one of he most philosophical treatise he burst into a extraordinary ebullition of ferocity against such as adduce a knowledge of that kind as a argument against a family 's acquire nobility affirm that such brutal stuff should be answer not with word but with the dagger -lrb- 3 -rrb- the elisei however must have be of some standing for macchiavellus in he history of florence mention they in he list of the early guelph and ghibelline party where the side which they take be different from that of the poet 's immediate progenitor -lrb- 4 -rrb- the arm of the alighierus -lrb- probably occasion by the change in that name for it be previously write aldighierus -rrb- be interesting on account of they poetical and aspiring character they be a golden wing on a field azure -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be generally suppose that the name dante be a abbreviation of durante but this be not certain though the poet have a nephew so call dante be the name he go by in the gravest record in law-proceedings in he epitaph in the mention of he put by himself into the mouth of a bless spirit boccaccio intimate that he be christen dante and derive the name from the ablative case of _ dan _ -lrb- give -rrb- -- a probable etymology especially for a christian appellation as a abbreviation of durante it would correspond in familiarity with the ben of ben jonson -- a diminutive that would assuredly not have be use by grave people on occasion like those mention though a wit of the day give the mason a shilling to carve o rare ben jonson on he grave stone on the other hand if give at the font the name of ben would have acquire all the legal gravity of benjamin in the english navy list not long ago one of we gallant admiral use to figure as billy dougla of the mother of dante nothing be know except that she be he father 's second wife and that she christian name be bellum or perhaps surname bello it might however be conjecture from the remarkable and only opportunity which we author have take of allude to she that he derive he disdainful character rather from he mother than father -lrb- 6 -rrb- the father appear to have die during the boyhood of he illustrious son the future poet before he have complete he ninth year conceive a romantic attachment to a little lady who have just enter hers and who have attain a celebrity of which she be destine to know nothing this be the famous beatrice portinarus daughter of a rich florentine who found more than one charitable institution she marry another man and die in she youth but retain the platonical homage of she young admirer living and dead and become the heroine of he great poem it be unpleasant to reduce any portion of a romance to the event of ordinary life but with the exception of those who merely copy from one another there have be such a conspiracy on the part of dante 's biographer to overlook at least one disenchant conclusion to be draw to that effect from the poet 's own writings that the probable truth of the matter must here for the first time be state the case indeed be clear enough from he account of it the natural tendency of a poetical temperament -lrb- oftener evince in a like manner than the world in general suppose -rrb- not only make the boy-poet fall in love but in the truly elysian state of the heart at that innocent and adoring time of life make he fancy he have discover a goddess in the object of he love and strength of purpose as well as imagination make he grow up in the fancy he disclose himself as time advance only by he manner -- receive complacent recognition in company from the young lady -- offend she by seem to devote himself to another -lrb- see the poem in the _ vita nuova _ begin ballata io vo -rrb- -- render himself the sport of she and she young friend by he adoring timidity -lrb- see the 5th and 6th sonnet in the same work -rrb- -- in short constitute she a paragon of perfection and enable she by so do to shew that she be none he say that find himself unexpectedly near she one day in company he tremble so and undergo such change of countenance that many of the lady present begin to laugh with she about he -- _ si gabbavano di I _ and he add in verse con l'altre donne mium vista gabbate e non pensate donna onde si mova ch ` io vi rassembri sì figura nova quando riguardo la vostra beltate & c son 5 you laugh with the other lady to see how i look -lrb- literally you mock my appearance -rrb- and do not think lady what it be that render I so strange a figure at sight of you beauty and in the sonnet that follow he accuse she of prevent pity of he in other by such killing mockery as make he wish for death -lrb- _ la pietà che ' l vostro gabbo recinde _ & c -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- now it be to be admit that a young lady if she be not very wise may laugh at she lover with she companion and yet return he love after she fashion but the fair portinarus laugh and marry another some less melancholy face some more intelligible courtship triumph over the questionable flattery of the poet 's gratuitous worship and the idol of dante alighierus become the wife of messer simone de ' bardi not a word do he say on that mortifying point it transpire from a clause in she father 's will and yet so bent be the poet 's biographer on leave a romantic doubt in one 's mind whether beatrice may not have return he passion that not only do all of they -lrb- as far as i have observe -rrb- agree in take no notice of these sonnet but the author of the treatise entitle _ dante and the catholic philosophy of the thirteenth century _ in spite -lrb- as a critic say -rrb- of the _ beatrice he daughter wife of messer simone de ' bardi _ of the paternal will describe she as die in all the lustre of virginity -lrb- 8 -rrb- the assumption appear to be thus gloriously state as a counterpart to the notoriety of its untruth it must be acknowledge that dante himself give the cue to it by more than silence for he not only vaunt she acquaintance in the next world but assume that she return he love in that region as if no such person as she husband could have exist or as if he himself have not be marry also this life-long pertinacity of will be illustrative of he whole career meantime though the young poet 's father have die nothing be want on the part of he guardian or perhaps he mother to furnish he with a excellent education it be so complete as to enable he to become master of all the knowledge of he time and he add to this learn more than a taste for draw and music he speak of himself as draw a angel in he tablet on the first anniversary of beatrice 's death -lrb- 9 -rrb- one of he instructor be brunetto latinus the most famous scholar then live and he study both at the university of padua and bologna at eighteen perhaps sooner he have show such a genius for poetry as to attract the friendship of guido cavalcante a young noble of a philosophical as well as poetical turn of mind who have retain a reputation with posterity : and it be probably at the same time he become acquaint with giotto who draw he likeness and with casellum the musician whom he greet with so much tenderness in the other world nor be he duty as a citizen forget the year before beatrice 's death he be at the battle of campaldino which he countryman gain against the people of arezzo and the year after it he be present at the taking of caprona from the pisan it have be suppose that he once study medicine with a view to it as a profession but the conjecture probably originate in nothing more than he have enter himself of one of the city-company -lrb- which happen to be the medical -rrb- for the purpose of qualify himself to accept office a condition exact of the gentry by the then democratic tendency of the republic it be assert also by a early commentator that he enter the franciscan order of friar but quit it before he be profess and indeed the circumstance be not unlikely consider he agitate and impatient turn of mind perhaps he fancy that he have do with the world when it lose the wife of simone de ' bardi wedding that might have take place but do not be like the reign of deceased heirs-apparent every thing be assumable in they favor check only by the history of husband and king would the great but splenetic poet have make a angel and a saint of beatrice have he marry she he never utter the name of the woman whom he do marry gemma donatus be a kinswoman of the powerful family of that name it seem not improbable from some passage in he work that she be the young lady whom he speak of as take pity on he on account of he passion for beatrice -lrb- 10 -rrb- and in common justice to he feeling as a man and a gentleman it be surely to be conclude that he feel some sort of passion for he bride if not of a very spiritual sort though he afterwards do not scruple to intimate that he be ashamed of it and beatrice be make to rebuke he in the other world for thinking of any body after herself -lrb- 11 -rrb- at any rate he probably rouse what be excitable in he wife 's temper with provocation from he own for the nature of the latter be not to be doubt whereas there be nothing but tradition to shew for the bitterness of hers foscolo be of opinion that the tradition itself arise simply from a rhetorical flourish of boccaccio 's in he life of dante against the marriage of man of letter though boccaccio himself expressly add that he know nothing to the disadvantage of the poet 's wife except that she husband after quit florence would never either come where she be or suffer she to come to he mother as she be by he of so many child -- a statement it must be confess not a little encouraging to the tradition -lrb- 12 -rrb- be this as it may dante marry in he twenty-sixth year write a adoring account of he first love -lrb- the _ vita nuova _ -rrb- in he twenty-eighth and among the six child which gemma bring he have a daughter whom he name beatrice in honor it be understand of the fair portinarus which surely be either a very great compliment or no mean trial to the temper of the mother we shall see presently how they domestic intercourse be interrupted and what absolute uncertainty there be respect it except as far as conclusion may be draw from he own temper and history italy in those day be divide into the party of guelph and ghibelline the former the advocate of general church-ascendancy and local government the latter of the pretension of the emperor of germany who claim to be the roman cæsar and paramount over the pope in florence the guelph have for a long time be so triumphant as to keep the ghibelline in a state of banishment dante be bear and breed a guelph : he have twice bear arm for he country against ghibelline neighbor and now at the age of thirty-five in the ninth of he marriage and last of he residence with he wife he be appoint chief of the temporary administrator of affair call prior -- functionary who hold office only for two month unfortunately at that moment he party have become subdivide into the faction of the whites and black or adherent of two different side in a dispute that take place in pistoium the consequence become serious the black propose to bring in as mediator the french prince charle of valoi then in arm for the pope against the emperor but the whites of whom dante be one be hostile to the measure and in order to prevent it he and he brother magistrate expel for a time the head of both faction to the satisfaction of neither the whites accuse they of secretly lean to the ghibelline and the black of openly favor the whites who be indeed allow to come back before they time on the alleged ground of the unwholesomeness of they place of exile which be fatal to dante 's friend cavalcante give a color to the charge dante answer it by say that he have then quit office but he could not shew that he have lose he influence meantime charle be still urge to interfere and dante be send ambassador to the pope to obtain he disapprobation of the interference but the pope -lrb- boniface the eighth -rrb- who have probably discover that the whites have cease to care for any thing but they own dispute and who at all event do not like they objection to he representative beguile the ambassador and encourage the french prince the black in consequence regain they ascendancy and the luckless poet during he absence be denounce as a corrupt administrator of affair guilty of peculation be severely mulcted banish from tuscany for two year and subsequently for contumaciousness be sentence to be _ burnt alive _ in case he return ever he never do return from that day forth dante never behold again he home or he wife she relation obtain possession of power but no use be make of it except to keep he in exile he have not accord with they and perhaps half the secret of he conjugal discomfort be owe to politics it be the opinion of some that the married couple be not sorry to part other think that the wife remain behind solely to scrape together what property she could and bring up the child all that be know be that she never live with he more dante now certainly do what he enemy have accuse he of wish to do : he join the old exile whom he have help to make such the party of the ghibelline he allege that he never be really of any party but he own a naïve confession probably true in one sense consider he scorn of other people he great intellectual superiority and the large view he have for the whole italian people and indeed he soon quarrel in private with the individual compose he new party however stanch he apparently remain to they cause he former associate he have learn to hate for they difference with he and for they self-seeking he hate the pope for deceive he he hate the pope 's french ally for be he ally and interfere with florence and he have come to love the emperor for be hate by they all and for hold out -lrb- as he fancy -rrb- the only chance of reunite italy to they confusion and make she the restorer of himself and the mistress of the world with these feeling in he heart no money in he purse and no place in which to lay he head except such as chance-patron afford he he now begin to wander over italy like some lonely lion of a man grudging in he great disdain at one moment he be conspire and hope at another despair and endeavor to conciliate he beautiful florence : now again catch hope from some new movement of the emperor 's and then not very handsomely threatening and re-abusing she but always ponder and grieve or try to appease he thought with some composition chiefly of he great work it be conjecture that whenever anything particularly affect he whether with joy or sorrow he put it hot with the impression into he sacred poem every body who jar against he sense of right or he prejudice he send to the infernal region friend or foe : the strangest people who side with they -lrb- but certainly no personal foe -rrb- he exalt to heaven he encourage if not personally assist two ineffectual attempt of the ghibelline against florence write besides he great work a book of mixed prose and poetry on love and virtue -lrb- the _ convito _ or banquet -rrb- a latin treatise on monarchy -lrb- _ de monarchia _ -rrb- recommend the divine right of the emperor another in two part and in the same language on the vernacular tongue -lrb- _ de vulgari eloquio _ -rrb- and learn to know meanwhile as he affectingly tell we how hard it be to climb other people 's stair and how salt the taste of bread be that be not we own it be even think not improbable from one awful passage of he poem that he may have place himself in some public way and strip he visage of all shame and tremble in he very vitals have stretch out he hand for charity -lrb- 13 -rrb- -- a image of suffering which proud as he be yet consider how great a man be almost enough to make one 's common nature stoop down for pardon at he foot and yet he should first prostrate himself at the foot of that nature for he outrage on god and man several of the prince and feudal chieftain of italy entertain the poet for a while in they house but genius and worldly power unless for worldly purpose find it difficult to accord especially in temper like he there must be great wisdom and amiableness on both side to save they from jealousy of one another 's pretension dante be not the man to give and take in such matter on equal term and hence he be at one time in a palace and at another in a solitude now he be in sienna now in arezzo now in bologna then probably in verona with can grande 's elder brother then -lrb- if we be to believe those who have track he step -rrb- in casentino then with the marchese moroello malaspina in lunigiana then with the great ghibelline chieftain faggiuolum in the mountain near urbino then in romagna in padua in _ pari _ -lrb- argue with the churchman -rrb- some say in germany and at _ oxford _ then again in italy in lucca -lrb- where he be suppose to have relapse from he fidelity to beatrice in favor of a certain gentucca -rrb- then again in verona with the new prince the famous can grande -lrb- where he sarcasm appear to have lose he a doubtful hospitality -rrb- then in a monastery in the mountain of umbrium in udine in ravenna and there at length he put up for the rest of he life with he last and best friend guido novello da polenta not the father but the nephew of the hapless francesca it be probably in the middle period of he exile that in one of the moment of he greatest longing for he native country he write that affect passage in the _ convito _ which be evidently a direct effort at conciliation excuse himself for some harshness and obscurity in the style of that work he exclaim ah would it have please the dispenser of all thing that this excuse have never be need that neither other have do I wrong nor myself undergo penalty undeservedly -- the penalty i say of exile and of poverty for it please the citizen of the fairest and most renowned daughter of rome -- florence -- to cast I out of she most sweet bosom where i be bear and breed and pass half of the life of man and in which with she good leave i still desire with all my heart to repose my weary spirit and finish the day allot I and so i have wander in almost every place to which we language extend a stranger almost a beggar expose against my will the wound give I by fortune too often unjustly imputed to the sufferer 's fault truly i have be a vessel without sail and without rudder drive about upon different port and shore by the dry wind that spring out of dolorous poverty and hence have i appear vile in the eye of many who perhaps by some better report have conceive of I a different impression and in whose sight not only have my person become thus debased but a unworthy opinion create of every thing which i do or which i have to do -lrb- 14 -rrb- how simply and strongly write how full of the touch yet undegrading commiseration which adversity have a right to take upon itself when accompany with the consciousness of manly endeavor and a good motive how could such a man condescend at other time to rage with abuse and to delight himself in image of infernal torment the date of these fluctuation of feeling towards he native city be not know but it be suppose to have be not very long before he abode with can grande that he receive permission to return to florence on condition which he justly refuse and resent in the follow noble letter to a kinsman the old spelling of the original -lrb- in the note -rrb- be retain as give by foscolo in the article on dante in the _ edinburgh review _ -lrb- vol xxx no 60 -rrb- and i have retain also with little difference the translation which accompany it : from you letter which i receive with due respect and affection i observe how much you have at heart my restoration to my country i be bind to you the more gratefully inasmuch as a exile rarely find a friend but after mature consideration i must by my answer disappoint the wish of some little mind and i confide in the judgment to which you impartiality and prudence will lead you you nephew and mine have write to I what indeed have be mention by many other friend that by a decree concern the exile i be allow to return to florence provide i pay a certain sum of money and submit to the humiliation of ask and receive absolution : wherein my father i see two proposition that be ridiculous and impertinent i speak of the impertinence of those who mention such condition to I for in you letter dictate by judgment and discretion there be no such thing be such a invitation then to return to he country glorious to d all -lrb- dante allighierus -rrb- after suffer in exile almost fifteen year be it thus they would recompense innocence which all the world know and the labor and fatigue of unremitting study far from the man who be familiar with philosophy be the senseless baseness of a heart of earth that could act like a little sciolist and imitate the infamy of some other by offer himself up as it be in chain : far from the man who cry aloud for justice this compromise by he money with he persecutor no my father this be not the way that shall lead I back to my country i will return with hasty step if you or any other can open to I a way that shall not derogate from the fame and honor of d -lrb- dante -rrb- but if by no such way florence can be enter then florence i shall never enter what shall i not everywhere enjoy the light of the sun and star and may i not seek and contemplate in every corner of the earth under the canopy of heaven consoling and delightful truth without first render myself inglorious nay infamous to the people and republic of florence bread i hope will not fail I -lrb- 15 -rrb- have dante 's pride and indignation always vent themselves in this truly exalted manner never could the admirer of he genius have refuse he they sympathy and never i conceive need he either have bring he exile upon he or close it as he do to that close we have now come and it be truly melancholy and mortifying failure in a negotiation with the venetian for he patron guido novello be suppose to have be the last bitter drop which make the cup of he endurance run over he return from venice to ravenna wear out and there die after fifteen year ' absence from he country in the year 1231 aged fifty-seven he life have be so agitate that it probably would not have last so long but for the solace of he poetry and the glory which he know it must produce he guido give he a sumptuous funeral and intend to give he a monument but such be the state of italy in those time that he himself die in exile the year after the monument however and one of a noble sort be subsequently bestow by the father of cardinal bembo in 1483 and another still nobler as late as 1780 by cardinal gonzaga he countryman in after year make two solemn application for the removal of he dust to florence but the just pride of the ravennese refuse they of the exile 's family three son die young the daughter go into a nunnery and the two remain brother who ultimately join they father in he banishment become respectable man of letter and leave family in ravenna where the race though extinct in the male line still survive through a daughter in the noble house of serego alighierus no direct descent of the other kind from poet of former time be i believe know to exist the manners and general appearance of dante have be minutely record and be in striking agreement with he character boccaccio and other novelist be the chief relater and they account will be receive accordingly with the greater or less trust as the reader consider they probable but the author of the decameron personally know some of he friend and relation and he intermingle he least favourable report with expression of undoubted reverence the poet be of middle height of slow and serious deportment have a long dark visage large pierce eye large jaw a aquiline nose a project under-lip and thick curl hair -- a aspect announce determination and melancholy there be a sketch of he countenance in he younger day from the immature but sweet pencil of giotto and it be a refreshment to look at it though pride and discontent i think be discernible in its lineament it be idle and no true compliment to he nature to pretend as he mere worshipper do that he face owe all its subsequent gloom and exacerbation to external cause and that he be in every respect the poor victim of event -- the infant change at nurse by the wicked what come out of he he must have have in he at least in the germ and so inconsistent be he nature altogether or at any rate such a epitome of all the graver passion that be capable of co-exist both sweet and bitter thoughtful and outrageous that one be sometimes tempt to think he must have have a angel for one parent and -- i shall leave he own toleration to say what -- for the other to continue the account of he manners and inclination : he dress with a become gravity be temperate in he diet a great student seldom speak unless speak to but always to the purpose and almost all the anecdote record of he except by himself be full of pride and sarcasm he be so swarthy that a woman as he be go by a door in verona be say to have pointed he out to another with a remark which make the saturnine poet smile -- that be the man who go to hell whenever he please and bring back news of the people there on which she companion observe -- very likely do not you see what a curly beard he have and what a dark face owing i dare say to the heat and smoke he be evidently a passionate lover of painting and music -- be think to have be less strict in he conduct with regard to the sex than might be suppose from he platonical aspiration -- -lrb- boccaccio say that even a goitre do not repel he from the pretty face of a mountaineer -rrb- -- could be very social when he be young as may be gather from the sonnet address to he friend cavalcante about a party for a boat -- and though he poetry be so intense and weighty the laudable minuteness of a biographer have inform we that he hand-writing besides be neat and precise be of a long and particularly thin character : meager be he word there be a letter say to be nearly coeval with he time and to be write by the prior of a monastery to a celebrated ghibelline leader a friend of dante 's which though hitherto account apocryphal by most have such a air of truth and contain a image of the poet in he exile so exceedingly like what we conceive of the man that it be difficult not to believe it genuine especially as the handwriting have lately be discover to be that of boccaccio -lrb- 16 -rrb- at all event i be sure the reader will not be sorry to have the substance of it the writer say that he perceive one day a man come into the monastery whom none of its inmate know he ask he what he want but the stranger say nothing and continue to gaze on the building as though contemplate its architecture the question be put a second time upon which look round on he interrogator he answer _ peace _ the prior whose curiosity be strongly excited take the stranger apart and discover who he be shewed he all the attention become he fame and then dante take a little book out of he bosom aid observe that perhaps the prior have not see it express a wish to leave it with he new friend as a memorial it be a portion he say of he work the prior receive the volume with respect and politely open it at once and fix he eye on the contents in order it would seem to shew the interest he take in it appear suddenly to check some observation which they suggest dante find that he reader be surprise at see the work write in the vulgar tongue instead of latin he explain that he wish to address himself to reader of all class and conclude with request the prior to add some note with the spirit of which he furnish he and then forward it -lrb- transcribe i presume by the monk -rrb- to they common friend the ghibelline chieftain -- a commission which know the prior 's intimacy with that personage appear to have be the main object of he come to the place -lrb- 17 -rrb- this letter have be adduce as a evidence of dante 's poem have transpire during he lifetime : a thing which in the tooth of boccaccio 's statement to that effect and indeed the poet 's own testimony -lrb- 18 -rrb- foscolo hold to be so impossible that he turn the evidence against the letter he think that if such bitter invective have be circulate a hundred dagger would have be sheathe in the bosom of the exasperating poet -lrb- 19 -rrb- but i can not help be of opinion with some writer whom i be unable at present to call to mind -lrb- schlegel i think -rrb- that the strong critical reaction of modern time in favor of dante 's genius have tend to exaggerate the idea conceive of he in relation to he own that he be of importance and bitterly hate in he native city be a distinction he share with other partisan who have obtain no celebrity though he poetry no doubt must have increase the bitterness that he genius also become more and more feel out of the city by the few individual capable of estimate a man of letter in those semi-barbarous time may be regard as certain but that busy politician in general war-making statesman and prince constantly occupy in fight for they existence with one another be at all alive either to he merit or he invective or would have regard he as anything but a poor wander scholar solace he foolish interference in the politics of this world with the old clerical threat against he enemy in another will hardly i think be doubt by any one who reflect on the difference between a fame accumulate by age and the living poverty that be oblige to seek its bread a writer on a monkish subject may have acquire fame with monk and even with a few distinguished person and yet have be little known and less care for out of the pale of that very private literary public which be almost exclusively they own when we read now-a-day of the great poet 's be so politely receive by can grande lord of verona and sit at he princely table we be apt to fancy that nothing but he great poetry procure he the reception and that nobody present compete with he in the eye of he host but to say nothing of the different kind of retainer that could sit at a prince 's table in those day can who be more ostentatious than delicate in he munificence keep a sort of caravansera for clever exile whom he distribute into lodgings classify accord to they pursuit -lrb- 20 -rrb- and dante only share he bounty with the rest till the more delicate poet could no longer endure either the buffoonery of he companion or the amusement derive from it by the master on one occasion he platter be slily heap with they bone which provoke he to call they dog as have none to shew for they own another time can grande ask he how it be that he companion give more pleasure at court than himself to which he answer because like love like he then leave the court and he disgusted superiority be no doubt regard as a pedantic assumption he stop long nowhere except with guido novello and when that prince whose downfal be at hand send he on the journey above mention to venice the senate -lrb- whom the poet have never offend -rrb- be so little aware of he be of consequence that they decline give he a audience he go back and break he heart boccaccio say that he would get into such passion with the very boy and girl in the street who plague he with party-word as to throw stone at they -- a thing that would be incredible if person acquaint with he great but ultra-sensitive nation do not know what italian could do in all age from dante 's own age down to the time of alfierus and foscolo it would be as difficult from the evidence of he own work and of the exasperation he create to doubt the extremest report of he irascible temper as it would be not to give implicit faith to he honesty the charge of peculation which he enemy bring against this great poet the world have universally scout with a indignation that do it honor he himself seem never to have condescend to allude to it and a biographer would feel bind to copy he silence have not the accusation be so atrociously record but on the other hand who can believe that a man so capable of do he fellow-citizen good and honor would have experience such excessive enmity have he not carry to excess the provocation of he pride and scorn he whole history go to prove it not omit the confession he make of pride as he chief sin and the eulogy he bestow on the favorite vice of the age -- revenge he christianity -lrb- at least as shewn in he poem -rrb- be not that of christ but of a furious polemic he motive for change he party though probably of a mixed nature like those of most human being may reasonably be suppose to have originate in something better than interest or indignation he have most likely not agree thoroughly with any party and have become hopeless of see dispute bring to a end except by the representative of the cæsars the inconsistency of the personal character of the pope with the sacred claim of the chair of st peter be also calculate greatly to disgust he but still he own infirmity of pride and vindictiveness spoil all and when he load every body else with reproach for the misfortune of he country he should have recollect that have he own fault be keep in subjection to he understand he might possibly have be its savior dante 's modesty have be assert on the ground of he humbling himself to the fame of virgil and at the foot of bless spirit but this kind of exalted humility do not repay a man 's fellow-citizen for lord it over they with scorn and derision we learn from boccaccio that when he be ask to go ambassador from he party to the pope he put to they the follow useless and mortifying query -- if i go who be to stay -- and if i stay who be to go -lrb- 21 -rrb- neither do he pride make he tolerant of pride in other a neighbor apply for he intercession with a magistrate who have summon he for some offence dante who dislike the man for ride in a overbearing manner along the street -lrb- stretch out he leg as wide as he could and hinder people from go by -rrb- do intercede with the magistrate but it be in behalf of double the fine in consideration of the horsemanship the neighbor who be a man of family be so exasperated that sacchettus the novelist say it be the principal cause of dante 's expatriation this will be consider the less improbable if as some suppose the delinquent obtain possession of he derider 's confiscate property but at all event nothing be more likely to have injure he the bitterest animosity be generally of a personal nature and bitter indeed must have be those which condemn a man of official dignity and of genius to such a penalty as the stake -lrb- 22 -rrb- that the florentine of old like other half-christianised people be capable of any extremity against a opponent burning include be prove by the fate of savonarolum and other and that dante himself could admire the burner be evident from he eulogy and beatification of such man as folco and st dominic the tragical as well as fantastic trick which man proud man drest in a little brief authority play with he energy and bad passion under the guise of duty be among the most perplexing of those spectacles which accord to a greater understanding than dante 's make the angel weep -lrb- dante by the way have introduce in he heaven no such angel as those though he have plenty that scorn and denounce -rrb- lope de vega though a poet be a officer of the inquisition and join the famous armada that be come to thumb-screw and roast we into he view of christian meekness whether the author of the story of _ paulo and francesca _ could have carry the dominican theory into practice have he be the banisher instead of the banish be a point that may happily be doubt but at all event he revenge himself on he enemy after they own fashion for he answer they decree of the stake by put they into hell dante entitle the saddest poem in the world a comedy because it be write in a middle style though some by a strange confusion of idea think the reason must have be because it end happily that be because begin with hell -lrb- to some -rrb- it terminate with heaven -lrb- to other -rrb- as well might they have say that a morning 's work in the inquisition end happily because while people be be rack in the dungeon the officer be make merry in the drawing-room for the much-injured epithet of divine dante 's memory be not responsible he entitle he poem arrogantly enough yet still not with that impiety of arrogance the comedy of dante alighierus a florentine by nation but not by habit the word divine be add by some transcriber and it heap absurdity on absurdity too much of it alas be literally infernal tragedy i be not speak in mockery any further than the fact itself can not help so speak i respect what be to be respect in dante i admire in he what be admirable would love -lrb- if he infernality would let I -rrb- what be loveable but this must not hinder one of the human race from protest against what be erroneous in he fame when it jar against every best feeling human and divine mr cary think that dante have as much right to avail himself of the popular creed in all its extravagance as homer have of he god or shakspeare of he fairy but the distinction be obvious homer do not personally identify himself with a creed or do he utmost to perpetuate the worst part of it in behalf of a ferocious inquisitorial church and to the risk of endanger the peace of million of gentle mind the great poem thus misnomer be partly a system of theology partly a abstract of the knowledge of the day but chiefly a series of passionate and imaginative picture altogether form a account of the author 's time he friend he enemy and himself write to vent the spleen of he exile and the rest of he feeling good and bad and to reform church and state by a spirit of resentment and obloquy which highly need reform itself it have also a design strictly self-referential the author feign that the beatify spirit of he mistress have obtain leave to warn and purify he soul by shew he the state of thing in the next world she depute the soul of he master virgil to conduct he through hell and purgatory and then take he herself through the sphere of heaven where saint peter catechise and confirm he and where he be finally honor with sight of the virgin mary of christ and even a glimpse of the supreme be he hell consider as a place be to speak geologically a most fantastical formation it descend from beneath jerusalem to the center of the earth and be a funnel graduate in circle each circle be a separate place of torment for a different vice or its co-ordinate and the point of the funnel terminate with satan stick into ice purgatory be a corresponding mountain on the other side of the globe commence with the antipode of jerusalem and divide into exterior circle of expiation which end in a table-land form the terrestrial paradise from this the hero and he mistress ascend by a flight exquisitely conceive to the star where the sun and the planet of the ptolemaic system -lrb- for the true one be unknown in dante 's time -rrb- form a series of heaven for different virtue the whole terminate in the empyrean or region of pure light and the presence of the beatific vision the boundary of old and new strange as it may now seem to we be so confuse in those day and book be so rare and the latin poet hold in such invincible reverence that dante in one and the same poem speak of the false god of paganism and yet retain much of its lower mythology nay invoke apollo himself at the door of paradise there be perhaps some mystical and even philosophical inclusion of the past in this medley as recognize the constant superintendence of providence but that dante partook of what may be call the literary superstition of the time even for want of better knowledge be clear from the grave historical use he make of poetic fable in he treatise on monarchy and in the very argument which he put into the mouth of saint and apostle there be linger feeling to this effect even now among the peasantry of italy where the reader need not be tell pagan custom of all sort include religious and most reverend one be exist under the sanction of other name -- heathenism christen a tuscan postilion once enumerate to I some of the native poet conclude he list with apollo and a plaster-cast man over here in london appear much puzzle when converse on the subject with a friend of mine how to discrepate samson from hercule dante accordingly while with the frightful bigotry of the school he put the whole pagan world into hell-border -lrb- with the exception of two or three whose salvation add to the absurdity -rrb- mingle the hell of virgil with that of tertullian and st dominic set mino at the door as judge retain charon in he old office of boatman over the stygian lake put fabulous people with real among the damned dido and cacus and ephialte with ezzelino and pope nichola the fifth and associate the centaur and the fury with the agent of diabolical torture it have please he also to elevate cato of utica to the office of warder of purgatory though the censor 's poor good wife marcium be detain in the region below by these and other far greater inconsistency the whole place of punishment become a _ reductio ad absurdum _ as ridiculous as it be melancholy so that one be astonished how so great a man and especially a man who think himself so far advance beyond he age and who possess such power of discerning the good and beautiful could endure to let he mind live in so foul and foolish a region for any length of time and there wreak and harden the unworthiest of he passion genius nevertheless be so commensurate with absurdity throughout the book and there be even such sweet and balmy as well as sublime picture in it occasionally nay often that not only will the poem ever be worthy of admiration but when those increase purification of christianity which we bless reformer begin shall finally precipitate the whole dregs of the author into the mythology to which they belong the world will derive a pleasure from it to a amount not to be conceive till the arrival of that day dante meantime with a impartiality which have be admire by those who can approve the assumption of a theological tyranny at the expense of common feeling and decency have put friend as well as foe into hell : tutor of he childhood kinsman of those who treat he hospitably even the father of he beloved friend guido cavalcante -- the last for not believe in a god : therein do the worst thing possible in behalf of the belief and totally differ both with the pious heathen plutarch and the great christian philosopher bacon who be of opinion that a contumelious belief be worse than none and that it be far better and more pious to believe in no god at all than in a god who would eat he child as soon as they be bear and dante make he do worse for the whole unbaptised infant world christian as well as pagan be in he tartarus milton have speak of the milder shades of purgatory and truly they possess great beauty even in a theological point of view they be something like a bit of christian refreshment after the horror of the _ inferno _ the first emerge from the hideous gulf to the sight of the blue serenity of heaven be paint in a manner inexpressibly charming so be the sea-shore with the come of the angel the valley with the angel in green the repose at night on the rock and twenty other picture of gentleness and love and yet special and great have be the escape of the protestant world from this part of roman catholic belief for purgatory be the heaviest stone that hang about the neck of the old and feeble in that communion hell be avoidable by repentance but purgatory what modest conscience shall escape mr cary in a note on a passage in which dante recommend he reader to think on what follow this expiatory state rather than what be suffer there -lrb- 23 -rrb- look upon the poet 's injunction as a unanswerable objection to the doctrine of purgatory it be difficult to conceive how the best can meet death without horror if they believe it must be follow by immediate and intense suffering luckily assent be not belief and mankind 's feeling be for the most part superior to they opinion otherwise the world would have be in a bad way indeed and nature not be vindicate of she child but let we watch and be on we guard against all resuscitation of superstition as to we florentine 's heaven it be full of beauty also though sometimes of a more questionable and pantomimical sort than be to be find in either of the other book i shall speak of some of they presently but the general impression of the place be that it be no heaven at all he say it be and talk much of its smile and its beatitude but always except the poetry -- especially the simile bring from the more heavenly earth -- we realize little but a fantastical assemblage of doctor and doubtful character far more angry and theological than celestial giddy rapture of monk and inquisitor dancing in circle and saint denounce pope and florentine in short a heaven libel itself with invective against earth and terminate in a great presumption many of the people put there a calvinistic dante would have consign to the other place and some if now live would not be admit into decent society at the beginning of one of the canto the poet congratulate himself with a complacent superiority on he be in heaven and occupy with celestial matter while he poor fellow-creature be wander and blunder on earth but he have never get there a divine -- worthy of that name -- of the church of england -lrb- dr whichcote -rrb- have beautifully say that heaven be first a temper and then a place accord to this truly celestial topography the implacable florentine have not reach its outermost court again he heavenly mistress beatrice besides be far too didactic to sustain the womanly part of she character properly alternate she smile and she sarcasm in a way that jar horribly against the occasional enchantment of she aspect she do not scruple to burst into taunt of the florentine in the presence of jesus himself and the spirit of he ancestor cacciaguida in the very bosom of christian bliss promise he revenge on he enemy be this the kind of zeal that be to be exempt from objection in a man who object to all the world or will it be think a profaneness against such profanity to remind the reader of the philosopher in swift who while gaze on the star be betray by he lower part into a ditch the reader 's time need not be waste with the allegorical and other mystical signification give to the poem still less on the question whether beatrice be theology or a young lady or both and least of all on the discovery of the ingenious signor rossettus that dante and all the other great old italian writer mean nothing either by they mistress or they mythology but attack on the court of rome suffice it that besides all other possible meaning dante himself have tell we that he poem have its obvious and literal meaning that he mean a spade by a spade purgatory by purgatory and truly and unaffectedly to devote he friend to the infernal region whenever he do so i confess i think it be a great pity that guido cavalcante do not live to read the poem especially the passage about he father the understanding of guido who have not the admiration for virgil that dante have -lrb- very likely for reason that have be think sound in modern time -rrb- be in all probability as good as that of he friend in many respects and perhaps more so in one or two and modern criticism might have be save some of its pain of objection by the poet 's contemporary the author do not live to publish in any formal manner he extraordinary poem probably do not intend to do so except under those circumstance of political triumph which he be always look for but as he shew portion of it to he friend it be no doubt talk of to a certain extent and must have exasperate such of he enemy as consider he worth they hostility no wonder they do all they could to keep he out of florence what would they have say of he could they have write a counter poem what would even he friend have say of he for we see in what manner he have treat even those and yet how could he possibly know with respect either to friend or enemy what pass between they and they conscience or who be it that give he he right to generate the boast distinction between a author 's feeling as a man and he assumed office as a theologian and parade the latter at the former 's expense he own spleen hatred and avowed sentiment of vengeance be manifest throughout the poem and there be this indeed to be say for the moral and religious inconsistency both of the man and he verse that in those violent time the spirit of christian charity and even the sentiment of personal shame be so little understand that the author in one part of it be make to blush by a friend for not have avenge he and it be say to have be think a compliment to put a lady herself into hell that she might be talk of provide it be for something not odious a admirer of this infernal kind of celebrity even in later time declare that he would have give a sum of money -lrb- i forget to what amount -rrb- if dante have but do as much for one of he ancestor it have be argue that in all the party concern in these curious ethic there be a generous love of distinction and a strong craving after life action and sympathy of some kind or other grant there be all sort of half-good half-barbarous feeling in dante 's poem let justice be do to the good half but do not let we take the ferocity for wisdom and piety or pretend in the complacency of we own freedom from superstition to see no danger of harm to the less fortunate among we fellow-creature in the support it receive from a man of genius bedlam have be fill with such horror thousand nay million of feeble mind be suffer by they or from they at this minute all over the world dante 's best critic foscolo have say much of the heroical nature of the age in which the poet live but he add that its mixture of knowledge and absurdity be almost inexplicable the truth be that like everything else which appear harsh and unaccountable in nature it be a excess of the material for good working in a over-active and inexperienced manner but know this we be bind for the sake of the good not to retard its improvement by ignore exist impiety or blind ourselves to the perpetuate tendency of the bigotry of great man oh have the first indoctrinator of christian feeling while enlist the divine plato into the service of diviner charity only keep the latter just enough in mind to discern the beautiful difference between the philosopher 's unmalignant and improvable evil and they own malignant and eternal one what a world of folly and misery they might have save we but as the evil have happen let we hope that even this form of it have have its use if dante thought it salutary to the world to maintain a system of religious terror the same charity which can hope that it may once have be so have teach we how to commence a better but do he after all or do he not think it salutary do he think so believe the creed himself or do he think it from a unwilling sense of its necessity or lastly do he write only as a mythologist and care for nothing but the exercise of he spleen and genius if he have no other object than that he conscientiousness would be reduce to a low pitch indeed foscolo be of opinion he be not only in earnest but that he be very near take himself for a apostle and would have do so have he prophecy succeed perhaps with success to the pretension -lrb- 24 -rrb- thank heaven he hell have not embittered the mild reading-desk of the church of england if king george the third himself with all he arbitrary notion and willing religious acquiescence could not endure the creed of st athanasius with its damnatory enjoinment of the impossible what would have be say to the inscription over dante 's hell-gate or the account of ugolino eat a archbishop in the gentle chapel of queen victorium may those chapel have every beauty in they and every air of heaven that painting and music can bestow -- divine gift not unworthy to be set before they divine bestower but far from they be keep the foul fiend of inhumanity and superstition it be certainly impossible to get at a thorough knowledge of the opinion of dante even in theology and he moral if judge accord to the receive standard be not seldom puzzling he rarely think as the pope do sometimes not as the church do : he be lax for instance on the subject of absolution by the priest at death -lrb- 25 -rrb- all you can be sure of be the predominance of he will the most wonderful poetry and the notion he entertain of the degree of vice and virtue towards the error of love he be incline to be so lenient -lrb- some think because he have indulge in they himself -rrb- that it be pretty clear he would not have put paulo and francesca into hell if they story have not be too recent and they death too sudden to allow he to assume they repentance in the tooth of the evidence require he avail himself of orthodox license to put the harlot rahab into heaven -lrb- cette bonne fille de jericho as ginguéné call she -rrb- nay he put she into the planet venus as if to compliment she on she profession and one of she companion there be a fair ghibelline sister of the tyrant ezzelino a lady famous for she gallantry of whom the poet good-naturedly say that she be overcome by she star -- to wit the say planet venus and yet he make she the organ of the most unfeminine triumph over the guelph but both these lady it be to be understand repent -- for they have time for repentance they good fortune save they poor murder francesca have no time to repent therefore she mischance be she damnation such be the compliment theology pay to the creator in fact nothing be really punish in dante 's catholic hell but impenitence deliberate or accidental no delay of repentance however dangerous hinder the most hard-hearted villain from reach he heaven the best man go to hell for ever if he do not think he have sin as dante think the worst be beatify if he agree with he : the only thing which every body be sure of be some dreadful duration of agony in purgatory -- the great horror of catholic death bed protestantism may well hug itself on have escape it o luther vast be the good you do we o gentle church of england let nothing persuade you that it be better to preach frightful and foolish idea of god from you pulpit than loving-kindness to all man and peace above all thing if dante have err only on the side of indulgence humanity could easily have forgive he -- for the excess of charity be the extension of hope but unfortunately where he be sweet-natured once he be bitter a hundred time this be the impression he make on universalist of all creed and party that be to say on man who have run the whole round of sympathy with they fellow-creature become the only final judge of sovereign pretension it be very well for individual to make a god of dante for some encouragement of they own position or pretension but a god for the world at large he never be or can be and i doubt if a impression to this effect be not always from the very dawn of we literature the one entertain of he by the genius of we native country which could never long endure any kind of unwarrantable dictation chaucer evidently think he a man who would spare no unnecessary probe to the feeling -lrb- see the close of he version of _ ugolino _ -rrb- spenser say not a word of he though he copy tasso and eulogise ariosto shakspeare would assuredly have put he into the list of those presumptuous looker into eternity who _ take upon themselves to know -lrb- cymbeline _ act v sc 4 -rrb- milton in he sonnet to henry lawe call he that sad florentine -- a lament epithet by which we do not designate a man whom we desire to resemble the historian of english poetry admirably apply to he a passage out of milton say that hell grow darker at he frown -lrb- 26 -rrb- walter scott could not read he at least not with pleasure he tell miss seward that the plan of the poem appear to he unhappy the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and uninteresting -lrb- 27 -rrb- uninteresting i think it be impossible to consider it the known world be there and the unknown pretend to be there and both be surely interesting to most people landor in he delightful book the _ pentameron _ -- a book full of the profoundest as well as sweetest humanity -- make petrarch follow up boccaccio 's eulogy of the episode of paulo and francesca with ebullition of surprise and horror : _ petrarca _ perfection of poetry the greater be my wonder at discover nothing else of the same order or cast in this whole section of the poem he who faint at the recital of francesca ` and he who fall as a dead body fall ' would exterminate all the inhabitant of every town in italy what execration against florence pistoium pisa siena genoa what hatred against the whole human race what exultation and merriment at eternal and immitigable suffering see this i can not but consider the _ inferno _ as the most immoral and impious book that ever be write yet hopeless that we country shall ever see again such poetry and certain that without it we future poet would be more feebly urge forward to excellence i would have dissuade dante from cancel it if this have be he intention -lrb- 28 -rrb- most happily be the distinction here intimate between the undesirableness of dante 's book in a moral and religious point of view and the greater desirableness of it nevertheless as a pattern of poetry for absurdity however potent wear itself out in the end and leave what be good and beautiful to vindicate even so foul a origin again petrarch say what a object of sadness and of consternation he who rise up from hell like a giant refreshed _ boccaccio _ strange perversion a pillar of smoke by day and of fire by night to guide no one paradise have fewer want for he to satisfy than hell have all which he feed to repletion but let we rather look to he poetry than he temper see also what be say in that admirable book further on -lrb- p 50 -rrb- respect the most impious and absurd passage in all dante 's poem the assumption about divine love in the inscription over hell-gate -- one of those monstrosity of conception which none ever have the effrontery to pretend to vindicate except theologian who profess to be superior to the priest of moloch and who yet defy every feeling of decency and humanity for the purpose of explain they own worldly frightened or hard-hearted submission to the mistake of the most wretched understanding ugo foscolo a excellent critic where he own temper and violence do not interfere see nothing but jealousy in petrarch 's dislike of dante and nothing but jesuitism in similar feeling entertain by such man as tiraboschus but all gentle and considerate heart must dislike the rage and bigotry in dante even be it true -lrb- as the dantesque foscolo think -rrb- that italy will never be regenerate till one-half of it be baptise in the blood of the other -lrb- 29 -rrb- such man with all they acuteness be incapable of see what can be effect by nobler and serener time and the progress of civilisation they fancy no doubt that they be vindicate the energy of nature herself and the inevitable necessity of do evil that good may come but dante in so do violate the scripture he profess to revere and man must not assume to themselves that final knowledge of result which be the only warrant of the privilege and the possession of which be to be arrogate by no earthly wisdom one calm discovery of science may do away with all the boast eternal necessity of the angry and the self-idolatrous the passion that may be necessary to savage be not bind to remain so to civilised man any more than the eating of man 's flesh or the worship of jugghernaut when we think of the wonderful thing lately do by science for the intercourse of the world and the beautiful and tranquil book of philosophy write by man of equal energy and benevolence and open the peacefulest hope for mankind and view of creation to which dante 's universe be a nutshell -- such a vision as that of he poem -lrb- in a theological point of view -rrb- seem no better than the dream of a hypochondriacal savage and he nutshell a rottenness to be spit out of the mouth heaven send that the great poet 's want of charity have not make myself presumptuous and uncharitable but it be in the name of society i speak and word at all event now-a-day be not the terrible stake-preceding thing they be in he reader in general however -- even those of the literary world -- have little conception of the extent to which dante carry either he cruelty or he abuse the former -lrb- of which i shall give some example presently -rrb- shew appalling habit of personal resentment the latter be outrageous to a pitch of the ludicrous -- positively scream i will give some specimen of it out of foscolo himself who collect they for a different purpose though with all he idolatry of dante he be far from be insensible to he mistake the people of sienna accord to this national and christian poet be a parcel of cox-comb those of arezzo dog and of casentino hog lucca make a trade of perjury pistoium be a den of beast and ought to be reduce to ash and the river arno should overflow and drown every soul in pisa almost all the woman in florence walk half-naked in public and be abandon in private every brother husband son and father in bologna set they woman to sale in all lombardy be not to be find three man who be not rascal and in genoa and romagna people go about pretend to be man but in reality be body inhabit by devil they soul have go to the ` lowest pit of hell ' to join the betrayer of they friend and kinsman -lrb- 30 -rrb- so much for he beloved countryman as for foreigner particularly king edward the first of england and robert of scotland be a couple of grasp fool the emperor albert be a usurper alphonso the second of spain a debauchee the king of bohemia a coward frederick of arragon a coward and miser the king of portugal and norway forger the king of naple a man whose virtue be express by a unit and he vice by a million and the king of france the descendant of a pari butcher and of progenitor who poison st thoma aquina they descendant conquer with the arm of juda rather than of soldier and sell the flesh of they daughter to old man in order to extricate themselves from a danger -lrb- 31 -rrb- when we add to these invective damnation of friend as well as foe of companion lawyer man of letter prince philosopher pope pagan innocent people as well as guilty fool and wise capable and incapable man woman and child -- it be really no better than a kind of diabolical sublimation of lord thurlow 's anathema in the _ rolliad _ which begin with damnation seize ye all and end with damn they beyond what mortal tongue can tell confound sink plunge they all to deepest blackest hell -lrb- 32 -rrb- in the gross indeed this be ridiculous enough no burlesque can beat it but in the particular one be astonished and saddened at the cruelty in which the poet allow he imagination to riot horror generally describe with too intense a verisimilitude not to excite we admiration with too astounding a perseverance not to amaze we humanity and sometimes with a amount of positive joy and delight that make we ready to shut the book with disgust and indignation thus in a circle in hell where traitor be stick up to they chin in ice -lrb- canto xxxii -rrb- the visitor in walk about happen to give one of they face a kick the sufferer weep and then curse he -- with such infernal truth do the writer combine the malignant with the pathetic dante reply to the curse by ask the man he name he be refuse it he then seize the miserable wretch by the hair in order to force he to the disclosure and virgil be represent as commend the barbarity -lrb- 33 -rrb- but he do worse to barbarity he add treachery of he own he tell another poor wretch whose face be iced up with he tear as if he have wear a crystal vizor that if he will disclose he name and offence he will relieve he eye awhile _ that he may weep _ the man do so and the ferocious poet then refuse to perform he promise add mockery to falsehood and observe that ill manners be the only courtesy proper to ward such a fellow -lrb- 34 -rrb- it have be conjecture that macchiavellus apparently encourage the enormity of the prince of he time with a design to expose they to indignation it might have be think of dante if he have not take a part in the cruelty that he detail the horror of he hell out of a wish to disgust the world with its frightful notion of god this be certainly the effect of the worst part of he description in a age like the present black burning gulf full of outcry and blasphemy foot red-hot with fire man eternally eat they fellow-creature freeze wretch malignantly dash they iced head against one another other adversary mutually exchange shape by force of a attraction at once irresistible and loathing and spit with hate and disgust when it be do -- enough enough for god 's sake take the disgust out of one 's sens o flower of true christian wisdom and charity now begin to fill the air with fragrance but it will be say that dante do all this out of he hate of cruelty itself and of treachery itself partly no doubt he do and entirely he think he do but see how the notion of such retribution react upon the judge and produce in he the bad passion he punish it be true the punishment be imaginary be a human be actually to see such thing he must be dehumanise or he would cry out against they with horror and detestation but the poem draw they as truth the writer 's creed threaten they he himself contribute to maintain the belief and however we may suppose such a belief to have have its use in give alarm to ruffian passion and barbarously ignorant time a age arrive when a beneficent providence permit itself to be better understand and dissipate the superfluous horror many indeed of the absurdity of dante 's poem be too obvious now-a-day to need remark even the composition of the poem egotistically say to be faultless by such critic as alfierus who think they resemble he partake as every body 's style do of the fault as well as good quality of the man it be nervous concise full almost as it can hold picturesque mighty primeval but it be often obscure often harsh and force in its construction defective in melody and wilful and superfluous in the rhyme sometimes also the writer be inconsistent in circumstance -lrb- probably from not have correct the poem -rrb- and he be not above be filthy even in the episode of paulo and francesca which have so often be pronounced faultless and which be unquestionably one of the most beautiful piece of write in the world some of these fault be observable particularly in the obscurity of the passage about _ tolta forma _ the cessation of the incessant tempest and the non-adjuration of the two lover in the manner that virgil prescribe but truly it be say that when dante be great nobody surpass he i doubt if anybody equal he as to the constant intensity and incessant variety of he picture and whatever he paint he throw as it be upon its own power as though a artist should draw figure that start into life and proceed to action for themselves frightening they creator every motion word and look of these creature become full of sensibility and suggestion the invisible be at the back of the visible darkness become palpable silence describe a character nay form the most striking part of a story a word act as a flash of lightning which display some gloomy neighborhood where a tower be stand with dreadful face at the window or where at you foot full of eternal voice one abyss be beheld drop out of another in the lurid light of torment in the present volume a story will be find which tell a long tragedy in half-a-dozen line dante have the minute probability of a defoe in the midst of the loftiest and most generalising poetry and this feeling of matter-of-fact be impress by fiction the most improbable nay the most ridiculous and revolting you laugh at the absurdity you be shock at the detestable cruelty yet for the moment the thing almost seem as if it must be true you feel as you do in a dream and after it -- you wake and laugh but the absurdity seem true at the time and while you laugh you shudder enough of this crueller part of he genius have be exhibit but it be seldom you can have the genius without sadness in the circle of hell soothsayer walk along weep with they face turn the wrong way so that they tear fall between they shoulder the picture be still more dreadful warton think it ridiculous but i can not help feeling with the poet that it be dreadfully pathetic it be the last mortifying insult to human pretension warton who have a grudge against dante natural to a man of happier piety think he ridiculous also in describe the monster geryon lie upon the edge of one of the gulf of hell like a beaver -lrb- canto xvii -rrb- he be of opinion that the writer only do it to shew he knowledge of natural history but surely the idea of so strange and awful a creature -lrb- a huge mild-faced man end in a dragon 's body -rrb- lie familiarly on the edge of the gulf as a beaver do by the water combine the supernatural with the familiar in a very impressive manner it be this combination of extreme which be the life and soul of the whole poem you have this world in the next the same person passion remembrance intensify by superhuman despair or beatitude the speechless entrancement of bliss the purgatorial trial of hope and patience the support of hate and anger -lrb- such as they be -rrb- in hell itself nay of loving despair and a self-pity make unboundedly pathetic by endless suffering hence there it no love-story so affect as that of paulo and francesca thus tell and perpetuate in another world no father 's misery so enforce upon we as ugolino 's who for hundred of year have not grow tired of the revenge to which it work he dante even put this weight and continuity of feeling into passage of mere transient emotion or illustration unconnected with the next world as in the famous instance of the verse about evening and many other which the reader will meet with in this volume indeed if pathos and the most impressive simplicity and graceful beauty of all kind and abundant grandeur can pay -lrb- as the reader i believe will think it do even in a prose abstract -rrb- for the pang of moral discord and absurdity inflict by the perusal of dante 's poem it may challenge competition with any in point of interest he heaven it be true though contain both sublime and lovely passage be not so good as he earth the more unearthly he try to make it the less heavenly it become when he be content with earth in heaven itself-when he literalise a metaphor and with exquisite felicity find himself _ arrive there _ in consequence of fix he eye on the eye of beatrice then he be most celestial but he endeavor to express degree of beatitude and holiness by variety of flame and light -- of dancing light revolve light light of smile of star of starry cross of didactic letter and sentence of animal figure make up of star full of bless soul with saint _ form a eagle 's beak _ and david in its _ eye _ -- such superhuman attempt become for the most part trick of theatrical machinery on which we gaze with little curiosity and no respect he angel however be another matter belief be prepare for those winged human form and they furnish he with some of he most beautiful combination of the natural with the supernatural ginguéné have remark the singular variety as well as beauty of dante 's angel milton 's indeed be commonplace in the comparison in the eighth canto of the _ inferno _ the devil insolently refuse the poet and he guide a entrance into the city of di : -- a angel come sweep over the stygian lake to enforce it the noise of he wing make the shore tremble and be like a crash whirlwind such as beat down the tree and send the peasant and they herd fly before it the heavenly messenger after rebuke the devil touch the portal of the city with he wand they fly open and he return the way he come without utter a word to the two companion he face be that of one occupy with other thought this angel be announce by a tempest another who bring the soul of the depart to purgatory be first discover at a distance gradually disclose white splendor which be he wing and garment he come in a boat of which he wing be the sail and as he approach it be impossible to look he in the face for its brightness two other angel have green wing and green garment and the drapery be keep in motion like a flag by the vehement action of the wing a fifth have a face like the morning star casting forth quiver beam a sixth be of a lustre so oppressive that the poet feel a weight on he eye before he know what be come another 's presence affect the sens like the fragrance of a may-morning and another be in garment dark as cinder but have a sword in he hand too sparkling to be gaze at dante 's occasional picture of the beauty of external nature be worthy of these angelic creation and to the last degree fresh and lovely you long to bathe you eye smart with the fume of hell in he dew you gaze enchant on he green field and he celestial blue sky the more so from the pain and sorrow in midst of which the vision be create dante 's grandeur of every kind be proportionate to that of he angel almost to he ferocity and that be say every thing it be not always the spiritual grandeur of milton the subjection of the material impression to the moral but it be equally such when he choose and far more abundant he infernal precipice -- he black whirlwind -- he innumerable cry and clasping of hand -- he very odours of huge loathsomeness -- he giant at twilight stand up to the middle in pit like tower and cause earthquake when they move -- he earthquake of the mountain in purgatory when a spirit be set free for heaven -- he dignified mantuan sordello silently regard he and he guide as they go by like a lion on he watch -- he blasphemer capaneus lie in unconquered rage and sullenness under a eternal rain of flake of fire -lrb- human precursor of milton 's satan -rrb- -- he aspect of paradise as if the universe have smile -- he inhabitant of the whole planet saturn cry out _ so loud _ in accordance with the anti-papal indignation of saint pietro damiano that the poet though among they _ could not hear what they say _ -- and the blush eclipse like red cloud at sunset which take place at the apostle peter 's denunciation of the sanguinary filth of the court of rome -- all these sublimity and many more make we not know whether to be more astonished at the greatness of the poet or the rage littleness of the man grievous be it to be force to bring two such opposite together and i wish for the honor and glory of poetry i do not feel compel to do so but the swarthy florentine have not the healthy temperament of he brethren and he fall upon evil time compare with homer and shakspeare he very intensity seem only superior to theirs from a excess of the morbid and he be inferior to both in other sovereign quality of poetry -- to the one in give you the healthiest general impression of nature itself -- to shakspeare in boundless universality -- to most great poet in thorough harmony and delightfulness he want -lrb- generally speak -rrb- the music of a happy and a happy-making disposition homer from he large vital bosom breathe like a broad fresh air over the world amidst alternate storm and sunshine make you aware that there be rough work to be face but also activity and beauty to be enjoy the feeling of health and strength be predominant life laugh at death itself or meet it with a noble confidence -- be not teach to dread it as a malignant goblin shakspeare have all the smile as well as tear of nature and discern the soul of goodness in thing evil he be comedy as well as tragedy -- the entire man in all he quality mood and experience and he beautify all and both those truly divine poet make nature they subject through she own inspiriting medium -- not through the darkened glass of one man 's spleen and resentment dante in constitute himself the hero of he poem not only render she in the general impression as dreary as himself in spite of the occasional beautiful picture he draw of she but narrow she very immensity into he pettiness he fancy alas that he could build she universe over again out of the politics of old rome and the divinity of the school dante besides he great poem and a few latin eclogue of no great value write lyric full of platonical sentiment some of which anticipate the loveliest of petrarch 's and he be the author of various prose work political and philosophical all more or less masterly for the time in which he live and all coadjutor of he poetry in fix he native tongue he account of he early life -lrb- the _ vita nuova _ -rrb- be a most engaging history of a boyish passion evidently as real and true on he own side as love and truth can be whatever might be its mistake as to its object the treatise on the vernacular tongue -lrb- _ de vulgari eloquio _ -rrb- shew how critically he consider

on monarchy -lrb- _ de monarchia _ -rrb- be a compound of ability and absurdity in which he great genius be fairly overborne by the barbarous pedantry of the age it be a argument to prove that the world must all be govern by one man that this one man must be the successor of the roman emperor -- god have manifestly design the world to be subject for ever to the roman empire and lastly that this emperor be equally design by god to be independent of the pope -- spiritually subject to he indeed but so far only as a good son be subject to the religious advice of he father and thus make church and state happy for ever in the two divide supremacy and all this assumption of the obsolete and impossible the author gravely prove in all the form of logic by argument draw from the history of æneas and the providential cackle of the roman goose how can the patriot of modern italy justified as they be in extol the poet to the sky see he plunge into such depths of bigotry in he verse and childishness in he prose and consent to perplex the friend of advancement with make a type of they success out of so err though so great a man such slavishness even to such greatness be a poor and unpromising thing compare with a altogether unprejudiced and forward-looking self-reliance to have no faith in name have be announce as one of they principle and god and humanity be they motto what therefore have dante 's name to do with they principle or what have the semi-barbarism of the thirteenth century to do with the final triumph of god and humanity dante 's laud wish for that union of the italian state which he fame have lead they so fondly to identify with they own be but a portion of he greater and prouder wish to see the whole world at the foot of he boast ancestress rome not of course that he have no view to what he consider good and just government -lrb- for what sane despot purpose to rule without that -rrb- but he good and just government be always to be found on the _ sine qua non _ principle of universal italian domination -lrb- 35 -rrb- all that dante say or do have its interest for we in spite of he error because he be a earnest and suffer man and a great genius but he fame must ever continue to lie where he greatest blame do in he principal work he be a gratuitous logician a preposterous politician a cruel theologian but he wonderful imagination and -lrb- consider the bitterness that be in he -rrb- still more wonderful sweetness have go into the heart of he fellow-creature and will remain there in spite of the moral and religious absurdity with which they be mingled and of the inability which the best-natured reader feel to associate he entire memory as a poet with they usual personal delight in a poet and he name -lrb- footnote 1 : as notice of

succession of gulf or circle narrow as they descend and terminate in the center so that the general shape be that of a funnel commentator have differ as to they magnitude but the latest calculation give 315 mile for the diameter of the mouth or crater and a quarter of a mile for that of its terminate point in the middle be the abyss pervade the whole depth and 245 mile in diameter at the opening which reduce the different platform or territory that surround it to a size comparatively small these territory be more or less varied with land and water lake precipice & c a precipice fourteen mile high divide the first of they from the second the passage from the upper world to the entrance be various and the descent from one circle to another be effect by the poet and he guide in different manners-sometime on foot through by-ways sometimes by the conveyance of supernatural being the crater he find to be the abode of those who have do neither good nor evil caring for nothing but themselves in the first circle be the whole unbaptised world -- heathen and infant -- melancholy though not torment here also be find the elysium of virgil whose charon and other infernal being be among the agent of torment in the second circle the torment commence with the sin of incontinence and the punishment go deepen with the crime from circle to circle through gluttony avarice prodigality wrath sullenness or unwillingness to be please with the creation disbelief in god and the soul -lrb- with which the punishment by fire commence -rrb- usury murder suicide blasphemy seduction and other

of the church heresy false apostleship alchemy forgery coining -lrb- all these from seduction downward in one circle -rrb- then in the frozen or lowest circle of all treachery and at the bottom of this be satan stick into the center of the earth with the center of the globe commence the antipodean attraction of its opposite side together with a rocky ascent out of it through a huge ravine the poet and he guide on they arrival at this spot accordingly find they position reverse and so conclude they _ downward _ journey _ upward _ till they issue forth to light on the border of the sea which contain the island of purgatory the journey through hell dante say that when he be half-way on he pilgrimage through this life he one day find himself towards nightfall in a wood where he could no longer discern the right path it be a place so gloomy and terrible every thing in it grow in such a strange and savage manner that the horror he feel return on he whenever he think of it the pass of death could hardly be more bitter travel through it all night with a beating heart he at length come to the foot of a hill and look up as he begin to ascend it he perceive the shoulder of the hill clothe in the beam of morning a sight which give he some little comfort he feel like a man who have buffet he way to land out of a shipwreck and who though still anxious to get farther from he peril can not help turn round to gaze on the wide water so do he stand look back on the pass that contain that dreadful wood after rest a while he again betake he up the hill but have not go far when he behold a leopard bound in front of he and hinder he progress after the leopard come a lion with he head aloft mad with hunger and seem to frighten the very air -lrb- 1 -rrb- and after the lion more eager still a she-wolf so lean that she appear to be sharpen with every wolfish want the pilgrim flee back in terror to the wood where he again find himself in a darkness to which the light never penetrate in that place he say the sun never speak word -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the wolf be still close upon he -lrb- 3 -rrb- while thus fly he behold come towards he a man who speak something but he know not what the voice sound strange and feeble as if from disuse dante loudly call out to he to save he whether he be a man or only a spirit the apparition at whose sight the wild beast disappear say that he be no longer man though man he have be in the time of the false god and sing the history of the offspring of anchise and art thou then that virgil say dante who have fill the world with such flood of eloquence o glory and light of all poet thou art my master and thou mine _ author _ thou alone the book from which i have gather beauty that have gain I praise behold the peril i be in and help I for i tremble in every vein and pulse virgil comfort dante he tell he that he must quit the wood by another road and that he himself would be he guide lead he first to behold the region of woe underground and then the spirit that live content in fire because it purify they for heaven and then that he would consign he to other hand worthier than he own which should raise he to behold heaven itself for as the pagan of whom he be one have be rebel to the law of he that reign there nobody could arrive at paradise by they means -lrb- 4 -rrb- so say virgil move on he way and dante closely follow he express a fear however as they go lest be neither æneas nor st paul he journey could not be worthily undertake nor end in wisdom but virgil after sharply rebuke he for he faintheartedness tell he that the spirit of she whom he love beatrice have come down from heaven on purpose to commend she lover to he care upon which the droop courage of the pilgrim be raise to a undaunted confidence as flower that have be close and bow down by frosty night rise all up on they stem in the morning sun -lrb- 5 -rrb- non vuol che 'n sua città per I sì vegna the pagan could not be rebel to a law they never hear of any more than dante could be a rebel to luther but this be one of the absurdity with which the impious effrontery or scarcely less impious admission of dante 's teacher avowedly set reason at defiance -- retain meanwhile they right of contempt for the impiety of mahometan and brahmin which be odd as the poet say for be not less absurd or as the other argue much more so they have at least a equal claim on the submission of the reason since the greater the irrationality the higher the theological triumph through I be the road to the dolorous city through I be the road to the everlasting sorrow through I be the road to the lose people justice be the motive of my exalted maker i be make by divine power by consummate wisdom and by primal love before I be no create thing if not eternal and eternal be i also abandon hope all ye who enter such be the word which dante beheld write in dark character over a portal master say he to virgil i find they meaning hard a man answer virgil must conduct himself at this door like one prepared hither must he bring no mistrust hither can come and live no cowardice we have arrive at the place i tell thee of here thou art to behold the dolorous people who have lose all intellectual good -lrb- 6 -rrb- so say virgil place he hand on dante 's look on he with a cheerful countenance and the florentine pass with he through the dreadful gate they enter upon a sightless gulf in which be a black air without star and immediately hear a hubbub of groan and wailing and terrible thing say in many language word of wretchedness outcry of rage voice loud and hoarse and sound of the smiting of hand one against another dante begin to weep the sound be as if the sand in a whirlwind be turn into noise and fill the blind air with incessant conflict yet these be not the soul of the wicked they be those only who have live without praise or blame thinking of nothing but themselves these miserable creature be mix with the angel who stand neutral in the war with satan heaven would not dull its brightness with those angel nor would lower hell receive they lest the bad one should triumph in they company and what be it say dante which make they so grievously suffer hopelessness of death say virgil they blind existence here and immemorable former life make they so wretched that they envy every other lot mercy and justice alike disdain they let we speak of they no more look and pass the companion go on till they come to a great river with a multitude wait on the bank a hoary old man appear cross the river towards they in a boat and as he come he say woe to the wicked never expect to see heaven i come to bear you across to the dark region of everlasting fire and ice then look at dante he say get thee away from the dead thou who standest there live spirit torment thyself not charon say virgil he have a passport beyond thy power to question the shaggy cheek of the boatman of the livid lake who have wheel of fire about he eye fall at these word and he be silent but the naked multitude of soul whom he have speak to change color and gnash they tooth blaspheme god and they parent and the human species and the place and the hour and the seed of the sowing of they birth and all the while they feel themselves drive onward by a fear which become a desire towards the cruel river-side which await every one destitute of the fear of god the demon charon beckon to they with eye like brasier collect they as they come give blow to those that linger with he oar one by one they drop into the boat like leaf from a bough in autumn till the bough be leave bare or as bird drop into the decoy at the sound of the bird-call there be then a earthquake so terrible that the recollection of it make the poet burst into a sweat at every pore a whirlwind issue from the lament ground attend by vermilion flash and he lose he sens and fall like a man stupefy a crash of thunder through he brain wake up the pilgrim so hastily that he shake himself like a person rouse by force he find that he be on the brink of a gulf from which ascend a thunderous sound of innumerable groaning he could see nothing down it it be too dark with sooty cloud virgil himself turn pale but say we be to go down here i will lead the way o master say dante if even thou fearest what be to become of myself it be pity not fear reply virgil that make I change color with these word he guide lead he into the first circle of hell surround the abyss the great noise gradually cease to be hear as they journey inwards till at last they become aware of a world of sigh which produce a tremble in the air they be breathe by the soul of such as have die without baptism man woman and infant no matter how good no matter if they worship god before the come of christ for they worship he not properly virgil himself be one of they they be all lose for no other reason and they only suffering consist in hopeless desire dante be strike with great sorrow when he hear this know how many good man must be in that place he inquire if no one have ever be take out of it into heaven virgil tell he there have and he name they to wit adam abel noah mose king david obedient abraham the patriarch and isaac and jacob with they child and rachel for whom jacob do so much -- and many more add however that there be no instance of salvation before theirs journey on through spirit as thick as leaf dante perceive a lustre at a little distance and observe shape in it evidently of great dignity inquire who they be that thus live apart from the rest virgil say that heaven thus favor they by reason of they renown on earth a voice be then hear exclaim honor and glory to the lofty poet lo he shade return dante then see four other noble figure come towards they of aspect neither sad nor cheerful observe he with the sword in he hand say virgil as they be advance that be homer the poet ' sovereign next to he come horace the satirist then ovid and the last be lucan and thus i beheld say dante the bright school of the loftiest of poet who fly above the rest like a eagle for a while the illustrious spirit talk together and then turn to the florentine with a benign salutation at which he master smile and further honor they do I add the father of italian poetry for they admit I of they tribe so that to a band of that high account i add a sixth -lrb- 7 -rrb- the spirit return towards the bright light in which they live talk with dante by the way and bring he to a magnificent castle girt with seven lofty wall and further defend with a river which they all pass as if it have be dry ground seven gate conduct they into a meadow of fresh green the resort of a race whose eye move with a deliberate soberness and whose whole aspect be of great authority they voice sweet and they speech seldom -lrb- 8 -rrb- dante be take apart to a elevation in the ground so that he could behold they all distinctly and there on the enamelled green -lrb- 9 -rrb- be point out to he the great spirit by the sight of whom he feel exalt in he own esteem he see electra with many companion among whom be hector and æneas and cæsar in armor with he hawk 's eye and on another side he behold old king latinus with he daughter lavinium and the brutus that expel tarquin and lucretium and julium and cato 's wife marcium and the mother of the gracchus and apart by himself the sultan saladin he then raise he eye a little and behold the master of those who know -lrb- 10 -rrb- -lrb- aristotle -rrb- sit amidst the family of philosopher and honor by they all socrate and plato be at he side among the rest be democritus who make the world a chance and diogene and heraclitus & c and dioscoride the good gatherer of simple orpheus also he see and cicero and the moral seneca and euclid and hippocrate and avicen and averro who write the great commentary and other too numerous to mention the company of six become diminish to two and virgil take he forth on a far different road leave that serene air for a stormy one and so they descend again into darkness it be the second circle into which they now come -- a sphere narrower than the first and by so much more the wretcheder mino sit at the entrance gnarling -- he that give sentence on every one that come and intimate the circle into which each be to be plunge by the number of fold into which he cast he tail round about he mino admonish dante to beware how he enter unbidden and warn he against he conductor but virgil sharply rebuke the judge and bid he not set he will against the will that be power the pilgrim then descend through hell-mouth till they come to a place dark as pitch that bellow with furious cross-wind like a sea in a tempest it be the first place of torment and the habitation of carnal sinner the wind full of stifled voice buffet the soul for ever whirling they away to and fro and dash they against one another whenever it seize they for that purpose the wail and the shriek be loudest cry out against the divine power sometimes a whole multitude come drive in a body like starling before the wind now hither and thither now up now down sometimes they go in a line like crane when a company of those bird be beheld sailing along in the air utter its dolorous clang dante see a group of they advance inquire of virgil who they be who be these say he come hither scourge in the blackest part of the hurricane she at the head of they say virgil be empress over many nation so foul grow she heart with lust that she ordain license to be law to the end that herself might be hold blameless she be semiramis of whom it be say that she give suck to ninus and espouse he lead the multitude next to she be dido she that slew herself for love and break faith to the ash of sichaeus and she that follow with the next be the luxurious woman cleopatra dante then see helen who produce such a world of misery and the great achille who fight for love till it slew he and pari and tristan and a thousand more whom he guide point at name they name every one of whom be lose through love the poet stand for a while speechless for pity and like one bereft of he wit he then besought leave to speak to a particular couple who go side by side and who appear to be bear before the wind with speed lighter than the rest he conductor bid he wait till they come nigher and then to entreat they gently by the love which bear they in that manner and they would stop and speak with he dante wait he time and then lift up he voice between the gust of wind and adjure the two weary soul to halt and have speech with he if none forbid they do so upon which they come to he like dove to the nest -lrb- 11 -rrb- there be a lull in the tempest as if on purpose to let they speak and the female address dante say that as he show such pity for they state they would have pray heaven to give peace and repose to he life have they possess the friendship of heaven -lrb- 12 -rrb- love she say which be soon kindle in a gentle heart seize this my companion for the fair body i once inhabit -- how deprive of it my spirit be bow to recollect love which compel the beloved person upon thought of love seize I in turn with a delight in he passion so strong that as thou seest even here it forsake I not love bring we both to one end the punishment of cain await he that slew we the poet be strike dumb by this story he hang down he head and stand look on the ground so long that he guide ask he what be in he mind alas answer he such then be this love so full of sweet thought and such the pass to which it bring they oh francesca he cry turn again to the sad couple thy suffering make I weep but tell I i pray thee what be it that first make thee know for a certainty that he love be return -- that thou couldst refuse he thine no longer there be not a greater sorrow answer she than call to mind happy moment in the midst of wretchedness -lrb- 13 -rrb- but since thy desire be so great to know we story to the root hear I tell it as well as i may for tear it chance one day that we sit read the tale of sir launcelot how love take he in thrall we be alone and have no suspicion often as we read we eye become suspend -lrb- 14 -rrb- and we change color but one passage alone it be that overcome we when we read how genevra smile and how the lover out of the depth of he love could not help kiss that smile he that be never more to be part from I kiss I himself on the mouth all in a tremble never have we go-between but that book the writer be the betrayer that day we read no more while these word be be utter by one of the spirit the other wail so bitterly that the poet think he should have die for pity he sens forsake he and he fall flat on the ground as a dead body fall -lrb- 15 -rrb- on regain he sens the poet find himself in the third circle of hell a place of everlasting wet darkness and cold one heavy slush of hail and mud emit a squalid smell the triple-headed dog cerberus with red eye and greasy black beard large belly and hand with claw bark above the head of the wretch who flounder in the mud tear skinning and dismember they as they turn they sore and soddened body from side to side when he see the two live man he show he fang and shake in every limb for desire of they flesh virgil throw lump of dirt into he mouth and so they pass he it be the place of glutton the traveller pass over they as if they have be ground to walk upon but one of they sit up and address the florentine as he acquaintance dante do not know he for the agony in he countenance he be a man nickname hog -lrb- ciacco -rrb- and by no other name do the poet or any one else mention he he countryman address he by it though declare at the same time that he weep to see he hog prophesy evil to he discordant native city add that there be but two just man in it -- all the rest be give up to avarice envy and pride dante inquire by name respect the fate of five other florentine _ who have do good _ and be inform that they be all for various offence _ in lower gulf of hell _ hog then beg that he would mention have see he when he return to the sweet world and so look at he a little bent he head and disappear among he blinded companion satan hoa satan roar the demon plutus as the poet be descend into the fourth circle peace cry virgil with thy swollen lip thou accursed wolf no one can hinder he come down god will it -lrb- 16 -rrb- flat fall plutus collapse like the sail of a vessel when the mast be split this circle be the most populous one they have yet come to the sufferer gifted with supernatural might keep eternally rolling round it one against another with terrific violence and so dashing apart and return why grasp cry the one -- why throw away cry the other and thus exclaim they dash furiously together they be the avaricious and the prodigal multitude of they be churchman include cardinal and pope not all the gold beneath the moon could have purchase they a moment 's rest dante ask if none of they be to be recognize by they countenance virgil say no for the stupid and sullied life which they lead on earth sweep they face away from all distinction for ever in discoursing of fortune they descend by the side of a torrent black as ink into the fifth circle or place of torment for the angry the sullen and the proud here they first behold a filthy marsh full of dirty naked body that in everlasting rage tear one another to piece in a quieter division of the pool be see nothing but bubble carry by the ascent from its slimy bottom of the stifled word of the sullen they be always say we be sad and dark within we in the midst of the sweet sunshine and now we live sadly in the dark bog the poet walk on till they come to the foot of a tower which hang out two blaze signal to another just discernible in the distance a boat come rapidly towards they ferry by the wrathful phlegya -lrb- 17 -rrb- who cry out aha felon and so thou hast come at last thou errest say virgil we come for no longer time than it will take thee to ferry we across thy pool phlegya look like one defraud of he right but proceed to convey they during they course a spirit rise out of the mire look dante in the face and say who art thou that comest before thy time who art thou say dante thou seest who i be answer the other one among the mourner then mourn still and howl accursed spirit return the florentine i know thee all over filth as thou art the wretch in fury lay hold of the boat but virgil thrust he back exclaim down with thee down among the other dog then turn to dante he embrace and kiss he say o soul that know how to disdain bless be she that bear thee arrogant truly upon earth be this sinner nor be he memory grace by a single virtue hence the furiousness of he spirit now how many king be there at this moment lord it as god who shall wallow here as he do like swine in the mud and be think no better of by the world i should like to see he smother in it say dante before we go a right wish say virgil and thou shalt to thy heart 's content on a sudden the wretch 's muddy companion seize and drench he so horribly that -lrb- exclaim dante -rrb- i laud and thank god for it now at this moment have at he cry they have at filippo argentus and the wild fool of a florentine dash he tooth for rage into he own flesh -lrb- 18 -rrb- the poet 's attention be now draw off by a noise of lamentation and he perceive that he be approach the city of di -lrb- 19 -rrb- the turret glow vermilion with the fire within it the wall appear to be of iron and moat be round about they the boat circuit the wall till the traveller come to a gate which phlegya with a loud voice tell they to quit the boat and enter but a thousand fall angel crowd over the top of the gate refuse to open it and make furious gesture at length they agree to let virgil speak with they inside and he leave dante for a while standing in terror without the parley be in vain they would not let they pass virgil however bid he companion be of good cheer and then stand listen and talk to himself disclose by he word he expectation of some extraordinary assistance and at the same time he anxiety for its arrival on a sudden three rage figure arise over the gate color with gore green hydra twist about they and they fierce temple have snake instead of hair look say virgil the fury the one on the left be megæra alecto be she that be wail on the right and in the middle be tisiphone virgil then hush the fury stand claw they breast smite they hand together and raise such hideous cry that dante clung to he friend bring the gorgon 's head cry the fury look down turn he to adamant turn round say virgil and hide thy face for if thou beholdest the gorgon never again wilt thou see the light of day and with these word he seize dante and turn he round himself clap he hand over he companion 's eye and now be hear come over the water a terrible crash noise that make the bank on either side of it tremble it be like a hurricane which come roar through the vain shelter of the wood splitting and hurl away the bough sweep along proudly in a huge cloud of dust and make herd and herdsman fly before it now stretch you eyesight across the water say virgil let loose he hand -- there where the smoke of the foam be thickest dante look and see a thousand of the rebel angel like frog before a serpent sweep away into a heap before the come of a single spirit who fly over the top of the billow with unwet foot the spirit frequently push the gross air from before he face as if tire of the base obstacle and as he come nearer dante who see it be a messenger from heaven look anxiously at virgil virgil motion he to be silent and bow down the angel with a face full of scorn as soon as he arrive at the gate touch it with a wand that he have in he hand and it fly open outcast of heaven say he despicable race whence this fantastical arrogance do ye forget that you torment be lay oil thicker every time ye kick against the fate do ye forget how you cerberus be bind and chained till he lose the hair off he neck like a common dog so say he turn swiftly and depart the way he come not address a word to the traveller he countenance have suddenly a look of some other business totally different from the one he have terminate the companion pass in and behold a place full of tomb red-hot it be the region of arch heretic and they follower dante and he guide pass round betwixt the wall and the sepulchre as in a churchyard and come to the quarter which hold epicurus and he sect who deny the existence of spirit apart from matter the lid of the tomb remain unclosed till the day of judgment the soul of a noble florentine farina deglus uberti hear dante speak address he as a countryman ask he to stop -lrb- 20 -rrb- dante alarmed behold he rise half out of he sepulchre look as lofty as if he scorn hell itself find who dante be he boast of have three time expel the guelph perhaps so say the poet but they come back again each time a art which they enemy have not yet acquire a visage then appear from out another tomb look eagerly as if it expect to see some one else be disappoint the tear come into its eye and the sufferer say if it be thy genius that conduct thee hither where be my son and why be he not with thee it be not my genius that conduct I say dante but that of one whom perhaps thy son hold in contempt how sayest thou cry the shade -- _ hold _ in contempt he be dead then he behold no longer the sweet light and with these word he drop into he tomb and be see no more it be cavalcante cavalcantus the father of the poet 's friend guido -lrb- 21 -rrb- the shade of farina who have meantime be look on now reply to the taunt of dante prophesy that he should soon have good reason to know that the art he speak of _ have _ be acquire upon which dante speaking with more considerateness to the lofty sufferer request to know how the gift of prophecy could belong to spirit who be ignorant of the time present farina answer that so it be just as there be a kind of eyesight which could discern thing at a distance though not at hand dante then express he remorse at not have inform cavalcante that he son be alive he say it be owe to he be overwhelm with think on the subject he have just mention and entreat farina to tell he so quit this part of the cemetery virgil lead he through the midst of it towards a descent into a valley from which there ascend a loathsome odour they stand behind one of the tomb for a while to accustom themselves to the breath of it and then begin to descend a wild fissure in a rock near the mouth of which lay the infamy of crete the minotaur the monster behold they gnaw himself for rage and on they persist to advance begin plunge like a bull when he be stricken by the knife of the butcher they succeed however in enter the fissure before he recover sufficiently from he madness to run at they and at the foot of the descent come to a river of boiling blood on the strand of which run thousand of centaur arm with bow and arrow in the blood more or less deep accord to the amount of the crime and shriek as they boil be the soul of the inflicter of violence and if any of they emerge from it higher than he have a right to do the centaur drive he down with they arrow nessus the one that bequeath hercule the poison garment come gallop towards the pilgrim bend he bow and call out from a distance to know who they be but virgil disdain he hasty character would explain himself only to chiron the centaur who instruct achille chiron in consequence bid nessus accompany they along the river and there they see tyrant immerse up to the eyebrow -- alexander the great among they dionysius of syracuse and ezzelino the paduan there be one of the pazzus of florence and rinierus of corneto -lrb- infestor of the public way -rrb- now shed bloody tear and attilum the scourge and pyrrhus king of epirus further on among those immerse up to the throat be guy de montfort the englishman who slew he father 's slayer prince henry during divine service in the bosom of god and then by degree the river become shallower and shallower till it cover only the foot and here the centaur quit the pilgrim and they cross over into a forest the forest be a trackless and dreadful forest -- the leave not green but black -- the bough not freely grow but knot and twist -- the fruit no fruit but thorny poison the harpy wail among the tree occasionally show they human face and on every side of he dante hear lament human voice but could see no one from whom they come pluck one of the bough say virgil dante do so and blood and a cry follow it why pluckest thou I say the trunk man have we be like thyself but thou couldst not use we worse have we be serpent the blood and word come out together as a green bough hiss and spit in the fire the voice be that of piero delle vigne the good chancellor of the emperor frederick the second just though he have be to other he be thus torment for have be unjust to himself for envy have wrong he to he sovereign who sentence he to lose he eye he dash he brain out against a wall piero entreated dante to vindicate he memory the poet could not speak for pity so virgil make the promise for he inquire at the same time in what manner it be that suicide become thus identify with tree and how they soul be to rejoin they body at the day of judgment piero say that the moment the fierce self-murderer 's spirit tear itself from the body and pass before charon it fall like a grain of corn into that wood and so grow into a tree the harpy then feed on its leaf cause both pain and a vent for lamentation the body it would never again enter have thus cast away itself but it would finally drag the body down to it by a violent attraction and every suicide 's carcass will be hang upon the thorn of its wretched shade the naked soul of two man whose profusion have bring they to a violent end here come run through the wood from the fang of black female mastiff 's -- leave that of a suicide to mourn the havoc which they passage have make of he tree he beg he countryman to gather he leaf up and lay they at the foot of he trunk and dante do so and then he and virgil proceed on they journey they issue from the wood on a barren sand flame hot on which multitude of naked soul lay down or sit huddle up or restlessly walk about try to throw from they incessant flake of fire which come down like a fall of snow they be the soul of the impious among they be a great spirit who lay scornfully submit himself to the fiery shower as though it have not yet ripen he -lrb- 22 -rrb- overhear dante ask he guide who he be he answer for himself and say the same dead as live jove will tire he flame out before they conquer I capaneus exclaimed virgil thy pride be thy punishment no martyrdom be sufficient for thee equal to thine own rage the besieger of thebe make no reply in another quarter of the fiery shower the pilgrim meet a crowd of florentine mostly churchmen whose offence be not to be name after which they behold usurer and then arrive at a huge waterfall which fall into the eighth circle or that of the fraudulent here virgil by way of bait to the monster geryon or fraud let down over the side of the waterfall the cord of st franci which dante wear about he waist -lrb- 23 -rrb- and presently the dreadful creature come up and sate on the margin of the fall with he serpent 's tail hang behind he in the air after the manner of a beaver but the point of the tail be occasionally see glance upward he be a gigantic reptile with the face of a just man very mild he have shaggy claw for arm and a body variegate all over with color that run in knot and circle each within the other richer than any eastern drapery virgil speak apart to he and then mount on he back bidding he companion who be speechless for terror do the salve geryon push back with they from the edge of the precipice like a ship leave harbor and then turn about wheel like a sullen successless falcon slowly down through the air in many a circuit dante would not have know that he be go downward but for the air that strike up ward on he face presently they hear the crash of the waterfall on the circle below and then distinguish flaming fire and the noise of suffer the monster geryon ever sullen as the falcon who seat himself at a distance from he dissatisfied master shake he rider from off he back to the water 's side and then shoot away like a arrow this eighth circle of hell be call evil-budget -lrb- 24 -rrb- and consist of ten compartment or gulf of torment cross and connect with one another by bridge of flint in the first be beheld pimp and seducer scourge like child by horn devil in the second flatterer begrime with ordure in the third simonist who be stick like plug into circular aperture with they head downward and they leg only discernible the sole of they foot glowing with a fire which make they incessantly quiver dante go down the side of the gulf with virgil be allow to address one of they who seem in greater agony than the rest and do so the sufferer cry out in a malignant rapture aha be it thou that standest there boniface -lrb- 25 -rrb- thou hast come sooner than it be prophesy it be the soul of pope nichola the third that speak dante undeceived and then sternly rebuke he for he avarice and depravity tell he that nothing but reverence for the key of st peter hinder he from use harsher word and that it be such as he that the evangelist beheld in the vision when he see the woman with seven head and ten horn who commit whoredom with the king of the earth o constantine exclaim the poet of what a world of evil be that dowry the mother which first convert the pastor of the church into a rich man -lrb- 26 -rrb- the foot of the guilty pope spin with fiercer agony at these word and virgil look pleased on dante return with he the way he come till they find themselves on the margin of the fourth gulf the habitation of the soul of false prophet it be a valley in which the soul come walk along silent and weep at the pace of chorister who chant litany they face be turn the wrong way so that the back of they head come foremost and they tear fall on they loin dante be so overcome at the sight that he lean against a rock and weep but virgil rebuke he tell he that no pity at all be the only pity fit for that place -lrb- 27 -rrb- there be amphiaraus whom the earth open and swallow up at thebe and tiresia who be transform from sex to sex and arun who live in a cavern on the side of the marble mountain of carrara look out on the star and ocean and manto daughter of tiresia -lrb- she hind tress over she bosom -rrb- who wander through the world till she come and live in the solitary fen whence afterwards arise the city of mantua and michael scot the magician with he slender loin -lrb- 28 -rrb- and

astrologer of forlus and ardente shoemaker of parma who now wish he have stick to he last and the wretched woman who quit the needle and the distaff to wreak they malice with herb and image such be the punishment of those who desire to see too far before they now look only behind they and walk the reverse way of they look the fifth gulf be a lake of boiling pitch constantly heave and subside throughout and bubble with the breath of those within it they be public peculator wing black devil be busy about the lake prong the sinner when they occasionally dart up they back for relief like dolphin or thrust out they jaw like frog dante at first look eagerly down into the gulf like one who feel that he shall turn away instantly out of the very horror that attract he see -- look behind thee say virgil drag he at the same time from the place where he stand to a covert behind a crag dante look round and behold a devil come up with a newly-arrived sinner across he shoulder whom he hurl into the lake and then dash down after he like a mastiff let loose on a thief it be a man from lucca where every soul be a false dealer except bonturo -lrb- 29 -rrb- the devil call out to other devil and a heap of they fall upon the wretch with hook as he rise to the surface tell he that he must practice there in secret if he practice at all and thrust he back into the boiling pitch as cook thrust back flesh into the pot the devil be of the lowest and most revolting habit of which they make disgusting jest and parade some of they on a sudden perceive dante and he guide and be go to seize they when virgil resort to he usual holy rebuke for a while they let he alone and dante see one of they haul a sinner out of the pitch by the clotted lock and hold he up sprawl like a otter the rest then fall upon he and flay he it be ciampolo a peculator in the service of the good thiebault king of navarre one of he companion under the pitch be friar gomita governor of gallura and another michael zanche also a sardinian ciampolo ultimately escape by a trick out of the hand of the devil who be so enraged that they turn upon the two pilgrim but virgil catch up dante with supernatural force as a mother do a child in a burning house plunge with he out of they jurisdiction into the border of gulf the sixth the region of hypocrite the hypocrite in perpetual tear walk about in a wearisome and exhaust manner as if ready to faint they wear huge cowl which hang over they eye and the outside of which be gilded but the inside of lead two of they have be ruler of florence and dante be listen to they story when he attention be call off by the sight of a cross on which caiapha the high priest be writhe breathing hard all the while through he beard with sigh it be he office to see that every soul which pass he on its arrival in the place be oppress with the due weight he father-in-law anna and all he council be stick in like manner on cross round the border of the gulf the pilgrim behold little else in this region of weariness and soon pass into the border of one of the most terrible portion of evil-budget the land of the transformation of robber the place be throng with serpent of the most appalling and unwonted description among which run torment the naked spirit of the robber agonise with fear they hand be bind behind they with serpent -- they body pierce and enfold with serpent dante see one of the monster leap up and transfix a man through the nape of the neck when lo sooner than a pen could write _ o _ or _ i _ the sufferer burst into flame burn up fall to the earth a heap of ash -- be again bring together and again become a man aghast with he agony and stare about he sigh -lrb- 30 -rrb- virgil ask he who he be i be but lately rain down into this dire gullet say the man amidst a shower of tuscan the beast vannus fuccus be i who lead a brutal life like the mule that i be in that den pistoium compel he to stop say dante and relate what bring he hither i know the bloody and choleric wretch when he be alive the sinner who do not pretend to be deaf to these word turn round to the speaker with the most painful shame in he face and say i feel more bitterly at be catch here by thee in this condition than when i first arrive a power which i can not resist compel I to let thee know that i be here because i commit sacrilege and charge another with the crime but now mark I that thou mayest hear something not to render this encounter so pleasant : pistoium hate thy party of the whites and long for the black back again it will have they and so will florence and there will be a bloody cloud shall burst over the battlefield of piceno which will dash many whites to the earth i tell thee this to make thee miserable so say the wretch give a gesture of contempt with he thumb and finger towards heaven and say take it god -- a fig for thee -lrb- 31 -rrb- from that instant say dante the serpent and i be friend for one of they throttle he into silence and another dash he hand into a knot behind he back o pistoium pistoium why art not thou thyself turn into ash and sweep from the face of the earth since thy race have surpass in evil thine ancestor never through the whole darkness of hell beheld i a blasphemer so dire as this -- not even capaneus himself the pistoian flee away with the serpent upon he follow by a centaur who come madly gallop up cry where be the caitiff it be the monster-thief cacus whose den upon earth often have a pond of blood before it and to whom hercule in he rage when he slew he give a whole hundred blow with he club though the wretch perceive nothing after the ninth he be all over adder up to the mouth and upon he shoulder lay a dragon with its wing open breathing fire on whomsoever it meet the centaur tear away and dante and virgil be gaze after he when they hear voice beneath the bank on which they stand cry who be ye the pilgrim turn they eye downward and behold three spirit one of whom look about he say where 's cianfa dante make a sign to virgil to say nothing cianfa come forth a man lately but now a serpent with six foot -lrb- 32 -rrb- if thou art slow to believe reader what i be about to tell thee say the poet be so it be no marvel for i myself even now scarcely credit what i beheld the six-footed serpent spring at one of the three man front to front clasp he tightly with all its leg and plunge he fang into either cheek ivy never stick so close to a tree as the horrible monster grapple with every limb of that pinioned man the two form then gradually mingle into one another like melting wax the color of they skin give way at the same time to a third color as the white in a piece of burn paper recede before the brown till it all become black the other two human shape look on exclaim oh how thou changest agnello see thou art neither two nor yet one and truly though the two head first become one there still remain two countenance in the face the four arm then become but two and such also become the leg and thigh and the two trunk become such a body as be never behold and the hideous twofold monster walk slowly away -lrb- 33 -rrb- a small black serpent on fire now flash like lightning on to the body of one of the other two pierce he in the navel and then fall on the ground and lie stretch before he the wounded man fascinate and mute stand look at the adder 's eye and endeavor to stand steady on he leg yawn the while as if smite with lethargy or fever the adder on he part look up at the eye of the man and both of they breathe hard and send forth a smoke that mingle into one volume and now let lucan never speak more of the wretched sabellus or nisidius but listen and be silent and now let ovid be silent nor speak again of he serpent that be cadmus or he fountain that be arethusa for say the tuscan poet i envy he not never do he change the nature of two creature face to face so that each receive the form of the other with corresponding impulse the serpent split he train into a fork while the man draw he leg together into a train the skin of the serpent grow soft while the man 's harden the serpent acquire tress of hair the man grow hairless the claw of the one project into leg while the arm of the other withdraw into he shoulder the face of the serpent as it rise from the ground retreat towards the temple push out human ear that of the man as he fall to the ground thrust itself forth into a muzzle withdraw at the same time its ear into its head as the slug do its horn and each creature keep its impious eye fix on the other 's while the feature beneath the eye be change the soul which have become the serpent then turn to crawl away hiss in scorn as he depart and the serpent which have become the man spat after he and speak word at he the new human-looking soul then turn he back on he late adversary and say to the third spirit who remain unchanged let buoso now take to he crawl as i have do the two then hasten away together leave dante in a state of bewildered amazement yet not so confused but that he recognize the unchanged one for another of he countryman puccio the lame joy to thee florence cry the poet not content with have thy name bruit over land and sea it flourish throughout hell the pilgrim now quit the seventh and look down from its barrier into the eighth gulf where they see innumerable flame distinct from one another flicker all over the place like fire-fly in those flame say virgil be soul each torment with the fire that swathe it i observe one say dante divide at the summit be the theban brother in it no reply virgil in that flame be diom and ulyss the sinner punish in this gulf be evil counsellor and those two be the adviser of the stratagem of the trojan horse virgil address ulyss who tell he the conclusion of he adventure not to be find in book : how he tire of a idle life and sail forth again into the wide ocean and how he sail so far that he come into a region of new star and in sight of a mountain the loftiest he ever see when unfortunately a hurricane fall upon they from the shore thrice whirl they vessel round then dash the stern up in air and the prow under water and send the billow over they head enough say virgil i trouble thee no more the soul of guido di montefeltro overhear the great mantuan speak in a lombard dialect ask he news of the state of thing in romagna and then tell he how he have lose he chance of paradise by think pope boniface could at once absolve he from he sin and use they for he purpose -lrb- 34 -rrb- he be go to heaven he say by the help of st franci who come on purpose to fetch he when a black angel meet they and demand he absolved indeed but unrepented victim to repent evil and to will to do it at one and the same time be say the dreadful angel impossible : therefore wrong I not oh how i shake say the unhappy guido when he lay he hand upon I and with these word the flame writhe and beat itself about for agony and so take its way the pilgrim cross over to the bank of the ninth gulf where the sower of scandal the schismatic heretic and founder of false religion undergo the penalty of such as load themselves with the sin of those whom they seduce the first sight they behold be mahomet tear open he own bowels and call out to they to mark he before he walk he son-in-law alus weep and cloven to the chin and the division in the church be punish in like manner upon all the schismatic in the place they all walk round the circle they gash close as they go and on they reach a certain point a fiend hew they open again with a sword the arabian prophet ere he pass on bade the pilgrim warn friar dolcino how he suffer himself to be surprise in he mountain-hold by the starvation of winter-time if he do not wish speedily to follow he -lrb- 35 -rrb- among other mangled wretch they behold piero of medicina a sower of dissension exhibit to they he face and throat all over wound and curio compel to shew he tongue cut out for advise cæsar to cross the rubicon and mosca de ' lamberti a adviser of assassination and one of the author of the guelf and ghibelline misery hold up the bleeding stump of he arm which drip on he face remember mosca cry he remember he alas who say ' a deed do be a thing end ' a bad saying of mine be that for the tuscan nation and death to thy family cry dante the assassin hurry away like a man drive mad with grief upon grief and dante now behold a sight which if it be not he say for the testimony of a good conscience -- that best of friend which give a man assurance of himself under the breastplate of a spotless innocence -lrb- 36 -rrb- -- he should be afraid to relate without further proof he see -- and while he be write the account of it he still appear to see -- a headless trunk about to come past he with the other it hold its sever head by the hair like a lantern and the head look up at the two pilgrim and say woe be I the head be in fact a lantern to the path of the trunk and thus there be two separated thing in one and one in two and how that could be he only can tell who ordain it as the figure come nearer it lift the head aloft that the pilgrim might hear better what it say behold it say behold thou that walkest living among the dead and say if there be any punishment like this i be bertrand de bear he that incite john of england to rebel against he father father and son i set at variance -- closest affection i set at variance -- and hence do i bear my brain sever from the body on which it grow in I behold the work of retribution -lrb- 37 -rrb- the eye of dante be so inebriate with all that diversity of bleed wound that they long to stay and weep ere he guide proceed further something also strike they on the sudden which add to he desire to stop but virgil ask what ail he and why he stand gaze still on the wretched multitude thou hast not do so continue he in any other portion of this circle and the valley be twenty-two mile further about and the moon already below we thou hast more yet to see than thou wottest of and the time be short dante excuse himself for the delay and proceed to follow he leader say he think he have see in the cavern at which he be gaze so hard a spirit that be one of he own family -- and it be so it be the soul of gerus del bello a cousin of the poet 's virgil say that he have observe he while dante be occupy with bertrand de bear point at he kinsman in a threatening manner waste not a think on he conclude the roman but leave he as he be o honor guide say dante he die a violent death which he kinsman have not yet avenge and hence it be that he disdain to speak to I and i must need feel for he the more on that account -lrb- 38 -rrb- they come now to the last partition of the circle of evil-budget and they ear be assail with such a burst of sharp wailing that dante be fain to close he with he hand the misery there accompany by a horrible odour be as if all the hospital in the sultry marsh of valdichiana have bring they malady together into one infernal ditch it be the place of punishment for pretended alchemist coiner personator of other people false accuser and impostor of all such description they lay on one another in heap or attempt to crawl about -- some itch madly with leprosy -- some swollen and gasp with dropsy -- some wetly reek like hand wash in winter-time one be a alchemist of sienna a nation vainer than the french another a florentine who trick a man into make a wrong will another sinon of troy another myrrha another the wife of potiphar they misery do not hinder they from give one another malignant blow and dante be listen eagerly to a abusive conversation between sinon and a brescian coiner when virgil rebuke he for the disgraceful condescension and say it be a pleasure fit only for vulgar mind -lrb- 39 -rrb- the blush poet feel the reproof so deeply that he could not speak for shame though he manifest by he demeanor that he long to do so and thus obtain the pardon he despair of he say he feel like a man that during a unhappy dream wish himself dream while he be so and do not know it virgil understand he emotion and as achille do with he spear heal the wound with the tongue that inflict it a silence now ensue between the companion for they have quit evil-budget and arrive at the ninth great circle of hell on the mound of which they pass along look quietly and steadily before they daylight have give place to twilight and dante be advance he head a little and endeavor to discern object in the distance when he whole attention be call to one particular spot by a blast of a horn so loud that a thunder clap be a whisper in comparison orlando himself blow no such terrific blast after the dolorous rout when charlemagne be defeat in he holy enterprise -lrb- 40 -rrb- the poet raise he head think he perceive a multitude of lofty tower he ask virgil to what region they belong but virgil say those be no tower : they be giant stand each up to he middle in the pit that go round this circle dante look harder and as object clear up by little and little in the depart mist he see with alarm the tremendous giant that war against jove standing half in and half out of the pit like the tower that crown the citadel of monteseggione the one whom he see plainest and who stand with he arm hang down on each side appear to he to have a face as huge as the pinnacle of st peter 's and limb throughout in proportion the monster as the pilgrim be go by open he dreadful mouth fit for no sweeter psalmody and call after they in the word of some unknown tongue _ rafel maee amech zabee almee _ -lrb- 41 -rrb- dull wretch exclaim virgil keep to thine horn and so vent better whatsoever frenzy or other passion stuff thee feel the chain round thy throat thou confusion see what a clench hoop be about thy gorge then he say to dante he howl be its own mockery this be nimrod he through whose evil ambition it be that mankind cease to speak one language pass he and say nothing for every other tongue be to he as he be to thee the companion go on for about the length of a sling 's throw when they pass the second giant who be much fiercer and linger than nimrod he be fetter round and round with chain that fix one arm before he and the other behind he -- ephialte he name the same that would need make trial of he strength against jove himself the hand which he then wield be now motionless but he shake with passion and dante thought he should have die for terror the effect on the ground about he be so fearful it surpass that of a tower shake by a earthquake the poet express a wish to look at briareus but he be too far off he see however antæus who not have fight against heaven be neither tongue-confounded nor shackled and virgil request the taker of a thousand lion by the fame which the living poet have it in he power to give he to bear the traveller in he arm down the steep descent into this deeper portion of hell which be the region of torment cold antmus stoop like the lean tower of bologna to take they up gather they in he arm and deposit they in the gulf below raise himself to depart like the mast of a ship -lrb- 42 -rrb- have i hoarse and rugged word equal to my subject say the poet i would now make they fuller of expression to suit the rocky horror of this hole of anguish but i have not and therefore approach it with fear since it be no jest enterprise to describe the depths of the universe nor fit for a tongue that babble of father and mother -lrb- 43 -rrb- let such of the muse assist I as turn the word of amphion into theban wall so shall the speech be not too far different from the matter oh ill-starred creature wretched beyond all other to inhabit a place so hard to speak of -- better have ye be sheep or goat the poet be begin to walk with he guide along the place in which the giant have set they down and be still look up at the height from which he have descend when a voice close to he say have a care where thou treadest hurt not with thy foot the head of thy unhappy brethren dante look down and before he and see that he be walk on a lake of ice in which be murderous traitor up to they chin they tooth chatter they face hold down they eye lock up freeze with tear dante see two at he foot so closely stick together that the very hair of they head be mingle he ask they who they be and as they lift up they head for astonishment and feel the cold doubly congeal they they dash they head against one another for hate and fury they be two brother who have murder each other -lrb- 44 -rrb- near they be other tuscan one of whom the cold have deprive of he ear and thousand more be see grin like dog for the pain dante as he go along _ kick _ the face of one of they whether by chance or fate or _ will _ -lrb- 45 -rrb- he could not say the sufferer burst into tear and cry out wherefore dost thou torment I art thou come to revenge the defeat at montaperto the pilgrim at this question feel eager to know who he be but the unhappy wretch would not tell he countryman seize he by the hair to force he but still he say he would not tell be he to be scalp a thousand time dante upon this begin pluck up he hair by the root the man _ bark _ -lrb- 46 -rrb- with he eye squeeze up at every pull when another soul exclaim why bocca what the devil ail thee must thou need bark for cold as well as chatter -lrb- 47 -rrb- now accursed traitor betrayer of thy country 's standard say dante be dumb if thou wilt for i shall tell thy name to the world tell and begone say bocca but carry the name of this babbler with thee ` tis buoso who leave the pass open to the enemy between piedmont and parma and near he be the traitor for the pope beccarium and ganellone who betray charlemagne and tribaldello who open faenza to the enemy at night-time the pilgrim go on and behold two other spirit so closely lock up together in one hole of the ice that the head of one be right over the other 's like a cowl and dante to he horror see that the upper head be devour the lower with all the eagerness of a man who be famish the poet ask what could possibly make he skew a hate so brutal add that if there be any ground for it he would tell the story to the world -lrb- 48 -rrb- the sinner raise he head from the dire repast and after wipe he jaw with the hair of it say you ask a thing which it shake I to the heart to think of it be a story to renew all my misery but since it will produce this wretch he due infamy hear it and you shall see I speak and weep at the same time how thou tamest hither i know not but i perceive by thy speech that thou art florentine learn then that i be the count ugolino and this man be ruggieri the archbishop how i trust he and be betray into prison there be no need to relate but of he treatment of I there and how cruel a death i undergo bear and then judge if he have offend I i have be imprison with my child a long time in the tower which have since be call from I the tower of famine and many a new moon have i see through the hole that serve we for a window when i dream a dream that foreshadow to I what be come methought that this man head a great chase against the wolf in the mountain between pisa and lucca among the foremost in he party be gualandus sismondus and lanfranchus and the hound be thin and eager and high-bred and in a little while i see the hound fasten on the flank of the wolf and the wolf 's child and tear they at that moment i awake with the voice of my own child in my ear ask for bread truly cruel must thou be if thy heart do not ache to think of what i think then if thou feel not for a pang like that what be it for which thou art accustom to feel we be now all awake and the time be at hand when they bring we bread and we have all dream dream which make we anxious at that moment i hear the key of the horrible tower turn in the lock of the door below and fasten it i look at my child and say not a word i do not weep i make a strong effort upon the soul within I but my little anselm say ` father why do you look so be any thing the matter ' nevertheless i do not weep nor say a word all the day nor the night that follow in the morning a ray of light fall upon we through the window of we sad prison and i beheld in those four little face the likeness of my own face and then i begin to gnaw my hand for misery my child think i do it for hunger raise themselves on the floor and say ` father we should be less miserable if you would eat we own flesh it be you that give it we take it again ' then i sit still in order not to make they unhappier : and that day and the next we all remain without speak on the fourth day gaddo stretch himself at my foot and say ` father why will not you help I ' and there he die and as surely as thou lookest on I so surely i beheld the whole three die in the same manner so i begin in my misery to grope about in the dark for they for i have become blind and three day i keep call on they by name though they be dead till famine do for I what grief have be unable to do with these word the miserable man he eye start from he head seize that other wretch again with he tooth and ground they against the skull as a dog do with a bone o pisa scandal of the nation since thy neighbor be so slow to punish thee may the very island tear themselves up from they root in the sea and come and block up the mouth of thy river and drown every soul within thee what if this count ugolino do as report say he do betray thy castle to the enemy he child have not betray they nor ought they to have be put to a agony like this they age be they innocence and they death have give thee the infamy of a second thebe -lrb- 49 -rrb- the pilgrim pass on and behold other traitor freeze up in swath of ice with they head upside down they very tear have hinder they from shed more for they eye be encrust with the first they shed so as to be enclose with they as in a crystal visor which force back the other into a accumulation of anguish one of the sufferer beg dante to relieve he of this ice in order that he might vent a little of the burden which it repress the poet say he would do so provide he would disclose who he be the man say he be the friar alberigo who invite some of he brotherhood to a banquet in order to slay they what exclaim dante art thou no longer then among the living perhaps i appear to be answer the friar for the moment any one commit a treachery like mine he soul give up he body to a demon who thenceforward inhabit it in the man 's likeness thou knowest branca dorium who murder he father-in-law zanche he seem to be walk the earth still and yet he have be in this place many year -lrb- 50 -rrb- impossible cry dante branca dorium be still alive he eat drink and sleep like any other man i tell thee return the friar that the soul of the man he slew have not reach that lake of boiling pitch in which thou sawest he ere the soul of he slayer be in this place and he body occupy by a demon in its stead but now stretch forth thy hand and relieve mine eye dante relieved they not ill manners he say be the only courtesy fit for such a wretch -lrb- 51 -rrb- o ye genoese he exclaim -- man that be perversity all over and full of every corruption to the core why be ye not sweep from the face of the earth there be one of you whom you fancy to be walk about like other man and he be all the while in the lowest pit of hell look before thee say virgil as they advance : behold the banner of the king of hell dante look and behold something which appear like a windmill in motion as see from a distance on a dark night a wind of inconceivable sharpness come from it the soul of those who have be traitor to they benefactor be here freeze up in depths of pellucid ice where they be see in a variety of attitude motionless some upright some downward some bent double head to foot at length they come to where the be stand who be once eminent for all fair seeming -lrb- 52 -rrb- this be the figure that seem toss its arm at a distance like a windmill satan whisper virgil and put himself in front of dante to re-assure he halt he at the same time and bidding he summon all he fortitude dante stand benumbed though conscious as if he himself have be turn to ice he feel neither alive nor dead the lord of the dolorous empire each of he arm as big as a giant stand in the ice half-way up he breast he have one head but three face the middle vermilion the one over the right shoulder a pale yellow the other black he sail of wing huger than ever be behold at sea be in shape and texture those of a bat and with these be constantly flap so as to send forth the wind that freeze the depths of tartarus from he six eye the tear run down mingle at he three chin with bloody foam for at every mouth he crush a sinner with he tooth as substance be break up by a engine the middle sinner be the worst punish for he be at once break and flay and he head and trunk be inside the mouth it be judas iscariot of the other two whose head be hang out one be brutus and the other cassius cassius be very large-limbed brutus writhe with agony but utter not a word -lrb- 53 -rrb- night have return say virgil and all have be see it be time to depart onward dante then at he bidding clasp as virgil do the huge inattentive be round the neck and watch they opportunity as the wing open and shut they slip round it and so down he shaggy and frozen side from pile to pile clutch it as they go till suddenly with the greatest labor and pain they be compel to turn themselves upside down as it seem but in

il senso lor m ' è duro _ -rrb- be among the passage in dante which lead some critic to suppose that he hell be nothing but a allegory intend at once to imply he own disbelief in it as understand by the vulgar part of mankind and he employment of it nevertheless as a salutary check both to the foolish and the reflect -- to the foolish as a alarm and to the reflect as a parable it be possible in the tooth of many appearance to the contrary that such may have be the case but in the doubt that it affect either the foolish or the wise to any good purpose and in the certainty that such doctrine

so woful that at he remorse i feel as though i should have die i turn would stone-stiff and to the ground fall like a corse the poet fall thus on the ground -lrb- some of the commentator think -rrb- because he have sin in the same way and if foscolo 's opinion could be establish -- that the incident of the book be invention -- they conclusion would receive curious collateral evidence the circumstance of the perusal of the romance in company with a lady be likely enough to have occur to dante but the same probability apply in the case of the lover the reading of such book be equally the taste of they own time and nothing be more likely than the volume 's have be find in the room where they perish the pagan could not be rebel to a law they never hear of any more than dante could be a rebel to luther but this be one of the absurdity with which the impious effrontery or scarcely less impious admission of dante 's teacher avowedly set reason at defiance -- retain meanwhile they right of contempt for the impiety of mahometan and brahmin which be odd as the poet say for be not less absurd or as the other argue much more so they have at least a equal claim on the submission of

from the lip of a italian postilion than be probably utter in england by people not out of they sens for a whole year yet the word after all be mere word for the man be a good-natured fellow and i

pure be a tautology for dante himself have already use that word conscienzium m ` assicura la buona compagnia che l'uom francheggia sotto l'osbergo & c but still we feel the impulsive beauty of the

towards a man too suppose to be suffer eternally it be idle to discern in such barbarous inconsistency any thing but the writer 's own contribution to the stock of they the utmost credit for right feeling be not to be give on every occasion to a man who refuse it to every one else -rrb- -lrb- footnote 52 : la creatura ch ` ebbe il bel sembiante this be touching but the reader may as well be prepare for a total failure in dante 's conception of satan especially the english reader accustom to the sublimity of milton 's grant that the roman catholic poet intend to honor the fall angel with no sublimity but to render he a object of mere hate and dread he have overdo and degrade the picture into caricature a great stupid be stick up in ice with three face one of which be yellow and three

be a mountain at the antipode on the top of which be the terrestrial paradise once the seat of adam and eve it form the principal part of a island in a sea and possess a pure air its lowest region with one or two exception of redeem pagan be occupy by excommunicate penitent and by delayer of penitence all of whom be compel to lose time before they atonement commence the other and greater portion of the ascent be divide into circle or plain in which be expiate the seven deadly sin the poet ascend from circle to circle with virgil and statius and be meet in a forest on the top by the spirit of beatrice who transport he to heaven the journey through purgatory when the pilgrim emerge from the opening through which they behold the star they find themselves in a scene which enchant they with hope and joy it be dawn : a sweet pure air come on they face and they behold a sky of the loveliest oriental sapphire whose color seem to pervade the whole serene hollow from earth to heaven the beautiful planet which encourage loving thought make all the orient laugh obscure by its very radiance the star in its train and among those which be still linger and sparkling in the southern horizon dante saw four in the shape of a cross never behold by man since they gladden the eye of we first parent heaven seem to rejoice in they possession o widow northern pole bereaved art thou

beholder with a veneration like that of a son for he father he have gray hair and a long beard which part in two down he bosom and the four southern star beam on he face with such lustre that he aspect be as radiant as if he have stand in the sun who be ye say the old man that have escape from the dreadful prison-house can the law of the abyss be violate or have heaven change its mind that thus ye be allow to come from the region of condemnation into mine it be the spirit of cato of utica the warder of the ascent of purgatory the roman poet explain to he countryman who they be and how dante be under heavenly protection and then he pray leave of passage of he by the love he bear to the chaste eye of he marcium who send he a message from the pagan circle hope that he would still own she cato reply that although he be so fond of marcium while on earth that he could deny she nothing he have cease in obedience to new law to have any affection for she now that she dwell beyond the evil river but as the pilgrim he companion be under heavenly protection he would of course do what he desire -lrb- 2 -rrb- he then desire he to gird he companion with one of the simplest and completest rush he would see by the water 's side and to wash the stain of the lower world out of he face and so take they journey up the mountain before they by a path which the rise sun would disclose and with these word he disappear -lrb- 3 -rrb- the pilgrim pass on with the eagerness of one who think every step in vain till he find the path he have lose the full dawn by this time have arise and they see the tremble of the sea in the distance -lrb- 4 -rrb- virgil then dip he hand into a spot of dewy grass where the sun have least affected it and with the moisture bath the face of dante who hold it out to he suffuse with tear -lrb- 5 -rrb- and then they go on till they come to a solitary shore whence no voyager have ever return and there the loin of the florentine be gird with the rush on this shore they be stand in doubt how to proceed -- move onward as it be in mind while yet they foot be stay -- when they be hold a light over the water at a distance rayless at first as the planet mar when he look redly out of the horizon through a fog but speedily grow brighter and brighter with amazing swiftness dante have but turn for a instant to ask he guide what it be when on look again it have grow far brighter two splendid phenomenon he know not what then develop themselves from it on either side and by degree another below it the two splendor quickly turn out to be wing and virgil who have hitherto watch its come in silence cry out down down -- on thy knee it be god 's angel clasp thine hand now thou shalt behold operancy indeed lo how he need neither sail nor oar come all this way with nothing but he wing lo how he hold they aloft use the air with they at he will and know they can never be weary the divine bird grow brighter and brighter as he come so that the eye at last could not sustain the lustre and dante turn he to the ground a boat then rush to shore which the angel have bring with he so light that it draw not a drop of water the celestial pilot stand at the helm with bliss write in he face and a hundred spirit be see within the boat who lift up they voice sing the psalm beginning when israel come out of egypt at the close of the psalm the angel bless they with the sign of the cross and they all leap to shore upon which he turn round and depart as swiftly as he come the new-comer after gaze about they for a while in the manner of those who be astonish to see new sight inquire of virgil and he companion the best way to the mountain virgil explain who they be and the spirit pale with astonishment at behold in dante a living and breathing man crowd about he in spite of they anxiety to shorten the period of they trial one of they come dart out of the press to embrace he in a manner so affectionate as to move the poet to return he warmth but he arm again and again find themselves cross on he own bosom have encircle nothing the shadow smile at the astonishment in the other 's face draw back and dante hasten as much forward to shew he zeal in the greet when the spirit in a sweet voice recommend he to desist the florentine then know who it be -- casellum a musician to whom he have be much attach after mutual explanation as to they meeting dante request he friend if no ordinance oppose it to refresh he spirit awhile with one of the tender air that use to charm away all he trouble on earth casellum immediately begin one of he friend 's own production commence with the word love that delight to talk unto my soul of all the wonder of my lady 's nature and he sing it so beautifully that the sweetness ring within the poet 's heart while record the circumstance the other spirit listen with such attention that they seem to have forget the very purpose of they come when suddenly the voice of cato be hear sternly rebuke they delay and the whole party speed in trepidation towards the mountain -lrb- 6 -rrb- the two pilgrim who have at first hasten with the other in a little while slacken they step and dante find that he body project a shadow while the form of virgil have none when arrive at the foot of the mountain they be join by a second party of spirit of whom virgil inquire the way up it one of the spirit of a noble aspect but with a gaping wound in he forehead step forth and ask dante if he remember he the poet humbly answer in the negative the stranger disclose a second wound that be in he bosom and then with a smile announce himself as manfredus king of naple who be slay in battle against charle of anjou and die excommunicate manfredus give dante a message to he daughter costanza queen of arragon beg she to shorten the consequence of the excommunication by she prayer since he like the rest of the party with he though repent of he contumacy against the church would have to wander on the outskirts of purgatory three time as long as the presumption have last unless relieve by such petition from the living -lrb- 7 -rrb- dante go on with he thought so full of this request that he do not perceive he have arrive at the path which virgil ask for till the wander spirit call out to they to say so the pilgrim then with great difficulty begin to ascend through a extremely narrow passage and virgil after explain to dante how it be that in this antipodal region he eastward face behold the sun in the north instead of the south be encourage he to proceed manfully in the hope of find the path easier by degree and of repose at the end of it when they hear a voice observe that they would most likely find it expedient to repose a little sooner the pilgrim look about they and observe close at hand a crag of a rock in the shade of which some spirit be stand as man stand idly at noon another be sit down as if tire out with he arm about he knee and he face bent down between they -lrb- 8 -rrb- dearest master exclaim dante to he guide what thinkest thou of a croucher like this for manful journey verily he seem to have be twin-born with idleness herself the croucher lift up he eye at these word look hard at dante and say since thou art so stout push on dante then see it be belacqua a pleasant acquaintance of he famous for he indolence that be a good lesson say belacqua that be give thee just now in astronomy the poet could not help smile at the manner in which he acquaintance utter these word it be so like he way of old belacqua pretend even in another world that it be of no use to make haste since the angel have prohibit he go higher up the mountain he and he companion have to walk round the foot of it as many year as they have delay repent unless as in the case of manfredus they time be shorten by the prayer of good people a little further on the pilgrim encounter the spirit of such delayer of penitence as have die violent death repent at the last moment one of they buonconte da montefeltro who die in battle and whose body could not be find describe how the devil have be hinder from seize he by the shed of a single tear have raise in he fury a tremendous tempest which send the body down the river arno and bury it in the mud -lrb- 9 -rrb- another spirit a female say to dante ah when thou returnest to earth and shalt have rest from thy long journey remember I -- pium sienna give I life the marsh take it from I this he know who put on my finger the wedding-ring -lrb- 10 -rrb- the majority of this party be so importunate with the florentine to procure they the prayer of they friend that he have as much difficulty to get away as a winner at dice have to free himself from the mercenary congratulation of the by-stander on resume they way dante quote to virgil a passage in the æneid decry the utility of prayer and beg he to explain how it be to be reconcile with what they have just hear virgil advise he to wait for the explanation till he see beatrice whom he now say he should meet at the top of the mountain dante at this information express a desire to hasten they progress and virgil see a spirit look towards they as they advance request he to acquaint they with the shortest road the spirit maintain a lofty and reserved aspect be as silent as if he have not hear the request intimate by he manner that they might as well proceed without repeat it and eye they like a lion on the watch virgil however go up to he and gently urge it but the only reply be a question as to who they be and of what country the latin poet begin to answer he have scarcely mention the word mantua when the stranger go as eagerly up to he interrogator as the latter have do to he and say mantua my own country my name be sordello and the compatriot embrace o degenerate italy exclaim dante land without affection without principle without faith in any one good thing here be a man who could not hear the sweet sound of a fellow-citizen 's voice without feel he heart gush towards he and there be no people now in any one of thy town that do not hate and torment one another sordello in another tone now exclaim but who be ye virgil disclose himself and sordello fall at he foot -lrb- 11 -rrb- sordello now undertake to accompany the great roman poet and he friend to a certain distance on they ascent towards the penal quarter of the mountain but as evening be draw nigh and the ascent could not be make properly in the dark he propose that they should await the dawn of the next day in a recess that overlook a flowery hollow the hollow be a lovely spot of ground enamel with flower that surpass the exquisitest dye and green with a grass brighter than emerald newly break -lrb- 12 -rrb- there rise from it also a fragrance of a thousand different kind of sweetness all mingle into one that be new and indescribable and with the fragrance there ascend the chant of the prayer begin hail queen of heaven -lrb- 13 -rrb- which be sing by a multitude of soul that appear sit on the flowery sward virgil point they out they be penitent delayer of penitence of sovereign rank among they however be spirit who sit mute one of whom be the emperor rodolph

hour when the pilgrim new to he journey be thrill with the like tenderness when he hear the vesper-bell in the distance which seem to mourn for the expire day -lrb- 16 -rrb- at this hour of the come darkness dante behold one of the spirit in the flowery hollow arise and after give a signal to the other to do as he do stretch forth both hand palm to palm towards the east and with softest emotion commence the hymn begin thee before the closing light -lrb- 17 -rrb- upon which all the rest devoutly and softly follow he keep they eye fix on the heaven at the end of it they remain with pale countenance in a attitude of humble expectation and dante see the angel issue from the quarter to which they look and descend towards they with flame sword in they hand break short of the point they wing be as green as the leaf in spring and they wear garment equally green which the fanning of the wing keep in a state of streaming fluctuation behind they as they come one of they take he stand on a part of the hill just over where the pilgrim stand and the other on a hill opposite so that the party in the valley be between they dante could discern they head of hair notwithstanding its brightness but they face be so dazzling as to be undistinguishable they come from mary 's bosom whisper sordello to protect the valley from the design of we enemy yonder -- the serpent dante look in trepidation towards the only undefended side of the valley and behold the serpent of eve come softly among the grass and flower occasionally turn its head and lick its polish back before he could take off he eye from the evil thing the two angel have come down like falcon and at the whir of they pinion the serpent flee the angel return as swiftly to they station aurora be now look palely over the eastern cliff on the other side of the globe and the star of midnight shine over the head of dante and he friend when they seat themselves for rest on the mountain 's side the florentine be still in the flesh lay down for weariness and be overcome with sleep in he sleep he dream that a golden eagle flash down like lightning upon he and bear he up to the region of fire where the heat be so intense that it wake he stare and look round about with a pale face he dream be a shadow of the truth he have actually come to another place -- to the entrance of purgatory itself sordello have be leave behind virgil alone remain look he cheerfully in the face saint lucy have come from heaven and shorten the fatigue of he journey by carry he upwards as he sleep the heathen poet follow they on arrive where they stand the fair saint intimate the entrance of purgatory to virgil by a glance thither of she beautiful eye and then vanish as dante wake -lrb- 18 -rrb- the portal by which purgatory be enter be embed in a cliff it have three step each of a different color and on the highest of these there sit mute and watch a angel in ash-coloured garment hold a naked sword which glance with such intolerable brightness on dante whenever he attempt to look that he give up the endeavor the angel demand who they be and receive the right answer gently bid they advance dante now see that the lowest step be of marble so white and clear that he behold he face in it the color of the next be a deadly black and it be all rough scorched and full of crack the third be of flaming porphyry red as a man 's blood when it leap forth under the lancet -lrb- 19 -rrb- the angel whose foot be on the porphyry sit on a threshold which appear to be rock-diamond dante ascend the step with the encouragement of virgil fall at the angel 's foot and after thrice beating himself on the breast humbly ask admittance the angel with the point of he sword inscribe the first letter of the word _ peccatum _ -lrb- sin -rrb- seven time on the petitioner 's forehead then bid he pray with tear for they erasement and be cautious how he look back open the portal with a silver and a golden key -lrb- 20 -rrb- the hinge roar as they turn like thunder and the pilgrim on enter think they hear mingle with the sound a chorus of voice singing we praise thee o god -lrb- 21 -rrb- it be like the chant that mingle with a cathedral organ when the word that the chorister utter be at one moment to be distinguish and at another fade away the companion continue ascend till they reach a plain it stretch as far as the eye could see and be as lonely as road across desert this be the first flat or table-land of the ascend gradation of purgatory and the place of trial for the soul of the proud it be border with a mound or natural wall of white marble sculpture all over with story of humility dante beheld among they the annunciation represent with so much life that the sweet action of the angel seem to be utter the very word hail and the submissive spirit of the virgin to be no less impressed like very wax in she demeanor the next story be that of david dancing and harping before the ark -- a action in which he seem both less and greater than a king michal be look out upon he from a window like a lady full of scorn and sorrow next to the story of david be that of the emperor trajan when he do a thing so glorious as move st gregory to gain the greatest of all he conquest -- the deliver of the emperor 's soul from hell a widow in tear and mourning be lay hold of he bridle as he ride amidst he court with a noise of horse and horseman while the roman eagle float in gold over he head the miserable creature speak out loudly among they all cry for vengeance on the murderer of she son the emperor seem to say wait till i return but she in the hastiness of she misery say suppose thou returnest not then my successor will attend to thee reply the emperor and what hast thou to do with the duty of another man cry she if thou attendest not to thine own now be of good comfort conclude trajan for verily my duty shall be do before i go justice will it and pity arrest I dante be proceed to delight himself further with these sculpture when virgil whisper hint to look round and see what be come he do so and beheld strange figure advance the nature of which he could not make out at first for they seem neither human nor aught else which he could call to mind they be soul of the proud bent double under enormous burden o proud miserable woe-begone christian exclaim the poet ye who in the shortness of you sight see no reason for advance in the right path know ye not that we be worm bear to compose the angelic butterfly provide we throw off the husk that impede we flight -lrb- 22 -rrb- the soul come slowly on each bend down in proportion to he burden they look like the crouching figure in architecture that be use to support roof or balcony and that excite piteous fancy in the beholder the one that appear to have the most patience yet seem as if he say i can endure no further the sufferer notwithstanding they anguish raise they voice in a paraphrase on the lord 's prayer which they conclude with humbly state that they repeat the clause against temptation not for themselves but for those who be yet live virgil wish they a speedy deliverance request they to spew the best way of go up to the next circle who it be that answer he could not be discern on account of they all be so bent down but a voice give they the require direction the speaker add that he wish he could raise he eye so as to see the living creature that stand near he he say that he name be omberto -- that he come of the great tuscan race of aldobrandesco -- and that he countryman the siennese murder he on account of he arrogance dante have bent down he own head to listen and in so do he be recognize by one of the sufferer who eye he as well as he could address he by name the poet reply by exclaim art thou not oderisi the glory of agubbio the master of the art of illumination ah say oderisus franco of bologna have all the glory now he color make the page of book laugh with beauty compare with what mine do -lrb- 23 -rrb- i could not have own it while on earth for the sin which have bring I hither but so it be and so will it ever be let a man 's fame be never so green and flourishing unless he can secure a dull age to come after he cimabue in painting lately keep the field against all comer and now the cry be ` giotto ' thus in song a new guido have deprive the first of he glory and he perhaps be bear who shall drive both out of the nest -lrb- 24 -rrb- fame be but a wind that change about from all quarter what do glory amount to at best that a man should prefer living and grow old for it to die in the day of he nurse and he pap-boat even if it should last he a thousand year a thousand year -- the twinkling of a eye behold this man who weep before I he name resound once over all we tuscany and now it be scarcely whisper in he native place he be lord there at the time that you once proud but now loathsome florence have such a lesson give to its frenzy at the battle of arbium and what be he name inquire dante salvanus return the limner he be here because he have the presumption to think that he could hold sienna in the hollow of he hand fifty year have he pace in this manner such be the punishment for audacity but why be he here at all say dante and not in the outer region among the delayer of repentance because exclaim the other in the height of he ascendancy he do not disdain to stand in the public place in sienna and tremble in every vein beg money from the people to ransom a friend from captivity do i appear to thee to speak with mysterious significance thy countryman shall too soon help thee to understand I -lrb- 25 -rrb- virgil now call dante away from oderisus and bid he notice the ground on which they be tread it be pavement work all over with figure like sculptured tombstone there be lucifer among they strike flame down from heaven and briareus pin to the earth with the thunderbolt and with the other giant amazing the god with he hugeness and nimrod standing confound at the foot of babel and niobe with she despairing eye turn into stone amidst she child and saul dead on he own sword in gilboa and arachne now half spider at fault on she own broken web and

cinder and hollow place oh what a fall from pride be there now maintain the loftiness of you look ye son of eve and walk with proud step bend not you eye on the dust ye be lest ye perceive the evil of you way -lrb- 26 -rrb- behold say virgil there be a angel come the angel come on clothe in white with a face that send tremble beam before it like the morning star he skew the pilgrim the way up to the second circle and then beat he wing against the forehead of dante on which the seven initial of sin be write tell he he should go safely and disappear on reach the new circle dante instead of the fierce wailing that use to meet he at every turn in hell hear voice singing bless be the poor in spirit -lrb- 27 -rrb- as he go he perceive that he walk lighter and be tell by virgil that the angel have free he from one of the letter on he forehead he put he hand up to make sure as a man do in the street when people take notice of something on he head of which he be not aware and virgil smile in this new circle the sin of envy be expiate after the pilgrim have proceed a mile they hear the voice of invisible spirit pass they utter sentiment of love and charity for it be charity itself that have to punish envy the soul of the envious clad in sackcloth sit lean for support and humiliation partly against the rocky wall of the circle and partly on one another 's shoulder after the manner of beggar that ask alms near place of worship they eye be sew up like those of hawk in training but not so as to hinder they from shed tear which they do in abundance and they cry mary pray for we -- michael peter and all the saint pray for we dante speak to they and one a female lift up she chin as a blind person do when express consciousness of notice and say she be sapium of sienna who use to be please at people 's misfortune and have rejoice when she countryman lose the battle of colle _ sapia _ be my name she say but _ sapient _ i be not -lrb- 28 -rrb- for i prayed god to defeat my countryman and when he have do so -lrb- as he have will to do -rrb- i raise my bold face to heaven and cry out to he ` now do thy worst for i fear thee not ' i be like the bird in the fable who think

but who art thou that goest with open eye and breathest in thy talk mine eye answer dante may yet have to endure the blindness in this place though for no long period far more do i fear the suffering in the one that i have just leave i seem to feel the weight already upon I -lrb- 29 -rrb- the florentine then inform sapium how he come thither which she say be a great sign that god love he and she beg he prayer the conversation excite the curiosity of two spirit who overhear it and one of they guido del duca a noble romagnese ask the poet of what country he be dante without mention the name of the river intimate that he come from the bank of the arno upon which the other spirit rinier da calboli ask he friend why the stranger suppress the name as though it be something horrible guido say he well might for the river throughout its course behold none but bad man and persecutor of virtue first he say it make its petty way by the sty of those brutal hog the people of casentino and then arrive at the dignity of water the kennel of the cur of arezzo who excel more in bark than in bite then grow unluckier as it grow larger like the curse and miserable ditch that it be it find in florence the dog become wolf and finally ere it go into the sea it pass the den of those fox the pisan who be full of such cunning that they hold trap in contempt it will be well continue guido for this man to remember what he hear and then after prophesy evil to florence and confess to dante he sin of envy which use to make he pale when any one look happy he add this be rinierus the glory of that house of calbolus which now inherit not a spark of it not a spark of it do i say in the house of calbolus where be there a spark in all romagna where be the good lizio -- where manardus traversaro carpigna the romagnese have all become bastard a mechanic found a house in bologna a bernardin di fosco find he dog-grass become a tree in faenza wonder not tuscan to see I weep when i think of the noble spirit that we have live with -- of the guido of pra and the ugolin of azzo -- of federigo tignoso and he band -- of the traversaro and anastagio family now ruin -- and all the lady and the cavalier the alternate employment and delight which wrap we in a round of love and courtesy where now there be nothing but ill-will o castle of brettinoro why dost thou not fall well have the lord of bagnacavallo do who will have no more child who would propagate a race of county from such blood as the castrocaro and the conio be not the son of paganus call the demon and would it not be better that such a son be sweep out of the family nay let he live to chew to what a pitch of villany it have arrive ubaldinus alone be blest for he name be good and he be too old to leave a child after he go tuscan -- go for i would be leave to my tear dante and virgil turn to move onward and have scarcely do so when a tremendous voice meet they splitting the air like peal of thunder and cry out whoever find I will slay I then dash apart like the thunder-bolt when it fall it be cain the air have scarcely recover its silence when a second crash ensue from a different quarter near they like thunder when the clap break swiftly into one another i be aglauro it say that be turn into stone dante draw closer to he guide and there ensue a dead silence -lrb- 30 -rrb- the sun be now in the west and the pilgrim be journey towards it when dante suddenly feel such a weight of splendor on he eye as force he to screen they with both he hand it be a angel come to show they the ascent to the next circle a way that be less steep than the last while mount they hear the angel 's voice singing behind they bless be the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and on he leave they to proceed by themselves the second letter on dante 's forehead be find to have be efface by the splendor the poet look round in wonder on the new circle where the sin of anger be expiate and behold as in a dream three successive spectacles illustrative of the virtue of patience the first be that of a crowded temple on the threshold of which a female say to she son in the sweet manner of a mother son why hast thou thus deal with we behold thy father and i have seek thee sorrowing : -lrb- 31 -rrb- -- and here she become silent and the vision end the next be the lord of athen pisistratus calmly reprove he wife for wish he to put to death she daughter 's lover who in a transport have embrace she in public if we be to be thus severe say pisistratus with those that love we what be to be do with such as hate the last spectacle be that of a furious multitude shout and stone to death a youth who as he fall to the ground still keep he face towards heaven make he eye the gate through which he soul reach it and implore forgiveness for he murderer -lrb- 32 -rrb- the vision pass away leave the poet staggering as if but half awake they be succeed by a thick and noisome fog through which he follow he leader with the caution of a blind man virgil repeatedly tell he not to quit he a moment here they hear voice pray in unison for pardon to the lamb of god who taketh away the sin of the world they be the spirit of the angry dante converse with one of they on free-will and necessity and after quit he and issue by degree from the cloud behold illustrative vision of anger such as the impious mother who be change into the bird that most delight in singing haman retain he look of spite and rage on the cross and lavinium mourning for she mother who slew herself for rage at the death of turnus -lrb- 33 -rrb- these vision be break off by a great light as sleep be break and dante hear a voice out of it say the ascent be here he then as virgil and he ascend into the fourth circle feel a air on he face as if cause by the fanning of wing accompany by the utterance of the word bless be the peace-maker and he forehead be lighten of the third letter -lrb- 34 -rrb- in this fourth circle be expiate lukewarmness or defect of zeal for good the sufferer come speeding and weep round the mountain make amends for the old indifference by the haste and fire of the new love that be in they bless mary make haste cry one to salute elizabeth and cæsar cry another to smite pompey at lerida -lrb- 35 -rrb- and the disobedient among the israelite cry other die before they reach the promised land and the tired among the trojan prefer ease in sicily to glory in latium -- it be now midnight and dante sleep and have a dream he dream be of a woman who come to he have a tongue that try ineffectually to speak squint eye foot whose distortion draw she towards the earth stump of hand and a pallid face dante look earnestly at she and he look act upon she like sunshine upon cold she tongue be loosen she foot make straight she stand upright she paleness become a lovely rose-colour and she warble so beautifully that the poet could not have refuse to listen have he wish it i be the sweet syren she say who make the mariner turn pale for pleasure in the sea i draw ulyss out of he course with my song and he that harbor with I once rarely depart ever so well i pay he for what he abandon she lip be not yet close when a lady of holy and earliest countenance come up to shame she o virgil she cry angrily who be this virgil approach with he eye fix on the lady and the lady tear away the garment of the woman and spew she to be a creature so loathly that the sleeper awake with the horror -lrb- 36 -rrb- virgil say i have call thee three time to no purpose let we move and find the place at which we be to go higher it be broad day with a sun that come warm on the shoulder and dante be proceed with he companion when the softest voice they ever hear direct they where to ascend and they find a angel with they who point he swan-like wing upward and then flap they against the pilgrim take away the fourth letter from the forehead of dante bless be they that mourn say the angel for they shall be comfort the pilgrim ascend into the fifth circle and behold the expiator of avarice grovel on the ground and exclaim as loud as they could for the tear that choke they my soul have cleave to the dust dante speak to one who turn out to be pope adrian the fifth the poet fall on he knee but adrian bid he arise and err not i be no longer say he spouse of the church here but fellow-servant with thee and with all other go thy way and delay not the time of my deliverance the pilgrim move onward dante hear a spirit exclaim in the struggle tone of a woman in child-bed o bless virgin that be a poor roof thou hadst when thou wast deliver of thy sacred burden o good fabricius virtue with poverty be thy choice and not vice with riches and then it tell the story of nichola who hear that a father be about to sacrifice the honor of he three daughter for want of money throw bag of it in at he window contain portion for they all dante earnestly address this spirit to know who he be and the spirit say it would tell he not for the sake of help for which it look elsewhere but because of the shine grace that be in he questioner though yet alive i be root say the spirit of that evil plant which overshadow all christendom to such little profit hugh capet be i ancestor of the philip and louise of france offspring of a butcher of pari when the old race of king be wear out -lrb- 37 -rrb- we begin by seize the government in pari then plunder in provence then to make amends lay hold of poitou normandy and gascony then still to make amends put conradin to death and seize naple then always to make amends give saint aquina he dismissal to heaven by poison i see the time at hand when a descendant of mine will be call into italy and the spear that juda _ joust with _ -lrb- 38 -rrb- shall transfix the bowels of florence another of my posterity sell he daughter for a sum of money to a marquis of ferrara another seize the pope in alagna and mock christ over again in the person of he vicar a fourth rend the veil of the temple solely to seize its money o lord how shall i rejoice to see the vengeance which even now thou huggest in delight to thy bosom -lrb- 39 -rrb- of loving and liberal thing continue capet we speak while it be light such as thou heardest I record when i address myself to the bless virgin but when night come we take another tone then we denounce pygmalion -lrb- 39 -rrb- the traitor the robber and the parricide each the result of he gluttonous love of gold and mida who obtain he wish to the laughter of all time and the thief achan who still seem frightened at the wrath of joshua and sapphira and she husband whom we accuse over again before the apostle and heliodorus whom we bless the hoof of the angel 's horse for trample -lrb- 40 -rrb- and crassus on whom we call with shout of derision to tell we the flavor of he molten gold thus we record we thought in the night-time now high now low now at greater or less length as each man be prompt by he impulse and it be thus thou didst hear I record also by day-time though i have no respondent near I the pilgrim quit hugh capet and be eagerly pursue they journey when to the terror of dante they feel the whole mountain of purgatory tremble as though it be about to fall in the island of delo shake not so awfully when latona hiding there bring forth the twin eye of heaven a shout then arise on every side so enormous that virgil stand nigher to he companion and bid he be of good heart glory be to god in the highest cry the shout but dante could gather the word only from those who be near he it be purgatory rejoice for the deliverance of a soul out of its bound -lrb- 41 -rrb- the soul overtake the pilgrim as they be journey in amazement onward and it turn out to be that of statius who have be convert to christianity in the reign of domitian -lrb- 42 -rrb- mutual astonishment lead to inquiry that explain who the other latin poet be and statius fall at he master 's foot statius have expiate he sin in the circle of avarice not for that vice but for the opposite one of prodigality a angel now as before take the fifth letter from dante 's forehead and the three poet have ascend into the sixth round of the mountain be journey on lovingly together dante listen with reverence to the talk of the two ancient when they come up to a sweet-smelling fruit-tree upon which a clear stream come tumble from a rock beside it and diffuse itself through the branch the latin poet go up to the tree and be meet by a voice which say be chary of the fruit mary think not of herself at galilee but of the visitor when she say ` they have no wine ' the woman of oldest rome drink water the beautiful age of gold feast on acorn its thirst make nectar out of the rivulet the baptist feed on locust and wild honey and become great as you see he in the gospel the poet go on they way and dante be still listen to the other when they hear behind they a mingled sound of chant and weep which produce a effect at once sad and delightful it be the psalm o lord open thou we lip and the chanter be expiator of the sin of intemperance in meat and drink they be condemn to circuit the mountain famish and to long for the fruit and water of the tree in vain they soon come up with the poet -- a pallid multitude with hollow eye and bone stare through the skin the socket of they eye look like ring from which the gem have drop -lrb- 43 -rrb- one of they know and accost dante who could not recognize he till he hear he speak it be forese donatus one of the poet 's most intimate connexion dante who have weep over he face when dead could as little forbear weep to see he thus hunger and thirst though he have expect to find he in the outskirts of the place among the delayer of repentance he ask he friend how he have so quickly get higher forese say it be owe to the prayer and tear of he good wife nellum and then he burst into a strain of indignation against the contrast exhibit to she virtue by the general depravity of the florentine woman whom he describe as less modest than the half-naked savage in the mountain of sardinium what be to be say of such creature continue he o my dear cousin i see a day at hand when these impudent woman shall be for bid from the pulpit to go expose they naked bosom what savage or what infidel ever need that oh if they could see what heaven have in store for they they mouth would be this instant open wide for howl -lrb- 44 -rrb- forese then ask dante to explain to himself and he astonished fellow-sufferer how it be that he stand there a living body of flesh and blood casting a shadow with he substance if thou callest to mind say dante what sort of life thou and i lead together the recollection may still grieve thee sorely he that walk here before we take I out of that life and through he guidance it be that i have visit in the body the world of the dead and be now traverse the mountain which lead we to the right path -lrb- 45 -rrb- after some further explanation forese point out to he friend among the expiator of intemperance buonaggiunta of lucca the poet and pope martin the fourth with a face make sharper than the rest for the eel which he use to smother in wine and ubaldino of pila grind he tooth on air and archbishop boniface of ravenna who feed jovially on he flock and rigogliosus of forlus who have have time enough to drink in the other world and yet never be satisfied buonaggiunta and dante eyed one another with curiosity and the former murmured something about a lady of the name of gentucca thou seemest to wish to speak with I say dante thou art no admirer i believe of my native place say buonaggiunta and yet if thou art he whom i take thee to be there be a damsel there shall make it please thee art thou not author of the poem begin lady that understand the lore of love -lrb- 46 -rrb- i be one reply dante who write as love would have he heed no manner but he dictator 's and utter simply what he suggest -lrb- 47 -rrb- ay that be the sweet new style return buonaggiunta and i now see what it be that hinder the notary and guittone and myself from hit the right natural point and here he cease speak look like one contented to have ascertain a truth -lrb- 48 -rrb- the whole multitude then except forese skim away like crane swift alike through eagerness and through leanness forese linger a moment to have a parting word with he friend and to prophesy the violent end of the chief of he family corso run away with and drag at the heel of he horse faster and faster till the frenzied animal smite he dead have give the poet this information the prophet speed after the other the companion now come to a second fruit-tree to which a multitude be in vain lift up they hand just as child lift they to a man who tantalise they with shew something which he withhold but a voice out of a thicket by the road-side warn the traveller not to stop tell they that the tree be a offset from that of which eve taste call to mind say the voice those creature of the cloud the centaur whose feast cost they they life remember the hebrew how they drop away from the rank of gideon to quench they effeminate thirst -lrb- 49 -rrb- the poet proceed wrapt in think till they hear another voice of a nature that make dante start and shake as if he have be some paltry hackney of what value be think say the voice if it lose its way the path lie hither dante turn toward the voice and behold a shape glowing red as in a furnace with a visage too dazzling to be look upon it meet he nevertheless as he draw nigh with a air from the fanning of its wing fresh as the first breathing of the wind on a may morning and fragrant as all its flower and dante lose the sixth letter on he forehead and ascend with the two other poet into the seventh and last circle of the mountain this circle be all in flame except a narrow path on the edge of its precipice along which the pilgrim walk a great wind from outside of the precipice keep the flame from rage beyond the path and in the midst of the fire go spirit expiate the sin of incontinence they sing the hymn begin god of consummate mercy -lrb- 50 -rrb- dante be compel to divide he attention between he own footstep and theirs in order to move without destruction at the close of the hymn they cry aloud i know not a man -lrb- 51 -rrb- and then recommence it after which they again cry aloud say diana run to the wood and drive calisto out of it because she know the poison of venus and then again they sing the hymn and then extol the memory of chaste woman and husband and so they go on without cease as long as they time of trial last occasionally the multitude that go in one direction meet another which mingle with and pass through it individual of both greet tenderly by the way as emmet appear to do when in pass they touch the antennæ of one another these two multitude part with loud and sorrowful cry proclaim the offence of which they have be guilty and then each renew they spiritual song and prayer the soul here as in former circle know dante to be a living creature by the shadow which he cast and after the wonted explanation he learn who some of they be one be he predecessor in poetry guido guinicellus from whom he could not take he eye for love and reverence till the sufferer who tell he there be a greater than himself in the crowd vanish away through the fire as a fish do in water the greater one be arnauld daniel the provençal poet who after beg the prayer of the traveller disappear in like manner the sun by this time be set on the fire of purgatory when a angel come cross the road through they and then stand on the edge of the precipice with joy in he look and singing bless be the pure in heart invite the three poet to plunge into the flame themselves and so cross the road to the ascent by which the summit of the mountain be gain dante clasp he hand and raise they aloft recoil in horror the thought of all that he have just witness make he feel as if he own hour of death be come he companion encourage he to obey the angel but he could not stir virgil say now mark I son this be the only remain obstacle between thee and beatrice and then himself and statius enter the fire dante follow they i could have cast myself say he into molten glass to cool myself so rage be the furnace virgil talk of beatrice to animate he he say methink i see she eye behold we there be indeed a great light upon the quarter to which they be cross and out of the light issue a voice which draw they onwards sing come bless of my father behold the sun be go down and the night cometh and the ascent be to be gain the traveller gain the ascent issue out of the fire and the voice and the light cease and night be come unable to ascend farther in the darkness they make themselves a bed each of a stair in the rock and dante in he happy humility feel as if he have be a goat lie down for the night near two shepherd towards dawn at the hour of the rising of the star of love he have a dream in which he see a young and beautiful lady come over a lea and bend every now and then to gather flower and as she bind the flower into a garland she sing i be leah gathering flower to adorn myself that my look may seem pleasant to I in the mirror but my sister rachel abide before the mirror flowerless contented with she beautiful eye to behold be my sister 's pleasure and to work be mine -lrb- 52 -rrb- when dante awake the beam of the dawn be visible and they now produce a happiness like that of the traveller who every time he awake know himself to be nearer home virgil and statius be already up and all three resume they way to the mountain 's top stand upon it at last and gaze round about they on the skirt of the terrestrial paradise the sun be sparkling bright over a green land full of tree and flower virgil then announce to dante that here he guidance terminate and that the creature of flesh and blood be at length to be master of he own movement to rest or to wander as he please the try and purify lord over himself the florentine eager to taste he new liberty leave he companion awhile and stroll away through the celestial forest whose thick and lively verdure give coolness to the sens in the midst of the brightest sun a fragrance come from every part of the soil a sweet unintermitt air stream

give way and disclose a car brighter than the chariot of the sun accompany by celestial nymph and shower upon by angel with a cloud of flower in the midst of which stand a maiden in a white veil crown with olive the love that have never leave dante 's heart from childhood tell he who it be and tremble in every vein he turn round to virgil for encouragement virgil be go at that moment paradise and

large room the tear of dante have hitherto be suppress but when the singing begin they again roll down he cheek beatrice in a milder tone say to the angel this man when he propose to himself in he youth to lead a new life be of a truth so gifted that every good habit ought to have thrive with he but the richer the soil the greater peril of weed for a while the innocent light of my countenance

flower about the maiden and be behold she though still beneath she veil as far surpass she former self in loveliness as that self have surpass other the sight pierce he with such pang that the more he have love any thing else the more he now loathe it and he fall senseless to the ground when he recover he sens he find himself in the hand of the lady he have first see in the place who bid he keep

from the lip of the angel and faith hope and charity call upon beatrice to unveil she face she do so and dante quench the ten-years thirst of he eye in she ineffable beauty -lrb- 58 -rrb- after a

son of a butcher that franci the first prohibit the admission of dante 's poem into he dominion mr cary think the king might have be mistake in he interpretation of the passage and that butcher may be simply a metaphorical term for the blood-thirstiness of capet 's father but when we find the man call not _ the _ butcher or _ that _ butcher or butcher in reference to he species but in plain local parlance a butcher of pari -lrb- _ un beccaio di parigi _ -rrb- and when this designation be follow up by the allusion to the extinction of the previous dynasty the ordinary construction of the word appear indisputable dante seem to have have no ground for what he aristocratical pride doubtless consider a hard blow and what king franci indeed condescend to feel as such he meet with the notion somewhere and choose to believe it in order to vex the french and they prince the spirit of the taunt contradict he own theory elsewhere for he have repeatedly say that the only true nobility be in

to save scotland from purgatory : so we must take good and bad together and hope the best in the end forese like many of dante 's preacher seem to have be one of those self-ignorant or self-exasperated denouncer who compound for sin they be incline to by damn those they have no mind to he be a glutton who could not bear to see lady too little clothe the defacing of god 's image in

spirit in this orb who come and go in the light of it like spark in fire or like voice chant in harmony with voice be spin round in circle of delight each with more or less swiftness accord to its share of the beatific vision several of they come sweep out of they dance towards the poet who have sing of love among whom be he patron charle martel king of hungary who shew he the reason why diversity of nature must occur in family and cunizza sister of the tyrant ezzelino who be overcome by this she star when on earth and folco the troubadour whose place be next cunizza in heaven and

church a band of they come encircle he and he guide as a halo encircle the moon singing a song the beauty of which like jewel too rich to be export be not conveyable by expression to mortal fancy the spirit compose the band be those of st thoma aquina albertus magnus gratian the benedictine pietro lombardo solomon saint dionysius the areopagite paulus orosius boetius isidore the venerable bede richard of st victor and sigebert of gemblor st thoma be the namer of they to dante they song have pause that he might speak but when he have do speak they begin resume it one by one and circle as they move like the wheel of church-clock that sound one after another with a sweet tinkle when they summon the heart of the devout to morning prayer -lrb- 10 -rrb- again they stop and again st thoma address the poet he be of the order of st dominic but with generous grace he hold up the founder of the franciscan with he vow of poverty as the example of what a pope should be and reprove the error of no order but he own on the other hand a new circle of doctor of the church make they appearance and enclose the first as rainbow enclose rainbow rolling round with it in the unison of a two-fold joy a voice from the new circle attract the poet 's ear as the pole attract the needle and saint buonaventura a franciscan open upon the praise of st dominic the loving minion of christianity the holy wrestler -- benign to he friend and cruel to he enemy -lrb- 11 -rrb- -- and so confine he reproof to he own franciscan order he then as st thoma have do with the doctor in the inner circle name those who constitute the outer : to wit illuminato and agostino and hugue of st victor and petrus comestor and pope john the twenty-first nathan the prophet chrysostom anselmo of canterbury donatus who deign to teach grammar raban of mentz and joachim of calabrium the two circle then vary they movement by wheeling round one another in counter direction and after they have chant not of bacchus or apollo but of three person in one st thoma who know dante 's thought by intuition again address he discourse of mystery human and divine exhort he to be slow in give assent or denial to proposition without examination and bidding he warn people in general how they presume to anticipate the divine judgment as to who should be save and who not -lrb- 12 -rrb- the spirit of solomon then related how soul could resume they body glorified and the two circle utter a rapturous amen glow with such intolerable brightness that the eye of beatrice only be able to sustain it dante gaze on she with a delight ineffable and suddenly find himself in the fifth heaven it be the planet mar the receptacle of those who have die fight for the cross in the middle of its ruddy light stand a cross itself of enormous dimension make of light still greater and exhibit first in the body of it the crucified presence glitter all over with indescribable flash like lightning and secondly in addition to and across the presence innumerable sparkle of the intensest mixture of white and red dart to and fro through the whole extent of the crucifix the movement be like that of mote in a sunbeam and as a sweet din arise from the multitudinous touch of harp and viol before the ear distinguish the note there issue in like manner from the whole glittering ferment a harmony indistinct but exquisite which entrance the poet beyond all he have ever feel he hear even the word arise and conquer as one who hear and yet hear not on a sudden with a glide like a fall star there run down from the right horn of the cross to the foot of it one of the light of this cluster of splendor distinguish itself as it go like flame in alabaster o flesh of my flesh it exclaim to dante o superabounding divine grace when be the door of paradise ever twice open as it shall have be to thee -lrb- 13 -rrb- dante in astonishment turn to beatrice and see such a rapture of delight in she eye that he seem at that instant as if he own have touch the depth of he acceptance and of he heaven -lrb- 14 -rrb- the light resume its speech but in word too profound in they meaning for dante to comprehend they seem to be return thanks to god this rapturous absorption be end the speaker express in more human term he gratitude to beatrice and then after incite dante to ask he name declare himself thus : o branch of mine whom i have long desire to behold i be the root of thy stock of he thy great-grandsire who first bring from he mother the family-name into thy house and whom thou sawest expiate he sin of pride on the first circle of the mountain well it befitteth thee to shorten he long suffering with thy good work florence -lrb- 15 -rrb- while yet she be confine within the ancient boundary which still contain the bell

more he have hear as he come through the nether region alarming intimation of the ill fortune that await he and he be anxious to know from so high and certain a authority what it would really be cacciaguida say as hippolytus be force to depart from athen by the wiles of he cruel step-dame so must even thou depart out of florence such be the wish such this very moment the plot and soon will it be the deed of those the business of whose life be to make a traffic of christ with rome thou shalt quit every thing that be dearest to thee in the world that be the first arrow shot from the bow of exile thou shalt experience how salt be the taste of bread eat at the expense of other how hard be the go up and down other ' stair but what shall most bow thee down be the worthless and disgusting company with whom thy lot must be partake for they shall all turn against thee the whole mad heartless and ungrateful set nevertheless it shall not be long first before themselves and not thou shall have cause to hang down they head for shame the brutishness of all they do will shew how well it become thee to be of no party but the party of thyself -lrb- 20 -rrb- thy first refuge thou shalt owe to the courtesy of the great lombard who bear the ladder charge with the holy bird -lrb- 21 -rrb- so benignly shall he regard thee that in the matter of ask and receive the customary order of thing shall be reverse between you two and the gift anticipate the request with he thou shalt behold the mortal bear under so strong a influence of this we star that the nation shall take note of he they be not aware of he yet by reason of he tender age but ere the gascon practice on the great henry sparkle of he worth shall break forth in he contempt of money and of ease and when he munificence appear in all its lustre he very enemy shall not be able to hold they tongue for admiration -lrb- 22 -rrb- look thou to this second benefactor also for many a change of the lot of people shall he make both rich and poor and do thou bear in mind but repeat not what further i shall now tell thee of thy life here the spirit say the poet foretell thing which afterwards appear incredible to they very beholder -- and then add : such my son be the heart and mystery of the thing thou hast desire to learn the snare will shortly gather about thee but wish not to change place with the contriver for thy day will outlast those of they retribution again be the spirit silent and yet again once more do he descendant question he anxious to have the advice of one that see so far and that speak the truth so purely and love he so well too plainly my father say dante do i see the time come when a blow be to be strike I heaviest ever to the man that be not true to himself for which reason it be fit that i so far arm myself beforehand that in lose the spot dearest to I on earth i do not let my verse deprive I of every other refuge now i have be down below through the region whose grief be without end and i have scale the mountain from the top of which i be lift by my lady 's eye and i have come thus far through heaven from luminary to luminary and in the course of this my pilgrimage i have hear thing which if i tell again may bitterly disrelish with many yet on the other hand if i prove but a timid friend to truth i fear i shall not survive with the generation by whom the present time will be call time of old the light that enclose the treasure which its descendant have find in heaven first flash at this speech like a golden mirror against the sun and then it reply thus : let the conscience blush at thy word that have reason to blush do thou far from shadow of misrepresentation make manifest all which thou hast see and let the sore place be gall that deserve it thy bitter truth shall carry with they vital nourishment -- thy voice as the wind do shall smite loudest the loftiest summit and no little shall that redound to thy praise it be for this reason that in all thy journey thou hast be shewn none but spirit of note since little heed would have be take of such as excite doubt by they obscurity the spirit of cacciaguida now relapse into the silent joy of its reflection and the poet be stand absorb in the mingled feeling of he own when beatrice say to he change the current of thy thought consider how near i be in heaven to one that repayeth every wrong dante turn at the sound of this comfort and feel no longer any other wish than to look upon she eye but she say with a smile turn thee round again and attend i be not thy only paradise and dante again turn and see he ancestor prepare to say more cacciaguida bid he look again on the cross and he should see various spirit as he name they flash over it like lightning and they do so that of joshua which be first mention dart along the cross in a stream the light of juda maccabeus go spin as if joy have scourge it -lrb- 23 -rrb- charlemagne and orlando sweep away together pursue by the poet 's eye guglielmo -lrb- 24 -rrb- follow and rinaldo and godfrey of bouillon and robert guiscard of naple and the light of cacciaguida himself dart back to its place and utter another sort of voice begin shew how sweet a singer he too be amidst the glittering choir dante turn to share the joy with beatrice and by the lovely paling of she cheek like a maiden 's when it deliver itself of the burden of a blush -lrb- 25 -rrb- know that he be in another and whiter star it be the planet jupiter the abode of bless administrator of justice here he behold troops of dazzling essence warble as they fly and shape they flight hither and thither like bird when they rise from the bank of river and rejoice with one another in new-found pasture but the figure into which the flight be shape be of a more special sort be mystical composition of letter of the alphabet now a d now a i now a l and so on till the poet observe that they complete the whole text of scripture which say _ diligite justitiam quus judicati terram _ -- -lrb- love righteousness ye that be judge of the earth -rrb- the last letter m they do not decompose like the rest but keep it entire for a while and glow so deeply within it that the silvery orb thereabout seem burn with gold other light with a song of rapture then descend like a crown of lily on the top of the letter and then from the body of it rise thousand of spark as from a shake firebrand and gradually expand into the form of a eagle the light which have descend like lily distribute themselves over the whole bird encrust it with ruby flash in the sun but what say the poet be never yet hear of write or imagine -- the beak of the eagle speak it utter many mind in one voice just as one heat be give out by many ember and proclaim itself to have be thus exalt because it unite justice and mercy while on earth dante address this splendid phenomenon and pray it to ease he mind of the perplexity of its worldly reason respect the divine nature and government and the exclusion from heaven of goodness itself unless within the christian pale the celestial bird rouse itself into motion with delight like a falcon in the conscious energy of its will and beauty when upon be set free from its hood it glance above it into the air and clap its self-congratulating wing answer nevertheless somewhat disdainfully that it be impossible for man in he mortal state to comprehend such thing and that the astonishment he feel at they though doubtless it would be excusable under other circumstance must rest satisfied with the affirmation of scripture the bird then bent over its questioner as a stork do over the nestle newly feed when it look up at she and then wheeling round and renew its warble conclude it with say as my note be to thee that understandest they not so be the judgment of the eternal to thine earthly brethren none ever yet ascend into these heavenly region that do not believe in christ either after he be crucify or before it yet many who call christ christ shall at the last day be find less near to he than such as know he not what shall the king of islam say to you christian king when they see the book of judgment open and hear all that be set down in it to they dishonor in that book shall be read the desolation which albert will inflict on bohemia : -lrb- 26 -rrb- -- in that book the woe inflict on pari by that adulterator of he kingdom 's money who shall die by the hog 's tooth : -- in that book the ambition which make such mad fool of the scotch and english king that they can not keep within they bound : -- in that book the luxury of the spaniard and the effeminate life of the bohemian who neither know nor care for any thing worthy : -- in that book the lame wretch of jerusalem whose value will be express by a unit and he worthlessness by a million : -- in that book the avarice and cowardice of the warder of the isle of fire in which old anchise die and that the record may answer the better to he abundant littleness the writing shall be in short-hand and he uncle 's and he brother 's filthy doings shall be read in that book -- they who have make such rottenness of a good old house and two diadem and there also shall the portuguese and the norwegian be know for what they be and the coiner of dalmatium who behold with such covetous eye the venetian ducat o bless hungary if thou wouldst resolve to endure no longer -- o bless navarre if thou wouldst but keep out the frenchman with thy mountain wall may the cry and groan of nicosium and famagosta be a earnest of those happier day proclaim as they do the vile habit of the beast who keep so close in the path of the herd he brethren the bless bird for a moment be silent but as at the go down of the sun the heaven be darken and then break forth into innumerable star which the sun light up -lrb- 27 -rrb- so the splendor within the figure of the bird suddenly become more splendid and break forth into song too beautiful for mortal to remember o dulcet love that dost shew thee forth in smile how ardent be thy manifestation in the lustrous sparkle which arise out of the mere thought of those pious heart after the gem in that glitter figure have cease chime they angelic song the poet seem to hear the murmur of a river which come fall from rock to rock and chew by the fulness of its tone the abundance of its mountain spring and as the sound of the guitar be modulate on the neck of it and the breath of the pipe be accordant to the spiracle from which it issue so the murmur within the eagle suddenly take voice and rise through the neck again issue forth in word the bird now bid the poet fix he attention on its eye because of all the fire that compose its figure those that sparkle in the eye be the noblest the spirit -lrb- it say -rrb- which dante beheld in the pupil be that of the royal singer who dance before the ark now enjoy the reward of he superiority to vulgar discernment of the five spirit that compose the eyebrow the one nearest the beak be trajan now experience above all other in the knowledge of what it cost not to follow christ by reason of he have be in hell before he be translate to heaven next to trajan be hezekiah whose penitence delay for he the hour of he death : next hezekiah constantine though in let the pope become a prince instead of a pastor he have unwittingly bring destruction on the world : next constantine william the good of sicily whose death be not more lament than the life of those who contest he crown and lastly next william riphaeus the trojan what err mortal cry the bird would believe it possible to find riphæus the trojan among the blest -- but so it be and he now know more respect the divine grace than mortal do though even he discern it not to the depth -lrb- 28 -rrb- the bird again relapse into silence appear to repose on the happiness of its thought like the lark which after quiver and expatiate through all its airy warble become mute and content have satisfy its soul to the last drop of its sweetness -lrb- 29 -rrb- but again dante could not help speak be astonish to find pagan in heaven and once more the celestial figure indulge he curiosity it tell he that trajan have be deliver from hell for he love of justice by the prayer of st gregory and that riphaeus for the same reason have be gifted with a prophetic knowledge of the redemption and then it end with a rapture on the hidden mystery of predestination and on the joy of ignorance itself when submit to the divine will the two bless spirit meanwhile whom the bird mention like the finger of sweet lutenist to sweet singer when they quiver to he warble as it go manifest the delight they experience by movement of accord simultaneous as the twinkling of two eye -lrb- 30 -rrb- dante turn to receive he own final delight from the eye of beatrice and he find it though the customary smile on she face be no longer there she tell he that she beauty increase with such intensity at every fresh ascent among the star that he would no longer have be able to bear the smile and they be now in the seventh heaven or the planet saturn the retreat of those who have pass they life in holy contemplation in this crystal sphere call after the name of the monarch who reign over the age of innocence dante look up and behold a ladder the hue of which be like gold when the sun glister it and the height so great that its top be out of sight and down the step of this ladder he see come such multitude of shine spirit that it seem as if all the light of heaven must have be there pour forth but not a sound be in the whole splendor it be spare to the poet for the same reason that he miss the smile of beatrice when they come to a certain step in the ladder some of the spirit fly off it in circle or other career like rook when they issue from they tree in the morning to dry they feather in the sun part of they go away without return other return to the point they leave and other content themselves with fly round about it one of they come so near dante and beatrice and brighten with such ardor that the poet see it be do in affection towards they and beg the loving spirit to tell they who it be between the two coast of italy say the spirit and not far from thine own country the stony mountain ascend into a ridge so lofty that the thunder roll beneath it catrium be its name beneath it be a consecrated cell and in that cell i be call pietro damiano -lrb- 31 -rrb- i so devoted myself to the service of god that with no other sustenance than the juice of the olive i forget both heat and cold happy in heavenly meditation that cloister make abundant return in its season to these granary of the lord but so idle have it become now that it be fit the world should know its barrenness the day of my mortal life be draw to a close when i be besought and draw into wear the hat which descend every day from bad head to worse -lrb- 32 -rrb- st peter and st paul come lean and barefoot get they bread where they could but pastor now-a-day must be lift from the ground and have usher go before they and train-bearer behind they and ride upon palfrey cover with they spreading mantle so that two beast go under one skin -lrb- 33 -rrb- o lord how long at these word dante saw more splendor come pour down the ladder and wheel round and round and become at every wheel more beautiful the whole dazzling body then gather round the indignant speaker and shout something in a voice so tremendous that the poet could liken it to nothing on earth the thunder be so overwhelming that he do not even hear what they say -lrb- 34 -rrb- pallid and stunned he turn in affright to beatrice who comfort he as a mother comfort a child that want breath to speak the shout be prophetic of the vengeance about to overtake the church beatrice then direct hisattention to a multitude of small orb which increase one another 's beauty by interchange they splendor they enclose the spirit of those who most combined meditation with love one of they be saint benedict and other macarius and romoaldo -lrb- 35 -rrb- the light of st benedict issue forth from among its companion to address the poet and after explain how its occupant be unable farther to disclose himself inveigh against the degeneracy of the religious order it then rejoin its fellow and the whole company clustering into one meteor sweep aloft like a whirlwind beatrice beckon the poet to ascend after they he do so gifted with the usual virtue by she eye and find himself in the twin light of the geminus the constellation that preside over he birth he be now in the region of the fix star thou art now say he guide so near the summit of thy prayer that it behove thee to take a last look at thing below thee and see how little they should account in thine eye dante turn he eye downward through all the seven sphere and see the earth so diminutive that he smile at its miserable appearance wisest think he be the man that esteem it least and truly worthy he that set he thought on the world to come he now see the moon without those spot in it which make he formerly attribute the variation to dense and rare he sustain the

altogether be a very grand one and the violence itself of the holy invective awful here he have a glimpse of the divine essence in likeness of a point of inconceivably sharp brightness enringe with the angelic hierarchy all earth and heaven and nature hang from it beatrice explain many mystery to he connect with that sight and then vehemently denounce the false and foolish teacher that quit the

bank paint with the loveliest flower fiery live sparkle arise from it on all side and pitch themselves into the cup of the flower where they remain awhile like ruby set in gold till inebriate with the odour they recast themselves into the bosom of the flood and ever as one return another leap forth beatrice bid he dip he eye into the light that he might obtain power to see deeper into its nature for the river and the jewel that spring out of it to and fro and the laughing flower on the bank be themselves but shadow of the truth which they include not indeed in they essential self but inasmuch as without further assistance the beholder 's eye could not see they as they be dante rush to the stream as eagerly as the lip of a infant to the breast when it have sleep beyond its time and he eyelash have no sooner touch it than the length of the river become a breadth and a circle and its real nature lay unveil before he like a face when a mask be take off it be the whole two combined

fold to fold fan they loin and communicate the peace and ardor which they gather as they give dante beheld all -- every flight and action of the whole winged multitude -- without let or shadow for he stand in the region of light itself and light have no obstacle where it be deservedly vouchsafe oh cry the poet if the barbarian that come from the north stand dumb with amazement to behold the magnificence of rome think they see unearthly greatness in the lateran what must i have think who have thus come from human to divine from time to eternity from the people of florence to being just

gaze upward and downward and on every side round about and see movement graceful with every truth of innocence and face full of loving persuasion rich in they own smile and in the light of the smile of other he turn to beatrice but she be go -- go as a messenger from herself tell he to resume she seat in the bless rise which the messenger accordingly point out she sit in the third circle from the

and a hope for she assistance after death and she look down at he and smile the messenger be st bernard he bid the poet lift he eye higher and dante behold the virgin mary sit above the rose in the

conclusion that he be nothing but a banterar he be a true poet of the mixed order grave as well as gay have a reflect mind a susceptible and most affectionate heart and perhaps be never more in

for the people to dance to in carnival time the intercourse between lorenzo and pulcus be of the most familiar kind pulcus be sixteen year older but of a nature which make no such difference feel between associate he have know lorenzo from the latter 's youth probably from he birth -- be speak of in a tone of domestic intimacy by he wife -- and be enumerate by he among he companion in a very

sonnet in a letter write to lorenzo when the future statesman then in he seventeenth year be make himself personally acquaint with the court of italy pulcus speak of himself as struggle hard to keep down the poetic propensity in he friend 's absence if you be with I he say i should produce heap of sonnet as big as the club they make of the cherry-blossom for may-day i be always mutter some verse or other betwixt my tooth but i say to myself ` my lorenzo be not here -- he who be my only hope and refuge ' and so i suppress it such be the first and of a like nature be the latest account we

by lorenzo probably quarrel with he on account of it plague he in somewhat the same spirit though in more friendly guise as the della cruscans and other afterwards plague tasso so he banter they in

a little troubled himself with the squabble of he literati we author probably have good reason to call he illustrious friend he refuge the _ morgante maggiore _ the work which have render the name of pulcus renown be a attempt to elevate the popular and homely narrative poetry chant in the street into the dignity of a production that should last the age be in a state of transition on all point the dogmatic authority of the schoolman in matter of religion which prevail in the time of dante have come to nought before the advance of knowledge in general and the indifference of the court of rome the council of trent as crescimbenus advise the critic have not then settle what christendom be to believe and man provide they comply with form and admit certain main article be allow to think and even in great measure talk as they please the lover of the platonic philosophy take the opportunity of exalt some of its dream to a influence which at one time be suppose to threaten christianity itself and which in fact have already succeed in affect christian theology to a extent which the scorner of paganism little suspect most of these hellenist push they admiration of greek literature to a excess they be oppose by the virgilian predilection of pulcus 's friend politian who have nevertheless universality enough to sympathise with the delight the other take in they native tuscan and its liveliest and most idiomatic effusion from all these circumstance in combination arise first pulcus 's determination to write a poem of a mixed order which should retain for he the ear of the many and at the same time give rise to a poetry of romance worthy of higher auditor second he banter of what he consider unessential and injurious dogma of belief in favor of those principle of the religion of charity which inflict no contradiction on the heart and understanding third the trouble which seem to have be give he by critic sacred and profane in consequence of these originality and lastly a doubt which have strangely exist with some as to whether he intend to write a serious or a comic poem or on any one point be in earnest at all one writer think he can not have be in earnest because he open every canto with some pious invocation another assert that the piety itself be a banter a similar critic be of opinion that to mix levity with gravity prove the gravity to have be nought and the levity all in all a fourth allow he to have be serious in he description of the battle of roncesvalle but say he be laugh in all the rest of he poem while a fifth candidly give up the question as one of those puzzle occasion by the caprice of the human mind which it be impossible for reasonable people to solve even sismondus who be well acquaint with the age in which pulci write and who if not a profound be generally a acute and liberal critic confess himself to be thus confound pulcus he say commence all he canto by a sacred invocation and the interest of religion be constantly intermingle with the adventure of he story in a manner capricious and little instructive we know not how to reconcile this monkish spirit with the semi-pagan character of society under lorenzo di medici nor whether we ought to accuse pulcus of gross bigotry or of profane derision -lrb- 1 -rrb- sismondus do not consider that the lively and impassioned people of the south take what may be call household-liberty with the object of they worship greater than northern can easily conceive that levity of manner therefore do not always imply the absence of the gravest belief that be this as it may the belief may be as grave on some point as light on other perhaps the more so for that reason and that although some poem like some people be altogether grave or the reverse there really be such a thing as tragi-comedy both in the world itself and in the representation of it a jest writer may be quite as much in earnest when he profess to be so as a pleasant companion who feel for he own or for other people 's misfortune and who be perhaps oblige to affect or resort to he very pleasantry sometimes because he feel more acutely than the gravest the source of tear and smile lie close to ay and help to refine one another if dante have be capable of more levity he would have be guilty of less melancholy absurdity if rabelai have be able to weep as well as to laugh and to love as well as to be licentious he would have have faith and therefore support in something earnest and not have be oblige to place the consummation of all thing in a wine-bottle people 's every-day experience might explain to they the greatest apparent inconsistency of pulcus 's muse if habit itself do not blind they to the illustration be nobody ever present in a well-ordered family when a lively conversation have be interrupt by the announcement of dinner the company after listen with the greatest seriousness to a grace deliver with equal seriousness perhaps by a clergyman resume it the instant afterwards in all its gaiety with the first spoonful of soup well the sacred invocation at the beginning of pulcus 's canto be compliance of the like sort with a custom they be recite and listen to just as gravely at lorenzo di medici 's table and yet neither compromise the reciter nor be at all associate with the enjoyment of the fare that ensue so with regard to the intermixture of grave and gay throughout the poem how many campaigning adventure have be write by gallant officer whose animal spirit see food for gaiety in half the circumstance that occur and who could crack a jest and a helmet perhaps with almost equal vivacity and yet be as serious as the gravest at a moment 's notice mourn heartily over the death of they friend and shudder with indignation and horror at the outrage commit in a capture city it be thus that pulcus write full no less of feeling than of whim and mirth and the whole honest round of humanity not only warrant he plan but in the twofold sense of the word embrace it if any thing more be necessary to shew the gravity with which we author address himself to he subject it be the fact relate by himself of its have be recommend to he by lorenzo 's mother lucrezium tornabuonus a good and earnest woman herself a poetess who write a number of sacred narrative and whose virtue he more than once record with the greatest respect and tenderness the _ morgante _ conclude with a address respect this lady to the virgin and with a hope that she devout and sincere spirit may obtain peace for he in paradise these be the last word in the book be it credible that expression of this kind and employ on such a occasion could have have no serious meaning or that lorenzo listen to such praise of he mother as to a jest i have no doubt that make allowance for the age in which he live pulcus be a excellent christian he orthodoxy it be true be not the orthodoxy of the time of dante or st dominic nor yet of that of the council of trent he opinion respect the mystery of the trinity appear to have be more like those of sir isaac newton than of archdeacon travi and assuredly he agree with origen respect eternal punishment rather than with calvin and mr toplady but a man may accord with newton and yet be think not unworthy of the starry sphere he may think with origen that god intend all he creature to be ultimately happy -lrb- 2 -rrb- and yet be consider as love a follower of christ as a dealer of damnation round the land or the burner of a fellow-creature pulcus be in advance of he time on more subject than one he pronounce the existence of a new and inhabit world before the appearance of columbus -lrb- 3 -rrb- he make the conclusion doubtless as columbus do from the speculation of more scientific man and the rumor of seaman but how rare be the mind that be foremost to throw aside even the most innocent prejudice and anticipate the enlargement of the public mind how many also be calumniate and persecute for so do whose memory for the same identical reason be love perhaps adore by the descendant of the calumniator in a public library in pulcus 's native place be preserve a little withered relic to which the attention of the visitor be draw with reverential complacency it stand point upward under a glass-case look like a mysterious bit of parchment and be the finger of galileo -- of that galileo whose hand possess that finger be suppose to have be tortured by the inquisition for write what every one now believe he be certainly persecute and imprison by the inquisition milton saw and visit he under the restraint of that scientific body in he own house yet galileo do more by he disclosure of the star towards elevate we idea of the creator than all the so-called saint and polemic that scream at one another in the pulpit of east and west like the _ commedium _ of dante pulcus 's commedium -lrb- for such also in regard to its general cheerfulness -lrb- 4 -rrb- and probably to its mediocrity of style he call it -rrb- be a representative in great measure of the feeling and knowledge of he time and though not entirely such in a learn and eclectic sense and not to be compare to that sublime monstrosity in point of genius and power be as superior to it in liberal opinion and in a certain pervade lovingness as the author 's affectionate disposition and he country 's advance in civilisation combine to render it the editor of the _ parnaso italiano _ have reason to notice this engaging personal character in we author 's work he say speaking of the principal romantic poet of italy that the reader will admire tasso will adore ariosto but will love pulcus -lrb- 5 -rrb- and all mind in which lovingness produce love will agree with he the _ morgante maggiore _ be a history of the fabulous exploit and death of orlando the great hero of italian romance and of the war and calamity bring on he fellow paladin and they sovereign charlemagne by the envy ambition and treachery of the misguided monarch 's favorite gail of magauza -lrb- mayence -rrb- count of poictier it be found on the pseudo-history of archbishop turpin which though it receive the formal sanction of the church be a manifest forgery and become such a jest with the wit that they take a delight in palming upon it they most incredible fiction the title -lrb- _ morgante the great _ -rrb- seem to have be either a whim to draw attention to a old subject or the result of a intention to do more with the giant so call than take place for though he be a conspicuous actor in the earlier part of the poem he die when it be not much more than half complete orlando the champion of the faith be the real hero of it and gin the anti-hero or vice charlemagne the reader hardly need be tell be represent for the most part as a very different person from what he appear in history in truth as elli and panizzus have shew he be either a exaggeration -lrb- still misrepresent -rrb- of charle martel the armorican chieftain who conquer the saracen at poictier or a concretion of all the charlese of the carlovingian race wise and simple potent and weak -lrb- 6 -rrb- the story may be thus briefly tell orlando quit the court of charlemagne in disgust but be always ready to return to it when the emperor need he help the best paladin follow to seek he he meet with and convert the giant morgante whose aid he receive in many adventure among which be the taking of babylon the other paladin he cousin rinaldo especially have they separate adventure all more or less mixed up with the treachery and thanklessness of gan -lrb- for they assist even he -rrb- and the provoke trust repose in he by charlemagne and at length the villain crown he infamy by lure orlando with most of the paladin into the pass of roncesvalle where the hero himself and almost all he companion be slay by the army of gan 's fellow-traitor marsilius king of spain they die however victorious and the two royal and noble scoundrel by a piece of prosaical justice better than poetical be despatch like common malefactor with a halter there be perhaps no pure invention in the whole of this enlargement of old ballad and chronicle except the character of another giant and of a rebel angel for even morgante 's history though tell in a very different manner have its prototype in the fiction of the pretended archbishop -lrb- 7 -rrb- the paladin be well distinguish from one another orlando as foremost alike in prowess and magnanimity rinaldo by he vehemence ricciardetto by he amours astolfo by a ostentatious rashness and self-committal but in all these respects they appear to have be make to the author 's hand neither do the poem exhibit any prevail force of imagery or of expression apart from popular idiomatic phraseology still less though it have plenty of infernal magic do it present we with any magical enchantment of the alluring order as in ariosto or with love-story as good as boiardo 's or even with any of the luxury of landscape and description that be to be find in both of those poet albeit in the fourteenth canto there be a long _ catalogue raisonné _ of the whole animal creation which a lady have work for rinaldo on a pavilion of silk and gold to these negative fault must be add the positive one of too many trifling unconnected and uninteresting incident -lrb- at least to reader who can not taste the flavor of the racy tuscan idiom -rrb- great occasional prolixity even in the best as well as worst passage not except orlando 's die speech harshness in spite of he fluency -lrb- accord to foscolo -rrb- and even bad grammar too many low or over-familiar form of speech -lrb- so the graver critic allege though perhaps from want of animal spirit or a more comprehensive discernment -rrb- and lastly -lrb- to say nothing of the question as to the gravity or levity of the theology -rrb- the strange exhibition of whole successive stanza contain as many question or affirmation as line and commence each line with the same word they meet the eye like palisado or a file of soldier and turn truth and pathos itself into a jest they be most likely imitate from the popular ballad the following be the order of word in which a young lady think fit to complain of a desert into which she have be carry away by a giant after seven initiatory o 's address to she friend and to life in general she change the key into e : e ' questa la mia patria dov ' io nacquus e ' questo il mio palagio e ' l mio castello e ' questo il nido ov ' alcun tempo giacquus e ' questo il padre e ' l mio dolce fratello e ' questo il popol dov ' io tanto piacquus e ' questo il regno giusto antico e bello e ' questo il porto de la mia salute e ' questo il premio d' ogni mia virtute ove son or le mie purpuree veste ove son or le gemme e le ricchezze ove son or già le notturne feste ove son or le mie delicatezze ove son or le mie compagne oneste ove son or le fuggite dolcezze ove son or le damigelle mie ove son dice omè non son già quie -lrb- 8 -rrb- be this the country then where i be bear be this my palace and my castle this be this the nest i wake in every morn be this my father 's and my brother 's kiss be this the land they breed I to adorn be this the good old bower of all my bliss be this the haven of my youth and beauty be this the sure reward of all my duty where now be all my wardrobe and they treasure where now be all my riches and my rights where now be all the midnight feast and measure where now be all the delicate delight where now be all the partner of my pleasure where now be all the sweet of sound and sight where now be all my maiden ever near where do i say alas alas not here there be seven more where now include lover and proffer husband and romance and end with the startling question and answer -- the counterpoint of the former close -- ove son l' aspre selve e i lupi adesso e glus orsus e i draghi e i tigri son qui presso where now be all the wood and forest drear wolf tiger bear and dragon alas here these be all very natural thought and such no doubt as would actually pass through the mind of the young lady in the candor of desolation but the mechanical iteration of she mode of put they render they irresistibly ludicrous it remind we of the wager lay by the poor queen in the play of _ richard the second _ when she overhear the discourse of the gardener : my wretchedness _ unto a roar of pin _ they 'll talk of state do pulcus expect he friend lorenzo to keep a grave face during the recital of these passage or do he flatter himself that the comprehensive mind of he hearer could at one and the same time be amuse with the banter of some old song and the pathos of the new one -lrb- 9 -rrb- the want both of good love-episode and of description of external nature in the _ morgante _ be remarkable for pulcus 's tenderness of heart be constantly manifest and he describe himself as be almost absorb in he wood that he understand love well in all its force and delicacy be apparent from a passage connect with this pavilion the fair embroiderer in present it to she idol rinaldo undervalue it as a gift which he great heart nevertheless will not disdain to accept add with the true lavishment of the passion that she wish she could give he the sun and that if she be to say after all that it be she own hand which have work the pavilion she should be wrong for love himself do it rinaldo wish to thank she but be so strike with she magnificence and affection that the word die on he lip the way also in which another of these loving admirer of paladin conceive she affection for one of they and persuade a vehemently hostile suitor quietly to withdraw he claim by present he with a ring and a graceful speech be in a taste as high as any thing in boiardo and superior to the more animal passion of the love in they great successor -lrb- 10 -rrb- yet the tenderness of pulcus rather shew itself in the friendship of the paladin for one another and in perpetual little escape of generous and affectionate impulse this be one of the great charm of the _ morgante _ the first adventure in the book be orlando 's encounter with three giant in behalf of a good abbot in whom he discover a kinsman and this goodness and relationship combine move the achille of christendom to tear morgante one of these giant who be convert become a sort of squire to he conqueror and take such a liking to he that see he one day deliver himself not without peril out of the clutch of a devil he long to go and set free the whole of the other world from devil indeed there be no end to he affection for he rinaldo and other paladin meantime can not rest till they have set out in search of orlando they never meet or part with he without manifest a tenderness proportionate to they valor -- the old homeric candor of emotion the devil ashtaroth himself who be a great and proud devil assure rinaldo for whom he have conceive a regard that there be good feeling -lrb- _ gentilezza _ -rrb- even in hell and rinaldo not to hurt the feeling answer that he have no doubt of it or of the capability of friendship in that quarter and he say he be as sorry to part with he as with a brother the passage will be find in we abstract there be no such devil as these in dante though milton have something like they : devil with devil damn would firm concord hold : man only disagree it be suppose that the character of ashtaroth which be a very new and extraordinary one and do great honor to the daring goodness of pulcus 's imagination be not lose upon milton who be not only acquaint with the poem but expressly intimate the pleasure he take in it -lrb- 11 -rrb- rinaldo advise this devil as burn do lucifer to take a thought and mend ashtaroth who have be a seraph take no notice of the advice except with a wave of the recollection of happier time he bid the hero farewell and say he have only to summon he in order to receive he aid this retention of a sense of he former angelical dignity have be notice by foscolo and panizzus the two best writer on these italian poem -lrb- 12 -rrb- a calvinist would call the expression of the sympathy harden a humanist know it to be the result of a spirit exquisitely soften a unbounded tenderness be the secret of all that be beautiful in the serious portion of we author 's genius orlando 's good-natured giant weep even for the death of the scoundrel margutte and the awful hero himself at whose death nature be convulse and the heaven open beg he die horse to forgive he if ever he have wrong it a charm of another sort in pulcus and yet in most instance perhaps owe the best part of its charmingness to its be connect with the same feeling be he wit foscolo it be true say it be in general more severe than refine and it be perilous to differ with such a critic on such a point for much of it unfortunately be lose to a foreign reader in consequence of its dependance on the piquant old tuscan idiom and on popular saying and allusion yet i should think it impossible for pulcus in general to be severe at the expense of some more agreeable quality and i be sure that the portion of he wit most obvious to a foreigner may claim if not to have originate at least to have be very like the style of one who be among its declare admirer -- and who be a very polished writer -- voltaire it consist in treat a absurdity with a air as if it be none or as if it have be a pure matter of course erroneously mistaken for a absurdity thus the good abbot whose monastery be blockade by the giant -lrb- for the virtue and simplicity of he character must be bear in mind -rrb- after observe that the ancient father in the desert have not only locust to eat but manna which he have no doubt be rain down on purpose from heaven lament that the relish provide for himself and he brethren should have consist of shower of stone the stone while the abbot be speak come thunder down and he exclaim for god 's sake knight come in for the manna be fall this be exactly in the style of the _ dictionnaire philosophique _ so when margutte be ask what he believe in and say he believe in neither black nor blue but in a good capon whether roast or boil the reader be forcibly remind of voltaire 's traveller _ scarmentado _ who when he be desire by the tartar to declare which of they two party he be for the party of the black-mutton or the white-mutton answer that the dish be equally indifferent to he provide it be tender voltaire however do injustice to pulci when he pretend that in matter of belief he be like himself -- a mere scoffer the friend of lucrezium tornabuonus have evidently the tenderest veneration for all that be good and lovely in the catholic

irrelevant to a right faith it be observable that he freest expression be put in the mouth of the giant margutte the lowest of these character who be a invention of the author 's and a most extraordinary personage he be the first unmitigated blackguard in fiction and be the greatest as well as first pulcus be conjecture with great probability to have design he as a caricature of some real person for margutte be a greek who in point of moral have be horribly bring up and some of the greek refugee in italy be greatly dislike for the cynicism of they manners and the grossness of they life margutte be a glutton a drunkard a liar a thief and a blasphemer he boast of have every vice and no virtue except fidelity which be mean to reconcile morgante to he company but though the latter endure and even like it for he amusement he give he to understand that he look on he fidelity as only securable by the bastinado and make he the subject of he practical joke the respectable giant morgante die of the bite of a crab as if to spew on what trivial chance depend the life of the strongest margutte laugh himself to death at sight of a monkey put he boot on and off as though the good-natured poet mean at once to express he contempt of a merely and grossly anti-serious mode of existence and he consideration nevertheless towards the poor selfish wretch who have have no better training to this wit and this pathos let the reader add a style of singular ease and fluency -- rhyme often the most unexpected but never at a loss -- a purity of tuscan acknowledge by every body and ranking he among the authority of the language -- and a modesty in speaking of he own pretension equal only by he enthusiastic extolment of genius in other and the reader have before he the lively and affect hopeful charitable large-hearted luigus pulci the precursor and in some respects exemplar of ariosto and in milton 's opinion a poet worth read for the good use that may be make of he it have be strangely suppose that he friend politian and ficino the platonist not merely help he with they book -lrb- as he take a pride in tell we -rrb- but write a good deal of the latter part of the morgante particularly the speculation in matter of opinion as if -lrb- to say nothing of the difference of style -rrb- a man of genius however lively do not go through the gravest reflection in the course of he life or could not enter into any theological or metaphysical question to which he choose to direct he attention animal spirit themselves be too often but a counterbalance to the most thoughtful melancholy and one fit of jaundice or hypochondria might have enable the poet to see more vision of the unknown and the inscrutable in a single day than perhaps ever enter the imagination

be restive the stone seem as if it come from a good arm yes reply the holy father i do not deceive you i think some day or other they will cast the mountain itself on we orlando quiet he horse and then sit down to a meal after which he say abbot i must go and return the present that have be make to my horse the abbot with great tenderness endeavor to dissuade he but in vain upon which he cross he on the forehead and say go then and the blessing of god be with you orlando scale the mountain and come where passamonte be who see he alone measure he with he eye and ask he if he would stay with he for a page promise to make he comfortable stupid saracen say orlando i come to you accord to the will of god to be you death and not you foot-boy you have displeased he servant here and be no longer to be endure dog that you be the giant finding himself thus insult run in a fury to he weapon and return to orlando sling at he a large stone which strike he on the head with such force as not

passamonte be go away orlando recover and cry aloud how now giant do you fancy you have kill I turn back for unless you have wing you escape be out of the question dog of a renegade the giant greatly marvel turn back and stoop to pick up a stone orlando who have cortana naked in he hand cleft he skull upon which cursing mahomet the monster tumble die and blaspheme to the ground blaspheme fall the sour-hearted and cruel wretch but orlando in the mean while thank the father and the word the paladin go on seek for alabastro the second giant who when he see he endeavor to pluck up a great piece of stony earth by the root ho ho cry orlando you too be for throw stone be you then alabastro take he sling and fling at he so large a fragment as force orlando to defend himself for if it have strike he he would no more have need a surgeon -lrb- 1 -rrb- but collect he strength he thrust he sword into the giant 's breast and the loggerhead fall dead bless jesus be thank say the giant for i have always hear you call a perfect knight and as i say i will follow you all my life long and so converse they go together towards the abbey and by the way orlando talk with morgante of the dead giant and seek to comfort he say they have do the monk a thousand injury and we scripture say the good shall be reward and the evil punish and we must submit to the will of god the doctor of we church continue he be all agree that if those who be glorified in heaven be to feel pity for they miserable kindred who lie in such horrible confusion in hell they beatitude would come to nothing and this you see would plainly be unjust on the part of god but such be the firmness of they faith that what appear good to he appear good to they do what he may they hold it to be do well and that it be impossible for he to err so that if they very father and mother be suffer everlasting punishment it do not disturb they a atom this be the custom i assure you in the choir above -lrb- 2 -rrb- a word to the wise say morgante you shall see if i grieve for my brethren and whether or no i submit to the will of god and behave myself like a angel so dust to dust and now let we enjoy ourselves i will cut off they hand all four of they and take they to these holy monk that they may be sure they be dead and not fear to go out alone into the desert they will then be certain also that the lord have purify I and take I out of darkness and assure to I the kingdom of heaven so say the giant cut off the hand of he brethren and leave they body to the beast and bird they go to the abbey where the abbot be expect orlando in great anxiety but the monk not know what have happen run to the abbot in great haste and alarm say will you suffer this giant to come in and when the abbot see the giant he change countenance orlando perceive he thus disturb make haste and say abbot peace be with you the giant be a christian he believe in christ and have renounce he false prophet mahomet and morgante shew the hand in proof of he faith the abbot thank heaven with great contentment of mind the abbot do much honor to morgante compare he with st paul and they rest there many day one day wander over the house they enter a room where the abbot keep a quantity of armor and morgante see a bow which please he and he fasten it on now there be in the place a great scarcity of water and orlando say like he good brother morgante i wish you would fetch we some water command I as you please say he and place a great tub on he shoulder he go towards a spring at which he have be accustom to drink at the foot of the mountain have reach the spring he suddenly hear a great noise in the forest he take a arrow from the quiver place it in the bow and raise he head see a great herd of swine rush towards the spring where he stand morgante shoot one of they clean through the head and lay he sprawl another as if in revenge run towards the giant without give he time to use a second arrow so he lend he a cuff on the head which break the bone and kill he also which stroke the rest see flee in haste through the valley morgante then place the tub full of water upon one of he shoulder and the two porker on the other and return to the abbey which be at some distance without spilling a drop the monk be delighted to see the fresh water but still more the pork for there be no animal to whom food come amiss they let they breviary therefore go to sleep a while and fall heartily to work so that the cat and dog have reason to lament the polish of the bone but why do we stay here do nothing say orlando one day to morgante and he shake hand with the abbot and tell he he must take he leave i must go say he and make up for lose time i ought to have go long ago my good father but i can not tell you what i feel within I at the content i have enjoy here in you company i shall bear in mind and in heart with I for ever the abbot the abbey and this desert so great be the love they have raise in I in so short a time the great god who reign above must thank you for I in he own abode bestow on we you benediction and do not forget we in you prayer when the abbot hear the county orlando talk thus he heart melt within he for tenderness and he say knight if we have fail in any courtesy due to you prowess and great gentleness -lrb- and indeed what we have do have be but little -rrb- pray put it to the account of we ignorance and of the place which we inhabit we be but poor man of the cloister better able to regale you with mass and orison and paternoster than with dinner and supper you have so take this heart of mine by the many noble quality i have see in you that i shall be with you still wherever you go and on the other hand you will always be present here with I this seem a contradiction but you be wise and will take my meaning discreetly you have save the very life and spirit within we for so much perplexity have those giant cast about we place that the way to the lord among we be block up may he who send you into these wood reward the justice and piety by which we be deliver from we trouble thanks be to he and to you we shall all be disconsolate at you departure we shall grieve that we can not detain you among we for month and year but you do not wear these weed you bear arm and armor and you may possibly merit as well in carry those as in wear this cap you read you bible and you virtue have be the means of shew the giant the way to heaven go in peace then and prosper whoever you may be i do not seek you name but if ever i be ask who it be that come among we i shall say that it be a angel from god if there be any armor or other thing that you would have go into the room where it be and take it if you have any armor that would suit my companion reply orlando that i will accept with pleasure come and see say the abbot and they go to a room that be full of armor morgante look all about but could find nothing large enough except a rusty breast-plate which fit he marvellously it have belong to a enormous giant who be kill there of old by orlando 's father milo of angrante there be a painting on the wall which tell the whole story : how the giant have lay cruel and long siege to the abbey and how he have be overthrow at last by the great milo orlando see this say within himself : o god unto whom all thing be know how come milo here who destroy this giant and read certain inscription which be there he could no longer keep a firm countenance but the tear run down he cheek when the abbot see orlando weep and he brow redden and the light of he eye become child-like for sweetness he ask he the reason but find he still dumb with emotion he say i do not know whether you be overpower by admiration of what be paint in this chamber you must know that i be of high descent though not through lawful wedlock i believe i may say i be nephew or sister 's son to no less a man than that rinaldo who be so great a paladin in the world though my own father be not of a lawful mother ansuigus be he name my own out in the world be chiaramonte and this milo be my father 's brother ah gentle baron for bless jesus ' sake tell I what name be yours orlando all glowing with affection and bath in tear reply my dear abbot and cousin he before you be you orlando upon this they run for tenderness into each other 's arm weep on both side with a sovereign affection too high to be express the abbot be so over-joyed that he seem as if he would never have do embrace orlando by what fortune say the knight do i find you in this obscure place tell I my dear abbot how be it you become a monk and do not follow arm like myself and the rest of we it be the will of god reply the abbot hasten to give he feeling utterance many and diver be the path he point out for we by which to arrive at he city some walk it with the sword -- some with pastoral staff nature make the inclination different and therefore there be different way for we to take : enough if we all arrive safely at one and the same place the last as well as the first we be all pilgrim through many kingdom we all wish to go to rome orlando but we go pick out we journey through different road such be the trouble in body and soul bring upon we by that sin of the old apple day and night be i here with my book in hand -- day and night do you ride about hold you sword and sweating oft both in sun and shadow and all to get round at last to the home from which we depart -- i say all out of anxiety and hope to get back to we home of old and the giant hear they talk of these thing shed tear also the paladin and the giant quit the abbey the one on horseback and the other on foot and journey through the desert till they come to a magnificent castle the door of which stand open they enter and find room furnish in the most splendid manner -- bed cover with cloth of gold and floor rejoice in variegated marble there be even a feast prepare in the saloon but nobody to eat it or to speak to they orlando suspect some trap and do not quite like it but morgante think nothing worth consider but the feast who care for the host say he when there be such a dinner let we eat as much as we can and bear off the rest i always do that when i have the picking of castle they accordingly sit down and be very hungry with they day 's journey devour heap of the good thing before they eat with all the vigor of health and drinking to a pitch of weakness -lrb- 3 -rrb- they sit late in this manner enjoy themselves and then retire for the night into rich bed but what be they astonishment in the morning at find that they could not get out of the place there be no door all the entrance have vanish even to any feasible window we must be dream say orlando my dinner be no dream i 'll swear say the giant as for the rest let it be a dream if it please continue to search up and down they at length find a vault with a tomb in it and out of the tomb come a voice say you must encounter with I or stay here for ever lift therefore the stone that cover I do you hear that say morgante i 'll have he out if it be the devil himself perhaps it be two devil filthy-dog and foul-mouth or itching and evil-tail -lrb- 4 -rrb- have he out say orlando whoever he be even be it as many devil as be rain out of heaven into the center morgante lift up the stone and out leap surely enough a devil in the likeness of a dried-up dead body black as a coal orlando seize he and the devil grapple with orlando morgante be for join he but the paladin bid he keep back it be a hard struggle and the devil grin and laugh till the giant who be a master of wrestling could bear it no longer : so he double he up and in spite of all he effort thrust he back into the tomb you 'll never get out say the devil if you leave I shut up why not inquire the paladin because you giant 's baptism and my deliverance must go together answer the devil if he be not baptise you can have no deliverance and if i be not deliver i can prevent it still take my word for it orlando baptise the giant the two companion then issue forth and hear a mighty noise in the house look back and see it all vanish i could find it in my heart say morgante to go down to those same region below and make all the devil disappear in like manner why should not we do it we would set free all the poor soul there egad i would cut off mino 's tail -- i would pull out charon 's beard by the root -- make a sop of phlegya and a sup of phlegethon -- unseat pluto -- kill cerberus and the fury with a punch of the face a-piece -- and set beelzebub scamper like a dromedary you might find more trouble than you wot of quoth orlando and get worst besides better keep the straight path than thrust you head into out-of-the-way place morgante take he lord 's advice and go straightforward with he through many great adventure help he with loving good-will as often as he be permit sometimes as he pioneer and sometimes as he finisher of troublesome work such as a slaughter of some thousand of infidel now he chuck a spy into a river -- now fell a rude ambassador to the earth -lrb- for he do not stand upon ceremony -rrb- -- now clear a space round he in battle with the clapper of a old bell which he have find at the monastery -- now double up a king in he tent and bear he away tent and all and a paladin with he because he would not let the paladin go in the course of these service the giant be leave to take care of a lady and lose he master for a time but the office be at a end he set out to rejoin he and arrive at a cross-road meet with a very extraordinary personage this be a giant huger than himself swarthy-faced horrible brutish he come out of a wood and appear to be journey somewhere morgante who have the great bell-clapper in he hand above-mentioned strike it on the ground with astonishment as much as to say who the devil be this and then set himself on a stone by the way-side to observe the creature what be you name traveller say morgante as it come up my name 's margutte say the phenomenon i intend to be a giant myself but altered my mind you see and stop half-way so that i be only twenty foot or so i be glad to see you quoth he brother-giant but tell I be you christian or saracen do you believe in christ or in _ apollo _ to tell you the truth say the other i believe neither in black nor blue but in a good capon whether it be roast or boil i believe sometimes also in butter and when i can get it in new wine particularly the rough sort but above all i believe in wine that be good and old mahomet 's prohibition of it be all moonshine i be the son you must know of a greek nun and a turkish bishop and the first thing i learn be to play the fiddle i use to sing homer to it i be then concern in a brawl in a mosque in which the old bishop somehow happen to be kill so i tie a sword to my side and go to seek my fortune accompany by all the possible sin of turk and greek people talk of the seven deadly sin but i have seventy-seven that never quit I summer or winter by which you may judge of the amount of my venial one i be a gambler a cheat a ruffian a highwayman a pick-pocket a glutton -lrb- at beef or blow -rrb- have no shame whatever love to let every body know what i can do lie besides about what i can not do have a particular attachment to sacrilege swallow perjury like fig never give a farthing to any body but beg of every body and abuse they into the bargain look upon not spilling a drop of liquor as the chief of all the cardinal virtue but must own i be not much give to assassination murder be inconvenient and one thing i be bind to acknowledge which be that i never betray a messmate that be as well observe morgante because you see as you do not believe in any thing else i would have you believe in this bell-clapper of mine so now as you have be candid with I and i be well instruct in you way we 'll pursue we journey together the best of giant in those day be not scrupulous in they mode of live so that one of the best and one of the worst get on pretty well together empty the larder on the road and pay nothing but douse on the chop when they could find no inn they hunt elephant and crocodile morgante who be the braver of the two delighted to banter and sometimes to cheat margutte and he eat up all the fare which make the other notwithstanding the credit he give himself for readiness of wit and tongue cut a very sorry figure and seriously remonstrate : i reverence you say margutte in other matter but in eat you really do not behave well he who deprive I of my share at meal be no friend at every mouthful of which he rob I i seem to lose a eye i be for share every thing to a nicety even if it be no better than a fig you be a fine fellow say morgante you gain upon I

know what sort of fellow i be do not i tell you i have every sin and shame under heaven and have i deceive you by the exhibition of a single virtue morgante could not help laugh at a candor of this excessive nature so they go on they way till they come to a wood where they rest themselves by a fountain and margutte fall fast asleep he have a pair of boot on which morgante feel tempt to draw off that he might see what he would do on wake he accordingly do so and throw they to a little distance among the bush the sleeper awake in good time and look and search round about suddenly burst into roar of laughter a monkey have get the boot and sit pull they on and off make the most ridiculous gesture the monkey busy himself and the light-minded drunkard laugh and at every fresh gesticulation

he own day be close by a far baser though not so petty a cause how shall i speak of it exclaim the poet how think of the horrible slaughter about to fall on the christian and they greatest man so that not a dry eye shall be leave in france how express my disgust at the traitor gan whose heart a thousand pardon from he sovereign and the most undeserved rescue of he by the warrior he betray could not shame or soften how mourn the weakness of charle always deceive by he and always trust how dare to present to my mind the good the great the ever-generous orlando bring by the traitor into the doleful pass of roncesvalle and the hand of myriad of he enemy so that even he superhuman strength avail not to deliver he out of the slaughterhouse and he blow the blast with he die breath which be the mightiest the farthest hear and the most melancholy sound that ever come to the ear of the undeceived gan be know well to every body but he confide sovereign the paladin know he well and in they moment of indignant disgust often tell he so though they spare he the consequence of he misdeed and even incur the most frightful peril to deliver he out of the hand of he enemy but he be brave he be in favor with the sovereign who be also they kinsman and they be loyal and loving man and know that the wretch envy they for the greatness of they achievement and might do the state a mischief so they allow themselves to take a kind of scornful pleasure in put up with he they cousin malagigus the enchanter have himself assist gan though he know he best of all and have prophesy that the innumerable endeavor of he envy to destroy he king and country would bring some terrible evil at last to all chistendom the evil alas be at hand the doleful time have come it will be follow it be true by a worse fate of the wretch himself but not till the valley of the pyrenee have run river of blood and all france be in mourning -lrb- footnote 1 : a common pleasantry in the old romance -- galaor go in and

-rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : o vita nostra debole e fallace -rrb- the battle of roncesvalle notice this be the sad and fearful story of the roncesvalle fight a event which national and religious exaggeration impressed deeply on the popular mind of europe hence italian romance and spanish ballad : hence the famous passage in milton when charlemain with all he peerage fall by fontarabbium : hence dante 's record of the _ dolorosa rotta _ -lrb- dolorous rout -rrb- in the _ inferno _ where he compare the voice of nimrod with the horn sound by the die orlando : hence the peasant in cervante who be meet by don quixote singing the battle as he come along the road in the morning : and hence the song of roland actually thunder forth by the army of william the conqueror as they advance against the english but charlemagne do not fall as milton have state nor do pulci make he do so in this respect if in little else the italian poet adhere to the fact the whole story be a remarkable instance of what can be do by poetry and popularity towards misrepresent and aggrandise a petty though striking adventure the simple fact be the cut off the rear of charlemagne 's army by the revolt gascon as he return from a successful expedition into spain two or three only of he noble perish among whom be he nephew roland the obscure warden of he march of brittany but charlemagne be the temporal head of christendom the poet constitute he nephew its champion and hence all the glory and superhuman exploit of the orlando of pulcus and ariosto the whole assumption of the wickedness of the saracen particularly of the then saracen king of spain whom pulci 's authority the pseudo-archbishop turpin strangely call marsilius be nothing but a pious fraud the pretended marsilius have be no less a person than the great and good abdoùlrahmaùn the first who wrest the dominion of that country out of the hand of the usurper of he family-rights yet so potent and long-lived be the most extravagant fiction when genius have put its heart into they that to this day we read of the devoted orlando and he friend not only with gravity but with the liveliest emotion the battle of roncesvalle a miserable man be i cry the poet for orlando beyond a doubt die in roncesvalle and die therefore he must in my verse altogether impossible be it to save he i think to make a pleasant ending of this my poem so that it should be happier somehow throughout than melancholy but though gan will die at last orlando must die before he and that make a tragedy of all i have a doubt whether consistently with the truth i could give the reader even that sorry satisfaction for at the beginning of the dreadful battle orlando 's cousin rinaldo who be say to have join it before it be over and there as well as afterwards to have avenge he death be far away from the seat of slaughter in egypt and how be i to suppose that he could arrive soon enough in the valley of the pyrenee but a angel upon earth shew I the secret even angelo poliziano the glory of he age and country he inform I how arnauld the provençal poet have write of this very matter and bring the paladin from egypt to france by means of the wonderful skill in occult science possess by he cousin malagigus -- a wonder to the ignorant but not so marvellous to those who know that all the creation be full of wonder and who have different mode of relate the same event by and by a great many thing will be do in the world of which we have no conception now and people will be incline to believe they work of the devil when in fact they will be very good work and contribute to angelical effect whether the devil be force to have a hand in they or not for evil itself can work only in subordination to good so listen when the astonishment come and reflect and think the best meantime we must speak of another and more truly devilish astonishment and of the pang of mortal flesh and blood the traitor gan for the fiftieth time have secretly bring the infidel from all quarter against he friend and master the emperor charle and charle by the help of orlando have conquer they all the worst of they marsilius king of spain have agree to pay the court of france tribute and gan in spite of all the suspicion he excite in this particular instance and he known villany at all time have succeed in persuade he credulous sovereign to let he go ambassador into spain where he put a final seal to he enormity by plot the destruction of he employer and the special overthrow of orlando charle be now old and white-haired and gan be so too but the one be only confirm in he credulity and the other in he crime the traitor embrace orlando over and over again at take leave pray he to write if he have any thing to say before the arrangement with marsilius and take such pain to seem loving and sincere that he villany be manifest to every one but the old monarch he fasten with equal tenderness on uliviero who smile contemptuously in he face and think to himself you may make as many fair speech as you choose but you lie all the other paladin who be present think the same and they say as much to the emperor add that on no account should gin be send ambassador to marsilius but charle be infatuate he beard and he credulity have grow old together gan be receive with great honor in spain by marsilius the king attend by he lord come fifteen mile out of saragossa to meet he and then conduct he into the city amid tumult of delight there be nothing for several day but ball and game and exhibition of chivalry the lady throw flower on the head of the french knight and the people shout france france mountjoy and st deni gan make a speech like a demosthene to king marsilius in public but he make he another in private like nobody but himself the king and he be sit in a garden they be traitor both and begin to understand from one another 's look that the real object of the ambassador be yet to be discuss marsilius accordingly assume a more than usually cheerful and confidential aspect and take he visitor by the hand say you know the proverb mr ambassador -- ` at dawn the mountain afternoon the fountain ' different thing at different hour so here be a fountain to accommodate we it be a very beautiful fountain so clear that you see you face in it as in a mirror and the spot be encircle with fruit-tree that quiver with the fresh air gan praise it very much contrive to insinuate on one subject he satisfaction with the glimpse he get into another marsilius understand he and as he resume the conversation and gradually encourage a mutual disclosure of they thought gan without appear to look he in the face be enable to do so by contemplate the royal visage in the water where he see its expression become more and more what he desire marsilius meantime see the like symptom in the face of gan by degree he begin to touch on that dissatisfaction with charlemagne and he court which he know be in both they mind : he lament not as to the ambassador but as to the friend the injury which he say he have receive from charle in the repeat attack on he dominion and the emperor 's wish to crown orlando king of they till at length he plainly utter he belief that if that tremendous paladin be but dead good man would get they rights and he visitor and himself have all thing at they disposal gan heave a sigh as if he be unwillingly compel to allow the force of what the king say but unable to contain himself long he lift up he face radiant with triumphant wickedness and exclaim every word you utter be truth die he must and die also must uliviero who strike I that foul blow at court be it treachery to punish affront like those i have plan every thing -- i have settle every thing already with they besotted master orlando could not be expect to be bring hither where he have be accustom to look for a crown but he will come to the spanish border -- to roncesvalle -- for the purpose of receive the tribute charle will await he at no great distance in st john pie de port orlando will bring but a small band with he you when you meet he will have secretly you whole army at you back you surround he and who receive tribute then the new juda have scarcely utter these word when the delight of he and he associate be interrupt by a change in the face of nature the sky be suddenly overcast it thunder and lighten a laurel be split in two from head to foot the fountain run into burn blood there be a earthquake and the carob-tree under which gan be sit and which be of the species on which juda iscariot hang himself drop some of its fruit on he head the hair of the head rise in horror marsilius as well as gan be appal at this omen but on assemble he soothsayer they come to the conclusion that the laurel-tree turn the omen against the emperor the successor of the cæsars though one of they renew the consternation of gan by say that he do not understand the meaning of the tree of juda and intimate that perhaps the ambassador could explain it gan relieve he consternation with anger the habit of wickedness prevail over all consideration and the king prepare to march for roncesvalle at the head of all he force gan write to charlemagne to say how humbly and properly marsilius be come to pay the tribute into the hand of orlando and how handsome it would be of the emperor to meet he halfway as agree upon at st john pie de port and so be ready to receive he after the payment at he footstool he add a brilliant account of the tribute and its accompany present they include a crown in the shape of a garland which have a carbuncle in it that give light in darkness two lion of a immeasurable length and aspect that frighten every body some lively buffalo leopard crocodile and giraffe arm and armor of all sort and ape and monkey seat among the rich merchandise that load the back of the camel this imaginary treasure contain furthermore two enchanted spirit call floro and faresse who be confine in a mirror and be to tell the emperor wonderful thing particularly floro -lrb- for there be nothing so nice in its detail as lie -rrb- : and orlando be to have heap of caravan full of eastern wealth and a hundred white horse all with saddle and bridle of gold there be a beautiful vest too for uliviero all over jewel worth ten thousand seraffus or more the good emperor write in turn to say how pleased he be with the ambassador 's diligence and that matter be arrange precisely as he wish he court however have its suspicion still nobody could believe that gan have not some new mischief in contemplation little nevertheless do they imagine after the base endeavor he have but lately make against they that he have immediately plot a new and greater one and that he object in bring charle into the neighborhood of roncesvalle be to deliver he more speedily into the hand of marsilius in the event of the latter 's destruction of orlando orlando however do as he lord and sovereign desire he go to roncesvalle accompany by a moderate train of warrior not dream of the atrocity that await he gin himself meantime have hasten on to france before marsilius in order to shew himself free and easy in the presence of charle and secure the success of he plot while marsilius to make assurance doubly sure bring into the pass of roncesvalle no less than three army who be successively to fall on the paladin in case of the worst and so extinguish he with number he have also by gan 's advice bring heap of wine and good cheer to be set before he victim in the first instance for that say the traitor will render the onset the more effective the feaster be unarmed and supposing prodigy of valor to await even the attack of you second army you will have no trouble with you third one thing however i must not forget add he my son baldwin be sure to be with orlando you must take care of he life for my sake i give he this vest off my own body say the king let he wear it in the battle and have no fear my soldier shall be direct not to touch he gin go away rejoice to france he embrace the court and he sovereign all round with the air of a man who have bring they nothing but blessing and the old king weep for very tenderness and delight something be go on wrong and look very black thought malagigus the good wizard and rinaldo be not here and it be indispensably necessary that he should be i must find out where he be and ricciardetto too and send for they with all speed and at any price malagigus call up by he art a wise terrible and cruel spirit name ashtaroth -- no light personage to deal with -- no little spirit such as play trick with you like a fairy a much blacker visitant be this tell I and tell I truly of rinaldo say malagigus to the spirit hard look the demon at the paladin and say nothing he aspect be clouded and violent he wish to see whether he summoner retain all the force of he art the enchanter with a aspect still cloudier bade ashtaroth lay down that look while give this order he also make sign indicative of a disposition to resort to angrier compulsion and the devil apprehend that he would confine he in some hateful place loosen he tongue and say you have not tell I what you desire to know of rinaldo i desire to know what he have be do and where he be return the enchanter he have be conquer and baptise the world east and west say the demon and be now in egypt with ricciardetto and what have gan be plot with marsilius inquire malagigus and what be to come of it on neither of those point can i enlighten you say the devil i be not attend to gin at the time and we fall spirit know not the future have we do so we have not be so willing to incur the danger of fall all i discern be that by the sign and comet in the heaven something dreadful be about to happen -- something very strange treacherous and bloody and that gan have a seat ready prepared for he in hell within three day cry the enchanter loudly fetch rinaldo and ricciardetto into the pass of roncesvalle do it and i hereby undertake never to summon thee more suppose they will not trust themselves with I say the spirit enter rinaldo 's horse and bring he whether he trust thee or not it shall be do return the demon and my serving-devil foul-mouth or fire-red shall enter the horse of ricciardetto doubt it not be i not wise and thyself powerful there be a earthquake and ashtaroth disappear marsilius have now make he first movement towards the destruction of orlando by send before he he vassal-king blanchardin with he present of wine and other luxury the temperate but courteous hero take they in good part and distribute they as the traitor wish and then blanchardin on pretence of go forward to salute charlemagne at st john pie de port return and put himself at the head of the second army which be the post assign he by he liege lord the device on he flag be a apollo on a field azure king falseron whose son orlando have slay in battle head the first army the device of which be a black figure of the devil belphegor on a dapple-grey field the third army be under king balugante and have for ensign a mahomet with golden wing in a field of red marsilius make a speech to they at night in which he confess he ill faith but defend it on the ground of charle 's hatred of they religion and of the example of judith and holoferne he say that he have not come there to pay tribute and sell he countryman for slave but to make all christendom pay tribute to they as conqueror and he conclude by recommend to they good-will the son of he friend gan whom they would know by the vest he have send he and who be the only soul among the christian they be to spare this son of gan meantime and several of the paladin who be disgust with charle 's credulity and anxious at all event to be with orlando have join the hero in the fate valley so that the little christian host consider the tremendous valor of they lord and he friend and the comparative inefficiency of that of the infidel be at any rate not to be sell for nothing rinaldo alas the second thunderbolt of christendom be destine not to be there in time to save they life he could only avenge the dreadful tragedy and prevent still worse consequence to the whole christian court and empire the paladin have in vain begged orlando to be on he guard against treachery and send for a more numerous body of man the great heart of the champion of the faith be unwilling to think the worst as long as he could help it he refuse to summon aid that might be superfluous neither would he do any thing but what he liege lord have desire and yet he could not wholly repress a misgive a shadow have fall on he heart great and cheerful as it be the anticipation of he friend disturb he in spite of the face with which he meet they i be not sure that he do not by a certain instinctive foresight expect death itself but he feel bind not to encourage the impression besides time press the moment of the looked-for tribute be at hand and little combination of circumstance determine often the greatest event king blanchardin have bring orlando 's people a luxurious supper king marsilius be to arrive early next day with the tribute and uliviero accordingly with the morning sun ride forth to reconnoitre and see if he could discover the peaceful pomp of the spanish court in the distance guottibuoffus be with he a warrior who have expect the very worst and repeatedly implore orlando to believe it possible uliviero and he ride up the mountain nearest they and from the top of it behold the first army of marsilius already form in the pass o guottibuoffus exclaim he behold thy prophecy come true behold the last day of the glory of charle every where i see the arm of the traitor around we i feel paris tremble all the way through france to the ground beneath my foot o malagigus too much in the right wert thou o devil gan this then be the consummation of thy good office uliviero put spur to he horse and gallop back down the mountain to orlando well cry the hero what news bad news say he cousin such as you would not hear of yesterday marsilius be here in arm and all the world have come with he the paladin press round orlando and entreat he to sound he horn in token that he need help he only answer be to mount he horse and ride up the mountain with sansonetto as soon however as he cast forth he eye and behold what be round about he he turn in sorrow and look down into roncesvalle and say o valley miserable indeed the blood that be shed in thee this day will color thy name for ever many of the paladin have ride after he and they again press he to sound he horn if only in pity to he own people he say if cæsar and alexander be here scipio and hannibal and nebuchadnezzar with all he flag and death stare I in the face with he knife in he hand never would i sound my horn for the baseness of fear orlando 's little camp be furious against the saracen they arm themselves with the greatest impatience there be nothing but lacing of helmet and mount of horse and good archbishop turpin go from rank to rank exhort and encourage the warrior of christ accoutrements and habiliment be put on the wrong way word and deed mix in confusion man run against one another out of very absorption in themselves all the place full of cry of arm arm the enemy and the trumpet clang over all against the mountain-echo orlando and he captain withdraw for a moment to consultation he fairly groan for sorrow and at first have not a word to say so wretched he feel at have bring he people to die in roncesvalle uliviero speak first he could not resist the opportunity of comforting himself a little in he despair with refer to he unheeded advice you see cousin say he what have come at last would to god you have attend to what i say to what malagigus say to what we all say i tell you marsilius be nothing but a anointed scoundrel yet forsooth he be to bring we tribute and charle be this moment expect he mummery at st john pie de port do ever any body believe a word that gan say but charle and now you see this rotten fruit have come to a head -- this medlar have get its crown orlando say nothing in answer to uliviero for in truth he have nothing to say he break away to give order to the camp bid they take refreshment and then address both officer and man he say i confess that if it have enter my heart to conceive the king of spain to be such a villain never would you have see this day he have exchange with I a thousand courtesy and good word and i think that the worse enemy we have be before the better friend we have become now i fancy every human be capable of this kind of virtue on a good opportunity save indeed such base-hearted wretch as can never forgive they very forgiver and of these i certainly do not suppose he to be one let we die if we must die like honest and gallant man so that it shall be say of we it be only we body that die it become we soul to be invincible and we glory immortal we motto must be ' a good heart and no hope ' the reason why i do not sound the horn be partly because i think it do not become we and partly because we liege lord could be of little use even if he hear it let gan have he glut of we like a carrion crow but let he find we under heap of he saracen a example for all time heaven my friend be with we if earth be against we methink i see it open this moment ready to receive we soul amidst crown of glory and therefore as the champion of god 's church i give you my benediction and the good archbishop here will absolve you and so please god we shall all go to heaven and be happy and with these word orlando spring to he horse cry away against the saracen but he have no sooner turn he face than he weep bitterly and say o holy virgin think not of I the sinner orlando but have pity on these thy servant archbishop turpin do as orlando say give the whole band he benediction at once and absolve they from they sin so that every body take comfort in the thought of die for christ and thus they embrace one another weep and then lance be put to thigh and the banner be raise that be win in the joust at aspramont and now with a mighty dust and a infinite sound of horn and tambour and trumpet which come fill the valley the first army of the infidel make its appearance horse neigh and a thousand pennon fly in the air king falseron lead they on say to he officer now gentleman recollect what i say the first battle be for the leader only -- and above all let nobody dare to lay a finger on orlando he belong to myself the revenge of my son 's death be mine i will cut the man down that come between we now friend say orlando every man for himself and st michael for we all there be no one here that be not a perfect knight and he might well say it for the flower of all france be there except rinaldo and ricciardetto every man a pick man all friend and constant companion of orlando there be richard of normandy and guottibuoffus and uliviero and count anselm and avolio and avino and the gentle berlinghierus and he brother and sansonetto and the good duke egibard and astolfo the englishman and angiolin of bayona and all the other paladin of france except those two whom i have mention and so the captain of the little troop and of the great array sit look at one another and single one another out as the latter come on and then either side begin raise they war-cry and the mob of the infidel halt and the knight put spear in rest and run for a while two and two in succession each one against the other astolfo be the first to move he run against arlotto of sorium and angiolin then run against malducco and mazzarigus the renegade come against avino and uliviero be bear forth by he horse rondel who could not stand still against malprimo the first of the captain of falseron and now lance begin to be paint red without any brush but themselves and the new color extend itself to the buckler and the cuish and the cuirass and the trappings of the steed astolfo thrust he antagonist 's body out of the saddle and he soul into the other world and angiolin give and take a terrible blow with malducco but he horse bear he onward and avino have something of the like encounter with mazzarigus but uliviero though he receive a thrust which hurt he send he lance right through the heart of malprimo falseron be daunt at this blow verily think he this be a miracle uliviero do not press on among the saracen he wound be too painful but orlando now put himself and he whole band into motion and you may guess what a uproar ensue the sound of the rattle of the blow and helmet be as if the forge of vulcan have be throw open falseron beheld orlando come so furiously that he think he a lucifer who have burst he chain and be quite of another mind than when he propose to have he all to himself on the contrary he recommend himself to he god and turn away beg for a more auspicious season of revenge but orlando hail and arrest he with a terrible voice say o thou traitor be this the end to which old quarrel be make up dost thou not blush thou and thy fellow-traitor marsilius to have kiss I on the cheek like a juda when last thou wert in france orlando have never shewn such anger in he countenance as he do that day he dash at falseron with a fury so swift and at the same time a mastery of he lance so marvellous that though he plunge it in the man 's body so as instantly to kill he the body do not move in the saddle the hero himself as he rush onward be fain to see the end of a stroke so perfect and turn he horse back he touch the carcass with he sword and it fall on the instant they say that it have no sooner fall than it disappear people get off they horse to lift up the body for it seem to be there still the armor be leave but when they come to handle the armor it be find as empty as the shell that be cast by a lobster o new and strange and portentous event -- proof manifest of the anger with which god regard treachery when the first infidel army behold they leader dead such fear fall upon they that they be for leave the field to the paladin but they be unable marsilius have draw the rest of he force round the valley like a net so that they shoulder be turn in vain orlando ride into the thick of they with count anselm by he side he rush like a tempest and wherever he go thunderbolt fall upon helmet the paladin drive here and there after they each make a whirlwind round about he and a bloody circle uliviero be again in the _ mêlée _ and walter of amulion throw himself into it and baldwin roar like a lion and avino and avolio reap the wretch ' head like a turnip-field and blow blind man 's eye and archbishop turpin himself have change he crozier for a lance and chase a new flock before he to the mountain yet what could be do against foe without number multitude fill up the space leave by the dead without stop marsilius from he anxious and rage post constantly pour they in the paladin be as unit to thousand why tarry the horse of rinaldo and ricciardetto the horse do not tarry but fate have be quicker than enchantment ashtaroth nevertheless have present himself to rinaldo in egypt as though he have issue out of a flash of lightning after tell he mission and give order to hundred of invisible spirit round about he -lrb- for the air be full of they -rrb- he and foul-mouth he servant enter the horse of rinaldo and ricciardetto which begin to neigh and snort and leap with the fiend within they till off they fly through the air over the pyramid crowd of spirit go like a tempest before they ricciardetto shut he eye at first on perceive himself so high in the air but he speedily become use to it though he look down on the sun at last in this manner they pass the desert and the sea-coast and the ocean and sweep the top of the pyrenee ashtaroth talk to they of wonder by the way for he be one of the wisest of the devil and know a great many thing which be then unknown to man he laugh for instance as they go over sea at the notion among other vain fancy that nothing be to be find beyond the pillar of hercule for say he the earth be round and the sea have a even surface all over it and there be nation on the other side of the globe who walk with they foot oppose to yours and worship other god than the christian hah say rinaldo and may i ask whether they can be save it be a bold thing to ask say the devil but do you take the redeemer for a partisan and fancy he die for you only be assure he die for the whole world antipode and all perhaps not one soul will be leave out the pale of salvation at last but the whole human race adore the truth and find mercy the christian be the only true religion but heaven love all goodness that believe honestly whatsoever the belief may be rinaldo be mightily take with the humanity of the devil 's opinion : but they be now approach the end of they journey and begin to hear the noise of the battle and he could no longer think of any thing but the delight of be near orlando and plunge into the middle of it you shall be in the very heart of it instantly say he bearer i love you and would fain do all you desire do not fancy that all nobleness of spirit be lose among we people below you know what the proverb say ` there be never a fruit however degenerate but will taste of its stock ' i be of a different order of being once and -- but it be as well not to talk of happy time yonder be marsilius and there go orlando farewell and give I a place in you memory rinaldo could not find word to express he sense of the devil 's good-will nor of that of foul mouth himself he say : ashtaroth i be as sorry to part with you as if you be a brother and i certainly do believe that nobleness of spirit exist as you say among you people below i shall be glad to see you both sometimes if you can come and i pray god -lrb- if my poor prayer be worth any thing -rrb- that you may all repent and obtain he pardon for without repentance you know nothing can be do for you if i might suggest a favor return ashtaroth since you be so good as to wish to do I one persuade malagigus to free I from he service and i be yours for ever to serve you will be a pleasure to I you will only have to say ` ashtaroth ' and my

little chapel by the road-side in roncesvalle which have a couple of bell and on the top of that chapel do the devil place themselves in order that they might catch the soul of the infidel as they die and so carry they off to the infernal region guess if they wing have plenty to do that day guess if mino and rhadamanthus be busy and charon sing in he boat and lucifer hug himself for joy guess also if the table in heaven groan with nectar and ambrosia and good old st peter have a dry hair in he beard the two paladin on they horse drop right into the middle of the saracen and begin make such havoc about they that marsilius who overlook the fight from a mountain think he soldier have turn one against the other he therefore descend in fury with he third army and rinaldo see he come say to ricciardetto we have better be off here and join orlando and with these word he give he horse one turn round before he retreat so as to enable he sword to make a bloody circle about he and story say that he shear off twenty head in the whirl of it he then dash through the astonished beholder towards the battle of orlando who guess it could be no other than he cousin and almost drop from he horse out of desire to meet he ricciardetto follow rinaldo and uliviero come up at the same moment the rapture of the whole party be not to be express they almost die for joy after a thousand embrace and question and explanation and expression of astonishment -lrb- for the infidel hold aloof awhile to take breath from the horror and mischief they have undergo -rrb- orlando refresh he little band of hero and then draw rinaldo apart and say o my brother i feel such delight at see you i can hardly persuade myself i be not dream heaven be praise for it i have no other wish on earth now that i see

receive he homage at the town of st john i have never see a lucky day since you leave we i believe i have do for charle more than in duty bind and that my sin pursue I and i and mine must all perish in roncesvalle look to marsilius exclaim rinaldo he be right upon we marsilius be upon they surely enough at once furious and frightened at the come of the new paladin for he camp numerous as it be have not only hold aloof but turn about to fly like herd before the lion so he be force to drive they back and bring up he other troops reasonably think that such number must overwhelm at last if they could but be keep together not the less however for this do the paladin continue to fight as if with joy they kill and trample wheresoever they go rinaldo fatiguing himself with send infinite number of soul to ashtaroth and orlando make a bloody passage towards marsilius whom he hope to settle as he have do falseron in the course of this he tremendous progress the hero strike a youth on the head

go in revenge of whose death orlando turn the spot on which he die into a gulf of saracen blood rinaldo meet the luckless bujaforte who have just begin to explain how he seem to be fight on the side which he father hate when the impatient hero exclaim he who be not with I be against I and give he a volley of such horrible cuff about the head and ear that bujaforte die without be able to speak another word orlando cut he way to a spot in which there be a great struggle and uproar find the poor youth baldwin the son of gan with two spear in he breast i be no traitor now say baldwin and so say fall dead to the earth and orlando lift up he voice and weep for he be bitterly sorry to have be the cause of he death he then join rinaldo in the hottest of the tumult and all the survive paladin gather about they include turpin the archbishop who fight as hardily as the rest and the slaughter be lavish and horrible so that the eddy of the wind chuck the blood into the air and earth appear a very seething-cauldron of hell at length down go uliviero himself he have become blind with he own blood and smitten orlando without know he who have never receive such a blow in he life how now cousin cry orlando have you too go over to the enemy o my lord and master orlando cry the other i ask you pardon if i have strike you i can see nothing -- i be die the traitor arcaliffe have stab I in

together i have lose all hope all pride all wish to live any longer but not my love for uliviero come -- let we give they a few blow yet let they see what you can do with you die hand one faith one death one only wish be ours orlando lead he cousin 's horse where the press be thickest and dreadful be the strength of the die man and of he half-dying companion they make a street through which they pass out of the battle and orlando lead he cousin away to he tent and say wait a little till i return for i will go and sound the horn on the hill yonder ` ti of no use say uliviero and my spirit be fast go and desire to be with its lord and savior he would have say more but he word come from he imperfectly like those of a man in a dream only he cousin gather that he mean to commend to he he sister orlando 's wife alda the fair of whom indeed the great paladin have not think so much in this world as he might have do and with these imperfect word he expire but orlando no sooner see he dead than he feel as if he be leave alone on the earth and he be quite willing to leave it only he wish that charle at st john pie de port should hear how the case stand before he go and so he take up the horn and blow it three time with such force that the blood burst out of he nose and mouth turpin say that at the third blast the horn break in two in spite of all the noise of the battle the sound of the horn break over it like a voice out of the other world they say that bird fall dead at it and that the whole saracen army draw back in terror but fearfuller still be its effect at st john pie de port charlemagne be sit in the midst of he court when the sound reach he and gan be there the emperor be the first to hear it do you hear that say he to he noble do you hear the horn as i hear it upon this they all listen and gan feel he heart misgive he the horn sound the second time what be the meaning of this say charle orlando be hunting observe gan and the stag be kill he be at the old pastime that he be so fond of in aspramonte but when the horn sound yet a third time and the blast be one of so dreadful a vehemence every body look at the other and then they all look at gan in fury charle rise from he seat this be no hunting of the stag say he the sound go to my very heart and i confess make I tremble i be awaken out of a great dream o gan o gan not for thee do i blush but for myself and for nobody else o my god what be to be do but whatever be to be do must be do quickly take this villain gentleman and keep he in hard prison o foul and monstrous villain would to god i have not live to see this day o obstinate and enormous folly o malagigus have i but believe thy foresight ` tis thou go the wise man and i the grey-headed fool ogier the dane and namo and other in the bitterness of they grief and anger could not help remind the emperor of all which they have foretell but it be no time for word they put the traitor into prison and then charle with all he court take he way to roncesvalle grieve and pray it be afternoon when the horn sound and half a hour after it when the emperor set out and meantime orlando have return to the fight that he might do he duty however hopeless as long as he could sit he horse and the paladin be now reduce to four and though the saracen suffer themselves to be mow down like grass by they and they little band he find he end approach for toil and fever and so at length he withdraw out of the fight and ride all alone to a fountain which he know of where he have before quench he thirst he horse be wearier still than he and no sooner have its master alight than the beast kneel down as if to take leave and to say i have bring you to you place of rest fall dead at he foot orlando cast water on he from the fountain not wish to believe he dead but when he find it to no purpose he grieve for he as if he have be a human being and address he by name in tear and ask forgiveness if ever he have do he wrong they say that the horse at these word once more open he eye a little and look kindly at he master and so stir never more they say also that orlando then summon all he strength smite a rock near he with he beautiful sword durlindana think to shiver the steel in piece and so prevent its fall into the hand of the enemy but though the rock split like a slate and a deep fissure remain ever after to astonish the eye of pilgrim the sword remain unhurt o strong durlindana cry he o noble and worthy sword have i know thee from the first as i know thee now never would i have be bring to this pass and now rinaldo and ricciardetto and turpin come up have give chase to the saracen till they be weary and orlando give joyful welcome to he cousin and they tell he how the battle be win and then orlando knelt before turpin he face all in tear and begged remission of he sin and confess they and turpin give he absolution and suddenly a light come down upon he from heaven like a rainbow accompany with a sound of music and a angel stand in the air blessing he and then disappear upon which orlando fix he eye on the hilt of he sword as on a crucifix and embrace it and say lord vouchsafe that i may look on this poor instrument as on the symbol of the tree upon which thou sufferedst thy unspeakable martyrdom and so adjust the sword to he bosom and embrace it closer he raise he eye and appear like a creature seraphical and transfigured and in bow he head he breathe out he pure soul a thunder be then hear in the heaven and the heaven open and seem to stoop to the earth and a flock of angel be see like a white cloud ascend with he spirit who be know to be what they be by the tremble of they wing the white cloud shoot out golden fire so that the whole air be full of they and the voice of the angel mingle in song with the instrument of they brethren above which make a inexpressible harmony at once deep and dulcet the priestly warrior turpin and the two paladin and the hero 's squire terigus who be all on they knee forget they own being in follow the miracle with they eye it be now the office of that squire to take horse and ride off to the emperor at saint john pie de port and tell he of all that have occur but in spite of what he have just see he lay for a time overwhelm with grief he then rise and mount he steed and leave the paladin and the archbishop with the dead body who kneel about it guard it with weep love the good squire terigus meet the emperor and he cavalcade come towards roncesvalle and alight and fall on he knee tell he the miserable news and how all he people be slay but two of he paladin and himself and the good archbishop charle for anguish begin tear he white lock but terigus comfort he against so do by give a account of the manner of orlando 's death and how he have surely go to heaven nevertheless the squire himself be broken-hearted with grief and toil and he have scarcely add a denouncement of the traitor gan and a hope that the emperor would appease heaven finally by give he body to the wind than he say the cold of death be upon I and so he fall dead at the emperor 's foot charle be ready to drop from he saddle for wretchedness he cry out let nobody comfort I more i will have no comfort curse be gan and curse this horrible day and this place and every thing let we go on like blind miserable man that we be into roncesvalle and have patience if we can out of pure misery like job till we do all that can be do so charle ride on with he noble and they say that for the sake of the champion of christendom and the martyr that die with he the sun stand still in the sky till the emperor have see orlando and till the dead be bury horrible to he eye be the sight of the field of roncesvalle the saracen indeed have forsake it conquer but all he paladin but two be leave on it dead and the slaughter heap among which they lay make the whole valley like a great dumb slaughter-house trample up into blood and dirt and reek to the heat the very tree be drop with blood and every thing so to speak seem tire out and go to a horrible sleep charle tremble to he heart 's core for wonder and agony after dumbly gaze on the place he again curse it with a solemn curse and wish that never grass might grow within it again nor seed of any kind neither within it nor on any of its mountain around with they proud shoulder but the anger of heaven abide over it for ever as on a pit make by hell upon earth then he ride on and come up to where the body of orlando await he with the paladin and the old man weep throw himself as if he have be a reckless youth from he horse and embrace and kiss the dead body and say i bless thee orlando i bless thy whole life and all that thou wast and all that thou ever didst and thy mighty and holy valor and the father that beget thee and i ask pardon of thee for believe those who bring thee to thine end they shall have they reward o thou beloved one but indeed it be thou that livest and i that be worse than dead and now behold a wonder for the emperor in the fervor of he heart and of the memory of what have pass between they call to mind that orlando have promise to give he he sword should he die before he and he lift up he voice more bravely and adjure he even now to return it to he gladly and it pleased god that the dead body of orlando should rise on its foot and kneel as he be wont to do at the foot of he liege lord and gladly and with a smile on its face return the sword to the emperor charle as orlando rise the paladin and turpin kneel down out of fear and horror especially see he look with a stern countenance but when they see that he kneel also and smile and return the sword they heart become re-assured and charle take the sword like he liege lord though tremble with wonder and affection : and in truth he could hardly clench he finger around it orlando be bury in a great sepulchre in aquisgrana and the dead paladin be all embalmed and send with majestic cavalcade to they respective county and principality and every christian be honourably and reverently put in the earth and record among the martyr of the church but meantime the fly saracen think to bury they own dead and ignorant of what still await they come back into the valley and rinaldo behold they with a dreadful joy and shew they to charle now the emperor 's cavalcade have increase every moment and they fall upon the saracen with a new and unexpected battle and the old emperor address the sword of orlando exclaim my strength be little but do thou do thy duty to thy master thou famous sword see that he return it to I smile and that he revenge be in my hand and so say he meet balugante the leader of the infidel as he come bear along by he frightened horse and the old man raise the sword with both hand cleave he with a delighted mind to the chin o sacred emperor charle o well-lived old man defender of the faith light and glory of the old time thou hast cut off the other ear of malchus and show how rightly thou wert bear into the world to save it a second time from the abyss again flee the saracen never to come to christendom more : but charle go after they into spain he and rinaldo and ricciardetto and the good turpin and they take and fire saragossa and marsilius be hang to the carob-tree under which he have plan he villany with gan and gan be hung and draw and quarter in roncesvalle amidst the execration of the country and if you ask how it happen that charle ever put faith in such a wretch i shall tell you that it be because the good old emperor with all he fault be a divine man and believe in other out of the excellence of he own heart and truth and such be the case with orlando himself appendix no i story of paulo and francesca poscium ch ' i ' ebbi il mio

a corse -rrb- no ii account give by different writer of the circumstance relate to paulo and francesca conclude with the only fact ascertain boccaccio 's account translate from he commentary on the passage you must know that this lady madonna francesca be daughter of messer guido the elder lord of ravenna and of cervium and that a long and grievous war have be wage between he and the lord malatesta of riminus a treaty of peace by certain mediator be at length conclude between they the which to the end that it might be the more firmly establish it pleased both party to desire to fortify by relationship and the matter of this relationship be so discourse that the say messer guido agree to give he young and fair daughter in marriage to gianciotto the son of messer malatesta now this be make know to certain of the friend of messer guido one of they say to he ` take care what you do for if you contrive not matter discreetly such relationship will beget scandal you know what manner of person you daughter be and of how lofty a spirit and if she see gianciotto before the bond be tie neither you nor any one else will have power to persuade she to marry he therefore if it so please you it seem to I that it would be good to conduct the matter thus : namely that gianciotto should not come hither himself to marry she but that a brother of he should come and espouse she in he name ' gianciotto be a man of great spirit and hope after he father 's death to become lord of riminus in the contemplation of which event albeit he be rude in appearance and a cripple messer guido desire he for a son-in-law above any one of he brother discerning therefore the reasonableness of what he friend counsel he secretly dispose matter accord to he device and a day be appoint polo a brother of gianciotto come to ravenna with full authority to espouse madonna francesca polo be a handsome man very pleasant and of a courteous breeding and pass with other gentleman over the court-yard of the palace of messer guido a damsel who know he point he out to madonna francesca through a opening in the casement say ` that be he that be to be you husband ' and so indeed the poor lady believe and incontinently place in he she whole affection and the ceremony of the marriage have be thus bring about and the lady convey to rimini she become not aware of the deceit till the morning ensue the marriage when she behold gianciotto rise from she side the which discovery move she to such disdain that she become not a whit the less root in she love for polo nevertheless that it grow to be unlawful i never hear except in what be write by this author -lrb- dante -rrb- and possibly it might so have become albeit i take what he say to have be a invention frame on the possibility rather than any thing which he know of he own knowledge be this as it may polo and madonna francesca living in the same house and gianciotto be go into a certain neighbouring district as governor they fall into great companionship with one another suspect nothing but a servant of gianciotto 's note it go to he master and tell he how matter look with the which gianciotto be fiercely move secretly return to riminus and see polo enter the room of madonna francesca the while he himself be arrive go straight to the door and finding it lock inside call to he lady to come out for madonna francesca and polo have descry he polo think to escape suddenly through a opening in the wall by means of which there be a descent into another room and therefore think to conceal he fault either wholly or in part he throw himself into the opening tell the lady to go and open the door but he hope do not turn out as he expect for the hem of a mantle which he have on catch upon a nail and the lady open the door meantime in the belief that all would be well by reason of polo 's not be there gianciotto catch sight of polo as he be detain by the hem of the mantle and straightway run with he dagger in he hand to kill he whereupon the lady to prevent it run between they but gianciotto have lift the dagger and put the whole force of he arm into the blow there come to pass what he have not desire -- namely that he strike the dagger into the bosom of the lady before it could reach polo by which accident be as one who have love the lady better than himself he withdraw the dagger and again strike at polo and slew he and so leave they both dead he hastily go he way and betook he to he wonted affair and the next morning the two lover with many tear be bury together in the same grave the reader of this account will have observe that while dante assume the guilt of all party and put they into the infernal region the good-natured boccaccio be for doubt it and consequently for send they all to heaven he will ignore as much of the business as a gentleman can boldly doubt any guilt in the case say nothing of the circumstance of the book and affirm that the husband love he wife and be miserable at have slay she there be however one negative point in common between the two narrator they both say nothing of certain particulars connect with the date of francesca 's marriage and not a little qualify the first romantic look of the story now it be the absence of these particulars combine with the tradition of the father 's artifice -lrb- omit perhaps by dante out of personal favor -rrb- and with that of the husband 's ferocity of character -lrb- the belief in which boccaccio do not succeed in displace -rrb- that have leave the prevail impression on the mind of posterity which be this : -- that francesca be beguile by she father into the marriage with the deform and unamiable giovannus and that the unconscious medium of the artifice be the amiable and handsome paulo that one or both of the victim of the artifice fall in love with the other that they intercourse whatever it be take place not long after the marriage and that when paulo and francesca be slay in consequence they be young lover with no other tie to the world it be not pleasant in general to dispel the illusion of romance though dante 's will bear the operation with less hurt to a reader 's feeling than most and i suspect that if nine out of ten of all the imply conclusion of other narrative in he poem could be compare with the fact he would be find to be one of the greatest of romancer in a new and not very desirable sense however excusable he may have be in he party-prejudice but a romance may be displace only to substitute perhaps matter of fact more really touching by reason of they greater probability the follow be the whole of what modern inquirer have ascertain respect paulo and francesca future enlarger on the story may suppress what they please as dante do but if any one of they like the writer of the present remark be anxious to speak nothing but the truth i advise he -lrb- especially if he be for trouble himself with make change in he story -rrb- not to think that he have see all the authority on the subject or even remember all he have see until he have search every corner of he library and he memory all the poem hitherto write upon this popular subject be indeed only to be regard as so many probable piece of fancy that of dante himself include \* \* \* \* \* the only particulars hitherto really ascertain respect the history of paulo and francesca francesca be daughter of guido novello da polenta lord of ravenna she be marry to giovannus surname the lame one of the son of malatesta da verrucchio lord of rimini giovannus the lame have a brother name paulo the handsome who be a widower and leave a son twelve year after francesca 's marriage by which time she have become mother of a son who die and of a daughter who survive she she and she brother-in-law paulo be slay together by the husband and bury in one grave two hundred year afterwards the grave be open and the body find lie together in silken garment the silk itself be entire now a far more

dante acknowledge and that he rival infamous as he or more infamous prevail against he and do shut he up and starve he and some of he family but the little child be a invention of the poet 's or
