he hold a revolver the woodwork snap and the two man fall over the edge _ my strangest case _ ~ introduction ~ part i i be of course prepare to admit that there be prettier place on the face of this earth of ours than singapore there be however i venture to assert few that be more interesting and certainly none that can afford a better study of human life and character there if you be so disposed you may consider the subject of british rule on the one hand and the various aspect of the chinese question on the other if you be a student of language you will be able to hear half the tongue of the world speak in less than a hour 's walk range say from parisian french to pigeon english you shall make the acquaintance of every sort of smell the human nose can manipulate from the sweet perfume of the lotus blossom to the diabolical odour of the durien and every sort of cooking from a dainty _ vol-au-vent _ to a stuff rat in the harbor the shipping be such as i feel justified in say you would encounter in no other port of its size in the world it comprise the stately man-of-war and the chinese junk the p and o the messagerie maritime the british indium and the dutch mail-boat the homely sampan the yacht of the globe-trotting millionaire the collier the timber-ship and in point of fact every description of craft that ply between the barbarian east and the civilized west the first glimpse of the harbor be one that will never be forget the last be usually associate with a desire that one may never set eye on it again he who would of he own free will settle down for life in singapore must have acquire the taste of a salamander and the sensibility of a frog among its other advantage singapore number the possession of a multiplicity of hotel there be stately raffle where the globe-trotter do mostly take up they abode also the hôtel de l'europe whose virtue i can vouch for but pack away in another and very different portion of the town unknown to the wealthy gt and indeed know to only a few of the white inhabitant of singapore itself there exist a small hostelry own by a lynx-eyed portuguese which rejoice in the name of the hotel of the three desire now every man who by mischance or deliberate intent have enter its door have he own notion of the meaning of its name the fact however remain that it be there and that it be regularly patronize by individual of a certain or uncertain class as they pass to and fro through the gateway of the further east this in itself be strange inasmuch as it be say that the proprietor rake in the dollar by sell liquor that be as bad as it can possibly be in order that he may get back to lisbon before he receive that threaten knife-thrust between the rib which have be promise he so long there be time as i be unfortunately able to testify when the latter possibility be not so remote as might be expect take altogether however the hotel of the three desire be a excellent place to take up one 's abode provide one be not desirous of attract too much attention in the city as a matter of fact its patron for some reason of they own be more _ en evidence _ after nightfall than during the hour of daylight they be also frugal of speech as a rule and be chary of form new acquaintance when they know each other well however it be surprising how affable they can become it be not the smallest of they many peculiarity that they seldom refer to absent friend by they name a will ask b when he expect to hear from _ he _ and c will inform d that the _ old man _ be now run the show and that if _ he _ do not jump from calcutta inside a week there will be trouble on the floor meanwhile the landlord mix the drink with he own dirty hand and reflect continually upon the villainy of a certain american third mate who have borrow five dollar from he be sufficiently ungrateful as to catch typhoid fever and die without either repay the loan or what be worse settle he account for the board and lodging receive manuel for this be the proprietor 's name have one or two recollection of a similar sort but not many for as a rule he be a careful fellow and experience have teach he the manners and idiosyncrasy of he customer he generally manage to emerge from he transaction with credit to himself and what be of much more importance a balance on the right side of he ledger the time of which i be now write be the middle of march the hottest and in every respect the worst month of the year in singapore day and night the land be oppress by the same stifle heat a swelter calidity possess the characteristic of a steam-laundry couple with those of the stokehole of a ocean liner in the red sea morning noon and night the quarter in which the hotel of the three desire be situate be fragrant with the smell of garbage and chinese tobacco a peculiar blend of perfume which once smell be not to be soon forget everything even the bottle on the shelf in the bar have a greasy feel about they and the mildew on one 's boot when one come to put they on in the morning be a triumph in the way of _ erysiphaceous fungus _ singapore at this season of the year be neither good for man nor beast in this sweeping assertion of course i except the yellow man upon whom it seem to exercise no effect whatsoever it be towards evening and strange to relate the hotel of the three desire be for once practically empty this be the more extraordinary for the reason that the customer who usually frequent it _ en route _ from one end of the earth to the other be not affect by season midwinter be to they the same as midsummer provide they do they business or get they ship and by those ship or that business receive they wages that those hard-earned wages should eventually find themselves in the pocket of the landlord of the three desire be only in the natural order of thing and in consequence such of he guest as be sailor as a general rule eventually board they ship without as much as would purchase they a pipe of tobacco it do not however prevent they from return to the hotel of the three desire when next they happen to be that way if he have no other gift manuel at least possess the faculty of make it comparatively homelike to he customer and that be a desideratum not to be despise even by sailor man in the far east as i have say night be fall on one of the hottest day of the year when a man enter the hotel and inquire for the proprietor pleased to find that there be at last to be a turn in the tide of he affair the landlord introduce himself to the stranger and at the same time inquire in what way he could have the pleasure of serve he i want to put up with you say the stranger who by the way be a tall man with a hawk 's eye and a nose that be not unlike the beak of the same bird you be not full i suppose manuel rub he greasy hand together and observe that he be not as full as he have be thereby insinuate that while he be not overflow he be still not empty it will be gather from this that he be a good business man who never throw a chance away in that case i 'll stay say the stranger and set down the small valise he carry upon the floor from what i have already write you will doubtless have derive the impression that the hotel of the three desire while be a useful place of abode be far from be the caravanserai of the luxurious order the stranger whoever he might be however be either not fastidious or as be more probable be use to similar accommodation for he pay as little attention to the perfume of the bar as he do to the dirt upon the floor and wall and also upon the landlord 's hand have stipulate for a room to himself he desire to be show to it forthwith whereupon manuel lead he through the house to a small yard at the back round which be several small cabin dignified by the name of apartment splendeed say manuel enthusiastically throw open the door of one of the room as he speak more splendeed than ever you see the stranger give a ravenish sort of croak which might have be a laugh or anything else and then go in and close the door abruptly behind he have lock it he take off he coat and hang it upon the handle apparently conscious of the fact that the landlord have glue he eye to the keyhole in order that he might from a precautionary point of view take further stock of he patron foiled in he intention he return to the bar murmur anglish peeg to himself as he do so in the meantime the stranger have seat himself upon the rough bed in the corner and have take a letter from he pocket the hotel of the three desire he read and on march the fifteenth without fail there be a pause while he fold the letter up and place it in he pocket then he continue this be the hotel and to-day be the fifteenth of march but why do not they put in a appearance it be not like they to be late they would better not play I any trick or they 'll find i have lose none of my old power of retaliation have satisfy himself that it be impossible for any one to see into the room either through the keyhole or by means of the window he partially disrobe and when he have do so unbuckled from round he waist a broad leather money-belt seat himself on the bed once more he unfasten the strap of the pocket and dribble the contents on to the bed they consist of three napoleon fifteen english sovereign four half-sovereign and eighteen one-franc piece in he trouser-pocket he have four mexican dollar and some cosmopolitan change of small value it be not very much he mutter to himself after he have count it but it ought to be sufficient for the business in hand if i have not be fool enough to listen to that frenchwoman on board i should not have play card and then it would have be double why the deuce be not i able to get monsieur ashore in that case i would have get it all back or i would have know the reason why the idea seem to afford he some satisfaction for he smile and then say to himself as if in term of approbation by jove i believe you my boy when he have count he money and have return it once more to its hiding-place he buckle the belt round he person and unstrapped he valise take from it a black _ tussa _ coat which he exchange for that hang upon the handle of the door then he light a java cigar and sit down upon the bed to think take altogether he be not a prepossessing countenance the peculiar attribute i have already describe be sufficient to prevent that at the same time it be a strong face that of a man who be little likely to allow himself to be beat of he own free will in anything he might undertake the mouth be firm the chin square the eye dark and well set moreover he wear a heavy black moustache which he keep sharp-pointed he hair be of the same color though streak here and there with gray he height be a inch and a half above six foot but by reason of he slim figure he look somewhat taller he hand and foot be small but of he strength there could be no doubt take altogether he be not a man with whom one would feel disposed to trifle unfortunately however the word _ adventurer _ be write all over he and as a considerable section of the world 's population have good reason to know he be as little likely to fail to take advantage of he opportunity as he be to forget the man who have rob he or who have do he a ill turn it be say in hong kong that he be well connect and that he have claim upon a viceroy now go to he account that have he persevere with they might have place he in a very different position how much truth there be in this report however i can not say one thing however be quite certain if it be true he have fall grievously from he high estate when he meditation have continue for something like ten minute he rise from the bed blow a cloud of smoke stretch himself strap he valise once more give himself what the sailor call a hoist that he might be sure he money-belt be in its proper position and then unlock the door pass out re-locked it after he and return to the bar there he call for certain curious liquor smell they suspiciously before use they and then proceed deliberately to mix himself a peculiar drink the landlord watch he with appreciative surprise he imagine himself to be familiar with every drink know to the taste of man have have wide experience but such a one as this he have never encounter before what do you call it he ask when the other have finish he preparation i call it a ` help to reformation ' the stranger reply then with a sneer upon he face he add it should be popular with you customer take the drink with he into the verandah outside he seat himself in a long chair and proceed to sip it slowly as if it be some elixir whose virtue would be lose by haste some people might have be amuse by the motley crowd that pass along the street beyond the verandah-rail but gideon hayle for such be he name take no sort of interest in it he have see it too often to find any variety in it as a matter of fact the mere sight of a pigtail be sufficient to remind he of a certain episode in he career which he have be for year endeavor to forget it do not look as if they be go to put in a appearance to-night he say to himself as the liquor in the glass begin to wane can this letter have be a hoax a attempt to draw I off the scent if so by all the god in asia they may rest assure i 'll be even with they he look as though he mean it at last he rise and have return he glass to the bar don he _ topee _ leave the hotel and go for a stroll it be but a short distance to the harbor and he presently find himself stroll along the several mile of what i have already describe as the most wonderful shipping in the world to mr hayle the scene be too familiar to call for comment he have see it on many occasion and under a variety of auspices he have witness it as a deck-hand and as a saloon passenger as a steerage passenger and in the humble capacity of a stowaway now he be regard it as a gentleman of leisure who smoke a cigar that have be pay for and round whose waist be a belt with gold in it know the spot where the british indium boat from calcutta usually lie he make he way to it and inquire for a certain vessel she have not yet arrive he be inform and no one seem to know when she might be expect at last tired of he occupation he return to he hotel and in due course sit down to supper he smoke another cigar in the verandah afterwards and be on the point of retire for the night when two man suddenly make they appearance before he and accost he by name he immediately spring to he foot with a cry of welcome i have make up my mind that you be not come he say as they shake hand the old tub do not get in until a quarter to nine the taller of the two new-comer reply when do you arrive this afternoon say hayle and for a moment volunteer no further information a good poker-player be always careful not to show he hand i suppose this place be not full inquire the man who have last speak full ask hayle scornfully it be full of cockroach and mildew if that be what you mean the best company we could possibly have say the taller man cockroach and blackbeetle do not talk and they do not listen at keyhole what be more if they trouble you you can put you heel on they now let 's see the landlord and see what he be get to offer we in the way of room we do not want any dinner because we have it on board the steamer hayle accompany they into the bar and be a witness of the satisfaction the landlord endeavor from business motive to conceal in due course he follow they to the small stifle room in the yard at the back and observe that they be place on either side of himself he have already take the precaution of rap upon the wall in order to discover they thickness and to find out whether the sound of chink money be to be hear through they i must remember that thirty-seven and sixpence and two mexican dollar be all i have in the world he say to himself it would be bad business to allow they to suppose that i have more until i find out what they want the last time i be here be with stellman say the taller of the man when they meet again in the courtyard he have get a concession from the dutch so he say to work a portion of the west coast for shell he want I to go in with he and you could not see you way to it i have see two dutch gaol say the other and i have no use for they and what happen to stellman ask hayle but without any apparent interest he be think of something else at the time they get he money he boat and he shell with three pearl that would have make you mouth water reply the other and stellman oh they bury he at sourabaya he take the cholera so they say but i have hear since that he die of starvation they do not feed you too well in dutch gaol especially when you have get a concession and a consul the speaker look up at he companion as he say this and the other who as i have already say be not interested in the unfortunate stellman or have probably hear the tale before nod he head in the direction of the room where the smaller man be engage on he toilet to the accompaniment of splash water the movement of the head be as significant as the nod of the famous lord of burleigh just the same as ever the other reply always push he nose into old papers and document until you would think he would make himself ill lord what a man he would have be for the british museum there be not he equal on ancient asia in the world and this particular business ah you shall hear all about it in the proper time that 'll be to-morrow morning i reckon in the meantime you can go to bed and content yourself with the knowledge that all be well you be go to play a hand in the biggest scoop that ever i or anybody else have tackle you can not give I a inkling of what it be to-night i suppose i could but i be not go to reply he companion calmly the story would take too long to tell and i be tired besides you would want to ask question of coddy and that would upset the little man 's equilibrium no go to bed and have a good night 's rest and we 'll talk it over in the morning i wonder what my curtain be like if ever there be a place in this world for mosquito it be singapore and i think calcutta be bad enough have no desire to waste time in discuss the various capability of this noxious insect hayle bid the other good-night and when he have visit the bar and have smoke another cigar disappear in the direction of he own apartment meanwhile mr kitwater for such be the name of the gentleman he have just leave have begin he preparation for the night vigorously cursing the mosquito as he do so he be a fine-looking man with a powerful though somewhat humorous cast of countenance he eye be large and not unkindly he head be a good one from a phrenological point of view but be mar by the possession of enormous ear which stand out on either side of he head like those of a bat he wear a close-cropped beard and he be famous for he strength which indeed be that of a giant hayle if i can sum it up aright be just the same as ever he say as he arrange the mosquito-netting of he bed he do not trust I and i do not trust he but he 'll be none the less useful for that let he try to play I false and by the lord harry he 'll not live to do it again with this amiable sentiment mr kitwater prepare himself for slumber then upon the three worthy the hot tropical night settle down next morning they meet at breakfast all three be somewhat silent it be as if the weight of the matter which be that day to be discuss press upon they spirit the smallest of the trio septimus codd by name who be habitually taciturn speak scarcely a word he be a strange little man a nineteenth century villain in a sense he be a rogue and a vagabond yet he one hobby apart from he business be a study of the past and many a authority on eastern history would have be astonish at the extent of he learn he be never so happy as when burrow amongst ancient record and it be mainly due to he learning in the first place and to a somewhat singular accident in the second that the trio be now foregather in singapore he personal appearance be a peculiar one he height be scarcely more than four foot six inch he face be round and at a distance appear almost boyish it be only when one come to look into it more closely that it be see to be score by numberless small line moreover it be unadorned by either beard or moustache he hair be gray and be worn somewhat longer than be usual he could speak fluently almost every language of the east and have be imprison by the russian for seal in prohibit water have be tortured by the chinese on the yang-tse and to he own unextinguishable disgrace flog by the french in tonquin not the least curious trait in he character be the affection he entertain for kitwater the pair have be together for year have quarrel repeatedly but have never separate the record of they doings would form a interesting book but for want of space can not be more than refer to here hayle have be they partner in not a few of they curious undertaking for he courage and resource make he a valuable ally though how far they trust each other it be impossible to say breakfast over they adjourn to the verandah where the inevitable cigar make they appearance now let 's hear what you have get to say to I hayle begin not here kitwater reply there be too many listener come down to the harbor so say he lead he companion to the waterside where he charter a native boat for a hour 's sail then when they be out of earshot of the land he bid hayle pay attention to what he have to say first and foremost you must understand he say that it be all due to coddy here we hear something of it from a old siamese in hanous but we never put much trust in it then coddy begin to look around to hunt up some of he fusty record and after awhile he begin to think that there might be something in the story after all you see it be this way : you know sengkor-wat sengkor how much sengkor-wat -- the old ruin at the back of burmah near the chinese border such a place as you never dream of tumble-down palace temple and all that sort of thing -- lie out there all alone in the jungle i have see amber say hayle with the air of a man who make a remark that can not be lightly turn aside after that i do not want any more ruin city i have get no use for they no but you have get a use for other thing have not you you can use ruby as big as pigeon 's egg i suppose you have get a use for sapphire the like of which mortal man never set eye on before that be certainly so hayle reply but what have this sengkor-wat to do with it everything in the world kitwater reply that be where those ruby be and what be more that be where we be go to find they be you joking or be this sober earnest he look from kitwater to codd the little man thus appeal to nod he head he agree with all he companion say it be quite true say he after a pause ruby sapphire and gold enough to make we all millionaire time over bravo for sengkor-wat then say hayle but how do you know all this i have tell you already that coddy find it out kitwater reply look over he old record he discover something that put he on the track then i happen to remember that year ago when i be in hanous a old man have tell I a wonderful story about a treasure-chamber in a ruin city in the burmese jungle a frenchman who visit the place and have write a book about it mention the fact that there be a legend amongst the native that vast treasure be bury in the ruin but only one man so far as we can discover seem to have take the trouble to have look for it but how big be the ruin bigger than london so coddy say coddy nod he head in confirmation of this fact but still hayle seem incredulous and be you go to search all that area it strike I that you will be a old man by the time you find the treasure kitwater do not you believe it we have get something better to go upon than that there be a old chinese traveller who visit this place in the year what be the year coddy twelve hundred and fifty-seven codd reply without hesitation well he describe the glory of the place the wealth of the inhabitant and then go on to tell how the king take he to the great treasure-chamber where he see such riches as mortal man have never look upon before but that do not tell you where the treasure-chamber be argue hayle perhaps not but there be other way of find out that be if a man have he wit about he you have get to put two and two together if you want to get on in this world coddy have translate it all and this be what it amount to when the king have show the traveller he treasure the latter declare that he eye be so blind by its magnificence that he could scarcely mount the step to the spot where he majesty give audience to he people in another place it mention that when the king administer justice he be seat on the throne in the courtyard of the three-headed elephant now what we have get to do be to find that courtyard and find it we will but how do you know that the treasure have not be take away year ago do you think they be such fool as to leave it behind when they go elsewhere not they though they be well out of earshot of the land and alone upon the boat kitwater look round he suspiciously before he answer then a pleasant smile play over he face it be as if he be recall some happy memory how do i know it he ask by way of preface if you 'll listen for a moment i 'll tell you if you want more proof when i have do you must be difficult to please when i be up at moulmein six month ago i come across a man i have not meet for several year he be a frenchman who i know have spend the most of he life away back in burmah he be very flush of money at the time and keep throw out hint when we be alone of a place he know of where there be the biggest fortune on earth to be have for the mere pick up and carry away he have bring away as much of it as he could but he have not time to get it all before he be chase out by the chinese who he say be strong in the neighborhood kitwater stop and rub he hand with a chuckle decidedly the recollection be a pleasant one well he continue to make a long story short i take advantage of my opportunity and get he secret out of he by well never mind how i manage it it be sufficient that i get it and the consequence be i know all that be to be know that be all very well but what become of the frenchman how do you know that he be not back there again fill he pocket i do not think he be kitwater reply slowly it put I to a lot of inconvenience and come just at the time when i be most anxious to leave besides it might have mean trouble he pause for a moment as a matter of fact they bring it in ` suicide during temporary insanity bring on by excessive drinking ' and that get I over the difficulty it must have be insanity i think for he have no reason for do away with himself it be prove that he have plenty of money leave what be more coddy give evidence that only the day before he have tell he he be tire of life hayle look at both with evident admiration well you two take together beat cockfighting he say enthusiastically then he add but what about the secret what do you get out of he here it be say kitwater take a old leather case from he pocket and produce from it a small piece of parchment there be no write upon it but we have compare it with another plan that we happen to have and find that it square exactly he lean over hayle 's shoulder and point to a certain portion of the sketch that be the great temple he say and what the red dot mean we be go to find out well suppose it be what make you send for I hayle inquire suspiciously because we must have another good man with we kitwater reply i be very well but you be better codd 's head-piece be all right but if it come to fight he might just as well be in kensal green be not that so little man mr codd nod he head i say send for hayle he remark in he quiet little voice kit send and now you be here and it be all right codd speak the truth say kitwater now what we have to do be to arrange the business part of the matter and then to get away as quickly as possible the business portion of the matter be soon settle and hayle be thereupon admit a member of the syndicate for the exploration of the ancient town of sengkor-wat in the hinterland of burmah for the remainder of the day hayle be somewhat more silent than usual if there be anything in they yarn it might be manage he say to himself that night when he be alone in he bedroom kitwater be clever i 'll admit that and coddy be by no manner of mean the fool he pretend to be but i be gideon hayle and that count for something yes i think it might be manage what it be he suppose might be effect he do not say but from the smile upon he face it be evident that the thought cause he considerable satisfaction next day they set sail for rangoon part ii the shadow of evening be slowly fall as the little party of which kitwater codd and hayle with two burman servant be member obtain they first view of the gigantic ruin of which they have come so far in search for many day they have be journey through the jungle now the prey of hope now of despair they have experience adventure by the score though none of they be of sufficient importance to be narrate here and more than once they have come within a hair 's - breadth of be compel to retrace they step they ride upon the small wiry pony of the country they servant clear a way before they with they _ parang _ as they advance they route for the most part lay through jungle in place so dense that it be well-nigh impossible for they to force a way through it it be as if nature be do she best to save the ancient city from the hand of the spoiler at last and so suddenly that it come upon they like a shock they find themselves emerge from the jungle below they in the valley peer up out of the forest be all that remain of a great city upon the ruin temple of which the set sun shone with weird effect at last say hayle bring he pony to a standstill and look down upon the ruin let we hope we shall have penetrate they secret before we be compel to say good-bye to they again hear hear to that say kitwater septimus codd however never say a word the magic hand of the past be upon he heart and be hold he spellbound they descend the hill and when they have select a suitable spot decide to camp upon it for the night next morning they be up betime the excitement of the treasure-hunt be upon each man and would not let he tarry it would not be long now they hope before they would be able to satisfy themselves as to the truth of the story they have be tell and of the value of the hope in which they have put they trust have eat they morning meal they take counsel together examine the plan for the thousandth time collect they weapon and tool bid they servant keep a sharp lookout and then set off for the city the morning sun sparkle upon the dew the bird and monkey chatter at they from the jungle while above they tower the myriad dome and sculptured spire of the ancient city it be a picture that once see would never be forget so far however not a sign of human life have they be able to discover indeed for all they know to the contrary they might be the only man within fifty mile of the place leave the jungle behind they they find themselves face to face with a curious stone bridge span the lake or moat which surround the city and in which the lotus flower bloom luxuriantly when they have cross the bridge they stand in the precinct of the city itself on either hand rise the ruin in all they solitary grandeur -- palace temple market-place and house in endless confusion while at the end of the bridge and run to right and leave as far as the eye could reach be a high wall construct of large stone each one of which would have require the effort of at least four man to lift it these with a few exception be in a excellent state of preservation pass through the massive gateway the traveller find themselves in a open square out of which street branch off the right and leave while the jungle thrust in its inquisitive nose on every possible occasion the silence be so impressive that the man find themselves speak in whisper not a sound be to be hear save the fluttering of bird ' wing among the tree and the obscene chattering of the monkey among the leaf from the first great square the street begin gradually to ascend then another moat be cross and the second portion of the city be reach here the building be larger and the sculpture upon the wall more impressive even than before the same intense silence however hang over everything in the narrower street creeper trail from side to side almost shut out the light and add a twilight effect to the already sufficiently mysterious room and courtyard to be see within this be by no mean the most cheerful sort of place say hayle to kitwater as they pass down a paved street side by side where do you expect to find the great temple and the courtyard of the three elephant ' head straight on say little codd who be behind and have be compare the route they be follow with the plan he hold in he hand as he speak they enter another square and see before they a mighty flight of step wear into groove in place by the thousand of foot that have ascend and descend they in day go by at the top be a sculptured gateway finer than anything either of they have ever see and this they presently enter above they clear of the tree and tower up into the blue be the multitudinous dome and spire of the king 's palace to which the gateway above the step be the principal entrance some of the spire be break some be cover with creeper other be mutilate by time and by stress of weather but the general effect be grand in the extreme from courtyard to courtyard they wander but without find the particular place of which they be in search it be more difficult to discover than they have expect indeed they have walk many mile through desert street and the afternoon be well advance before a hail from codd who have go on ahead of they inform they that at last some sort of success have crown they effort when they come up with he they find themselves in a courtyard somewhat larger than those they have previously explore the four corner of which be decorate with three unite elephant ' head by the great poker we have get it at last cry kitwater in a voice that echo and reechoe through the silent hall and about time too cry hayle upon whom the place be exercise a most curious effect if you have find it show we you precious treasure-chamber all in good time my friend all in good time say kitwater thing have go so smoothly with we hitherto that we must look for a little set-back before we have do we do not want any set-back say hayle what we want be the ruby as big as pigeon 's egg and sapphire and gold and then to get back to civilization as quick as may be that be what be the matter with I as i have already observe the courtyard in which they be stand be considerably larger than any they have yet enter like the other however it have fall sadly to decay the jungle have creep in at all point and gorgeous creeper have wreathe themselves round the neck of the statue above the gateway i do not see any sign of step say hayle when they have examine the place in silence for some minute i think you say a flight of stone step lead up to where the king 's throne be place codd certainly read it so kitwater answer look about he as if he do not quite realize the situation and how be we to know that there be not some step here they may be hide what do you think little man he turn to codd who be look about he with eye in which a curious light be shine step must be somewhere the latter reply we have get to find they -- but not to-night sun go down too late this be undoubtedly true and so without more ado but none the less reluctantly the three traveller retrace they step to they camp upon the hillside hayle be certainly not in a good temper the monotony of the long journey from civilization have prove too much for he and he be ready to take offence at anything fortunately however kitwater be not of the same way of think otherwise there would probably have be trouble between they next morning they be up and have breakfast before the sun be in the sky they meal at a end they pick up they arm and tool bid they servant have a care of the camp and then set off on they quest once more there be a perceptible change however in they demeanor a nervous excitement have take possession of they and it affect each man in a different manner kitwater be suspicious hayle be morose while little codd repeatedly pucker up he mouth as if he be about to whistle but no sound ever come from it the sky overhead be emerald-blue the air be full of the sweetest perfume while bird of the most gorgeous plumage fly continually across they path they have no regard however for nature 's beauty the craving for wealth be in they heart render they blind to everything else they cross the stone bridge pass through the outer portion of the city proceed over the second moat and at last with the familiarity of old friend make they way up the step towards the courtyard of the king 's palace now my friend listen to I say kitwater as he speak throw down the tool he have be carry what we have to do be to thoroughly sound the whole of this courtyard inch by inch and stone by stone we can not be wrong for that this be the courtyard of the three elephant ' head there can be no doubt you take the right-hand side he go on address hayle you coddy must take the left i 'll try the middle if we do not hit it to-day we 'll do so to-morrow or the next day or the day after that this be the place we be tell about and if the treasure be to be find anywhere it will be here for that reason we have get to set about the search as soon as possible now to work use the iron bar they have bring with they for the purpose they begin they task bump the iron down upon each individual stone in the hope of elicit the hollow sound that be to reveal the presence of the treasure-chamber with the regularity of automaton they parade up and down the walled enclosure without speak until they have thoroughly test every single stone no sort of success however reward they endeavor i expect as much say hayle angrily as he throw down the bar you have be humbug and we long journey be all undertake for nothing i be a fool ever to have listen to you nonsensical yarn i might have know it would have come to nothing it be not the first time i have be treasure-hunting but i 'll swear it shall be the last i have have enough of these foolery a dangerous light be gather in kitwater 's eye he moreover throw down the iron bar as if in anticipation of trouble and place he fist defiantly on he hip if you be go to talk like that my boy he begin with never a quaver in he voice it be best for we to understand each other straight off once and for all let I tell you that i 'll have none of you bounce whether or not this business be destine to come to anything you may rely upon one thing and that be the fact that i do my best to do you a good turn by allow you to come into it there be another thing that call for comment and you can deny it if you will it be a fact that you have be grumble and growl ever since we leave rangoon and have make difficulty innumerable where you need not have do so and now because you think the affair be go to turn out badly you round upon I as if it be all a put-up job on my part to rook you of you money it be not the thing hayle and i do not mind say that i resent it you may resent it or not as you darned well please say hayle doggedly bite at the butt of he cigar as he speak it do not matter a curse to I you do not mean to tell I you think i be fool enough to stand by and see myself -- at that moment codd who have be away investigate on he own account and have no idea of the other ' quarrel give a shout of delight he be at the further end of the courtyard at a spot where a dense mass of creeper have fall and now lay trail upon the stone the effect upon he companion be instantaneous they abandon they quarrel without another word and pick up they crowbar hasten towards the spot where he be wait for they what have you find little man inquire kitwater as he approach mr codd however say nothing in reply but beat with he bar upon the stone beneath he there could be little or no doubt about the hollow sound that reward he endeavor we have get it cry kitwater bring the pickaxe hayle and we 'll soon see what be underneath this precious stone we may be at the heart of the mystery for all we know in less time than it take to tell hayle have comply with the other 's request and be hard at work pick out the earth which hold the enormous flagstone in its place a state of mad excitement have take hold of the man and the vein stand out like whipcord upon hayle 's forehead it be difficult to say how many foot separate they from the treasure that be to make they lord of all the earth at last the stone show sign of move and it be possible for kitwater to insert he bar beneath one corner he do so prize it up and lean upon it with all he weight it show no sign of move however the seal of time be set upon it and it be not to be lightly disturbed push you bar in here alongside of mine coddy say kitwater at last i fancy we shall get it then the little man do as he be direct kitwater and hayle second he effort on the other side and then under the strain of they unite exertion the stone begin to move slowly from its place little by little they raise it put all the strength they possess into the operation until at last with one great effort they hurl it backwards and it fall with a crash upon the pavement behind they reveal a dark narrow hole the bottom of which it be impossible to see -lrb- illustration : a dark narrow hole the bottom of which it be impossible to see -rrb- now then gideon my worthy friend what have you get to say about the business ask kitwater as he wipe the perspiration from he brow you pretend to doubt my story be there anything in the old frenchman 's yarn after all be we waste we time upon a fool 's errand when we set off to explore sengkor-wat hayle look at he somewhat sheepishly no no he say i be willing to admit that so far you have win the trick let I down easily if you can i can neither pass nor follow suite i be right out of my reckoning now what do you propose to do get one of those torch we bring with we and find out what there be in that hole kitwater answer they wait while the latter go back to the camp and when he reappear and have light the torch they prepare to follow he down the step into the mysterious depths below the former they soon discover be as solidly build as the rest of the palace and be about thirty in number they be moreover wet and slimy and so narrow that it be only possible for one man to descend they at once when they reach the bottom they find themselves stand in a narrow passage the wall of which be compose of solid stone in many place finely carve the air be close and from the fact that now and again bat dash past they into the deeper darkness they argue that there must be some way of communicate with the open air at the further end this be just what the frenchman tell I say kitwater and he voice echo away along the passage like distant thunder he say we should find a narrow corridor at the foot of the step and then the treasure chamber at the further end so far it look all right let we move on my friend there be no need for he to issue such a invitation they be more than eager to follow he leave the first room or ante-chamber as it might more properly be call they continue they way along the narrow passage which lead from it the air be grow perceptibly closer every moment while the light of the torch reflect the wall on either side hayle wonder for a moment as he follow he leader what would happen to they if the chinese of whom the old frenchman have speak to kitwater should discover they presence in the ruin and should replace the stone upon the hole in that case the treasure would prove of small value to they for they would be bury alive he do not allow he mind however to dwell very long upon this subject for kitwater who be push on ahead with the torch have leave the passage and be stand in a large and apparently well vaulted chamber handsomely carve pillar support the roof the floor be well pave while on either side there be receptacle not unlike the niche in the roman catacomb though for what purpose they be intend be not at first glance so easy to determine with heart that beat tumultuously in they breast they hasten to one of they to see what it contain the niche in question be fill with strange-looking vessel some like bowl and other not unlike crucible the man almost clamber over each other in they excitement to see what they contain it be as if they whole existence depend upon it they could scarcely breathe for excitement every moment 's delay be unspeakable agony at last however the covering be withdraw and the contents of the receptacle stand reveal two be fill with uncut gem ruby and sapphire other contain bar gold and yet more contain gem to which it be scarcely possible in such a light to assign a name one thing at least be certain so vast be the treasure that the three man stand tongue-tied with amazement at they good fortune in they wildest dream they have never imagine such luck and now that this vast treasure lay at they finger-end to be handle to be make sure of they be unable to realize the extent of they future happiness hayle dive he hand into a bowl of uncut ruby and have collect as many as he could hold in each fist turn to he companion look here he cry it be the bank of england in each hand -lrb- illustration : ` look here ' he cry ` it be the bank of england in each hand ' -rrb- he voice end in a choke then kitwater take up the tale i must get out of this or i shall go mad he mutter hoarsely come let we get back to the light if i do not i shall die without more ado like man who be drunk with the finest wine they follow he along the passage and up the step into the open air they be just in time to see the sun set blood-red behind the jungle he beauty however have no effect upon they in all probability they be regardless of he altogether for with almost simultaneous sigh of relief they throw themselves down upon the flagstone of the courtyard and set to work with feverish earnestness to overhaul the booty they have procure all three be good judge of stone and a very brief examination be sufficient even in the feeble evening light to enable they to see that they be not only gem of the first water but also stone of such a size as be seldom see in these unregenerate day it be the biggest scoop on earth say hayle unconsciously echo the expression kitwater have use to he in singapore what be better there be hundred more like they down below i 'll tell you what it be my friend we be just the richest man on this earth at the present moment and do not you forget it in he excitement he shake hand wildly with he companion he ill-humour have vanish like breath off a razor and now he be on the best of term not only with himself but also with the world in general if i know anything about stone there be at least one hundred thousand pound worth in this little parcel he say enthusiastically and what be more there be a million or perhaps two million to be have for the trouble of look for they what do you say if we go below again no no say kitwater it be too late we would better be get back to the camp as soon as may be very well hayle reply reluctantly they accordingly pick up they iron bar and replace the stone that cover the entrance to the subterranean passage i do not like leave it say hayle it do not seem to I to be safe somehow think what there be down there do not it strike you that it would be better to fill we pocket while we have the chance who know what might happen before we can come again nonsense say kitwater who do you think be go to rob we of it what be the use of worry about it in the morning we 'll come back and fill up we bag and then clear out of the place and trek for civilization as if the devil and all be after we just think my lad what there will be to divide a million apiece at least say hayle rapturously and then in a awed voice he add as if he be discomfited by he own significance i never think to be worth a quarter of that somehow it do not seem as if it can be real it be quite real say mr codd as he sprinkle some dry dust round the crack of the stone to give it a appearance of not have be disturb there be no doubt of it when he have finish they pick up they tool and set off on they return journey to the camp the sun have disappear behind the jungle when they leave the courtyard of the three elephant ' head and ascend the stone step towards the inner moat they cross the bridge and enter the outer city in silence the place be very dreary at that hour of the day and to codd who be of a imaginative turn of mind it seem as if face out of the long desert past be watch he from every house he companion however be scarcely so impressionable they be gloat over the treasure they have win for themselves and one at least be speculate as to how he should spend he share suddenly hayle who be look down a side street utter a exclamation of surprise do you see that he inquire of kitwater then without wait for a reply he dive into the nearest ruin and disappear from view what on earth be the matter with he inquire kitwater of codd have he go mad codd only shake he head hayle 's doings be more often than not a enigma to he presently however the runaway make he appearance before they he face be flush and he breathe heavily apparently he have be run and for some distance do not you see he he inquire of he companion in some surprise see who ask kitwater with elevated eyebrow who do you think you see a man hayle reply i be ready to take my oath i see he cross that narrow street back yonder be it one of we own man do you think say codd refer to the two burman they have bring with they not a bit of it hayle reply i tell you kitwater i be as sure as i be of anything that the man i saw be a chinaman gammon say kitwater there be not a chinaman within fifty mile of the ruin you be unduly excite you 'll be see a regiment of scot guard presently if you be not careful i do not care what you say it be a man i see the other answer good heaven will not you believe I when i say that i see he pigtail believe you of course i will reply kitwater good-humouredly it be a pity you do not catch hold of he by it however no no gid you take my word for it there be no chinaman about here what do you think codd mr codd appear to have no opinion for he do not reply by this time they have cross the last bridge and have leave the city behind they the jungle be lull itself to sleep and drowsy crooning sound on every hand so certain be hayle that he have not be mistake about the man he declare he have see that he keep he eye well open to guard against a surprise he do not know what clump of bamboo might contain a enemy and in consequence he right hand be keep continually in he pocket in order not to lose the grip of the revolver therein contain at last they reach the top of the hill and approach the open spot where they camp be situate what do i tell you say kitwater as he look about the camp and could discover no trace of they two native servant it be one of we prowl rascal you see and when he come back i 'll teach he to come spy on we if i know anything of the rattan he will not do it again hayle shrug he shoulder while the fact that they servant be not at the camp to anticipate they return be certainly suspicious he be still as convinced as ever that the man he have see slip through the ruin be no burman but a true son of the celestial empire wear out by the excitement of the day kitwater anathematize the servant for not have be there to prepare the evening meal but while he and hayle wrangle mr codd have as usual take the matter into he own hand and pick up a cooking-pot have set off in the direction of the stream whence they draw they supply of water he have not proceed very far however before he utter a cry and come run back to the camp there be a scared expression upon he face as he rejoin he companion they have not run away he cry point in the direction whence he have come they be dead dead cry kitwater and hayle together then the latter add what do you mean by that what i say codd reply they be both lie in the jungle back there with they throat cut then i be right after all hayle find time to put in come kit let we go and see there be more than we bargain for at the back of all this they hurry with codd to the spot where he have discover the body to find that he tale be too true they two unfortunate servant be to be see lie one on either side of the track both dead and shockingly mutilate kitwater knelt beside they and examine they more closely chinese he say laconically then after a pause he continue it be a good thing for we we have the foresight to take we rifle with we to-day otherwise we should have lose they for a certainty now we shall have to keep we eye open for trouble it will not be long in come mark my word you do not think they watch we at work in that courtyard do you ask hayle anxiously as they return to the camp if that be so they 'll have every atom of the remain treasure and we shall be do for he speak as if until that moment they have receive nothing it be just possible they may have do so of course say kitwater but how be we to know we could not prevent they for we do not know how many of they there may be that fellow you see this evening may only have be place there to spy upon we movement confound it all i wish we be a bigger party it be no use wish that hayle return and then after a pause he add -- fortunately we hold a good many life in we hand and what be more we know the value of we own the only thing we can do be to watch watch and watch and if we be take by surprise we shall have nobody to thank for it but ourselves now if you 'll stand sentry coddy and i will get tea they set to work and the meal be in due course serve and eat afterwards codd go on guard be relieve by hayle at midnight ever since they have make the ghastly discovery in the jungle the latter have be more silent even than the gravity of the situation demand now he sit nurse he rifle listen to the mysterious voice of the jungle and thinking as if for dear life meanwhile he companion sleep soundly on secure in the fact that he be watch over they at last hayle rise to he foot it be my only chance he say to himself as he go softly across to where kitwater be lie it must be now or never kneel beside the sleep man he feel for the packet of precious stone they have that day obtain have find it he transfer it to he own pocket and then return to he former position as quietly as he have come then have secure as much of they store of ammunition as he could conveniently carry together with a supply of food sufficient to last he for several day he desert he post abandon he friend and disappear into the jungle part iii the sun be slowly sink behind the dense wall of jungle which hem in on the southern side the frontier station of nampoung in the river below there be a ford which have a distinguished claim on fame inasmuch as it be one of the gateway from burmah into western china this ford be guard continually by a company of sikh under the command of a english officer to be candid it be not a post that be much seek after its dullness be extraordinary true one can fish there from morning until night if one be so disposed and if one have the good fortune to be a botanist there be a inexhaustible field open for study it be also true that nampoung be only thirty mile or so as the crow fly from bhamo and when one have be in the wild and out of touch of civilization for month at a time bhamo be by no mean a place to be despise so think gregory of the 123rd burmah regiment as he throw he line into the pool below he it be worse than a dog 's life he say to himself as he look at the ford a hundred yard or so to he right where at the moment he subaltern be engage levy toll upon some yunnan merchant who be carry cotton on pack-mule into china after that he glance behind he at the little cluster of building on the hill and groan once more i wonder what they be do in england he continue trout-fishing have just begin and i can imagine the dear old governor at the long pool rod in hand the girl will stroll down in the afternoon to find out what sport he have have and they 'll walk home across the park with he while the mater will probably meet they half way and here be i in this god-forsaken hole with nothing to do but to keep a eye on that ford there bhamo be better than this mandalay be better than bhamo and rangoon be better than either chivy _ dakus _ be paradise compare with this sort of thing anyhow i be tired of fishing he begin to take he rod to piece preparatory to return to he quarter on the hill he have just unshipped the last joint when he become aware that one of he man be approach he he inquire he business and be inform in return that dempsey he sub would be glad to see he at the ford hand he rod to the man he set off in the direction of the cross in question to become aware as he approach it of a disreputable figure prop up against a tree on the nearer bank what be the matter dempsey he inquire what on earth have you get there man well that be more than i can say the other reply he be evidently a white man and i fancy a englishman at home we should call he a scarecrow he turn up from across the ford just now and tumble down in the middle of the stream like a shot rabbit never see such a thing before he be not a pretty sight be he poor devil say gregory he seem to be on he last leg i wonder who the deuce he be and what bring he into this condition -lrb- illustration : ` poor devil ' say gregory ` he seem to be on he last leg ' -rrb- i have search and there be nothing about to tell we say dempsey what do you think we have better do with he get he up the hill say he superior without hesitation when he be a bit stronger we 'll have he story out of he i 'll bet a few year ' pay it will be interesting a file of man be call and the mysterious stranger be carry up to the residence of the english officer it be plain to the least observant that he be in a very serious condition such clothes as he possess be in rag he face be pinch with starvation and moreover he be quite unconscious when he bearer accompany by the two englishman reach the cluster of hut he be carry to a small room at the end of the officer ' bungalow and place upon the bed after a little brandy have be administer he recover consciousness and look about he heave a sigh of relief he inquire where he might be you be at nampoung say gregory and you ought to thank you star that you be not in kingdom come if ever a man be near it you have be we will not ask you for you story now however later on you shall _ bukh _ to you heart 's content now i be go to give you something to eat you look as if you want it badly enough gregory look at dempsey and make a sign whereupon the other withdraw to presently return carry a bowl of soup the stranger drink it ravenously and then lay back and close he eye once more he would have be a clever man who could have recognize in the emaciate be upon the bed the spruce well-cared-for individual who be know to the hotel of the three desire in singapore as gideon hayle you would better rest a while now say gregory and then perhaps you 'll feel equal to join we at mess or whatever you like to call it thanks very much the man reply with the conventional utterance of a english gentleman which be not lose upon he audience i hope i shall feel up to it whoever the fellow be say gregory as they pass along the verandah a few minute later he have evidently see better day poor beggar i wonder where he be be and what he have be up to we shall soon find out dempsey answer all he say when we fish he out of the water be ' _ at last _ ' and then he faint clean away i be not more curious than my neighbor but i do not mind admit that i be anxious to hear what he have to say for himself talk about rip van winkle why he be not in it with this fellow he could give he point and beat he hollow a hour later the stranger be so far recover as to be able to join he host at they evening meal between they they have manage to fit he out with a somewhat composite set of garment he have shave off he beard have reduce he hair to something like order and in consequence have now the outward resemblance at least of a gentleman come that be better say gregory as he welcome he i do not know what you usual self may be like but you certainly have more the appearance of a man and less that of a skeleton than when we first bring you in you must have be pretty hard put to it out yonder the recollection of all he have be through be so vivid that the man shudder at the mere thought of it i would not go through it again for world he say you do not know what i have endure trading over the border alone gregory inquire the man shake he head try to walk across from pekin he say _ viâ _ szechuen and yunnan nearly die of dysentery in yunnan city while i be there my servant desert I take with they every halfpenny i possess be suspect by the mandarin i be throw into prison manage eventually to escape and so make my way on here i think to-day be go to prove my last you have have a hard time of it by jove say dempsey but you have manage to come out of it alive and now where be you go i want if possible to get to rangoon the other reply then i shall ship for england as best as i can i have have enough of china to last I a lifetime from that moment the stranger do not refer again to he journey he be singularly reticent upon this point and feeling that perhaps the recollection of all he have suffer might be painful to he the two man do not press he to unburden himself he be a strange sort of fellow say gregory to dempsey later in the evening when the other have retire to rest if he have walk from pekin here as he say he be more than a little modest about it i 'll be bind he be a funny story if only he would condescend to tell it they would have be more certain than ever of this fact have they be able to see they guest at that particular moment in the solitude of he own room he have remove a broad leather belt from round he waist from the pocket of this belt he shake out upward of a hundred ruby and sapphire of extraordinary size he count they carefully replace they in the belt and then once more secure the latter about he waist at last i be safe he mutter to himself but it be a close shave -- a very close shave i would not do that journey again for all the money the stone be worth no not for twice the amount once more the recollection of he suffering rise so vividly before he that he could not suppress a shudder then he arrange the mosquito-curtain of he bed and lay himself down upon it it be not long before he be fast asleep before he go to he own quarter gregory look in upon the stranger to find he sleep heavily one arm throw above he head poor beggar say the kind-hearted englishman as he look down at he one meet some extraordinary character out here but i think he be the strangest that have come into my experience the word have scarcely leave he lip before the stranger be sit up in bed with a look of abject terror in he eye the sweat of a living fear be stream down he face gregory run to he and place he arm about he what be the matter he ask pull yourself together man there be nothing for you to fear here you be quite safe the other look at he for a moment as if he do not recognize he then take in the situation he give a uneasy laugh i have have such a awful nightmare he say i think the chinese be after I again lord how thankful i be it be not true next morning george bertram as he call himself leave nampoung for bhamo with gregory 's cheque for five hundred rupee in he pocket you must take it say that individual in reply to the other 's half-hearted refusal of the assistance treat it as a loan if you like you can return it to I when you be in better circumstance i assure you i do not want it we can not spend money out here little do he imagine when he make that offer the immense wealth which the other carry in the belt that encircle he waist needless to say hayle say nothing to he upon the subject he merely pocket the cheque with a expression of he gratitude promise to repay it as soon as he reach london as a matter of fact he do so and to this day i have no doubt gregory regard he as a man of the most scrupulous and unusual integrity two day later the wanderer reach bhamo that important military post on the sluggish irrawaddy he appearance thanks to gregory and dempsey 's kind office be now sufficiently conventional to attract little or no attention so he negotiate the captain 's cheque fit himself out with a few other thing that he require and then set off for mandalay from mandalay he proceed as fast as steam could take he to rangoon where after the exercise of some diplomacy he secure a passage aboard a tramp steamer bind for england when the shweydagon be lose in the evening mist and the steamer have make she way slowly down the sluggish stream with the rice-field on either side hayle go aft and take he last look at the land to which he be say good-bye a quarter of a million if a halfpenny he say and as soon as they be sell and the money be in my hand the leaf shall be turn and my life for the future shall be all respectability part iv two month have elapse since the mysterious traveller from china have leave the lonely frontier station at nampoung in outward appearance it be very much the same as it have be then the only difference consist in the fact that captain gregory and he subaltern dempsey have finish they period of enforced exile have return to bhamo to join the main body of they regiment a captain handiman and a subaltern name grantham have take they place and be imitate they inasmuch as they spend the greater portion of they time fishing and complain of the hardness of they lot it be the more unfortunate in they case that they do not get on very well together the fact of the matter be handiman be build on very different line to gregory he predecessor he give himself air and be fond of assert he authority in consequence the solitary life at the ford sit heavily upon both man one hot afternoon grantham who be a keen sportsman take he gun and accompany by a wiry little shan servant depart into the jungle on _ shikar _ thought intent he be less successful than usual indeed he have proceed fully three mile before he see anything worth empty he gun at in the jungle the air be as close as a hothouse and the perspiration run down he face in stream what a ass i be to come out he say angrily to himself this heat be unbearable at that moment a crash noise reach he from behind turn to discover what occasion it he be just in time to see a large boar cross the clearing and disappear into the bamboo on the further side take he rifle from the little shan he set off in pursuit it be no easy task for the jungle in that neighborhood be so dense that it be well nigh impossible to make one 's way through it at last however they hit upon a dry up _ nullah _ and follow it along listen as they go to the progress the boar be make among the bamboo on they right presently they sight he cross a open space a couple of hundred yard or so ahead of they on the further side he stop and begin to feed this be grantham 's opportunity and sight he rifle he fire the beast drop like a stone well hit just behind the shoulder the report however have scarcely die away before the little shan hold up he hand to attract grantham 's attention what be it the other inquire before the man have time to reply he quick ear catch the sound of a faint call from the jungle on the other side of the _ nullah _ without doubt it be the english word _ help _ and whoever the man might be who call it be plain that he be in sore strait what the deuce do it mean say grantham half to himself and half to the man beside he some poor devil get lose in the jungle i suppose i 'll go and have a look have climb the bank of the _ nullah _ he be about to proceed in the direction whence the cry have come when he become aware of the most extraordinary figure he have ever see in he life approach he the appearance hayle have present when he have turn up at the ford two month before be nothing compare with that of this individual he be a small man not more than five foot in height he clothes be in rag a grizzly beard grow in patch upon he cheek and chin while he hair reach nearly to he shoulder he face be pinch until it look more like that of a skeleton than a man grantham stand and stare at he scarcely able to believe he eye good heaven he say to himself what a figure i wonder where the beggar hail from then address the man he continue be you a englishman or what be you the man before he however do not reply he place he finger on he lip and turn pointed in the direction he have come either he do not understand or he be dumb say grantham but it be quite certain that he want I to follow he somewhere turn to the man again he sign to he to proceed whereupon the little fellow hobble painfully away from the _ nullah _ in the direction whence he have appear on and on he go until he at length come to a standstill at the foot of a hill where a little stream come splash down in a miniature cascade from the rock above then grantham realize the meaning of the little man 's action stretch out beside a rock be the tall figure of a man like he companion he present a miserable appearance he clothes if clothes they could be call be in rag he hair be long and snowy white match he beard which descend to within a few inch of he waist he eye be close and for a moment grantham think he be dead this be not the case however for upon he companion approach he he hold out he hand and inquire whether he have discover the man who have fire the shot to grantham 's surprise the other make no reply in word but take he friend 's hand he make some mysterious movement upon it with he finger whereupon the latter raise himself to a sit position my friend tell I that you be a englishman he say in a voice that shake with emotion i be glad we have find you i hear you rifle shot and hail you we be in sore distress and have be through such adventure and such misery as no man would believe i have poison my foot and be unable to walk any further as you can see for yourself i be blind while my companion be dumb this statement account for the smaller man 's curious behavior and the other 's close eye you have suffer indeed say grantham pityingly but how do it all come about we be trader and we fall into the hand of the chinese the taller man answer with they usual amiability they set to work to torture we my companion 's tongue they cut out at the root while as i have say they deprive I of my sight after that they turn we loose to go where we would we have wander here there and everywhere live on what we could pick up and die a thousand death every day it would have be better if we have die outright -- but somehow we have come through can you take we to a place where we can procure food we have be live on jungle fruit for a eternity my foot want look to pretty badly too we 'll do all we can for you say grantham that be if we can get you down to the ford which be about five mile away you 'll have to carry I then for i be too far go to walk i think it can be manage say grantham at any rate we 'll try turn to the little shan he despatch he with a message to handiman and when the other have disappear kneel down beside the tall man and set to work to examine he injured foot there could be no doubt that it be in a very serious condition tramp through the jungle he have manage to poison it and have be unable to apply the necessary remedy obtain some water from the stream grantham bath it tenderly and then bind it up as well as he could with he handkerchief that be the best i can do for you for the present he say we must leave it as it be and when we get you to the station we will see what else can be manage he look up and see the little man 's eye watch he intently there be a look of almost dog-like affection in they for he companion that go to the young soldier 's heart by jove he say i be sorry for you fellow you must have suffer agony the chinese be devil but yours be not the first case we have hear of we only come up here for a month at a time but the man we relieve tell we a strange tale about another poor beggar who come into the station some two month ago he have be wander in the jungle and be nearly at death 's - door the blind man give a start while the little man seize he hand and make a number of rapid movement upon it with he finger my friend want to know if you be aware of that man 's name he say we lose a companion and he think that he may be the man for heaven 's sake tell we what you know you have no idea what it mean to we since you be so interested in he i be sorry to have to say that i do not know very much you see he have very little to do with we as i have say he turn up while we predecessor be here from what i hear about he from gregory he gather that he be a tall thin man who have come through from pekin by way of yunnan be you sure it be from yunnan that be what they tell I say grantham since then i have hear that he be on he way from pekin to burmah and that he coolie have rob he of all he possess you do not happen to remember he name i suppose the blind man try to ask the question calmly but he voice fail he as far as i remember he name be george bertram grantham answer there be a pause for a few seconds after which the blind man begin again -- he do not tell you i suppose whether he have any money about he he have not a red cent say grantham the chinese clear he out they lend he the money to get to rangoon i happen to know that because he cash my friend 's cheque in bhamo there be another and somewhat longer pause you do not hear whether he have any precious stone in he possession good gracious no from what they tell I i gather that the man have not a halfpenny in the world why should he have be likely to have have jewel in point of fact i be sure he have not for i be give to understand he be about as woe-begone a customer as could be find anywhere the blind man utter a heavy sigh and sink back to he former position upon the ground a hour and a half later just as the shadow of evening be draw in a party of sikh put in a appearance bring with they a dhooly in which they place the injured man it be almost dark when they reach the station where grantham 's superior officer be await they come what on earth 's the meaning of this he ask as the _ cortège _ draw up before the bungalow who be these man and where do you find they grantham make he report and then the wounded man be lift out and carry to a hut at the rear of the main block of building the little man watch everything with a eagle eye as if he be afraid some evil might be practice upon he companion when the blind man have be place on a bed and he foot attend to as well as the rough surgery of the place would admit grantham do something he have not already do and that be to ask they they name my name be kitwater say the blind man and the name of my friend here be codd -- septimus codd he be one of the best and staunchest little fellow in the world i do not know whether we name will convey much to you but such as they be you be welcome to they as a matter of fact they be all we have with which to requite you hospitality why it should have be so i can not say but it be evident from the first that captain handiman do not believe the account the refugee give of themselves he be one of that peculiar description of person who have a idea that it add to they dignity not to believe anything that be tell they and he certainly act up to it on every possible occasion there be more in the case than meet the eye he say suspiciously and i fancy if only we could see the bottom of it we should discover that you two _ protégés _ be as fine a pair of rascal as could be find on the continent of asia i do not know anything about that grantham reply i only know that they be a miserable couple and that i do the best i could for they you would not have have I leave they in the jungle surely i be not aware i have say so the other answer stiffly the only thing i object to be you treat they as if they be martyr when in all probability they deserve all the punishment they have receive grantham be too wise to carry the argument any further he know that when handiman be in he present humor the best thing to do be to leave he alone in it he accordingly return to the hut where the two man be domicile and attend to they comfort as far as lay in he power he heart have be touch by they misery he do not give as a reason for the trouble he take the fact that the face of the elder man remind he of he own venerable father the worthy old somersetshire vicar it be a fact nevertheless for a week the unfortunate couple be domicile at the ford and during that time grantham attend to they want with the assiduity of a blood relation meanwhile handiman scoff and bid he take heed for he valuable lest he new-found friend should appropriate they he do not believe in honest gratitude he declare particularly where homeless wanderer in the burmese jungle be concern at last however they be so far recover as to be able to proceed on they way once more we have to thank you for you life sir say kitwater to grantham when the time come for they to say good-bye to the ford have it not be for you we would probably be dead man now i do not know whether we shall ever be able to repay you kindness that be with allah but if the opportunity should ever arise you may be sure we will not neglect it whatever we may be now you may take it that we be gentleman once there be just one favor i should like to ask of you sir before we part what be it grantham inquire i want you sir to give I a letter of introduction to the gentleman in you regiment who look after the stranger you tell I of when he come here from out of china i have get a sort of notion in my head that even if he be not we friend that be to say the man we be search for he may happen to know something of he i will give you the letter with pleasure grantham reply i be sure gregory will be only too pleased to help you as far as lie in he power the letter be accordingly write and hand to kitwater who stow it away in he pocket as if it be a priceless possession then when they have bid they protector farewell they in they turn set off along the track that hayle have follow two month before and in due course arrive at bhamo here they present the letter they have obtain to captain charle pauncefort gregory who as may be suppose receive it with manifest astonishment well say he of all the story i have hear since i have be in the east this be the most extraordinary i think that other chap be about as unfortunate a beggar as could well be but you beat he hollow at every turn now look here before i go any further i must have my friend with I he be the man who discover the other chap and i be sure he would like to hear you story dempsey be accordingly summon and he wonderment be as great as he friend 's have be now say gregory when dempsey have be make familiar with the other 's story what be it you want to know about the man we pick up ask you question and we 'll do the best we can to answer they in reply to kitwater 's question gregory and dempsey describe as far as they be able the appearance of the man whom they have help the schedule be in a great measure satisfactory but not altogether there be so many english in burmah who be tall and who have dark eye and broad shoulder little codd lean towards he companion and take he hand make some sign upon it that be so my little man say kitwater nod he head approvingly you have hit the nail on the head then turn to gregory he continue perhaps sir you do not happen to remember whether he have any particular mark upon either of he wrist gregory reply that he have not notice anything extraordinary but dempsey be by no means so forgetful of course he have he answer i remember notice it for the first time when i pull he out of the ford and afterwards when he be in bed a inch or so above he left wrist he have a tattooed snake swallow he own tail it be do in blue and red ink and be as nice a piece of work as ever i have see i thank you sir kitwater reply you have hit it exactly by the living thunder he be we man after all heaven bless you for the news you have give we it put new life into I we 'll find he yet coddy my boy i thank you sir again and again he hold out he hand which dempsey feel constrain to shake the man be tremble with excitement i tell you sir he continue that you do not know how we love that man if it take the whole of we life and if we have to tramp the whole world over to do it we 'll find he yet and if i be not mistake it will be a bad day for he when you do find he put in gregory who have be a observant spectator of the scene why should you hate he so how do you know that we _ do _ hate he kitwater ask turn he sightless face in the direction whence the other 's voice proceed hate he why should we hate he we have no grudge against he coddy my boy have we mr codd shake he head gravely no they certainly have no grudge nothing more be to be glean from they whatever they connection with george bertram or gideon hayle may have be they be not go to commit themselves when they have inquire as to he movement after leave bhamo they drop the subject altogether and thank the officer for the courtesy show they withdraw they manifest destitution and the misery they have suffer have touch the kindly white resident of that far off place and a subscription be raise for they result in the collection of a amount sufficient to enable they to reach rangoon in comparative comfort when they arrive at that well-known seaport they visit the residence of a person with whom it be plain they be well acquaint the interview be presumably satisfactory on both side for when they leave the house kitwater squeeze codd 's hand say as he do so -- we 'll have he yet coddy my boy mark my word we 'll have he yet he leave in the _ jemadar _ and he think we be lie dead in the jungle at this moment it be scarcely he fault that we be not be it but when we get hold of he we 'll -- well we 'll let he see what we can do will not we old boy he steal the treasure and sneak away abandon we to we fate in consequence i shall never see the light again and you 'll never speak to mortal man we have mr gideon hayle to thank for that and if we have to tramp round the world to do it if we have to hunt for he in every country on the face of the earth we 'll repay the debt we owe he mr codd 's bright little eye twinkle in reply then they shake hand solemnly together it would certainly prove a bad day for gideon hayle should he ever have the ill luck to fall into they hand two day later they ship aboard the mail-boat as steerage passenger for england they have be missionary in china so it be rumor on board and they zeal have be repay by the cruellest torture on a Sunday in the indian ocean kitwater hold a service on deck which be attend by every class he preach a eloquent sermon on the labor of the missionary in the far east and from that moment become so popular on board that when the steamer reach english water a subscription be take up on behalf of the sufferer which result in the collection of a amount sufficient to help they well on they way to london as soon as they reach liverpool now say kitwater as they stand together at the wharf with the pitiless english rain pour down upon they wet they to the skin what we have to do be to find gideon hayle as soon as possible chapter i it have often strike I as be a remarkable circumstance that in nine case out of ten a man 's success in life be not find in the career he originally choose for himself but in another and totally different one that mysterious power force of circumstance be doubtless responsible for this and no better illustration for my argument could be find than my own case i believe my father intend that i should follow the medical profession while my mother hope i would enter the church my worthy uncle clutterfield the eminent solicitor of lincoln 's inn field offer I my article and would possibly have eventually take I into partnership but i would have none of these thing my one craving be for the sea if i could not spend my life upon salt water existence would have no pleasure for I my father threaten my mother weep uncle clutterfield prophesy all sort of disaster but i remain firm very well say my father when he realize that further argument be hopeless since you must go to sea go to sea you certainly shall but you must not blame I if you find that the life be not exactly what you anticipate and that you would prefer to find yourself on dry land once more i willingly give this promise and a month later leave liverpool as a apprentice on the clipper ship _ maid of normandy _ appropriately enough the captain 's name be fairweather and he certainly be a character in he way in fact the whole ship 's company be original have my father search all england through he could not have discover a set of man from the captain to the cook 's mate who would have be better calculate to instil in a young man 's heart a distaste for father neptune and he ocean in the number of the various book of the sea i have encounter be one entitle _ a float hell _ when read it i have not expect to have the misfortune to be bind aboard a vessel of this type it be my lot however to undergo the experience we carry three apprentice include myself each of whom have pay a large sum for the privilege i be the youngest the eldest be the son of a country parson a mild decent lad who eventually desert and become a house-painter in the south island of new zealand the next be wash overboard when we be round the horn on we homeward voyage poor lad when all be say and do he could not have be much worse off for he life on board be a disgrace to what be sometimes erroneously call human nature in due course as we clear for san francisco and long before we cross the line i be heartily tire of the sea in those day few year ago as it be sailor be not so well protect even as they be now and on a long voyage aboard a sailing ship it be possible for a good deal to happen that be not log and much of which be forget before the vessel reach its home-port again when i return from my first voyage my family inquire how i like my profession and with all truth i inform they that i do not like it at all and that i would be willing to have my indenture cancel and to return to shore life once more if i might be so permit my father smile grimly and seem to derive considerable satisfaction from the fact that he have prophesy disaster from the outset no he say you have make you bed my lad and now you must lie upon it there be still a considerable portion of you apprenticeship to be serve and it will be quite soon enough for we at the end of that time to decide what you be to do a month later i be at sea again bind this time for sydney we reach that port on my nineteenth birthday and by that time i have make up my mind article or no article i be determine to spend no more of my life on board that hateful ship accordingly one day have obtain shore leave i purchase a new rig-out and leave my sea-going tog with the jewish shopman i make track as the say go into the bush with all speed happen what might i be resolve that captain fairweather should not set eye on george fairfax again from that time onward my career be a strange one i become a veritable jack-of-all-trade a station-hand a roust-about shearer assistant to a travel hawker a gold-miner and at last a trooper in one of the finest body of man in the world the queensland mount police it be in this curious fashion that i arrive at my real vocation after a considerable period spend at headquarters i be draft to a station in the far west there be a good deal of horse and sheep-stealing go on in that particular locality and a large amount of tact and ingenuity be necessary to discover the criminal i soon find that this be a business at which i be likely to be successful more than once i have the good fortune to be able to bring to book man who have carry on they trade for year and who have be entirely unsuspected eventually my reputation in this particular line of business become noised abroad until it come to the ear of the commissioner himself then news reach we that a dastardly murder have be commit in the suburb of brisbane and that the police be unable to obtain any clue as to the identity of the person accountable for it two or three man be arrest on suspicion but be immediately discharge on be in a position to give a satisfactory account of they action on the night of the murder it strike I that i should like to take up the case and with the confidence of youth i apply to the commissioner for permission to be allow to try my hand at unravel the mystery what they think of my impudence i can not say but the fact remain that my request after be back up by my inspector be grant the case be a particularly complicate one and at one time i be begin to think that i should prove no more successful than the other have be instead of deter I however this only spur I on to greater effort the mere fact that i have ask to be allow to take part in the affair have arouse the jealousy of the detective of the department and i be aware that they would receive the news of my failure with unqualified satisfaction i therefore prosecute my inquiry in every possible direction spare myself neither labor nor pain it would appear that the victim a old man be without kith or kin he be very poor and live by himself in a small villa on the outskirts of the city no one have be see near the house on the night in question nor have any noise be hear by the neighbor yet in the morning he be discover lie on the floor of the front-room stab to the heart from behind now every detective know -- indeed it be part of he creed -- that in a affair such as i be describe nothing be too minute or too trivial to have a bearing upon the case the old gentleman have be at supper when the crime be commit and from the fact that the table be only lay for one i argue that he have not expect a visitor the murderer could not have be hungry for the food have not be touch that the motive be not robbery be also plain from the fact that not a drawer have be open or a lock force while the money in he pocket be still intact the doctor have certify that the wound could not have be self-inflicted while there be plenty of evidence to show that there have not be a struggle from the fact that the front-door be lock and that the key be in the murder man 's pocket it be certain that the assassin must have leave the house by the back there be one question however so trivial in itself that one might have be excuse for not take note of it that attract my attention as i have say the old man have be stab from behind and when he be discover by the police next day he overturn chair be lie beside he this to my mind show that he have be seat with he back to the door when the crime have be perpetrate when i have examine everything else i turn my attention to the chair i do not expect it to tell I anything yet it be from it that i obtain the clue that be ultimately to lead to the solution of the whole mystery the chair be a cheap one make of white wood and have the usual smooth strip of wood at the top on the back of this piece of wood a quarter of a inch or so from the bottom on the left-hand side be a faint smear of blood the presence of the blood set I think when find the chair have be exactly eighteen inch from the body the mere fact that the man have be stab from behind and to the heart preclude any possibility of he have jump up and catch at the back of the chair afterwards place my left hand upon the back i clasped my finger under the piece of wood above-mentioned to discover that a portion of the second finger fall exactly upon the stain now i think i understand the situation i say to myself the old man be seat at the table about to commence he meal when the murderer enter very quietly by the door behind he he rest he left hand upon the chair to steady himself while he aim the fatal blow with he right but in that case how do the knife touch the middle finger of he left hand from the fact that the body be discover lie upon its back just as it have fall and that the chair be also still upon the floor it be evident that the blood must have get there before not after the crime be commit leave the room i go out to the yard at the back and study the paling fence the partition which separate the yard from that of the house next door be old and in a very dilapidated condition while that at the bottom be almost new and be arm at the top with a row of bristle nail bring the powerful magnifying-glass i have bring with I for such a purpose to bear upon it i examine it carefully from end to end the result more than justified the labor a little more than half way along i discover another small smear of blood there could be no doubt that the man have cut he finger on a nail as he have climb over on he murderous errand the next and more important thing be to decide how this information be to be make useful to I since nothing have be take from the house and the old man have be quite unprepared for the attack that be to be make upon he i set the whole crime down as be one of revenge in that case what would the assassin be likely to do after he object be obtain would he vanish into the bush forthwith or get away by sea after i have finish my inspection of the fence i visit every public-house in the neighborhood in the hope of find out whether a man with a wounded hand have be see in any of they on the night of the murder i be totally unsuccessful however no one recollect have see such a man from the hotel i go to various chemist ' shop but with the same result next i try the shipping-office connect with the line of steamer leave the port but with no more luck than before the case seem rapidly go from bad to worse and already it have be suggest that i should give it up and return to my duty without further waste of time this as you may naturally suppose i have no desire to do i worried myself about it day and night give it a great deal more attention in fact than i should bestow upon such a matter now or even upon case of twice the importance if there have be nothing else in my favor my attention to duty should have be sufficient to have commend I to my superior it be the other way round however the press be twit the authority concern they inability to discover the murderer and more than hint at the inefficiency of the detective force when i have be engage upon the matter for about a fortnight and with what success i have already inform you the commissioner send for I and tell I that he do not think my qualification be sufficiently mark to warrant my be employ longer on the task in hand this facer come upon the top of all the hard work i have be do and possibly my nerve be somewhat strain by my anxiety lead I to say more than i intend though a man may have the bad luck to fail in a thing he seldom like to be remind of it it be certainly so in my case consequently i be inform that at the end of the month my connection with the queensland police would terminate very well sir i say in the meantime if you will give I the opportunity i will guarantee to catch the murderer and prove to you that i be not as incapable as you imagine i have often wonder since that i be not order back to the bush there and then the fact remain however that i be not and thus i be permit to continue my quest unhindered ever since i have first take the affair in hand i have have one point continually before my eye the mere fact that the man have be stab in the back seem to I sufficient proof that the assassin be of foreign origin and that the affair be the outcome of a vendetta and not the act of a ordinary bloodthirsty crime the wound so the doctor inform I be a extremely deep and narrow one such as might very well have be make by a stiletto assume my supposition to be correct i return to the house and once more overhaul the dead man 's effect there be little or nothing there however to help I if he have lay himself out to conceal the identity of he enemy he could scarcely have do it more effectually baffle in one direction i turn for assistance to another in other word i interview he left-hand neighbor a lady with whom i have already have some slight acquaintance we conversation take place across the fence that separate the two property do you happen to be aware i ask when we touch upon the one absorb topic whether the unfortunate gentleman have ever be in europe he have be almost everywhere the woman reply i believe he be a sailor at one time and i have often hear he boast that he know almost every seaport in the world i suppose you never hear he say whether he have live in italy i inquire he use to mention the country now and again she say if it be a fine morning he would sometimes remark that it be a perfect italian sky but nothing more than that i be about to thank she and move away when she stop I with a exclamation wait one moment she say now i come to think of it i remember that about three month ago he receive a letter from italy i 'll tell you how i come to know it i be stand in the front verandah when the postman bring up the letter he give I mine and then i notice that the top letter he hold in he hand have a foreign stamp now my little boy willie collect stamp he be tire of they now but that do not matter at that time however he be so take up with they that he could talk of nothing else well as i be say i notice this stamp and ask the postman what country it come from he tell I it be from italy and that the letter be for the gentleman next door ` the next time i see he ' i say to myself ` i 'll ask he for that stamp for willie ' i have my opportunity that self-same minute for just as i be go down the garden there to where my husband be do a little cabbage-planting he come into he front verandah he take the letter from the postman and as he look at the envelope i see he give a start of surprise he face be as white as death when he open it and he have no sooner glance at it than he give a sort of stagger and if it have not be for the verandah-rail i believe he would have fall he be so take aback that i think he be go to faint i be stand where you may be now and i call out to he to know whether i could do anything for he i like the man you see and pity he for he loneliness what be more he and my husband have always be on friendly term together well as i be go on to say he do not answer but pull himself together go into the house and shut the door when next i see he he be quite himself again at last the case be begin to look more hopeful i think i could see a faint spark of light ahead do you happen to say anything about this to the other detective when they be make inquiry after the crime have be commit i ask with a little anxiety no i do not she reply i never give it a thought it be such a long time before the murder you see and to tell the truth i have forget all about it it be only when you begin to talk of italy and of he have be there that i remember it you do not mean to say you think that letter have something to do with the man 's death that be a very difficult question to answer i observe i think however it be exceedingly likely it may have have some connection with it at any rate we shall see now will you think for one moment and see whether you can tell I the exact day on which that letter arrive she consider for a few moment before she answer i believe i can if you will give I time to turn it over in my mind she say my husband be at home that morning and willie that be my little boy be very much upset because i would not let he stay away from school to help he father in the garden yes sir i can tell you the exact date it be on a Monday and the third of June i thank she for the information she have give I and then go off to see what use it be likely to prove to I the letter from italy have be deliver in brisbane on the third of June the murder be commit on the night of the nineteenth of July or in other word forty-six day later with all speed i set off to the office of the royal mail steamship company where i ask to be show they passenger-list for the vessel that arrive on the nineteenth of July when it be hand to I i scan it eagerly in the hope of discover a italian name there be at least a dozen in the steerage and one in the first-class i be relieved however to find that all but the first-class passenger have disembark at cairn further up the coast the name of the exception be steffano gairdus and he be a passenger from naple you can not tell I anything more definite about this gentleman i suppose i say to the clerk who be attend to I do you happen to see he he be in here only this morning the man reply here when i inquire with such surprise that the other clerk look up from they book at I in astonishment do you mean to tell I that the gentleman i be ask about be here this morning i do he reply he come in to book he return passage to italy he only undertake the voyage for the sake of he health then it be just possible you may know where he be stay now i ask not however with much hope of success if you can tell I i shall be under a obligation to you i can tell you that also the young man answer he be stay at the continental hotel in adelaide street i be more oblige to you than i can say i return you have render I a great service do not mention it say the clerk i be very glad to have be able to give you the information you require i thank he once more and leave the office now if mr steffano gairdus happen to have a cut or the mark of one upon the inside of he left hand i feel that i should be within measurable distance of the end of the affair but how be i to get a view of he hand if he be the man i want he would probably be on he guard and he have already prove himself to be sufficiently acute to make I careful how i go to work with he i have no time to lose however the next boat sail for europe in two day ' time and he have book he passage in she for that reason alone i know that i must be quick if i wish to accumulate sufficient evidence against he to justify the issue of a warrant for he arrest i accordingly walk on to the continental hotel and ask to see the manager with whom i have the good fortune to be acquaint i be show into he private office and presently he join I there he be familiar with my connection with the police force and laughingly remark that he hope i have not call upon he in my official capacity as a matter of fact that be just what i be do i reply i want you to give I some information concern one of you guest i believe i be right in say that you have a italian gentleman name gairdus stay at you hotel that be certainly so he admit i hope there be nothing against he it be rather soon to say that i say i be suspicious of the man -- and i want to ask you a few question concern he as many as you like he return i can not say however that i know very much about he he have be up the country and only return to brisbane yesterday be this the first occasion on which he have stay here no the manager reply he be here nearly a month ago for a couple of night and he have have he room reserve for he while he be away perhaps you can tell I if he sleep here on the night of July the nineteenth if you will excuse I for a moment i can soon let you know say the manager and then cross the room to go into a outer office a few moment later he return and nod he head yes he sleep here that night and go to toowoomba next day one more question and then i have do do you happen to notice that night or before he leave next day whether he have hurt he left hand it be strange that you should speak of that say the manager he have cut he left hand rather badly with a broken glass so he tell we we give he some sticking-plaster to do it up with that will do beautifully i say and now perhaps you will add to the kindness you have already do I by let I see the gentleman in question i do not want to speak to he but i want to impress he countenance upon my mind why not go into lunch the manager inquire you will then be able to study he to you heart 's content without he be any the wiser you be not in uniform and no one would take you for a detective a excellent idea i reply by the way while i be upon the subject i suppose i can rely upon you say nothing about the matter to he or to any one else you may depend upon I implicitly he answer i should be scarcely likely to do so for my own sake i trust the matter be not a very serious one i should not like to have any scandal in the hotel well between ourselves i observe i be afraid it be rather a serious affair but you may be sure i will do all i can to prevent you name or the hotel 's be mix up in it then as he have propose i follow he into the dining-room and take my place at a small table near the window at that adjoining I a tall swarthy individual with close-cropped hair a italian without doubt be seat he glance at I as i take my place and then continue he meal as if he be unaware of my presence in the room by the time i have finish my lunch i have thoroughly impressed he face and personality upon my memory and feel sure that if necessary i should know he anywhere again my labor however be by no means over in fact they be only just begin what i have against he so far would scarcely be sufficient to justify we apply for a warrant for he arrest if i want to bring the crime home to he it would be necessary for I to connect he with it more closely than i have yet do but how to do this in the short space of time that be at my disposal i could not see the murderer as i have already say be no ordinary one and have lay he plan with the greatest care he have take away the knife and in all probability have get rid of it long since no one have see he enter the house on the night in question nor have any one see he leave it again i be nearly beside myself with vexation to be so near my goal and yet not be able to reach it be provoke beyond endurance but my lucky star be still in the ascendant and good fortune be to favor I after all as i have already observe when the crime have become know the permanent detective force have be most assiduous in the attention they have give it the only piece of valuable evidence however that they have be able to accumulate be a footprint on a flower-bed near the center of the yard and another in the hall of the house itself now it be definitely settle by a careful comparison of these imprint that the murderer whoever he might have be wear he boot down considerably on the left heel and on the inside now as every bootmaker will tell you while the outer be often affect in this way the inner side seldom be i notice however that this be the case with the man i suspect the heel of he left boot be very much wear down and on the inside the right however be intact on leave the continental hotel i make my way to the police commissioner 's office obtain a interview with he and place the evidence i have glean before he he be good enough to express he approval of my endeavor but be doubtful whether the case against the italian be strong enough yet to enable we to definitely bring the crime home to the man at any rate it will justify we issue a warrant for he arrest he say and that have better be do with as little delay as possible otherwise he will be out of the country a warrant be immediately procure and a officer be detail to accompany I in case i should need he assistance when we reach the continental hotel i inquire for señor gairdus only to be inform that he have leave the hotel soon after lunch it be only what i expect i say to my companion he suspicion be arouse and he be go to try and give we the slip i think not say the manager i fancy you will find that he be on board the steamer you must remember that she sail at daybreak we accordingly hasten to the river and make we way to where the steamer be lie on arrival on board i inquire for the head-steward and when he put in a appearance inquire whether señor gairdus have come aboard yet he bring he luggage on board and inspect he cabin about three o'clock that official reply and then go ashore again there be nothing for it therefore but for we to await he return though we do not know it we be in for a long spell for it be not until nearly nine o'clock that we man reappear on board he have just cross the gangway and be make he way along the promenade deck when i accost he may i have a word with you señor gairdus i ask yes certainly he reply speak with only a slight foreign accent what be it you want i draw he a few pace further along the deck so that if possible the other passenger who be stand near should not hear what i have to say to he i have to tell you i say that i hold a warrant for you arrest on the charge of murder one joseph spainton on the night of July the nineteenth of this year i must caution you that anything you may say will be use as evidence against you the nearest electric light shone full and clear upon he face and i notice that a queer expression have suddenly make its appearance upon it apart from that he do not seem at all surprise at he arrest so you have find it out after all he say i think i be go to evade suspicion and get away safely you would not have catch I then it be fate i suppose he shrug he shoulder and say something under he breath in italian must i go ashore with you he ask if you please i answer marvel that he should take it so coolly then turn he dark eye upon I he continue -- señor in italy i be a gentleman and my name which be not gairdus be a honor one what i be accuse of and what i admit do be no crime the dead man be a traitor and i be depute to kill he i do it and this be the end the word have scarcely leave he lip before he take a revolver from he coat-pocket place it to he right temple and before i could prevent he have pull the trigger he fall with a crash at my foot and before the ship 's doctor could be bring to he side he be dead who he really be or to what secret society he belong -- for he last word to I warrant the belief that he be a member of some such organization -- we be never able to discover he be dead and there be a end to it such be the story of the first big case in which i be engage and one that lead I step by step to the position i now hold i have tell it perhaps at somewhat greater length than i need have do but i trust the reader will forgive I as a matter of fact i be rather proud of it more so perhaps than i have any reason to be -lrb- illustration : he fall with a crash at my foot -rrb- have resign my position in the police of the northern colony i be not to be tempt to reconsider my decision my liking for the life however and my interest in the unravelling of mysterious crime prove too strong and i join the detective staff in melbourne see in they service a good deal of queer life and ferret out not a small number of extraordinary case the experience gain there be invaluable and lead I after one particularly interesting piece of business in which i have the good fortune to be most successful to entertain the notion of quit government employ altogether and set up for myself i do so and soon have more work upon my hand than i could very well accomplish but i be too ambitious to be content with small thing and eventually come to the conclusion that there be not enough scope in the colony for I after fifteen year ' absence therefore i return to england spend a year in the further east _ en route _ in order to enlarge my experience and to qualify myself for any work that might come to I from that quarter on a certain bitterly cold day in January i reach liverpool from the united state and take the train for my old home my father and mother have long since die and now all that remain to I of they be the stone slab that cover they rest place in the quiet little churchyard at the foot of the hill well here i be i say to myself thirty-three year old and alone in the world nobody know I in england but it will not be my fault if they do not hear of george fairfax before very long i 'll be off to london and try my fortune there next day i make my way to the great metropolis and install myself at a small private hotel while i look about I preparatory to commence business to talk of gain a footing in london be all very well in its way but it be by no means so easy a task to accomplish as it might appear doubtless it can be do fairly quickly if one be prepare to spend large sum of money in advertising and be not afraid to blow one 's own trumpet on every possible occasion but that be not my line and besides even have i so wish i have not the money to do it for a multitude of reason i do not feel inclined to embark my hard-earned savings on such a risky enterprise i prefer to make my way by my own diligence and with that end in view i rent a office in a convenient quarter furnish it put a small advertisement in a few of the papers and then await the come of my client as i have a long and curious story to tell and this book be only intend to be the narration of a certain episode in my life a detailed description of my first three year in london would not only be superfluous but in every way a waste of time let it suffice that my first case be that of the now notorious pilchard street diamond robbery my success in which bring I business from a well know firm in hatton garden as the public will doubtless remember they have be rob of some valuable gem between london and amsterdam in a singularly audacious manner my second be the case of the celebrated russian swindler who call herself the countess demikoff this case alone take I nearly six month to unravel but i do not grudge the time see that i be well pay for my labor and that i manage to succeed where the police have fail from that time forward i think i may say without boast that i have be as successful as any man of my age have a right to expect to be what be better still i be now in the happy position of be able to accept or decline business as i choose it be in many respects a hard life and at all time be attend with a fair amount of risk but you can not make omelet without break egg and if any one choose to spend he life run to earth man who be wage war against society well he must not grumble if he receive some hard knock in return after these preliminary i will proceed to show how i come to be mix up in the most curious case it have ever be my good or evil fortune to encounter it show I a side of human nature i have not meet before and it bring I the greatest happiness a man can ever hope to find chapter ii all business london and a good many other people besides must remember the famous united empire bank fraud bond have be steal and negotiate vast sum of money be discover to be miss and the manager and one of the director be absent also so cleverly have the affair be work and so flare be the defalcation that have it not be for the public-spirited behavior and generosity of two of the director the position of the bank would have be most seriously compromise if not shatter altogether how the culprit have manage to slip through the finger of the law in the first place no one could say but the fact remain that they be able to get out of england without apparently leave a trace of they intention or they whereabouts behind they scotland yard take the matter up with its usual promptness and at first be confident of success they set they cleverest detective to work upon it and it be not until more than a month have elapse that the man engage be compel most reluctantly to admit they defeat they have do they best : it be the system under which they work that be to blame in the detection of crime or in the trace of a criminal it be best as in every other walk of life to be original one morning on arrive at my office i find a letter await I from the remain director of the bank in which they inquire if i could make it convenient to call upon they at the head-office that day to tell the truth i have be expect this summons for nearly a week and be far from be displeased when it come the work i have expect they to offer I be after my own heart and if they would only trust the business to I and give I a free hand i be prepare on my part to bring the miss gentleman to justice needless to say i call upon they at the hour specify and after a brief wait be conduct to the board room where the director sit in solemn conclave the chairman sir walter bracebridge receive I on behalf of he colleague we write to you mr fairfax he say in order to find out whether you could help we concern the difficulty in which we find ourselves place you of course be aware of the serious trouble the bank have experience and of the terrible consequence which have result therefrom i admit that i be quite conversant with it and wait to hear what he would have to say next as a matter of fact he continue we have send for you to know whether you can offer we any assistance in we hour of difficulty pray take a chair and let we talk the matter over and see what conclusion we can arrive at i seat myself and we discuss the affair to such good purpose that when i leave the boardroom it be on the understanding that i be to take up the case at once and that my expense and a very large sum of money should be pay I provide i could manage to bring the affair to a successful termination i spend the remainder of that day at the bank carefully study the various memorandum a great deal of what i have read and hear have be mere hearsay and this it be necessary to discard in order that the real fact of the case might be take up and the proper conclusion draw therefrom for three day i weigh the case carefully in my mind and at the end of that time be in a position to give the board a definite answer to they inquiry thereupon i leave england with the result that exactly twelve week later the two man so much want be at bow street and i have the proud knowledge of know that i have succeed where the man who have try before I have so distinctly fail as will be remember it be a case that interested every class of society and press and public be alike unite in the interest they show in it it be not however to the trial itself as much as another curious circumstance connect with it that have induce I to refer to it here the case have pass from the magistrate 's court to the old bailey and be hourly increase in interest day after day the court be crowd to overflow and when the time come for I to take my place in the witness-box and describe the manner in which i have lead up to and effect the capture of the offender the excitement rise to fever-heat i can see the whole scene now as plainly as if it have occur but yesterday the learn judge upon the bench the jury in they box the row of counsel and the bench full of interested spectator i give my evidence and be examine by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defense i describe how i have trace the man from england to they hiding-place abroad and the various attempt that have be make to prevent they extradition and have just refer to a certain statement one of the prisoner have make to I soon after he arrest when a interruption cause I to look behind at the row of spectator at the further end of the bench nearest I be two man one be evidently tall the other very short the taller be the possessor of silvery white hair and a long and venerable beard he be a handsome look man of about forty and my first glance at he tell I that he be blind as i have say he companion be a much smaller man with a smooth almost boyish face a pair of twinkling eye but a mouth rather hard set both be evidently follow the case closely and when on the next day i see that they be in the same place i take a even greater interest in they than before it be not however until the trial have finish and the pair of miserable man have be send to penal servitude for a lengthy term of year that i make the acquaintance of the man i have just describe i remember the circumstance quite distinctly i have leave the court and be proceed down the old bailey in the direction of ludgate hill when i hear my name pronounce turn round i discover to my astonishment the two man i have see in the court and who have seem to take such a interest in the case the smaller be guide he friend along the crowded pavement with a dexterity that be plainly the outcome of a long practice when i stop they stop also and the blind man address I he voice be deep and have a note of pathos in it impossible to describe it may have be that i be a little sad that afternoon for both the man who have be condemn to penal servitude have wife and child to whose pitiful condition the learn judge have refer when pass sentence you be mr fairfax be you not inquire the taller of the man that be my name i admit what can i do for you if we could persuade you to vouchsafe we a hour of you valuable time we should be more grateful than we could say the man reply we have a important piece of business which it might possibly be to you advantage to take up at any rate it would be worthy of you consideration but why have you not come to I before i inquire you have see I in court every day why do you wait until the case be at a end because we want to be quite sure of you he answer we case be so large and of such vital importance to we that we do not desire to run any risk of lose you we think we would wait and familiarize ourselves with all that you have do in this affair before come to you now we be satisfied that we could not place we case in better hand and what we be anxious to do be to induce you to interest yourself in it and take it up you pay I a very high compliment i say but i can not give you a decision at once i must hear what it be that you want I to do and have time to think it over before i can answer you that be my invariable rule and i never depart from it do you know my office we know it perfectly return the blind man it would be strange if we do not see that we have stand outside it repeatedly try to summon up courage to enter would it be possible for you to grant we a interview to-night i fear not i say i be tired and stand in need of rest if you care to come to-morrow morning i shall be very pleased to see you but you must bear in mind the fact that my time be valuable and that it be only a certain class of case that i care to take up personally we be not afraid of we case the man reply i doubt if there have ever be another like it i fancy you yourself will say so when you hear the evidence i have to offer it be not as if we be destitute we be prepare to pay you well for you service but we must have the very best that england can supply my reader must remember that this conversation be be carry on at the corner of ludgate hill and the old bailey curious glance be be throw at my companion by passer-by and so vehement be the taller man 's utterance become that a small crowd be gradually collect in we neighborhood very well i say if you be really desirous of consult I i shall be very glad to see you at my office at ten o'clock to-morrow morning i must ask you however not to be late as i have several other appointment we shall not be late the man answer you may rely upon that we have too much at stake to run any risk of lose you assistance we will be with you to-morrow morning at ten o'clock punctually he thereupon bid I good-bye and raise he hat politely be lead along the street by he companion in a opposite direction to that i be take they seem delighted that i have give they a appointment but for my part i be afraid i be too absorb by the memory of the day and the punishment that have be allot to the two principal member in the swindle to think very much of they and they business indeed although i make a note of the appointment it be not until i have arrive at the office on the follow morning that i recollected they promise visit i have just finish my correspondence and have dictate a few letter to my manage clerk when a junior enter with two card which he place before I the first i take up bear the name of mr septimus codd that of the second mr george kitwater when i have finish the letter i be in the act of dictate i bade the clerk admit they and a moment later the blind man and he companion whom i have see on ludgate hill the previous evening be usher into my presence i can not remember a more venerable appearance than that present by the taller man he be a personality that would have appeal forcibly to any student of humanity it be decidedly a open countenance to which the long white beard that descend almost to he waist give a add reverence he head be well shaped and well set upon he shoulder he height be six foot two if a inch and he carry himself with the erectness of a man accustom to a outdoor life he be well dress and for this reason i surmise that he be the possessor of good manners he companion be as much below the middle height as he be above it he be a peculiar countenance resemble that of a boy when see at a distance and that of a old man when one be close to he he eye as i have already say be small and they be set deep in he head this in itself be calculate to add to he peculiar appearance he steer he blind companion into the room and place he in a seat then he perch himself on a chair beside he and wait for I to open the debate good-morning gentleman i say allow I to congratulate you on you punctuality we be afraid of miss you observe kitwater we business be so particular that we do not want to run any risk of lose we appointment perhaps you will now be good enough to tell I what that business be i reply take my note-book out of a drawer preparatory to write down what they have to say in the first place sir the man begin we of course understand that everything we have to tell you will be regard by you as strictly private and confidential that go without say i reply if i be to divulge what my client tell I my business would not be worth a day 's purchase you can rest assure that everything you may impart to I will be treat in strictest confidence we thank you say kitwater the story i have to tell you be perhaps the strangest that have ever be tell to mortal man to begin with you must understand that my companion and myself have but lately arrive in england we have be for many year missionary in china sowing the good seed in the western province i do not know whether you have ever visit that country but even if you have not you must be aware to some extent of the danger to which we calling be subject we carry we life in we hand from the moment we leave civilization until we enter it again there be time however that compensate one for all the trial that have to be undergo you must excuse I i say if i remind you that my time be valuable and that however interested i may be in the missionary work of china i can not allow it to interfere with my business the sooner you tell I in what way you want I to help you the sooner i shall be able to give you the answer you be seek i must implore you pardon the man continue humbly enough i be afraid we call however be apt to make we a trifle verbose if you will allow I i will put what i have to say in as few word as possible i bow and sign to he to proceed we case be as follow he begin as i have tell you we have be in china for several year and during that time we have have the good fortune to enroll not a few well-known name among we convert to make a long story short we be so successful as to be able to persuade even the mandarin of the province to listen to we message he be a enormously rich man one of the richest perhaps in china and be so impressed by the good news we bring to he that on he death-bed he leave to we for the benefit of the mission all he wealth in gold silver and precious stone it be a princely legacy and one that would have enable we to carry on we mission with such success as we have never before dream of but if you be so lucky and so much in love with you profession how do it come about that you be in england now i inquire i will tell you why he answer lean towards I and tap with he finger upon the edge of my writing-table it be a sad story and the mere tell of it cause I more pain than you would believe you must understand that at the time of the mandarin 's death a english traveller who have be pass through the western province reach we city and take up he abode with we needless to say we be overwhelm with grief at the loss of we patron the treasure he have present we with we take to the mission and deposit it in a safe place we have no suspicion of any sort of treachery i fear my companion and i be not man of the world that be to say we do not go about suspect evil of we neighbor i think i understand i say you bring the treasure home put it in what you consider a safe place and one day awake to find you estimable guest miss and the treasure go with he have i guess correctly you have hit the mark exactly kitwater reply we wake one day not only to find the treasure go but also ourselves and we mission seriously compromise the relation of the dead man not only accuse we of have alienate he from the faith of he forefather but also of have rob he of he ancestral treasure we could not but admit that we have be present with the wealth in question and when it be demand of we we could only explain that we have lose it in we turn you can imagine the position for yourself at the best of time the foreigner be not popular in china and we situation be particularly unpleasant situate as we be in one of the wildest portion of the empire and accuse of the basest sacrilege that be to say of violate the home of a dead man we could hope for but small mercy the man who have rob we have entirely disappear and no trace of he could be discover to attempt to offer any explanation or to incriminate he be out of the question we could only suffer in silence he pause and heave a heavy sigh and what form do you punishment take i inquire for i be begin to be interested in they story can you not see for yourself the man answer can you not see that i be blind while my companion be dumb that be what they condemn we to by that man 's villainy i be destine never to look upon god 's earth again while my companion will never be able to converse with he fellow-men except by sign we be in the world yet out of it i look at they both in amazement they tale seem too terrible to be true and yet i have the best of evidence to show that it be correct and why have you come to I what do you want I to do i can not give you back you sight nor you friend he power of speech but you can help we to find the man who bring this misery upon we kitwater reply that be what we have come to ask of you he must not be permit to enjoy the wealth he steal from we it be sacred to a special duty and that duty it must perform we be not overburdened with riches in fact we be dependent upon the bounty of another but if you can help we to recover the sum that be steal from we we will gladly pay whatever you may ask we can not say more than that but this be a most unheard-of request i say how do you know where the man may be at this moment we do not know or we should scarcely have ask you assistance kitwater reply with some show of reason it be because we have hear of you wonderful power in trace people that we have come to you we only cause for attend the trial at which you see we be to hear the evidence you give and to draw we own conclusion from it that those conclusion be complimentary to you we presence here be evidence of we know that we could not put we case in better hand and we will leave it with you to say whether or not you will help we as i say just now my companion be dumb while i be blind we can not do much ourselves will you not take pity upon we and help we to find the man who betray and ruin we but he may be at the other end of the world at this moment i say that do not matter he return we know that wherever he may be you will find he all we ask you to do be to bring we face to face with he we will manage the rest it will be strange then if we be not able to get he to a proper way of think this be the most unusual case i have have to do with and for the moment i scarcely know what to say i turn to the blind man once more have you any idea where the man go after he rob you he cross the province of yunnan into burmah he reply after that he make he way through mandalay to rangoon and ship on board the steamer _ jemadar _ for london when do the _ jemadar _ reach london on the twenty-third of June he answer we have make inquiry upon that point i make a note of this and then continue my inquiry one other question i say while we be on the subject what do you suppose would be the total value of the treasure of which he rob you that be very difficult to say kitwater reply and then turn to he companion and hold out he hand the other take it and tap upon the palm with the tip of he finger in a sort of dot-and-telegraph fashion that i have never see use before my friend say that there be ninety-three stone all ruby and sapphire they be of exquisite lustre and extraordinary size possibly they might have be worth anything from a hundred and seventy thousand pound to a quarter of a million i open my eye on hearing this be the man tell I the truth i ask myself or be they try to interest I in the case by exaggerate the value of the treasure what you say be almost incomprehensible i continue i trust you will forgive I but can you substantiate what you say when we say that we be willing to pay you expense in advance if you will try to find the man i think we be give you very good proof of we _ bona fides _ he remark i be afraid we can not give you any other see as i have say that we be both poor man if you be prepare to take up we case we shall be under a life-long gratitude to you but if you can not we must endeavor to find some one else who will undertake the task it be impossible for I to decide now whether i can take it up or not i say lean back in my chair and look at they both as i speak i must have time to think it over there be a hundred and one thing to be consider before i can give you a direct reply there be silence for a few moment and then kitwater who have be hold he usual mysterious communication with he friend say -- when do you think you will be able to let we have a answer that depend upon a variety of circumstance i reply it be a matter difficult to average in the first place there be no know where the man be at present : he may be in london he may be in america he may be in any other portion of the globe it might cost five hundred pound to find he it might cost five thousand you must see for yourselve how uncertain it all be in that case we should be prepare to give security for the first-named amount or pay you half in advance kitwater reply i hope you do not think mr fairfax that we be endeavor to play you false you can see for yourself that we injury be permanent and as far as they go be at least evidence concern the truth of we story you can also see for yourself how this man have behave towards we he have rob we of all we hold valuable and to he act of treachery we owe the mutilation we have suffer can you wonder that we be anxious to find he i do not wonder at that at all i say my only feeling be that i must regard it as a entirely business matter we can not blame you kitwater reply yet you must surely understand we anxiety for a definite and immediate answer the man have have a considerable start of we already and he have doubtless disposed of the jewel ere this at whatever price he sell they he must now be in possession of a considerable fortune which rightly belong to we we be not vindictive man all we ask be for we own i quite agree with you there i reply the only question in my mind be who shall get it for you let I explain matter a little more clearly in the first place i have no desire to offend you but how be i to know that the story you tell I be a true one i have already tell you that you will have to take we word for that he say it will be a great disappointment to we if you can not take the matter up but we must bear it as we have bear we other misfortune when we realize the way you manage those bank people we say to each other -- ` that be the man for we if any one can catch hayle he be that person ' it naturally come to we as a disappointment to find that you be not willing to take up the case i have not say that i be not willing i answer i only say that i be not go to commit myself until i have give the matter due consideration if you will call here at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon i shall be able to give you a definite answer i suppose we must be content with that say kitwater lugubriously they thereupon thank I and rise to go by the way i say do this man hayle know that you be in england the blind man shake he head he think we be lie dead in the jungle he say and it be not he fault that we be not do he suspect for a moment that we be alive and in the same country as himself he would be out of it like a rat drive by a ferret from he hole but if you will give we you assistance sir we will make he aware of we presence before very long though he try to speak unconcernedly there be a expression upon the man 's face that startle I i feel that blind though he be i should not care to be in mr hayle 's place when they should meet after they have leave I i light a cigar and begin to think the matter over i have have a number of strange case present to I in my time but never one that have open in such a fashion as this a man rob he friend in the center of china the latter be tortured and maim for life and come to I in london to seek out they betrayer for they in whatever part of the globe he might be the whole thing seem so preposterous as to be scarcely worth consideration and yet try how i would to put it out of my mind i find myself think of it continually the recollection of the blind man 's face and that of he dumb companion haunt I awake and asleep more than once i determine to have nothing to do with they only later to change my mind and vow that i would see the matter through at any cost to myself next morning however saner counsel prevail a exceedingly remunerative offer be make I by a prominent trust company which at any other time i should have have no hesitation in immediately accept fate however which be generally more responsible for these matter than most folk imagine have still a card to play upon messr kitwater and codd 's behalf and it be destine to overthrow all my scruple and what be more to ultimately revolutionize the conduct of my whole life chapter iii towards the middle of the morning i be sit in my office await the come of a prominent new york detective with whom i have a appointment when my clerk enter to inform I that a lady be in the outer office and desire to see I if i could spare she a few minute who be she i inquire find out that and also she business she name be kitwater the man reply when he return after a moment 's absence but she decline to state she business to any one but yourself sir kitwater i say then she be a relation i suppose of the blind man who be here yesterday what on earth can she have to say to I well lawson will not be here for another ten minute so you may as well show she in then to myself i add -- this be a development of the case which i do not expect i wonder who she be -- wife sister daughter or what of the blind man i be not to be leave long in doubt for presently the door open and the young lady herself enter the room i say ' _ young lady _ ' because she age could not at most have be more than one-or two-and-twenty she be tall and the possessor of a graceful figure while one glance be sufficient to show I that she face be a exceedingly pretty one -lrb- afterwards i discover that she eye be dark brown -rrb- i rise and offer she a chair good morning miss kitwater i say this be a unexpected visit will not you sit down when she have do so i resume my seat at the table mr fairfax she begin you be the great detective i believe i admit the soft impeachment with as much modesty as i could assume at so short a notice she certainly be a very pretty girl i have come to talk to you about my uncle she stop as if she do not quite know how to proceed then the gentleman who call upon I yesterday and who have the misfortune to be blind be you uncle i say yes he be my father 's younger and only brother she answer i have often hear my father speak of he but i have never see he myself until he arrive in england a month ago with he companion mr codd mr fairfax they have suffer terribly i have never hear anything so awful as they experience i can quite believe that i answer you uncle tell I something of they great trouble yesterday it seem wonderful to I that they should have survive to tell the tale then he must have tell you of hayle they suppose friend -lrb- she speak with superb scorn -rrb- the man who betray they and rob they of what be give they it be for that purpose that they call upon I i answer they be anxious that i should undertake the search for this man she rest she clasped hand upon the table and look pleadingly at I and will you do so i be consider the matter i say with the first feeling of reluctance i have experience in the case i have promise to give they my decision this afternoon so they inform I and that be why i be here she reply oh mr fairfax you do not know how i pity they surely if they could find this man he heart would be touch and he would refund they a portion at least of what he take from they and what be legally theirs i be afraid it be very doubtful whether he will i say even in the event of he be find gentleman of he description be not conspicuous for they pity nor as a rule will they disgorge unless considerable pressure of a unpleasant description be bring to bear upon they then that pressure must be bring to bear she say and if i may say so you be the only one who can do it that be why i have call upon you this morning i have come to plead with you to implore you if necessary to take the matter up i be not very rich but i would willingly give all i have in the world to help they in that case you be one niece in a thousand miss kitwater i say with a smile you uncle be indeed fortunate in have such a champion she look at I as if she be not quite certain whether i be joking or not you will do this for they what be i to say what could i say i have well nigh decide to have nothing to do with the matter yet here i be begin to think it be hard upon I to have to disappoint she my profession be not one calculate to render a man 's heart over tender but i must confess that in this case i be by no means as adamant as be usual with I as i have say she be a unusually pretty girl and have she not be kind enough to express she belief in my power after all detective like other people be only human you uncle and he companion have promise to call upon I this afternoon i say and when they do so i think i may promise you that i will endeavor to come to some arrangement with they i thank you she say for i think that mean that you will try to help they if you do i feel confident that you will succeed i hope you will forgive I for have call upon you as i have do but when i see how disappointed they be after they interview with you yesterday i make up my mind that i would endeavor to see you and to interest you on they behalf before they come again you have certainly do so i answer as she rise to go if i take the case up and believe I i be not at all sure that i shall not do so they will owe it to you intercession oh no i do not mean that exactly she reply blush prettily i should like to feel that you do it for the reason that you believe in the justice of they cause not merely because i try to persuade you into it that would not be fair either to they or to you would it not be possible for it to be on account of both reason i ask let we hope so and now good-morning miss kitwater i trust you uncle will have good news for you when you see he again this afternoon i hope so too she answer and then with a renewal of she thanks and a little bow she leave the office i close the door and go back to my seat almost wonder at my own behavior here be i a hard-headed man of the world be draw into a extraordinary piece of business which i have most certainly decide to have nothing to do with simply because a pretty girl have smile upon I and have ask I to do it for i do not mind confess that i have make up my mind to help kitwater and codd in they search for the villain hayle the trust company would have to look elsewhere for assistance and yet as i have the best of reason for know that piece of business be likely to prove twice as remunerative as this search for the traitorous friend happily however money be not everything in this world during the remainder of the day i find myself look forward with a feeling that be almost akin to eagerness to the interview i be to have with kitwater and codd that afternoon if the two gentleman have fault unpunctuality be certainly not one of they for the clock upon the mantelpiece have scarcely finish strike the hour of four when i hear footstep in the office outside and next moment they be show into my own sanctum codd come first lead he friend by the hand and as he do so he eye I with a look of intense anxiety upon he face kitwater on the other hand be dignified and as impressive as ever if he be nervous he certainly conceal it very well good afternoon mr fairfax he say as codd lead he to a seat accord to the arrangement we come to yesterday afternoon we have come here to learn you decision which you promise to give we at four o'clock to-day i trust you have good news for we that depend upon how you take it i answer i have make up my mind to help you on certain condition and those condition be that you pay my expense and the sum of five hundred pound to which another five hundred be to be add if i be successful in help you to recover the treasure of which you tell I yesterday be that a fair offer a exceedingly fair one kitwater reply while little codd nod he head energetically to show that he appreciate it we have expect that you would charge more of course you understand that it may involve a chase round half the world before you can find he he be as slippery as a eel and if he once get to know that we be after he he 'll double and twist like a hare he 'll not be the first man i have have to deal with who possess these characteristic i answer and i have generally succeed in run they to earth at the end let 's hope for all we sake that you will be as successful in this case he say and now if i may ask the question when will you be ready to begin you search we shall both feel happier when we know that you be on he track i be ready as soon as you like i rejoin indeed the sooner the better for all party concerned nothing be to be gain by delay and if as you say the man have now be in england two month he may soon be think of get out of it again if he have not do so already but before i embark on anything you must answer I some question a hundred if you like he return you have only to ask they and i will do my best to answer in the first place i must have a description of this mr gideon hayle what be he like tall thin with brown hair and a short close-cropped beard he carry himself erect and look about thirty-eight you do not happen to have a photograph of he in you possession i suppose no reply kitwater shake he head gideon hayle be not the sort of man to allow himself to be photograph and what be more you must remember that when we reach nampoung the station on the frontier of burmah we have scarcely a rag upon we back any goods and chattel we might once have possess be in the hand of the chinese they have rob we of everything except what that arch thief hayle have already steal from we as he say this another look such as i have see on the occasion of he previous visit spread over he face the robber the thief he hiss almost tremble in he sudden excess of rage when i get hold of he he shall rue he treachery to the day of he death upward of a quarter of a million of money he steal from we and where be it now where be my sight and where be coddy 's power of speech all go and he be free ` vengeance be mine ' saith the lord but i want to repay it myself i want to -- here he lean across the table and turn he sightless eye upon I this be certainly a curious sort of missionary i say to myself as i watch he he may be smite on one cheek but i scarcely fancy he would be content to turn the other to the striker at this moment coddy lean forward in he chair and place he hand upon he friend 's arm the effect be magical he fit of impotent rage die down as suddenly as it have spring up and immediately he become again the quiet suave smoothspoken individual who have first enter my office i must beg you pardon mr fairfax he say in a totally different voice to that in which he have just speak when i remember how we have be wrong i be apt to forget myself i trust you will forgive I i will do so willingly i answer you have certainly win the right to be excuse if you entertain a feeling of resentment for the man who have treat you so shamefully and now to resume we conversation what be you about to say i be about to ask you the number and description of the stone of which he rob you you tell I they number ninety-three in all if i remember aright can you tell I how many there be of each forty-eight ruby and forty-five sapphire he reply without a moment 's hesitation the ruby be uncut and of various size range perhaps from ten to eighty carat they be true ruby not spinel remember that the sapphire run from fifteen carat to sixty and there be not a flaw amongst they have hayle any knowledge of the value of precious stone there be not a keener judge in the east he would be a cunning man who would succeed in take he in about the value of anything from a moonstone to a ruby in that case he would in all probability know where to place they to the best advantage you may be sure that be he intention in come to england but we have try hatton garden and can hear nothing of he there he may have dispose of some of they on the continent i say however we will soon clear that point up the size of the larger stone be so unusual that they would be certain to attract attention and now one other question be you aware whether he have any friend or relative in england so far as we know he have not a single relative in the world kitwater reply have you ever hear of one coddy the little man shake he head and then take the other 's hand tap upon it with he finger in the manner i have already describe he say hayle have a sister once of whom he be very fond the tap upon the hand continue and once more kitwater translate she be a cripple and live in a small house off the brompton road she die while hayle be in north borneo be not that so little man codd nod he head to show that kitwater have interpret he correctly i then make some inquiry as to the miss man 's habit so far the description i have have of he be commonplace in the extreme do you know whether he ship on board the _ jemadar _ for england under he own name or under a assume one he book he passage as george bertram kitwater reply we know that be so for we make inquiry at rangoon i next note the name and address of the vessel 's owner and resolve to pay he a visit next morning it would be hard if i could not learn from he something concern mr hayle and where he have go on landing i think those be all the question i want to ask you at present i say closing my note-book it would be as well perhaps for you to furnish I with you address in order that i may communicate with you should it be necessary at present say kitwater we be stay with my niece at the village of bishopstowe in surrey my late brother be vicar of the parish for many year and he leave he daughter a small property in the neighborhood they tell I it be a pretty place but as you be aware i unfortunately can not see it and my friend codd here can not talk to I about it he heave a heavy sigh and then rise to depart i must again express my gratitude to you mr fairfax he say for have consent to take up the case i feel certain you will ultimately be successful i will leave you to imagine with what anxiety we shall await any news you may have to give we i will communicate with you as soon as i have anything to report i answer you may rely upon my do my best to serve you by the way be you aware that you niece call upon I this morning he give a start of surprise no i certainly do not know it he reply she say nothing to we of such a intention i know that she be heart and soul with we in we desire to find hayle but since you have see she you probably know that i think i do i return for some reason almost abruptly she be a good girl say kitwater and then take from he pocket a envelope which he hand to I by the way i bring this with I he say in the hope that we should be able to induce you to accede to we wish inside you will find a hundred-pound note which should be sufficient to cover any preliminary expense if you need more perhaps you will be kind enough to communicate with I at once and it shall be send you a receipt can be forward to I at you leisure i thank he and place the envelope upon the table in my own mind i feel that it would be a easy matter to guess whence the sum have come and for a reason that i could not then analyze and therefore be unable to describe the thought irritated I have assure they that the amount would be quiet sufficient in the event of nothing unforeseen happen to last for some considerable time to come i conduct they to the door again repeat the promise that i would communicate with they so soon as i have anything to report if i have only known then that at the very moment when they step in to the street the man they want I to find for they and whom they hate so desperately be stand in a shop on the other side of the road keep a eye on my door and evidently watch for they departure how much trouble and vexation of spirit we should all have be save but i do not know this until long afterwards and then of course the information come too late to be of any service to we next morning i be early at the office be desirous of wind up another little matter before i turn my attention to the new affair one of my subordinate have just return from the continent whither i have send he to keep a eye on a certain pseudo-french marquis with whom i expect to have dealings at no distant date he report that the gentleman in question have break the bank at monte carlo have stake and lose all he winnings next day and have shoot himself on the promenade on the evening follow with he death the affair on which i have confidently expect to be employ come to a end i could not say that i be altogether sorry i shall want you to leave on Friday turner for st petersburg i say when he have finish he report and i have comment upon it do you remember paulus scevanovitch who be concern in that attempt to defraud the parisian jeweller maurel and company two year ago yes sir i remember he perfectly turner reply a tall burly man with a bushy beard the top of he little finger on the left hand miss and a long white scar over he right eyebrow the same i answer i see you have not forget he well i want you to find he out and let I have a exact account of he movement during the next three week the office will arrange you expense in the usual way and you have better leave by the mail-train in all probability i shall see you off very good sir the man respond and withdraw he have scarcely go before one of my clerk enter the room and hand I a card on it be print the name of mr edward bayley and in the left-hand bottom corner be the announcement that he be the managing director of the santa cruz mining company of forzoda in the argentine republic show the gentleman in walter i say in a few minute a tall handsome man irreproachably turn out enter the office he seat himself in a chair the clerk place for he put he hat and umbrella on another and then turn to I my card have make you familiar with my name mr fairfax he begin and doubtless if you be at all familiar with mine and mining you be acquaint with the name of the company i have the honor to represent i be very much afraid the mining market do not possess very much interest for I i reply i have to work so hard for my money that when i have get it i prefer to invest it in something a little more reliable may i inquire the nature of you business with I i have come to see you mr fairfax he say speak very impressively and regard I deliberately as he do so on rather a delicate subject before i explain what it be may i ask that you will treat what i be about to tell you as purely confidential my business be invariably a confidential one i answer for the second time in two day i venture to think that this room have hear more secret than almost any other in england but though they say wall have ear i have never hear it say that they have tongue it be sometimes a good thing that they have not he reply and now let I tell you what business have bring I here in the first place if you do not already know it i may say that the company i represent be a exceedingly wealthy one and as we business lie a long way from threadneedle street if i may so put it it be necessary for we to trust very largely to the honesty of we _ employés _ on the other side of the world of course we make all sort of inquiry about they prior to engage they service and it be also needless to say that we keep a sharp eye on they when they have enter we employ nevertheless it be quite possible all precaution notwithstanding for a unscrupulous man to take advantage of we as a matter of fact that be what have happen and what have also bring I to you for some considerable time past we have have we suspicion that we manager at the mine have be in league with a notorious rascal in new york in proof of this i might say that we return have show a decide fall off while we manager have so we have lately discover within the past year become rich enough to purchase property to a considerable extent in the united state unfortunately for we owe to a lack of direct evidence we be unable to bring he defalcation home to he though of course we be as certain of we fact as we can well be of anything i think i understand i say you business with I be to endeavor to induce I to go out to the argentine and make inquiry on you behalf with the idea of bring this man to book be that not so that be my errand he reply gravely if you care to undertake the task we on we side -- and i speak as the mouthpiece of the company -- will be prepare to pay you very high term for you service in point of fact almost what you may ask in reason the matter as you may suppose be a most serious one for we and every day 's delay be add to it may i ask what you term would be and when would you be prepare to start you offer be a most liberal one i say unfortunately however i fear there be a considerable difficulty in the way of my accept it a difficulty he exclaim raise he eyebrow as if in astonishment but surely that obstacle can be remove especially for a offer of such magnitude as we be prepare to make you excuse I i say somewhat tartly but however great the inducement may be i never break faith with my client the fact of the matter be only yesterday i promise to undertake another piece of business which while not be so remunerative perhaps as that you be now put before I mean a very great deal to those who be for the time be my employer would it be impertinent on my part to ask at what time yesterday afternoon you arrive at this momentous decision shortly after four o'clock i answer but not without a little wonderment as to he reason for put the question for my own part i do not see what it have to do with the matter in hand dear I how very vexing to be sure he observe this be certainly another instance of the contrariness of fate how so i ask because it be my intention to have call upon you shortly after lunch yesterday on this matter he answer unfortunately i be prevent at the last moment have i be able to get here i might have forestall you more successful client be you quite sure mr fairfax that it be out of the question for you to undertake what we want if it be necessary for I to go at once i fear it be i answer but if it would be of any use to you i could send you a trustworthy subordinate one who would be quite capable of undertake the work and who would give you every satisfaction i fear that would not be the same thing he say my firm have such implicit faith in you that they would not entertain the idea of any one else go now think mr fairfax for a moment if you be prepare to go i in my turn on behalf of my company be prepare to offer you you expense and a sum of five thousand pound you need not be away more than three month at longest so that you see we offer be at the rate of twenty thousand pound a year it be princely remuneration i look at he closely it be plain that he be in earnest -- in deadly earnest so it seem even a default manager would scarcely seem to warrant so much zeal i be very much flatter by you offer i say and believe I i most truly appreciate the generosity of you company but as i say before if it be necessary for I to go at once that be to say before i have complete my present case then i have no option but to most reluctantly decline perhaps you will think it over he continue and let I know say to-morrow no amount of think it over will induce I to alter my decision i reply you must see for yourself that i have no right to accept a retainer from one party and then throw they over in order to favor another that would not only be a dishonourable action on my part but would be bad from a business point of view no mr bayley i be exceedingly sorry but i have no option but to act as i be do in that case i must wish you a very good-morning he remark and take up he hat and umbrella i could see however that he be still reluctant to go good-morning i answer i hope you affair in the argentine may brighten before very long he shake he head gloomily and then leave the office without another word when he have go i answer some letter give some instruction to my manage clerk and then don my hat and set off for the office of the shipping company that have bring gideon hayle to england unfortunately it transpire that they be not in a position to do very much in the way of help I mr bertram have certainly travel home in one of they steamer so the manager inform I a boat that as a rule do not carry passenger he have land at the dock and from that moment they have neither see nor hear anything of he i inquire for the steamer only to learn that she be now somewhere on she way between singapore and hong kong this be decidedly disappointing but as most of the case in which i have be ultimately successful have have unpromising beginning i do not take it too seriously to heart leave the shipping office i next turn my attention to hatton garden where i call upon messr jacob and bulenthall one of the largest firm in the gem trade we have have many dealings together in the past and as i have have the good fortune on one occasion to do they a signal service i know that they would now do all that they could for I in return good-day mr fairfax say the chief partner as i enter he snug little sanctum which lead out of the main office what can i have the pleasure of do for you i be in search of some information i reply and i think you may be able to help I i will do all that be in my power to render you assistance he return as he wipe he glass and place they on he somewhat fleshy nose what be the information you require have there be another big robbery of stone and you think it possible that some of they may have come into we hand there certainly have be a robbery i reply and the stone may have be offer to you but not in the way you mean the fact of the matter be i want to discover whether or not a large consignment of uncut ruby and sapphire of great value have be place upon the market within the last two month uncut ruby and sapphire be be continually place upon the market he observe lean back in he chair and rattle he key but not such stone as those i be look for i say and furnish he with the rough weight that have be supply to I this be interesting -- decidedly interesting he remark especially since it serve to offer a explanation on a certain matter in which we have be interested for some little time past on the sixteenth of last month a gentleman call upon we here who state that he have lately return from the far east he have have so he declare the good fortune to discover a valuable mine the locality of which he be most careful not to disclose he thereupon show my partner and myself ten stone consist of five ruby and five sapphire each of which weigh between fifty-five and sixty carat and you purchase they we do and for a very heavy sum i can assure you the vendor be very well aware of they value as we soon discover and he be also a good hand at a bargain would you care to see the stone i shall be please to show they to you if you would i should like to see they immensely i reply thereupon he cross the room to a safe in the corner and when he have unlock it take from it a wash-leather bag presently ten superb gem be lie before I on the table there they be he say wave he hand towards they and as you can see for yourself they be worthy of be set in the crown of a emperor it be not often that we be enthusiastic in such matter but in this case we have very good reason to be when they be properly cut they will be well nigh priceless do you happen to know whether he sell any more of a similar kind in london i ask as he return they to they place in the safe i know that he sell fifteen smaller one to henderson and soil and three almost as large as those i have just show you to a firm in amsterdam if he be the man i want to get hold of that account for twenty-eight i say make a note of the fact as i speak originally he have ninety-three in he possession ninety-three the merchant reply as if he could scarcely believe he ear why he mine must be a source of unlimited wealth i wish i have know this before so do i i say and now perhaps you can go further and furnish I with a description of the man himself i shall then be able to tell you whether my gentleman and you customer be one and the same person i can describe he to you perfectly well he be tall but somewhat sparely build very sunburnt -- which would be account for by he long residence in the east -- he hair be streak with gray he have dark eye and a singularly sharp nose do he wear a beard no only a moustache the latter be carefully trim and i think wax of this however i be not quite certain and he name he would not tell we that we press he to disclose it but he obstinately refuse to do so he say that if he name become know it might lead to the discovery of he mine and that he be naturally anxious that such a event should not occur but what guarantee have you that the stone be not steal none whatever -- but it be most unlikely in the first place they be uncut in the second we have have they in we possession for some time and you may be sure have make the closest inquiry besides there be few such stone in europe and what there be be safely in the possession of they owner surely you be not go to tell I that they be steal in the man 's voice there be a perceptible note of alarm i do not think you need be afraid i say they be steal by the man from he two partner and all they want be to get hold of he in order to make he disgorge they share of what he get for they i be glad indeed to hear that be the reply i be begin to grow uneasy and now be there any other way in which i can serve you if so i shall be only too pleased to do it i inform he that if i have anything else to ask he i would call upon he again and then take my departure while i be in a great measure satisfy with the information i have gain i be not altogether easy in my mind the question to be answer be be the man i be after the same individual who have sell jacob and bulenthall the stone the description give I vary in several particulars to that furnish I by kitwater my client declare he to possess black hair the merchant have say gray the one have declare that hayle possess a beard the other that he have only a wax moustache the figure however be in both case identically the same have satisfy myself that he have no more to tell I i thank he for he courtesy and leave the office a fresh idea have occur to I which i think might lead to something and i resolve to put it into practice without any further waste of time chapter iv it would be a truism to declare that human nature be about as complicate a piece of machinery as could be find in the human world and yet i do not know why it should be consider so all thing and all man do not run in groove a man to be a criminal need not be hopelessly bad in every other sense i have meet murderer who do not possess sufficient nerve to kill a rabbit burglar who would rob a poor man of all he possession in the world and yet would not despoil a little child of a halfpenny the fact of the matter be we all have we better point we own innate knowledge of good and evil hayle have betray kitwater and codd in the cruellest fashion possible and by so do have condemn they to the most fiendish torture the mind of man could conceive yet it be through he one good point he weakness if i might so describe it that i be enable to come to my first grip with he it be between the hour of two and three that i enter the gate of brompton cemetery and commence my examination of the various grave therein contain up one path i wander and down another in search of the resting-place of the poor cripple sister of whom gideon hayle have be so fond it be a long time before i find it but at last i be successful to my astonishment the stone be plainly a new one and the grave be tastefully decorate with flower as a matter of fact it be one of the prettiest in its neighborhood and to I this tell its own tale i go in search of the necessary official and put the case to he he inform I that i be correct in my supposition and that the stone have only lately be erect and what be more to the point he inform I that the gentleman who have give the order for it have only the week before pay the necessary sum for insure the decoration of the grave for many year to come i gather from you word that the gentleman who must be a relative of the decease have be here lately i say he be here last Sunday afternoon the man reply he be a most kindly and generous gentleman and must have be very fond of he sister the way he stand and look at that stone the last time he be here be touch to see he would be in foreign part sir and be likely to go out there again so i gather from what he say it be a pity there be not more like he this be news indeed and i prick up my ear on hear it have learn all i be likely to discover i thank the man for he kindness and leave the cemetery if i have do nothing else i have at least satisfied myself upon one point and this be the fact that gideon hayle have be in london within the week under such circumstance it should not be very difficult to obtain he address but i know from experience that when thing seem to be run most smoothly they be as much liable to a breakdown as at any other time -- sometimes even more so i accordingly hail a cab and drive back to my office once there i enter up my diary accord to custom write a note to kitwater inform he that i have discover that gideon hayle have not leave london on the previous Sunday and also that i believe he to have negotiate certain of the stone in london after which i return to my hotel to dine most people who know I would tell you that it might be consider consistent with my character that i still occupy the same apartment in the private hotel off the strand in which i have domicile myself when i first arrive in england if i be make comfortable i prefer to stick to my quarter and the hotel in question be a quiet one the cooking and the service be excellent and as every one do he or she best for I i see no sort of reason for move elsewhere it be something in such matter to know the people with whom one have to deal and in my case i could not have be better care for have i be a crown head i suppose i be a bit of a faddist in these thing except when business compel I to break through my rule i rise at the same hour every morning breakfast lunch and dine at the same time and as far as possible retire to rest punctually at the usual moment after dinner in those day thing have change since then somewhat i invariably smoke a cigar and when the evening be fine go for a stroll return between nine and ten and retire to rest unless i have anything to attend to punctually at eleven on this particular occasion the night be fine though rather close i light my cigar in the hall and step out into the street exactly as the clock be striking eight i have a lot to think of and feel just in the humor for a walk london at all hour be a fascinating study to I and however much i see of she i never tire of watch she mood after i leave my hotel i stroll along the embankment so far as the house of parliament pass the abbey make my way down victorium street and then by way of grosvenor place to hyde park corner opposite apsley house i pause to look about I i have my reason for so do for ever since i have leave the river-side i have entertain the notion that i be be follow when i have cross the road at the house of parliament two man apparently of the loafer class have cross too they have follow I up victorium street and now as i stand outside the duke of wellington 's residence i could see they move about on the other side of the way what they intention be i could not say but that they object be to spy upon my movement i be quite convinced in order to assure myself of this fact i resolve to lay a little trap for they pass down piccadilly at a sharp pace i turn into berkeley street some twenty yard or so ahead of they cross the road i sheltered myself in a doorway and wait i have not be there very long before i observe that they have turn the corner and be come along in hot pursuit that they do not notice I in my hiding-place be evident from the fact that they pass on the other side of the street and doubtless thinking that they have miss I commence to run i thereupon quit my friendly doorway return to piccadilly hail a cab and drive back to my hotel as i go i turn the matter over in my mind with the exception of the present case i have nothing important on hand so that i could think of no one who would be likely to set a watch upon I that i do not suspect hayle would only be natural under the circumstance as i do not know then that he have be the witness of kitwater and codd 's visit to my office that afternoon and i feel convinced in my own mind that he be unaware that they be in england it be most natural therefore that i should not in any way associate he with the plot the follow day be spend for the greater part in make further inquiry in hatton garden and among the various dutch merchant then in london the story the senior partner of messr jacob and bulenthall have tell I have prove to be correct and there could be no sort of doubt that hayle have realize a very large sum of money by the transaction what be more i discover that he have be see in london within the previous twenty-four hour this be a most important point and it encourage I to persevere in my search one thing however be remarkable one or two of the merchant to whom hayle have dispose of he stone have see more of he than messr jacob and bulenthall two have dine with he at a certain popular restaurant in regent street and have visit a theater with he afterwards in neither case however have they discover he name or where he live this secret he guard most religiously and the fact that he do so afford additional food for reflection if he imagine he old companion to be dead why should he be so anxious that he own identity and he place of residence should remain a secret if they be safely out of the way no one could possibly know of he connection with they and in that case he might if he please purchase a mansion in park lane and flourish he wealth before the eye of the world for any harm it might do he yet here he be exciting mistrust by he secrecy and lead a hole-and-corner sort of life when as i have say there be not the slightest necessity for it little by little i be begin to derive the impression that the first notion of mr hayle be a erroneous one and that there be more in he than i suppose this sentiment be destine to be strengthen and in the very near future by two remarkable discovery that evening i again go for a walk feeling fairly confident however that the man who have follow I before would do so again i take certain precaution before i set out one of my subordinate a man remarkable for he strength be order to be at the corner of my street at half-past eight he be to wait there until i emerge from my hotel himself remain as far as possible out of sight on this occasion i have plan my route deliberately i make my way in the first place along the strand as far as trafalgar square down cockspur street by way of the haymarket to regent street then on by langham place to that vast network of street that lie between oxford street and the euston road i have some time before this find out that i be be follow again the two man who have dodge my step on the previous night be do so again though the reason for they action be no more apparent however i have lay my plan most carefully and hope if all go well to be able to satisfy myself upon this point i have plenty of enemy i know as a man of my profession must of necessity have but i could not think of one who would pry upon my movement like this at last the time come for action turn into a side street i slacken my pace in order to give my pursuer time to come up apart from ourselves the street be quite desert and if they intend do I harm be quite dark enough to favor they plan i could see as well as hear they approach then when they be close upon I i slip my hand into my coat-pocket and turn and confront they my own man be softly come up from behind now my man i begin what be the meaning of this no you can keep you distance it be no use thinking of violence for i have get you before and behind take care that they do not get away wilson aye aye sir the man reply i 'll take good care of that let 's ` out he ' bill say the taller of the two man and as he do so take a step towards I -lrb- illustration : ` let 's out he bill ' say the taller of the two man -rrb- do you see this i inquire produce my revolver as i speak i be aware that it be not lawful to carry firearm in the street of london but when one have to deal with gentleman like you it become a necessity throw up you hand they do as they be order without demur then turn to the taller man i address he more particularly you seem to be the leader i say and for that reason i want to have a little talk with you you companion can take himself off as soon as he please if he do not let I assure he that he will get into trouble you intention to ` out I ' as you call it have fail as you can see and when i have do with you i do not think the attempt will be repeat now get off my man and thank you star that i have let you go so easily never be the table turn so quickly or so completely on a pair of rogue and the man i address seem to think too after a whisper conversation with he companion he walk away at he best pace and we see no more of he now i say turn to the fellow who be leave behind you will come along with I to my office and we 'll have a little talk together we prisoner would have resist but certain warning i be able to give he induce he to change he mind when we reach my office i open the door and conduct he to my sanctum while wilson follow close behind and light the gas he then pass into the outer office leave I alone with my prisoner on closer inspection he prove to be a burly ruffian and would doubtless have prove a ugly customer to tackle alone he in he turn look at I in some interest and then at the door as if he be half inclined to try the effect of a struggle first and

seem to belong to either of they i take from my pocket the watch which be to have play such a important part in the drama and consult it it be just half-past eleven therefore i have exactly half-an-hour to get to the _ rendezvous _ i call wilson and congratulate he on the success which have attend we effort of that evening it be a good thing you come out of it so well sir he say they be a nasty pair of chap and would have think as much of ` out ' you as they would of drink a pot of ale but thank goodness they do not succeed i reply as the say go ' a miss have never kill a man yet ' and now wilson you would better be off home to bed turn out the gas before you go good-night good-night sir he answer and then i put on my hat and leave the office i find when i step into the street that the character of the night have change thick cloud obscure the sky and a few drop of rain be fall at first i feel inclined to take a cab but on second thought i change my mind and put up my umbrella stride along in the direction of st martin 's church the theater be over by this time and the street be begin to grow empty i pass the gaiety where a middle-aged gentleman decidedly intoxicated be engage in a noisy altercation with a policeman who be threaten to take he to bow street if he do not go quietly home and at last approach the spot for which i be make i take up my position on the darker side of holywell street and wait so far i seem to have the thoroughfare to myself but i have still some three or four minute to wait at last midnight sound and as i hear it i conceal myself more carefully in my doorway and watch i be not to be keep long in suspense for the new day be scarcely three minute old when a hansom drive up to the other side of the church and a man alight he pay off the man and wish he good-night and then come along the roadway at the back of the church from where i stand i could see he figure distinctly but be not able to distinguish he face he be dress in a black cloak and wear a deer-stalker hat upon he head that he be the man i want i feel sure for what would any one else be do there at such a hour that he be surprise at not find he bravo await he be very certain for he look up the street down the street peer into holywell street where thank goodness he do not see I then along the strand in a westerly direction and afterwards come and take up he position within half-a-dozen pace of where i be hide presently he take a cigar-case from he pocket open it select a weed and strike a match to light it the flame illumine he face so that i could see it distinctly if i have not have myself well under control i believe i should have utter a exclamation of surprise that could not have fail to attract attention _ the man who have set those rascal on to try and get rid of I be none other than mr edward bayley the managing director of the santa cruz mining company of the argentine republic _ here be a surprise indeed what on earth do it all mean chapter v i must confess that the discovery i have make behind st martin 's church and which i describe at the end of the previous chapter have prove too much for I what possible reason could mr bayley have for want to rid himself of I only the morning before he have be anxious to secure my service in the interest of he company and now here he be hire a couple of ruffian to prevent I from do my work if not to take my life when i reach my hotel again and go to bed i lay awake half the night endeavor to arrive at a understanding of it but try how i would i could not hit upon a satisfactory solution upon one thing however i have quite make up my mind as soon as the city office be open i would call at that of the santa cruz mining company and put a few question to mr bayley which i fancy that individual would find difficult and rather unpleasant to answer this plan i carry out and at ten o'clock i stand in the handsome outer office of the company i should be glad to see the managing director if he could spare I a few moment i say to the youth who wait upon I in answer to he question he be engage sir at present the lad reply if you will take a seat however i do not fancy he will be very long i do as he direct and in the interval amuse myself by study a large map of the argentine republic which hang upon the wall i have practically exhaust its capability when the door open and a tall military-looking man emerge and pass out into the street what name shall i say sir inquire the clerk as he descend from he high stool and approach I fairfax i reply give he my card i think the manager will know my name the clerk disappear to return a few moment later with the request that i would follow he prepare myself for what i fully expect would be a scene i enter the director 's sanctum it be a handsome room and be evidently use as a boardroom as well as a office for there be a long table in the middle surround by at least a dozen chair at the furthest end a gentleman of venerable appearance be seat he rise as i enter and bow to I in what way can i be of service to you mr fairfax he inquire after i have seat myself i be afraid there have be a mistake i answer look about I for mr bayley i tell the clerk that i desire to see the managing director you _ be _ see he he return with a smile for i be he in that case i must have misunderstand the gentleman who call upon I two day ago i reply with some surprise do i understand you to say that a gentleman from this office call upon you yes a mr bayley a tall good-looking man of between thirty-eight and forty year of age the old gentleman stare as well he might but there be no mr bayley here he say we have no one of that name in we employ i fear the man whoever he be must have be play a trick upon you i sincerely trust he have do no damage might i ask what he call upon you about he call on I on behalf of you company i answer he inform I that for some time past you have ascertain the gravest suspicion concern the manager of you mine in the argentine he say that information have reach you ear to the effect that the man in question be in league with a notorious swindler in new york and though you could not bring any proved charge against he you be equally certain that he be rob you in order to fill he own pocket he appear to be most anxious to persuade I to go to the republic at once in order that i might inquire into matter and report to you i be to be away three month and be to be pay five thousand pound and my expense for my trouble my good sir this be really preposterous the old gentleman return i can positively assure you that there be not a word of truth in he assertion we manager in the argentine be a old and value friend and i would stake my life on he fidelity nothing would induce we to think even of send a detective out to spy upon he i be begin to believe that i should like to meet mr bayley again i remark he have a fine imagination and from what you tell I it seem that i should have look a fool have i go out to south america on such a errand it would have be exceedingly inconvenient not only for you but also for we say the manager i shall report this matter at the board meeting to-day we must endeavor to discover who this man be and also he reason for act as he have do should we hear anything further upon the subject we will at once communicate with you i should be glad if you will do so i reply i should like to get this matter clear up as soon as possible there may be something behind it that we do not understand i thank he for the interview and then take my departure more puzzle by it than i have be by anything for a long time when i reach my office i take the card from a drawer which mr edward bayley have send to I and despatch it by special messenger to the office of the famous mining company that afternoon another surprise be in store for I shortly after lunch and when i be in the middle of a letter to kitwater a message be receive through the telephone to the effect that the managing director of the santa cruz mining company whom i have see that morning be on he way to call upon I something have evidently come to light i reflect perhaps the mystery surround mr edward bayley be about to be clear up for i must confess i do not like the look of it a quarter of a hour later the manager be usher into my presence good afternoon mr fairfax he say i have come to ask you if you will permit I a few question and also to tell you that i think we have discover who it be that be masquerade as the occupant of my position you give I this morning a rough description of the individual who call upon you can you recall anything particular about he appearance any strange mark for instance anything by which we should be able to swear to he identity i would swear to he identity anywhere without a mark i reply but since you _ do _ mention it i remember that he have a small triangular scar upon he left cheek then it be the same man after all say the manager that be certainly extraordinary when we secretary speak to I about he after you have leave i have my doubt now however they be quite remove why he should have call upon you in such a guise be a question i can not for the life of I answer with any sort of satisfaction perhaps you will be a little more explicit i say you have not tell I yet how it be that you have be able to locate the gentleman in question this morning you must remember you have no sort of remembrance of he in that case you must forgive I he reply as a matter of fact i be so much carry away by my excitement that i could think of nothing else however i have promise you the story and you shall have it some year ago eight or ten perhaps we have a young man work for we in the argentine as a overseer he be in many respects a brilliant young fellow and would doubtless have do well for himself in time have he be able to go straight unfortunately however he do not do so he go from bad to worse at last he be catch in a flagrant piece of dishonesty and be immediately discharge when i tell you that that young man have a mark such as you describe upon he cheek you may be able to derive some idea of what follow might it not be a pure coincidence i reply not in this case i fancy he answer what make I the more inclined to believe that it be the same individual be the fact that we secretary meet he in leadenhall street only a few day ago he look older but have evidently prosper in the world as a matter of fact warner describe he as be irreproachably dress and turn out i trust he good fortune be honestly come by but i must own from what i know of he that i have my doubt but what possible reason could this individual have for call upon I and why should he have make I such a offer as i have describe to you the director shake he head the question be evidently beyond he i can assign no sort of reason for it he say unless he have some hope of be able to get you out of england for a time i do not see how that could benefit he i reply i be connect with no case in which he have any sort of interest you never can tell the old gentleman reply from what i know of he gideon hayle be always -- gideon what i cry spring to my foot do i understand you to say gideon hayle that be the name of the young man of whom i have be speak to you he reply but what make you so excited because i can understand everything now i declare good heaven what a idiot i have be not to have see the connection before now i know why gideon hayle try to lure I out of england with he magnificent offer now i see why he set these rough upon I it be all as plain as daylight i be afraid i do not quite understand say my companion in he turn but it be quite evident to I that you know more of hayle 's past life than i do i should think i do i reply by jove what a blackguard the man must be he rob he two partner of enormous wealth in china leave they in the hand of the chinese to be tortured and maim for life and now that he know that i be act for they in order to recover they treasure he endeavor to put I out of the way but you have not do it yet mr hayle i continue bring my fist down with a bang upon the table and what be more clever as you may be you be not likely to accomplish such a end you 'll discover that i can take very good care of myself but before very long you 'll find that _ you _ be be take care of by somebody else this be a strange affair indeed mr fairfax say the manager and it be evident that i have be of some assistance to you i need not say that i be very glad the more so because it be evident that we company be not involve in any system of fraud i will not disguise from you that i have my fear that it be the beginning of trouble for we all you may disabuse you mind of that once and for all i answer if there be any trouble brewing it be for we friend mr hayle that gentleman 's reckoning be indeed likely to be a heavy one i would not stand in he shoe for something there be a brief and somewhat uncomfortable pause and now allow I to wish you a very good-afternoon the old gentleman observe good-afternoon i reply and many thanks for the service you have render I it have help I more than i can say pray do not mention it my dear sir do not mention it reply the kindly old gentleman as he move towards the door i be very glad to have be useful to you when he have go i sit down at my desk to think i have have a good many surprise in my life but i do not know that i have ever be more astonished than i be that afternoon if only i have be aware of hayle 's identity when he have call upon I two morning before how simply everything might have be arrange as a matter of fact i have be talk with the very man i have be pay to find and what be worse have even terminate the interview myself when i realize everything i could have kick myself for my stupidity why should i have suspect he however the very boldness of he scheme carry conviction with it certainly mr gideon hayle be a foeman worthy of my steel and i begin to realize that with such a man to deal with the enterprise i have take in hand be likely to prove a bigger affair than i have bargain for have fail in both he attempt to get I out of the way he next move will be to leave england with as little delay as possible i say to myself if only i know in what part of london he be stay i would ransack it for he if i have to visit every house in order to do so as it be he have a thousand different way of escape and unless luck favor I i shall be unable to prevent he from take he departure at that moment there be a tap at the door and my clerk enter the room mr kitwater and mr codd to see you sir show they in i say and a moment later the blind man and he companion be usher into my presence codd must have divine from the expression upon my face that i be not pleased to see they you must forgive I for trouble you again so soon say kitwater as he drop into the chair i have place for he but you can understand that we be really anxious about the affair you letter tell we that you discover that hayle be in london a short time since and that he have realize upon some of the stone be it not possible for you to discover some trace of he whereabouts i have not be able to do that yet i answer it will be of interest to you however to know that he call upon I here in this room and occupy the chair you be now sit in three day ago kitwater clutch the arm of the chair in question and he face go as white as he beard in this room three day ago and sit in you presence he cry then you know where he be and can take we to he i regret that such a thing be out of my power i answer the man come into and leave this room without be hinder by I kitwater spring to he foot with a oath that strike I as come rather oddly from the lip of a missionary i see it all you be in league with he he cry he face suffuse with passion you be siding with he against we by god you be and i 'll have you punish for it you hoodwink we you sell we you have take we money and now you have go over and be act for the enemy i open the drawer of my table and take out the envelope he have give I when he have call for a reason of my own i have not bank the note it contain excuse I mr kitwater i say speaking as calmly as i could but there seem to be a little misunderstanding i have not sell you and i have not go over to the enemy there be the money you give I and i will not charge you anything for the little trouble i have be put to that should convince you of my integrity now perhaps you will leave my office and let I wash my hand of the whole affair i notice that little codd place he hand upon the other 's arm it travel down until they hand meet i see that the blind man be make a effort to recover he composure and i feel sure that he regret ever have lose it a moment later codd come across the room to my table and take up a piece of paper write upon it the follow word -- kitwater be sorry i be sure try to forgive he remember what he have suffer through hayle the simplicity of the message touch I pray sit down a minute mr kitwater i say and let I put myself right with you it be only natural that you should get angry if you think i have treat you as you say just now however that do not happen to be the case i can assure you that have i know who hayle be i should have take very good care that he do not leave this office until you have have a interview with he unfortunately however i be not aware of he identity i have encounter some bold criminal in my time but i do not know that i have ever have a more daring one than the man who treat you so badly i thereupon proceed to give he a rough outline of hayle 's interview with myself and he subsequent treatment of I both man listen with rapt attention that be hayle all over say kitwater when i have finish it be not he fault that you be not a dead man now he will evade we if he possibly can the story of the rough you have just tell we show that he be aware that you be on the trail and if i know he at all he will try the old dodge and put run water between you and himself as soon as possible as i say to you the other day he know the world as well as you know london and in spite of what people say there be still plenty of place leave in it where he can hide and we shall never find he with the money he steal from we he can make himself as comfortable as he please wherever he may happen to be to sum it all up if he get a week 's start of we we shall never set eye on he again if that be so we must endeavor to make sure that he do not get that start i reply i will have the principal port watch and in the meantime will endeavor to find out where he have stow himself away in london you may rest assure of one thing gentleman i take this matter up in the first place as a ordinary business speculation i be now go on for that reason and another mr hayle try a trick on I that i have never have attempt before and for the future he be my enemy as well as yours i hope i have set myself right with you now you do not still believe that i be act in collusion with he i do not kitwater answer vehemently and i most humbly apologize for have say what i do it would have serve I right if you have throw the case up there and then and i regard it as a proof of you good feeling towards we that you consent to continue you work upon it to-day be Friday be it not then perhaps by Sunday you may have something more definite to tell we it be just possible i may i return in that case i be instruct by my niece to ask if you will give we the pleasure of you company at bishopstowe on that day after the toil of london a day in the country will do you no harm and needless to say we shall be most pleased to see you i remember the girl 's pretty face and the trim neat figure i be not a lady 's man far from it nevertheless i think that i should like to renew my acquaintance with she i shall be very pleased to accept miss kitwater 's invitation provide i have something of importance to communicate i say should i not be able to come you will of course understand that my presence be require in london or elsewhere my movement must of necessity be regulate by those of mr hayle and while i be attend to he i be not my own master kitwater ask I one or two more question about the disposal of the gem to the merchant in hatton garden groan as i describe the enthusiasm of the dealer swear under he breath when he hear of hayle 's cunning in refuse to allow either he name or address to be know and then rise and bid I good-bye during dinner that evening i have plenty to think about the various event of the day have be so absorb and have follow so thick and fast upon each other that i have little time to seriously digest they as i eat my meal and drink my modest pint of claret i give they my fullest consideration as kitwater have observe there be no time to waste if we desire to lay we hand upon that slippery mr hayle give the full machinery of the law and its boundless resource to stop he it be by no mean a easy thing for a criminal to fly the country unobserved but with I the case be different i have only my own and the exertion of a few and trust servant to rely upon and it be therefore impossible for we to watch all the various backdoor lead out of england at once when i have finish my dinner i stroll down the strand as far as charing cross station turner be to leave for st petersburg that night by the mail-train and i have some instruction to give he before he departure i find he in the act of attend to the labeling of he luggage and when he have see it safely on the van we stroll down the platform together i warn he of the delicate nature of the operation he be about to undertake and bid he use the greatest possible care that the man he be to watch do not become aware of he intention directly he know for certain that this man be about to leave russium he be to communicate with I by cypher and with my representative in berlin and then follow he with all speed to that city himself as i have good reason to know he be a shrewd and intelligent fellow and one who never forget any instruction that might be give he know that he be a great votary of the goddess nicotine i give he a few cigar to smoke on the way to dover write to I immediately you have see you man i say remember I to herr schneider and if you should see -- i come to a sudden stop for there among the crowd not three carriage-length away from I a travelling-rug throw over he shoulder and carry a small brown leather bag in he hand stand gideon hayle unfortunately he have already see I and almost before i realize what he be do he be make he way through the crowd in the direction of the main entrance without another word to turner i set off in pursuit know that he be go to make he bolt and that if i miss he now it would probably be my last chance of come to grip with he never before have the platform seem so crowd a exasperating lady with a lanky youth at she side hinder my passage porter with truck pile with luggage bar the way just when i be get along nicely while as i be about to make my way out into the courtyard and idiotic frenchman seize I by the arm and implore I to show he ze office of ze money-changaire i reply angrily that i do not know and run out into the portico only to be in time to see gideon hayle take a seat in a hansom he have evidently give he driver he instruction for the man whip up he horse and go out of the yard at a speed which at any other hour would certainly have get he into trouble with the police i call up another cab and jump into it promise the man a sovereign as i do so if he would keep the other cab in sight and find out for I its destination right ye be sir the cabman reply you jest leave that to I i will not let he go out of my sight then we in we turn leave the yard of the station and set off eastward along the strand in pursuit both cabman be sharp fellow and evidently familiar with every twist and turn of they famous london in my time i have have a good many curious drive in one part of the world and another but i think that chase will always rank first we travel along the strand about a hundred yard behind the other vehicle then turn up southampton street through covent garden by way of henrietta street into long acre after that i can not pretend to have any idea of the direction we take i know that we pass through drury lane cross high holborn to presently find ourselves somewhere at the back of gray 's inn the building of the parcel ' post depot mark another stage in we journey but still the other cab do not show any sign of come to a standstill leaving mount pleasant behind we we enter that dingy labyrinth of street lie on the other side of the clerkenwell house of detention how much longer be the chase go to last then to my delight the other cab slacken its pace and eventually pull up before a small public-house we be so close behind it that we narrowly escape a collision i spring out and run to the other vehicle in order to stop hayle before he could alight wot 's up guvner ask the cabman do not go a worritting of yourself there be nobody inside he be quite right _ the cab be empty _ chapter vi i flatter myself that i be a man who be not easily disconcerted but for the second time that day i be completely take aback i have watch that cab so closely have follow its progress so carefully that it seem impossible hayle could have escape from it yet there be the fact apparent to all the world that he have get away i look from the cab to the cabman and then at my own driver who have descend from he perch and be stand beside I well i would not have believe it i say aloud when i have recover somewhat my astonishment my own driver who have doubtless begin to think that the sovereign i have promise he be in danger be incline to be somewhat bellicose it appear as if he be anxious to make a personal matter of it and in proof of this he sternly demand of he rival what he have do with he fare you do not think i have eat he do yer ask that worthy what be it get to do with I what a fare do i set ` im down same as i should do you and now i be on my way ` ome look arter you own fare and take he ` ome and put he ter bed but do not yer a ` come abotherin ' I i have do the best day 's work i have ever ` ad in my life and if so be the pair of yer like to come into the pub here well i do not know as i will not a stand yer both a two of scotch cold it look as if ` twould kind a ' cheer the guvner up a bit seem ' as how he be di ` point like come on now it be one of my best principle and to it i feel that i owe a considerable portion of my success that i never allow my pride to stand in the way of my business the most valuable information be not unfrequently pick up in the most unlikely place and for this reason i follow my own jehu and he rival into the public-house in question the man be visibly elate by the good stroke of business he have do that night and be incline to be convivial ' e be a proper sort of bloke he say as we partake of we refreshment ' e give I a fiver ' e do a ' i wish as ` ow i could meet another like ` im every day they do say as how one man 's mutton be another man 's poison retort my driver who in spite of the entertainment he be receive visibly regard the other with disfavor if you would a give we the tip i would ` ave ` ad my suvering as it be i do not take it friendly like that you should a ' bilk we yer can take it as yer darned well please say the other as he speak place he glass upside down on the counter in order to prove beyond contradiction that it be empty i immediately order a repetition which be supply thereupon the cabman continue -- when i ` as a bit of business ter do yer must understand that i do it and that no man can say as i do not a gent get into my keb and sez he ` drive I until i tell yer to stop and go as fast as yer can ' sez he ` take every back street yer know of and come out somewhere hoxton way i be not partic ` lar so long as i go fast a ' i do not git collar by the keb that be after we if yer help I to give ` im the slip there be a five-poun ' note for yer trouble ' well sez i to myself this be a proper bit of busness and there and then i set off as fast as the old ` orse cud take we we turn up southampton street and you turn up after we as we be agoin ' down ` enrietta street i ask he to let I ` ave a look at he five-poun ' note for i do not want no bank of fashion or any of that sort of truck shove into I you 'll understand ` you need not be suspicious cabby ' sez he ` i 'll make it suvering if you like and half a one over for luck if that will satisfy yer ` when i tell he it would he give I two poun ' ten in advance and away we go again we be not more than ` arf a mile away from here -- thank ye sir i do not mind if i do it be cold drivin ' -- well as i be a sayin ' we be not more than ` arf a mile away from here when the gent he stand up and sez to I ` look here kebby turn the next corner pretty sharp and slow down at the first bye-street you come to then i 'll jump out ' ` right yer be guvner ' sez i and with that he ` and I up the other two poun ' ten and the extry half-suvering i fob it and whip up the old ` oss next moment we be around the corner and a-drivin ' as if we be a try to ketch a train then we come to a little side street a ' i slow down out ' e jump and down he go along a side street as if the devil be arter he then i drive on my way and pull up ` ere bilked you be guvner and i do not mind sayin ' so but busness be busness and five poun ' ten be not to be pick up every day i guess the old woman will be all there when i get ` ome to-night that be all very well cabby i say but it be just likely you want to add another sovereign to that five-pound ten if you do i do not mind put another in you way i tell you that i want to catch the man i be after to-night he be as big a thief as ever walk the earth and if you will help I to put my hand upon he you 'll be do a service not only to I but to the whole country at large what be it you want I to do he ask suspiciously he treat I fair and he 'll take it mean of I if i help you to nab he i do not want you to do anything but to drive I to the side street where you put he down then you can take you sovereign and be off home as quick as you like do you agree he hesitate for a space in which a man could have count twenty and then set he glass upon the counter i 'll do it he say i 'll drive yer there not for the suvering but for the good of the country yer speak about come on i give my own man he money and then follow the other out to he cab he mount to he box not without some help and we presently set off whether it be the effect of the refreshment he have imbibe or whether it be mere elation of spirit i can not say the fact however remain that for the whole of the journey which occupy ten or twelve minute he howl vociferously a more joyous cabman could scarcely have be discover in all that part of london at last he pull he horse to a standstill and descend from he seat this ` ere be the place he say and that be the street he bolt down yer can not mistake it now let 's have a look at yer suver guvner and then i 'll be off home to bed and it be about time too i pay he the sum i have promise he and then make my way down the narrow street in the direction hayle have take it be not more than a couple of hundred yard long and be hem in on either hand by squalid cottage as if to emphasize the misery of the locality and perhaps in a measure to account for it at the further end i discover a gin-palace whose flare light illuminate the street on either hand with brazen splendor a small knot of loafer be cluster on the pavement outside the public and these be exactly the man i want address myself to they i inquire how long they have be in they present position best part of a hour guv ` ner say one of they push he hand deep down into he pocket and execute a sort of double shuffle as he speak be not doin ' any harm ` ere i ` ope we be ` opin ' as ` ow a gent like yourself would come along in the course of the evening just to ask we if we be thirsty and wot we would take for to squench it you shall have something to squench it if you can answer the question i be go to ask you i reply do either of you see a gentleman come down this street run about half-an-hour or so ago be he carry a rug and a bag ask one of the man without hesitation he be i reply he be the man i want which way do he go when he leave here he take jim boulter 's cab say another man who have until a few moment before be lean against the wall the short ` un be alookin ' after it for ` im and i hear he call jimmy myself he toss the short ` un a bob he do when he get in such luck do not seem ever to come my way where be the short ` un as you call he i inquire think that it might be to my advantage to interview that gentleman a-drinkin ' of he bob in there the man answer where d'ye think ye would be a-seein ' ` im bearin ' ` isself proud like a real torf and at closen ' time they 'll be chuckin ' ` im out into the gutter and then ` be wife 'll come down and they 'll fight a ' most like both of 'em 'll get jug before they know where they be and come before the beak in the mornin ' look here i say if one of you will go in and induce the gentleman of whom you speak to come out here and talk to I i would not mind treat the four of you to half-a-crown the word have scarcely leave my lip before a deputation have enter the house in search of the gentleman in question when they return with he one glance be sufficient to show I that the short ` un be in a decidedly inebriated condition he friend however deem it possible that they chance of appreciate my liberality depend upon he condition be such as he could answer question with some sort of intelligence proceed to shake and pummel he into something approach sobriety in one of he lucid interval i inquire whether he feel equal to tell I in what direction the gentleman who have give he the shilling have order the cabman to drive he he turn the question over and over in he mind and then arrive at the conclusion that it be some hotel close to waterloo this be certainly vague but it encourage I to persevere think again i say he must have give you some definite address now i do remember say the man it seem to I it be foxwell 's hotel waterloo road that be where it be foxwell 's hotel do not you know it foxwell 's hotel be a merry merry place when the jolly booze be flowin ' flowin ' free now chorus gen ` man have hear all i want to i give the poor wretch what i have promise they and go in search of a cab as good luck would have it i be able to discover one in the city road and in it i drive off in the direction of waterloo if hayle be really go to stay the night at foxwell 's hotel then my labor have not be in vain after all but i have see too much of that gentleman 's character of late to put any trust in he statement until i have verify they to my own satisfaction i be not acquaint with foxwell 's hotel but after some little search i discover it it be by no mean the sort of place a man of hayle 's wealth would be likely to patronize but remember that he have particular reason for not be _ en evidence _ just at present i could understand he reason for choose such a hostelry i accordingly pay off my cabman and enter the bar take the young lady i find there a little on one side i inquire whether a gentleman have arrive within the last half-hour carry a bag and a heavy travelling-rug much to my gratification she reply that such a gentleman have certainly arrive within the past half-hour and be now at supper in the coffee-room she inquire whether i would care to see he i reply in the negative state that i would call next day and make myself know to he we be old friend i say and for that reason i should be glad if you would promise I that you will say nothing to he about my come to-night woman-like the idea please she and she willingly give the promise i ask if you want to see he you would better be here early she say he tell I when he book he room that he should be want to get away at about ten o'clock to-morrow morning i 'll be here well before that i reply if all go right i shall call upon he between eight and nine o'clock feel sure that after what i have say to she she would say nothing to hayle about my visit i return to my own hotel and retire to rest next morning i be up betime have breakfast and be at foxwell 's hotel before eight o'clock have strike i proceed straight to the bar where i discover my acquaintance of the previous evening in curl papers assiduously dust shelf and counter there be a fragrance of the last night 's potation still hover about the place which have the dreary tawdry appearance that be so different to the glamour of the previous night i bade the girl good-morning and then inquire whether she have see anything of my friend at first she do not appear to recognize I but on do so she volunteer to go off and make inquiry she do so to return a few moment later with the information that the gentleman have ring for he boot and would be down to breakfast in a few minute i wonder what you will have to say for yourself when you see I mr hayle i muttered you will find that i be not to be so easily shake off as you imagine i accordingly make my way to the dining-room and seat myself at a table order a cup of coffee and a egg the london egg be not a favorite of mine but i be prepare to eat a dozen of they if necessary if by so do i could remain in the room long enough to find myself face to face with gideon hayle several people put in a appearance and commence they morning repast but when a quarter of a hour have elapse and the man i want have not present himself my patience become exhaust and i go in search of my _ hourie _ of the bar my friend 's a long time come down i say i hope he have not go out to breakfast you must be mistaken she answer i see he come down-stair nearly a quarter of a hour ago he go into the dining-room and i feel sure you must have see he if you will follow I i 'll show he to you so say she lead the way along the dingy passage until she arrive at a green baize door with two glass panel here she stop and scan the dining-room the boot who have just come upstairs from the lower region assist in the operation and seem to derive considerable satisfaction from it there he be say the girl point to a table in the furthest corner of the room the tall man with the black moustache i look and be consume with disappointment the individual i see there be no more like hayle than he be like the man in the moon do you mean to tell I that he be the man who arrive late last night in a cab and whose luggage consist of a small brown bag and a travel rug i ask you have be have a game with I young woman and i should advise you to be careful you do not realize who i be hoighty toity she say with a toss of she head that send she curl-papers dance if you be go to be nasty i be go you ask for the gentleman who come late last night with a bag and there he be if he be not the person you want you must not blame I i be sure i be not responsible for everybody 's friend dear I i hope not the shock-headed boot have all this time be listen with the greatest interest he and the barmaid it appear have have a quarrel earlier in the morning and in consequence be still far from be upon the best of term the cove as the gent want miss must be ` im as come close upon eleven o'clock last night he put in the toff with the bag and blanket why i carry he bag up to number forty-seven with my own ` and and you know it the girl be quite equal to the occasion you would better hold you tongue she say if you do not you 'll get into trouble what for he inquire it be a free country i ` ope nice sort of toff ' e be forget all about the boot and I a-doin ' ` be brown as slap-up as if ' e be a-goin ' out to dinner with the queen but p ` reap he be leave a ` arf-sovereign for I with you it be not likely oh no of course it be not likely he would you would not keep it carefully for I would you oh no in course not what about that two bob the american gent give you the girl do not wait to hear any more but with a final toss of she head disappear into the bar now look here my friend i say to the boot it be quite evident that you know more about this gentleman than that young lady do tell I all about he and i 'll make it worth you while there be not much to tell he answer leastway nothin ' particular he be no end of a toff great-coat with silk collar neat brown glove and a bowler ` at moustache yes and wax get a sort of broad-arrow on he cheek and look at ye as if ` be eye be gimlet and he want to bear a

` im in with he bag and blanket and say ` kindly remember the boot sir ' and he say ` i have do it ' i say i ` ad not ` ad it and he tell I to go to ------ well the place as be not mention in perlite company that be all i know about ` im he pause and shake he head in the direction of the bar after which he observe that he know all about it and one or two other thing beside i give he a shilling for he information and then leave the house once more i have miss gideon hayle by a few minute but i have receive some information that might help I to find he again unfortunately however he be now well on he way to southampton and in a few hour might be out of england my respect for that astute gentleman be increase hourly but it do not deter I only make I the more resolve to beat he in the end make my way to waterloo i inquire when the next train leave for southampton finding that i have more than a hour and a half to wait i telegraph to the man i have send to southampton to watch the dock and then take the electric railway to the city and make my way to my office where a pile of correspondence await I on my table call my managing clerk to my assistance i set to work to examine it he open the letter while i peruse they and dictate the various reply when he come to the fifth he utter a exclamation of surprise what be it i inquire anything wrong in reply he hand I a letter write on good note-paper but without a address it run as follow -- mr gideon hayle return thanks for kind inquiry and beg to inform mr fairfax that he be leave england to-day for algier if he think he be go to bluff I with that sort of tale he be very much mistaken i say i happen to be aware of the fact that he leave for southampton by the nine o'clock train this morning if i might hazard a guess as to where he be go i should say that he destination be the cape but let he go where he will i 'll have he yet in the meantime send william to chare cross at once robert to victorium and dickson to st paul 's furnish each with a description of the man they be to look after be particular about the scar upon he left cheek and if they see he tell they that they be not to lose sight of he happen what may let they telegraph should they discover anything definite and then go in pursuit in any case i shall return from southampton to-night and shall call here at once half-an-hour later i arrive at waterloo take my ticket and board the train for southampton when i reach the port i be meet at the station by my representative who inform I that he have see nothing of the man i have describe although he have carefully look for he we 'll try the various shipping-office first i say i feel positively certain that he come down here by the nine o'clock train we drive from shipping-office to shipping-office and make the most careful inquiry but in every case without success once we think we have discover we man only to find after waste a precious hour that the clerk 's description be altogether a wrong one and that he resemble hayle in no sort of way we board the south african mail-boat but he be not among she passenger we overhaul the american liner with a equally barren result we pay cursory visit to the principal hotel but could hear no tiding of he in any one of they as a matter of fact if the man have journey to southampton as i have every reason to suppose he have do he must have disappear into thin air when he get there the whole affair be most bewildering and i scarcely know what to think of it that the boot at the hotel have not be hoodwink I i feel assure in my own mind he anger against the man be too real to allow any doubt upon that point at last have exhaust all we resource and not see what i could do further i return to my subordinate 's lodgings where it have be arrange that telegram should be address to I on my arrival there a yellow envelope be hand to I i tear it open eagerly and withdraw the contents it prove to be from dickson and have be send off from dover i take my codebook from my pocket and translate the message upon the back of the telegraph-form it run as follow -- man with triangular scar upon left cheek brown bag and travel rug board train at herne hill go through to dover and have book to paris be follow he accord to instruction then he slip I after all i cry he must have go on to waterloo cross to cannon street then on to london bridge the cunning scoundrel he must have make up he mind that the biggest bluff he could play upon I be to tell the truth and by jove he be not very far wrong however those laugh best who laugh last and though he have have a very fair inning so far we will see whether he can beat I in the end i 'll get back to town now run down to bishopstowe to-morrow morning to report progress and then be off to pari after he on Monday at 845 that night i reach london at the same moment mr gideon hayle be sit down to a charming little dinner at the café des prince and be smile to himself as he think of the success that have attend the trick he have play upon I chapter vii when i reach the charming little surrey village of bishopstowe i could see that it bear out kitwater 's description of it a prettier little place could scarcely have be discover with its tree-shaded high-road its cluster of thatched cottage its blacksmith 's shop rustic inn with the signboard on a high post before the door and last but not least the quaint little church stand some hundred yard back from the main road and approach from the lych-gate by a avenue of lime here i say to myself be a place where a man might live to be a hundred undisturbed by the rush and bustle of the great world that be my feeling then but since i have come to know it better and have be permit a opportunity of see for myself something of the inner life of the hamlet i have discover that it be only the life of a great city on a small scale there be the same keen competition in trade with the same jealousy and bickering however on this peaceful Sunday morning it strike I as be delightful there be a old-world quiet about it that be vastly soothing the rook caw lazily in the elm before the church as if they know it be Sunday morning and a day of rest a dog lay extend in the middle of the road bask in the sunshine a thing which he would not have dare to do on a weekday even the little stream that run under the old stone bridge which mark the center of the village and then wind its tortuous course round the churchyard through the squire 's park and then down the valley on its way to the sea seem to flow somewhat more slowly than be its wont feeling just in the humor for a little moralizing i open the lych-gate and enter the churchyard the congregation be sing the last hymn the old hundredth if i remember rightly and the sound of they unite voice fitted perfectly into the whole scheme give it the one touch that be lack as i strolled along i glance at the inscription on the various tomb-stone and endeavor to derive from they some notion of the life and character of those whose memory they perpetuate sacred to the memory of erasmus gun twenty-seven year schoolmaster of this parish bear 24th of march 1806 and rest from he labor on September the 19th 1876 seat myself on the low wall that surround the churchyard i look down upon the river and while so do reflect upon erasmus gun what have he be like this knight of the ferrule who for twenty-seven year act as pedagogue to this tiny hamlet what good have he do in he world have he realize he life 's ambition into many of the congregation now worship yonder he must have drive the three r 's possibly with the assistance of the faithful ferrule aforesaid yet how many of they give a think to he memory in this case the assertion that he rest from he labor be a trifle ambiguous consign poor erasmus to oblivion i continue my walk presently my eye catch a inscription that make I halt again it be dedicate to the loving memory of william kitwater and susan he wife i be still look at it when i hear a step on the gravel-path behind I and turn round i find myself stand face to face with miss kitwater to use the conventional phrase church have come out and the congregation be even now make its way down the broad avenue towards the high-road how do you do mr fairfax say miss kitwater give I she hand as she speak it be kind indeed of you to come down i hope you have good news for we -lrb- illustration : ` how do you do mr fairfax ' say miss kitwater -rrb- i be incline to consider it good news myself i say i hope you will think so too she do not question I further about it then but ask I to excuse she for a moment step over the little plot of ground where she dear one lay and pluck some of the dead leaf from the flower that grow upon it to my think she be just what a honest english girl should be straight-forward and gentle look the whole world in the face with frank and honorable simplicity when she have finish she labor of love which only occupy she a few moment she suggest that we should stroll on to she house my uncle will be wonder what have become of I she say and he will also be most anxious to see you he do not accompany you to church then no she answer he be so conscious of he affliction that he can not bear it to be remark he usually stay at home and walk up and down a path in the garden brooding i be afraid over he treatment by mr hayle it go to my heart to see he and mr codd he poor little man spend most of he time read such work on archæology as he can obtain it be he one great study and i be thankful he have such a hobby to distract he mind from he own trouble they come to england must have make a great change in you life i remark it _ have _ make a difference she answer but one should not lead one 's life exactly to please one 's self they be in sore distress and i be thankful that they come to I and that i have the power to help they this set I think she speak gravely and i know that she mean what she say but underlie it there be a suggestion that for some reason or another she have not be altogether favourably impress by she visitor whether i be right in my supposition i could not tell then but i know that i should in all probability be permit a better opportunity of judge later on we cross the little bridge and pass along the high road for upward of a mile until we find ourselves stand at the entrance to one of the prettiest little country residence it have even be my lot to find a drive some thirty yard or so in length lead up to the house and be shaded by overhang tree the house itself be of two story and be cover by creeper the garden be scrupulously neat and i fancy that i could detect its mistress 's hand in it shady walk lead from it in various direction and at the end of one of these i could discern a tall restless figure pacing up and down there be my uncle say the girl refer to the figure i have just describe that be he sole occupation he like it because it be the only part of the garden in which he can move about without a guide how empty and hard he life must seem to he now mr fairfax it must indeed i reply to my think blindness be one of the worst ill that can happen to a man it must be particularly hard to one who have lead such a vigorous life as you uncle have do i could almost have declare that she shudder at my word do she know more about she uncle and he past life than she like to think about i remember one or two expression he have let fall in he excitement when he have be talk to I and how i have comment upon they as be strange word to come from the lip of a missionary i have often wonder whether the story he have tell I about they life in china and hayle 's connection with it have be a true one the tenaciousness with which a chinaman cling to the religion of he forefather be proverbial and i could not remember have ever hear that a mandarin or a official of high rank have be convert to the christian faith even if he have it strike I as be highly improbable that he would have be the possessor of such princely treasure and even suppose that to be true that he would at he death leave it to such a man as kitwater no i fancied if we could only get at the truth of the story we should find that it be a good deal more picturesque not to use a harsher term than we imagine for a moment i have almost be tempt to believe that the stone be hayle 's property and that these two man be conduct they crusade with the intention of rob he of they yet on maturer reflection this do not fit in there be the fact that they have certainly be mutilate as they describe and also they hatred of hayle to be weigh in one balance while hayle 's manifest fear of they could be set in the other if i be not mistake that be you step mr fairfax say the blind man stop suddenly in he walk and turn he sightless face in my direction it be wonderful how the loss of one 's sight sharpen one 's ear i suppose you meet margaret on the road i meet miss kitwater in the churchyard i reply a very good meeting-place he chuckle sardonically it be where most of we meet each other sooner or later upon my word i think the dead be luckier than the living in any case they be more fortunate than poor devil like codd and myself but i be keep you stand will not you sit down somewhere and tell I you news i have be almost count the minute for you arrival i know you would not be here to-day unless you have something important to communicate to I you have find hayle he ask the question with feverish eagerness as if he hope within a few hour to be clutch at the other 's throat i could see that he niece notice it too and that she recoil a little from he in consequence i thereupon set to work and tell they of all that have happen since i have last see they describe my lucky meeting with hayle at chare cross my chase after he across london the trick he have play I at foxwell 's hotel and my consequent fruitless journey to southampton and he manage to escape you after all say kitwater that man would outwit the master of all liar himself he be out of england by this time and we shall lose he he have not escape I i reply quietly i know where he be and i have get a man on he track then where be he ask kitwater if you know where he be you ought to be with he yourself instead of down here you be pay to conduct the case how do you know that you man may not bungle it and that we may not lose he again he tone be so rude and he manner so aggressive that he niece be about to protest i make a sign to she however not to do so i do not think you need be afraid mr kitwater i say more soothingly than i feel my man be a very clever and reliable fellow and you may be sure that have once set eye on mr hayle he will not lose sight of he again i shall leave for paris to-morrow morning and shall immediately let you know the result of my search will that suit you it will suit I when i get hold of hayle he reply until then i shall know no peace surely you must understand that then imagine perhaps that he have go too far he begin to fawn upon I and what be worse praise my method of elucidate a mystery i can not say which i dislike the more indeed have it not be that i have promise miss kitwater to take up the case and that i do not want to disappoint she i believe i should have abandon it there and then out of sheer disgust a little later we hostess propose that we should adjourn to the house as it be neatly lunch-time we do so and i be show to a pretty bedroom to wash my hand it be a charming apartment redolent of the country smell of lavender and after london as fresh as a glimpse of a new life i look about I take in the cleanliness of everything and contrast it with my own dingy apartment at rickford 's hotel where the view from the window be not of meadow and breezy upland but of red roof chimney-pot and constantly revolving cowl i could picture the view from this window in the early morning with the dew upon the grass and the blackbird whistle in the shrubbery i be not a vain man i think but at this juncture i stand before the looking-glass and survey myself for the first time in my life i could have wish that i have be better-look at last i turn angrily away what a duffer i be to be sure i say to myself if i begin to get notion like this in my head there be no know where i may end as if any girl would ever think twice about I thereupon i descend to the drawing-room which i find empty it be a true woman 's room daintily furnish with little knick-knack here and there a work-basket put neatly away for the sabbath and a open piano with one of chopin 's work upon the music-rest lead out of the drawing-room be a small conservatory fill with plant it be a pretty little place and i could not refrain from explore it i be passionately fond of flower but my life at that time be not one that permit I much leisure to indulge in my liking as i stand now however in the charming place among the row of neatly-arranged pot i experience a sort of wake dream i seem to see myself stand in this very conservatory hard at work upon my flower a pipe in my mouth and my favorite old feel hat upon my head crime and criminal be alike forget i no longer live in a dingy part of the town and what be better than all i have -- do you know i feel almost incline to offer you the proverbial penny say miss kitwater 's voice behind I at the drawing-room door be it permissible to ask what you be think about i be not of course prepare to swear it but i honestly believe for the first time for many year i blushed i be think how very pleasant a country life must be i say make the first excuse that come to I i almost wish that i could lead one then why do not you surely it would not be so very difficult i be rather afraid it would i answer and yet i do not know why it should be perhaps mr fairfax would not care about it she continue as we return to the drawing-room together good gracious i remark there be no mr fairfax i be the most confirm of old bachelor i wonder you could not see that be not the word _ crustiness _ write plainly upon my forehead i be afraid i can not see it she answer i be not quite certain who it be but i fancy it be my uncle who inform I that you be marry it be very kind of he i say but it certainly be not the case i fear my wife would have rather a lonely time of it if it be i be oblige to be away from home so much you see and for so long at a time yours must be indeed a strange profession mr fairfax if i may say so she continue some time ago i come across a account in a magazine of you life and the many famous case in which you have take part ah i remember the wretched thing i say i be sorry that you should ever have see it and why should you be sorry because it be a silly thing and i have always regret allow the man to publish it he certainly call upon I and ask I a lot of question after which he go away and write that article ever since then i have feel like a conceited ass who try to make himself out more clever than he really be i do not think you would do that she say but if you will let I say so yours must be a very try life and also a extremely dangerous one i be afraid you must look upon human nature from a very strange point of view not more strange probably than you do i answer but you be continually see the saddest side of it to you all the misery that a life of crime entail be visible the greater part of you time be spend among desperate man who be without hope and to whom even they own shadow be a constant menace i wonder that you still manage to retain you kind heart but how do you know that my heart be kind i inquire if for no other reason simply because you have take up my uncle 's case she answer do you think when he be so rude to you just now that i could not see that you pity he and for that reason you forbear to take advantage of you power i know you have a kind heart and you find it difficult to assimilate that kind heart with the remorseless detective of public life i find it difficult to recognize in you the man who on a certain notable occasion go into a thief ' den in chicago unaccompanied and after a terrible struggle in which you nearly lose you life succeed in effect the arrest of a notorious murderer at that moment the gong in the hall sound for lunch and i be by no means sorry for the interruption we find kitwater and codd await we come in the dining-room and we thereupon sit down to the meal when we leave the room again we sit in the garden and smoke and later in the afternoon my hostess conduct I over she estate show I she vinery introduce I to she two sleek jersey who have they home in the meadow i have see from the window to she poultry pig and the pigeon who come flutter about she confident that they would come to no harm meanwhile she uncle have resume he restless pacing up and down the path on which i have first see he codd have return to he archaeological study and i be alone with miss kitwater we be stand alone together i remember at the gate that separate the garden from the meadowland i know as well as possible indeed i have know it since we have meet in the churchyard that morning that she have something to say to I something concern which she have not quite make up she mind what it be however i fancied i could hazard a very good guess but i be determine not to forestall she but to wait and let she broach it to I in she own way this i fancy she be now about to do mr fairfax she begin rest she clasped hand upon the bar of the gate as she speak i want if you will allow I to have a serious talk with you i could not have a better opportunity than the present and such as it be i want to make the best of it i be quite at you service miss kitwater i reply and if i can be of any use to you i hope you will tell I pray let I know what i can do for you it be about my uncle and mr codd that i want to speak to you she say sink she voice a little as if she be afraid they might hear and what about they i want to be loyal to they and yet i want to know what you think of the whole affair she say look intently at I as she speak believe I i have good and sufficient reason for my request i be to tell exactly what i think about they pursuit of this man hayle and what chance of success i think they possess i say i be not think so much of they success she return as of the real nature of they case i believe i understand what be pass in you mind i say indeed i should not be surprise if the suspicion you entertain be not the same as i have myself you have be suspicious then i could scarcely fail to be i reply perhaps you will tell I what you suspect will you forgive I in my turn if i be abrupt or if i speak my mind a little too plainly you could not do that she answer with a sigh i want to know you exact thought and then i shall be able to form my own conclusion well i say before i begin may i put one or two question to you you will of course remember that i have never see or hear of you uncle and mr codd until they stop I on ludgate hill they be and practically be stranger to I i have hear they story of they treasure but i have not hear what any one else have to say upon the subject i think i understand now what be you question in the first place do you late father ever speak to you of he brother as be a missionary in china she shake she head and from the look upon she face i could see that i have touch upon something painful this at least be one of the thing that have strike she as suspicious if he be a missionary i be quite sure my father do not know it she say in fact i always understand that he be somewhat of a scapegrace and in consequence could never settle down to anything that be you first now what be you second question mr fairfax i pause for a moment before i reply my second partake more of the nature of a assertion than a question i answer as i read it you be more afraid of what may happen should the two man meet than anything else yes that be just what i _ be _ afraid of she reply my uncle 's temper be so violent and he desire for revenge so absorb that i dare not think what would happen if he come into actual contact with hayle now that i have reply to you question will you give I the answer i want that be to say will you tell I what you think of the whole affair if you wish it i will i say slowly you have promise to permit I to be candid and i be go to take advantage of that permission in my own mind i do not believe the story they tell i do not believe that they be ever missionary though we have convincing proof that they have be in the hand of the chinese that hayle betray they i have not the least doubt it seem consistent with he character but where they obtain the jewel that be practically the keystone to the whole affair i have no more notion than you they may have be honestly come by or they may not so far as the present case be concern that fact be immaterial there be still however one vital point we have to consider if the gem in question belong equally to the three man each be entitle to he proper share either of the stone or of the amount realize by the sale that share as you already know would amount to a considerable sum of money you uncle i take it have not a penny-piece in the world and he companion be in the same destitute condition now we will suppose that i find hayle for they and they meet do it not seem to you quite possible that you uncle 's rage might lead he to do something desperate in order to revenge himself upon the other but if he could command himself he would probably get he money if on the other hand they do not meet then what be to be do forgive I miss kitwater for prying into you private affair but in my opinion it be manifestly unfair that you should have to support these two man for the rest of they existence you surely must see that i would rather do that than let my father 's brother commit a crime she return more earnestly than she have yet speak the position be decidedly a awkward one it be some proof of the girl 's sterling quality that she should be prepare to make such a sacrifice for the sake of a man whom it be certainly impossible to love and for that reason even to respect i look at she with a admiration in my face that i do not attempt to conceal i say nothing by way of praise however it would have be a insult to she to have even hint at such a thing pardon I i say at last but there be one thing that must be take into consideration some day miss kitwater you may marry and in that case you husband might not care about the arrangement you have make such thing have happen before now she blush a rosy red and hesitate before she reply i do not consider it very likely that i shall ever marry she answer and even if i do i should certainly not marry a man who would object to my do what i consider to be my duty and now that we have discuss all this mr fairfax what do you think we have better do i understand you to say to my uncle that you intend leave for paris to-morrow morning in order to continue you search for the man hayle suppose you find he what will you do then in such a case i say slowly look at she all the time i should endeavor to get you uncle 's and codd 's share of the treasure from he if i be successful then i shall let he go where he please and suppose you be unsuccessful in obtain the money or the gem then i must endeavor to think of some other way i reply but somehow i do not think i shall be unsuccessful nor do i she answer look I full and fair in the face i fancy you know that i believe in you most implicitly mr fairfax in that case do you mind shake hand upon it i say i will do so with much pleasure she answer you can not imagine what a weight you have lift off my mind i have be so depressed about it lately that i have scarcely know what to do i have lie awake at night turn it over and over in my mind and try to convince myself as to what be best to be do then my uncle tell I you be come down here and i resolve to put the case before you as i have do and to ask you opinion she give I she little hand and i take it and hold it in my own then i release it and we stride back along the garden-path together without another word the afternoon be well advance by this time and when we reach the summer-house where codd be still read we find that a little wicker tea-table have be bring out from the house and that chair have be place for we round it to my think there be nothing that become a pretty woman more than the mere commonplace act of pour out tea it be certainly so in this case when i look at the white cloth upon the table the heavy brass tray and the silver jug and teapot and thought of my own crack earthenware vessel then repose in a cupboard in my office and in which i brew my cup of tea every afternoon i smile to myself i feel that i should never use it again without recall this meal after that i wonder whether it would ever be my good fortune to sit in this garden again and to sip my orange pekoe from the same dainty service the thought that i might not do so be strangely enough a unpleasant one and i put it from I with all promptness during the meal kitwater scarcely utter a word we have exhaust the probability of the case long since and i soon find that he could think or talk of nothing else at six o'clock i prepare to make my adieu my train leave bishopstowe for london at the half-hour and i should just have time to walk the distance comfortably to my delight my hostess decide to go to church and say she would walk with I as far as the lych-gate she accordingly leave we and go into the house to make she toilet as soon as she have go kitwater fumble he way across to where i be sit and have discover a chair beside I seat himself in it mr fairfax say he i labor under the fear that you can not understand my position can you realize what it be like to feel shut up in the dark waiting and longing always for only one thing could you not let I come to pari with you to-morrow impossible i say it be out of the question it could not be think of for a moment but why not i can see no difficulty in it if for no other reason because it would destroy any chance of my even get on the scent i should be hamper at every turn he heave a heavy sigh blind blind he say with despair in he voice but i know that i shall meet he some day and when i do -- he ferocity be the more terrible by reason of he affliction only wait mr kitwater i reply wait and if i can help you you shall have you treasure back again will you then be satisfied yes i 'll be satisfied he answer but with what strike I as almost reluctance yes when i have my treasure back again i 'll be satisfied and so will codd in the meantime i 'll wait here in the dark the dark in which the day and night be the same yes i 'll wait and wait and wait at that moment miss kitwater make she reappearance in the garden and i rise to bid my client farewell good-bye mr kitwater i say i 'll write immediately i reach paris and let you know how i be get on you be very kind kitwater answer and codd nod he head my hostess and i then set off down the drive to the righ road which we follow towards the village it be a perfect evening and the sun be set in the west in a mass of crimson and gold at first we talk of various commonplace subject but it be not very long before we come back as i know we should do to the one absorb topic there be another thing i want to set right with you miss kitwater i say as we pause upon the bridge to which i have elsewhere refer it be only a small matter somehow however i feel that i must settle it before i can proceed further in the affair with any satisfaction to myself she look at I in surprise what be it she ask i think we have settle everything so far as i can see that be the only matter that remain i answer yet it be sufficiently important to warrant my speak to you about it what i want to know be who i be serve i do not think i understand she say drawing line with she umbrella upon the stone coping of the bridge as she speak and yet my meaning be clear i return what i want to be certain of be whether i be serve you or you uncle i do not think you be _ serve _ either of we she answer you be help we to right a great wrong forgive I but that be merely trifling with word i be go to be candid once more you be pay the money i believe in some confusion she inform I that this certainly be the case very well then i be certainly you servant i say it be you interest i shall have to study i can trust they implicitly to you i be sure mr fairfax she reply and now here we be at the church if you walk quickly you will be just in time to catch you train let I thank you again for come down to-day it have be a great pleasure to I i reply perhaps when i return from paris you will permit I to come down again to report progress we shall be very pleased to see you she answer now good-bye and a pleasant journey to you we shake hand and part as i pass along the road i watch she make she way along the avenue towards the church there be need for I to shake my head george fairfax say i it would require very little of that young lady 's society to enable you to make a fool of yourself chapter viii unlike so many of my countryman i be prepare to state that i detest the french capital i always make my visit to it as brief as possible then my business complete off i fly again seem to breathe more freely when i be outside its boundary i do not know why this should be so for i have always be treat with the utmost courtesy and consideration by its inhabitant particularly by those member of the french detective force with whom i have be bring in contact on this visit i cross with one of the cleverest parisian detective a man with whom i have have many dealings he be most anxious to ascertain the reason of my visit to he country my assurance that i be not in search of any one of he own criminal seem to afford he no sort of satisfaction he probably regard it as a attempt to put he off the scent and i fancy he resent it we reach pari at seven o'clock whereupon i invite he to dine with I at eight o'clock at a restaurant we have both patronize on many previous occasion he accept my invitation and promise to meet I at the time and place i name on the platform await we arrival be my man dickson to whom i have telegraph order he to meet I well dickson i say when i have bid the detective _ a revoir _ what about we man i have have he under my eye sir he answer i know exactly what he be be do and where he be stay that be good news indeed i reply have you discover anything else about he yes sir he return i find that he be strike up a sudden acquaintance with a lady name mademoiselle beaumarai and that they be to dine together at the café des ambassadeurs to-night they have be in and out of half the jeweller ' shop in the rue de la paix to-day and he be spend a mint of money on she they be dine at the café des ambassadeurs to-night do you say at what time i can not tell you that sir dickson reply i only know that they be to dine there together to-night and pray how do you find that out i make inquiry as to who she be where she live and then pump she maid he answer you do not do anything that would excite he suspicion i hope i put in you ought to know by this time what woman be oh no sir you need not be afraid he say i be too careful for that the maid and i be on very friendly term she believe I to be a russian and i have not deny it it would be safest not to do so i reply if she discover that you be a englishman she might chance to mention the fact to she mistress she would doubtless let it fall in conversation with he and then all we trouble would be useless you speak russian do you not only pretty well sir he answer i should be soon bowl out if i come in contact with a real one well i think i will be somewhere near the café des ambassadeurs to-night just to make sure of my man after that i 'll tell you what to do next very good sir he return i suppose you will be stay at the same place yes the same place i reply if you have anything to communicate you can either call or send word to I there i thereupon depart for the quiet house at which i usually take up my abode when in paris the big hotel be place i steer clear of for the simple reason that i often have business in connection with they and it do not pay I to become too well know at this little house i can go out and come in just as i please have my meal at any time of the day or night and be as well care for as at my own abode in london on this occasion the old lady of the house greet I with flattering enthusiasm she have receive my telegram she say and my usual room await I i accordingly ascend to it in order to dress myself for the dinner of the evening and as i do so think of the pretty bedroom i have see on the previous day which naturally lead I to think of the owner of the house at that moment my employer in my mind 's eye i could see she just as she have stand on that old stone bridge at bishopstowe with the sunset behind she and the church bell sound across the meadow call the villager to evensong how much better it be i argue to be stand talk to she there in that old world peace than to be dress for a dinner at a up-to-date french restaurant my toilet complete i descend to the street hire a _ fiacre _ and drive to the restaurant where i have arrange to meet my friend the place in question be neither a expensive nor a fashionable one it have no hall of mirror no dainty little cabinet but to my think you can obtain the best dinner in all paris there on reach it i find my guest have be the first to arrive we accordingly ascend the stair to the room above where we select we table and sit down my companion be a witty little man with half the language of europe on he tongue and a knowledge of all the trick and dodge of all the criminal fraternity at he finger-end he have since write a book on he experience and a stranger volume or one more replete with a knowledge of the darker side of human nature it would be difficult to find he have commence he professional career as a doctor and like myself have gradually drift into the detective profession among other thing he be a inimitable hand at disguise himself as many a wretched criminal now know to he cost even i who know he so well have be take in by he i have give alms to a blind beggar in the street have encounter he as a _ chiffonier _ prowl about the gutter have sit next to he on a omnibus when he have be clothe as a artisan in a blue blouse and on not one of those occasion have i ever recognize he until he make himself know to I among other thing he be a decide epicure and love a good dinner as well as any of he compatriot could you but see he with he napkin tuck under he chin he little twinkling eye sparkling with mirth and he face wreathe in smile you would declare he to be one of the jolliest-looking individual you have ever encounter see he however when he be on business and have a knotty problem to solve and you will find a different man the mouth have become one of iron the eye be as fierce as fierce can be some one i remember liken he to the great napoleon and the description be a exceedingly apt one by the way i say as we take a peep into we second bottle of perrier-jouet there be a question i want to put to you do you happen to be acquaint with a certain mademoiselle beaumarai i have know she for more year than she or i would care to remember he answer for a woman who have lead the life she have she wear uncommonly well a beautiful creature the very finest shoulder in all pari and that be say something he blow a kiss off the tip of he finger and raise he glass in she honor i drink to she in this noble wine but i do not let she touch my money oh no _ la belle louise _ be a clever woman a very clever woman but money trickle through she finger like water through a sieve let I think for a moment she ruin the marquis d'esmai the vicomte cotforét monsieur d'armier and many other whose name i can not now recall the first be with we noble troops in cochin china the second be in algerium and the third i know not where and now i have learn since my arrival in pari that she have get hold of a young englishman who be vastly wealthy she will have all he have get very soon and then he will begin the world anew you be interested in that englishman of course how do you know that because you question I about mademoiselle beaumarai he answer a good many people have ask I about she at different time but it be always the man they want to get hold of you my astute fairfax be interested in the man not because you want to save he from she but because he have do a little something which he should not have do elsewhere the money he be lavish on mademoiselle louise whence do it come should i be very wrong if i suggest gem i give a start of surprise how on earth do he guess this yes i see i be right he answer with a little laugh well i know it a long time ago ah you be astonish you should surely never allow yourself to be surprise by anything now i will tell you how i come to know about the gem some time ago a certain well-known lady of this city lose she jewel-case in a mysterious manner the affair be place in my hand and when i have exhaust pari i go to amsterdam _ en route _ if necessary for london you know we old friend levenstein and schartzer i nodded i have have dealings with that firm on many occasion well as i go into they office i see the gentleman who have be pay he attention to the lady we have be discuss come out i have a excellent memory for face and when i see he to-night enter the café des ambassadeurs i recognize he immediately thus the mystery be explain he shrug he shoulder and spread he hand apart like a conjurer who have just vanish a rabbit or a orange have the man of whom we be speak do very wrong he inquire the stone he sell in london and amsterdam belong to himself and he two partner i answer he have not give they they share of the transaction that be all they have better be quick about it then or they be not likely to get anything it would be a very big sum that would tempt _ la belle louise _ to be faithful for a long period if you employer really desire to punish he and they be not in want of money i should say do not let they interfere she will then _ nibble-nibble _ at what he have get like a mouse into a store of good thing then presently that store will be all go and then she will give he up and he the man will go out and shoot himself and she will pick up somebody else and will begin to nibble-nibble just as before as i say there will be somebody else and somebody else right up to the end of the chapter and with every one she will grow just a imperceptible bit older by and by the wrinkle will appear i fancy there be just one or two already then she will not be so fastidious about she hundred of thousand franc and will condescend to think of mere thousand after that it will come to simple hundred then there will be a interval -- after which a garret a charcoal brazier and the morgue i have know so many and it be always the same first the diamond the champagne the exquisite little dinner at the best restaurant and at last the brazier the closed door and window and the cold stone slab there be a moral in it my dear friend but we will not look for it to-night when do you intend to commence business with you man at once i answer he know that i be after he and my only fear be that he will make a bolt i can not understand why he be dally in paris so long for the simple reason that he be confident he have put you off the scent be my companion 's reply he be do the one foolish thing the criminal always do sooner or later that be to say he be become over-confident of he own power to elude we you and i my friend should be able to remember several such instance now strange to say i come across a curious one the other day would you care to hear it he light a cigarette and blow a cloud of smoke while he wait for my answer very much i say be well aware that he story be always worth hear this be a somewhat remarkable case he say i will mention no name but doubtless you can read between the line there be a man who murder he wife in order that he might marry another woman the thought which he give to it and the clever manner in which he lay he plan not only for the murder but also for the disposal of the body mark he as a criminal in the possession of a singularly brilliant intellect he give no hint to anybody but leave the country without leave the faintest clue concern he destination behind he i be call in to take over the case but after some consideration could make nothing of it i have no objection to admit that i be completely baffle now it so happen that i discover that the man 's mother be of irish extraction he believe that he would be safe on that island engage a passage on board a steamer from havre to belfast she be to pick up at southampton plymouth and bristol _ en route _ my man who by the way be a very presentable person and could be distinctly sociable when he please endeavor to make himself agreeable to the passenger on board on the first evening out of port the conversation turn upon the value of diamond and one of the lady on board produce some costly stone she happen to have in she possession the murderer who you must understand be quite safe be unhappily eat up with vanity he could not forego the boast that he be the possessor of a magnificent ring which have be give he by the ex-emperor napoleon iii needless to say this information excited considerable interest and he be ask to produce it for the general edification he declare that it be too late to do so that evening but say that he would do so on the morrow or at any rate before he leave the vessel in the excitement of reach southampton the matter be for the moment forget but on the day that they arrive in plymouth one of the lady passenger remind he of he promise this be follow by another application thus surround the unhappy man find himself in the unpleasant position of be discover in the perpetration of a untruth or of be compel to invent some feasible tale in order to account for he not be able to produce the ring it be at this juncture that he make he great mistake anxious doubtless to attract attention he return from he cabin with the astounding declaration that the lock have be force and the famous ring steal from he trunk in which it have lie conceal he certainly act he part well but he do not realize to what consequence it would lead the matter be report to the police and a search be make through the vessel the passenger be naturally indignant at such treatment and for the rest of the voyage the man find himself take what you english ` call the cold shoulder ' he reach belfast make he way into the country and presently settle down later on when the pursuit have die down it be he intention to ship for america where he be to be join by the woman to obtain whom he have in the first place commit the crime now observe the result photograph of the miss man and the murder woman be circulate all through france while not a few be send to england one of these picture reach plymouth where it be show to the officer who have investigate the case on the boat on its way to ireland he immediately recognize the man who have make the charge against he fellow-passenger after that it be easy to trace he to belfast and he hiding-place on land extradition be of course grant and he leave the place have he not imagine that in he safety he could indulge he vanity i confidently believe i should never have find he when you come to think of it it be hard to come to the guillotine for a diamond that never exist be it not i agree with he and then suggest that we should amuse ourselves by endeavor to find out how the dinner at the café des ambassadeurs be progress they will proceed to a theater afterwards you may be sure my companion say in that case if you like we could catch a glimpse of they as they come out what do you say i answer that i have not the least objection one night do not make much difference to-morrow morning i shall make a point of meeting he face to face should you require my assistance then i shall be most pleased to give it to you my companion reply i thank he for he offer and then we leave the restaurant together hail a cab and drive to he flat it consist of four room situate at the top of a lofty block of building near the river from he window he could look out over pari and he be wont to declare that the view he receive in exchange be the most beautiful in the world fine as it be i be scarcely so enthusiastic in my praise among other thing they be remarkable for the simplicity of they furniture and also for the fact that in the sitting-room there be nothing to reveal the occupation of they owner he clever old servant susanne of whom 'twa say she would do she but choose make as clever a detective as she master -lrb- she have serve he for more than forty year -rrb- bring we coffee so quickly that it would almost seem as if she have be aware that we should reach the house at that particular moment we have plenty of time to spare say my host in the meantime it will be necessary for we to find out what they be do if you will wait i will despatch a messenger who will procure we the information he write something on a half-sheet of note-paper ring the bell and hand it to susanne give that to leon he say and tell he to be off with it at once the woman disappear and when she have go we resume we conversation have he not have the good fortune to be such a great success in he own profession what a admirable actor the man would have make he power of facial contortion be extraordinary and i believe that on demand he could have imitate almost any face that strike he fancy and now with regard to we little excursion he say what would you like to be as you be aware i can offer you a varied selection will you be a workman a pedlar a elderly gentleman from the province or a street beggar i think the elderly gentleman from the province would suit I best i answer while it will not necessitate a change of dress very good then so it shall be he reply we 'll be a couple of elderly gentleman in pari for the first time let I conduct you to my dressing-room where you will find all that be necessary for you make-up he thereupon show I to a room lead out of that in which we have hitherto be sit it be very small and light by means of a skylight indeed it be that very skylight so he always declare that induce he to take the flat if this room look out over the back or front it would have be necessary for I either to have curtain which i abominate or to run the risk of be observe which would have be far worse he have remark to I once needless to say there be time when i find it most necessary that my preparation should not be suspect take altogether it be a room that have a strange fascination for I i have be in it many time before but be always able to discover something new in it it be a conglomeration of cupboard and shelf a large variety of costume hang upon the peg in the wall range from soldier 's uniform to beggar 's rag there be wig of all sort and description on block pad of every possible order and for every part of the body hump for hunchback wooden leg boot range from the patent leather of the dandy to the toeless foot-covering of the beggar there be hat in abundance from the spotless silk to the most miserable head covering some of which look as if they have be pick up from the rubbish-heap there be pedlar ' tray fit with all and every sort of ware a faro-table a placard setting forth the fact that the renowned professor somebody or other be a most remarkable phrenologist and worthy of a visit in fact there be no say what there be not there everything that be calculate to be useful to he in he profession be to be find in the room for my own part i be not fond of disguise indeed on only two or three occasion during the whole course of my professional career have i find it necessary to conceal my identity but to this wily little frenchman disguise be as often as not a common occurrence half-an-hour later two respectable elderly gentleman look more like professor from some eminent _ lycée _ than detective leave the house and proceed in the direction of the folly theater the performance be almost at a end when we reach it and we mingle with the crowd who have assemble to watch the audience come out the inquiry we have make prove to be correct and it be not very long before i see the man i want emerge accompany by a female who could be no other than mademoiselle beaumarai hayle be in immaculate evening dress and as i could not but admit present a handsome figure to the world a neat little brougham draw up beside the pavement in its turn and into this they step then the door be close upon they and the carriage drive away that be my man i say to my companion as we watch it pass out of sight to-morrow morning i shall pay he a little visit i think you be quite right in what you say about the money that woman must have make a fairly big hole in it already you may be quite sure of that he answer when she have finish with he there will not be much left for anybody else and now to get these thing off and then home to bed to-morrow will in all probability prove a exciting day i accompany he to he room and remove the disguise which have enable I to see hayle without he be aware of my identity and then bidding my friend good-night return to my abode before i go to bed however i sit down and write a report of my doings for miss kitwater little as i have to tell the writing of this letter give I considerable pleasure i could imagine it come like a breath from another world to that quiet house at bishopstowe i picture the girl 's face as she read it and the strained attention of the two man who needless to say would hang on every word when i have finish it i go to bed to dream that gideon hayle and i be swim a race in the seine for five gigantic ruby which be to be present to the winner by miss kitwater next morning i arise early go for a stroll along the boulevard and return to breakfast at eight o'clock in the matter of my breakfast in paris i be essentially english i must begin the day with a good meal or i be fit for nothing on this particular occasion i sit down on the best of term with myself and the world in general i make a excellent meal do the best i could with the morning paper for my french be certainly not above reproach and then wonder when i should set out to interview the man whose flight from england have prove the reason of my visit pari then the door open and the _ concierge _ enter with the word a gentleman to see monsieur next moment to my overwhelming surprise no less a person than gideon hayle enter the room chapter ix at the moment that i see hayle enter my room you might as the say go have knock I down with a feather of all that could possibly have happen this be surely the most unexpected the man have endeavor to get I out of he way in london he have play all sort of trick upon I in order to put I off the scent he have bolt from england because he know i be search for he yet here he be deliberately seek I out and of he own free will put he head into the lion 's mouth it be as astounding as it be inexplicable good morning mr fairfax he say bow most politely to I as he speak i hope you will forgive this early call i only discover you address a hour ago and as i do not wish to run the risk of lose you i come on at once you appear to be fairly desirous of do so last week i say what have occur to make you change you mind so suddenly a variety of circumstance have conspire to bring such a result about he answer i have be think the matter over and not be able to determine the benefit of this hole-and-corner sort of game i have make up my mind to settle it once and for all i be glad you have come to that way of think i say it will save we both a infinity of trouble you understand of course that i represent messr kitwater and codd i be well aware of it he reply and in common fairness to yourself i can only say that i be sorry to hear it may i ask why you be sorry because you have the honor to represent the biggest pair of scoundrel unhung he answer and in say this i pledge you my word that i be by no means overstep the mark i have know they both for a great many year and can therefore speak from experience before go further with he i be desirous of convince myself upon one point you know they then when they be missionary in china i suppose that be the first time i have ever hear what they be he reply kitwater a missionary you must forgive my laughing but the idea be too ludicrous i 'll admit he be do a considerable amount of convert but it have be convert other people 's money into he own pocket he laugh at he own bad joke and almost instantly grow serious once more he be quite at he ease and though he must have know that i be familiar with the story or suppose story of he villainy seem in no way ashamed now mr fairfax he go on i know that you be surprise to see I this morning but i do not think you will be when we have have a little talk together first and foremost you have be tell the story of the stone i possess i have hear mr kitwater 's version of it i answer cautiously i know that you rob my client of they and then disappear i do not _ rob _ they of the stone he say not in the least offend by the bluntness of my speech it be plain that you do not know how we obtain they perhaps it be as well that you should not for there be more behind and you would go and get they no we obtain they honestly enough at a certain place and i be appoint to carry they for this reason i secure they in a belt about my waist that night the chinese come down upon we and make we prisoner they murder we two native servant blind kitwater and cut out codd 's tongue i alone manage to effect my escape leave my two companion for dead i manage to get away into the jungle good heaven man you can not imagine what i suffer after that i look at he and see that he face have grow pale at the mere recollection of he experience at last i reach the british outpost of nampoung on the burmah-chinese border where the officer take I in and play the part of the good samaritan when i be well enough to travel i make my way down to rangoon where still believe my late companion to be dead i ship for england as mr george bertram i say quietly why under a assumed name when accord to you story you have nothing to fear because i have good and sufficient reason for so do he reply you must remember that i have a quarter of a million 's worth of precious stone in my possession and well to put it bluntly up to that time i have be live what you might call a make-shift sort of life for the future i tell myself i be go to be a rich man that be so i want to start with a clean sheet you can scarcely blame I i do not answer he on this point but continue my cross-examination you reach london and sell some of the stone there later on you dispose of some more in amsterdam why do you refuse the dealer you name and address once more he be quite equal to the occasion because if i have tell they everybody would have get to know it and to be perfectly frank with you i could not feel quite certain that kitwater and codd be really dead by that i be to presume that you intend if possible to swindle they out of they share i ask not a little surprised by he admission once more to be quite frank with you i do i have no desire to be rude but i rather fancy you would have do the same have you be similarly situate i never be much of a success in the moral business i could well believe this but i do not tell he so when do you first become aware that they be in london on the day that they land he answer i watch every ship that come in from rangoon and at last have the doubtful satisfaction of see my two old friend pass out of the dock-gate poor beggar they have indeed have a hard time of it then you could pity they even while you be rob they why not he answer there be no reason because i have the stone that i should not feel sorry for the pain they have suffer i have to remember how near i would be to it myself this speech sound very pretty though somewhat illogical and pray how do you know that they have call in my assistance because i keep my eye on they i know mr kitwater of old you see i watch they go into you office and come out from a shop on the other side of the street the whole mystery be now explain what a amount of trouble i should have be spare have i only know this before you do not approve then of my be import into the case i distinctly disapprove he answer i know you reputation of course and i begin to see that if you take up they case for they i should in all probability have to climb down it be doubtless for that reason you call upon I represent yourself to be mr bayley manage director of that south american mining company i can now quite understand you motive you want to get I out of the way in order that i might not hunt you be that not so you hit the nail upon the head exactly but you be virtuous and would not swallow the bait it would have simplify matter from my point of view if you have i should not have be compel to waste my money upon those two rough nor would you have spend a exceedingly uncomfortable quarter of a hour in that doorway in holywell street this be news indeed so he have be aware of my presence there i put the question to he oh yes i know you be there he say with a laugh and i can tell you i do not like the situation one bit as a matter of fact i find that it require all my nerve to pretend that i do not know it every moment i expect you to come out and speak to I i can assure you the failure of my plot be no end of a disappointment to I i have expect to see the man i have send after you and instead i find you myself upon my word mr hayle if i can not appreciate you action i must say i admire you candor i can also add that in a fairly long experience of -- of -- why not say _ of criminal _ at once mr fairfax he ask with a smile i assure you i shall not be offend we have both we own view on this question and you of course be entitle to air yours if it please you you be about to observe that -- that in all my experience i have never meet any one who could so calmly own to a attempt to murder a fellow-being but suppose we now come to business with all my heart he answer i be as anxious as yourself to get everything settle you will admit that it be rather hard line on a man who can lay he hand upon a quarter of a million of money to have a gentleman like yourself upon he trail and instead of be able to enjoy himself to be compel to remain continually in hide i be a individual who like to make the most of he life i also enjoy the society of my fellow-man may we not substitute ` woman ' i ask i be afraid you quarter of a million would not last very long if you have much to do with mademoiselle beaumarai so you have hear of she have you he answer but you need have no fear dog do not eat dog and that charming lady will not despoil I of very much now to another matter what amount do you think you client would feel inclined to take in full settlement of they claim upon I i can not say i answer how many of the gem have you realize upon there be ninety-three originally he say when he have consult he pocket-book and i have sell sixty which leave a balance of thirty-three all of which be better than any i have yet dispose of will you client be prepare to accept fifty thousand pound of course give without prejudice you generosity amaze I i answer my client you partner be to take twenty-five thousand pound apiece while you get off scot-free after you treatment of they with two hundred thousand they may consider themselves lucky to get anything at all he retort run you eye over the case and see how it stand you must know as well as i do that they have not a leg to stand upon if i want to be nasty i should say let they prove that they have a right to the stone they can not call in the assistance of the law -- why not because to get even with I it would be necessary for they to make certain incriminate admission and to call certain evidence that would entail caustic remark from a learn judge and would not improbably lead to a charge of murder be prefer against they no mr fairfax i know my own business and what be better i know theirs if they like to take fifty thousand pound and will retire into obscurity upon it i will pay it to they always through you but i will not see either of they and i will not pay a halfpenny more than i have offer you do not mean to tell I that you be in earnest i be quite in earnest he answer i never be more so will you place my offer before they or will you not i will write and also wire they to-day i say but i think i know exactly what they will say point out the applicability of the moral concern the bird in the hand if they do not take what they can get now the time may come when there may be nothing at all i never be a very patient man and i can assure you most confidentially that i be about tired of this game but how be i to know that this be not another trick on you part and that you will not be clear out of pari within a few hour i should present a sorry picture if my client be to accept you generous offer and i have to inform they that you be not on hand to back it up oh you need not be afraid about that he say with a laugh i be not go to bilk you provide you play fair by I i will guarantee to do the same by you with the advantage i at present enjoy i be naturally most anxious to know that i can move about europe unmolested besides you can have I watch and so make sure of I there be that beautiful myrmidon of yours who be so assiduously make love to mademoiselle beaumarai 's maid give he the work i be more than surprise to find that he know about this business he see it and utter one of he peculiar laugh he do not think i know it he say but i do he cleverness be a little too marked he overact he part and even shakespeare will tell you how foolish a proceeding that be if you doubt my word concern my stay in paris let he continue to watch I you know where i be living and for that reason you can come and see I whenever you like as a proof of my sincerity may i suggest that you give I the pleasure of you company at dinner to-night oh you need not be afraid i be not a cæsar borgium i shall not poison you meat and you wine will not be drug it will be rather a unique experience detective and criminal dining together will it not what do you say the opportunity be so novel that i decide to embrace it why should i not do so since it be a very good excuse for keep my man in sight he could scarcely play I any trick at a fashionable restaurant and i be certainly curious to study another side of this man 's complex character i accordingly accept he invitation and promise to meet he at the well-known restaurant he name that evening in the meantime you will telegraph to you client i suppose he say you may be able to give I they reply this evening when we meet i shall hope to be in a position to do so i answer after which he bid I good-bye and pick up he hat and stick leave the room well i say to myself when i be alone once more this be the most extraordinary case upon which i have ever be engage my respect for mr hayle 's readiness of resource to say nothing of he impudence be increase by leap and bound the man be not to be meet every day who can rob he partner of upward of a hundred and seventy thousand pound and then invite the detective who be send after he to a friendly dinner i sit down and write a letter to miss kitwater tell she all that have occur then go out to despatch it with a telegram to kitwater himself inform he of the offer hayle have make i could guess the paroxysm of rage into which it would throw he and i would willingly have spare he niece the pain such a exhibition must cause she i could see no other way out of it however the message have be despatch i settle myself down to wait for a reply with all the patience i could command in my own mind i know very well what it would be it be not so much the money that kitwater want as revenge that hayle 's most miserable offer would only increase he desire for it i feel certain shortly after three o'clock the reply arrive it be short and to the point and run as follow -- tell he i will have all or nothing here be a nice position for a man to find himself in instead of solve the difficulty we have only increase it i wonder what hayle would say when he hear the news and what he next step would be that he would endeavor to bolt again i feel quite certain it be a point in my favor however that he would not know until the evening what kitwater 's decision be so i feel i have still some time to arrange my plan of action of one thing i be quite determine and that be that he should be watch day and night from that minute but not by mr dickson that worthy i bade return to england and he rage on discover that mademoiselle beaumarai 's maid have trick he would have be amusing to witness have the principal event in which i be most concerned not be so grave the expression he use about she be certainly far from be complimentary feeling that i must have other assistance i set off for my friend leglosse 's residence i have the good fortune to meet he by the _ concierge 's _ lodge and we ascend the stair to he room together i have come to ask you to do I a favor i say when we be seat in he sitting-room a thousand favor if you wish _ cher amus _ the old fellow reply tell I how i can have the pleasure of serve you i want you to lend I one of you man for a few day i say i have to send my own man back to england and i be afraid the gentleman we be discuss last night may give I the slip in the meantime if i be not careful the better to enable he to appreciate the position i furnish he with a brief summary of the case upon which i be engage and so you be to dine with you prisoner to-night he remark with one of he quiet chuckle that be droll -- very droll it be very good for you that it be at such a place or i should have my doubt as to the rascal 's intention but you be well able to take care of yourself my friend that i know and the man you shall have he you shall have half-a-dozen if you like i be only too pleased to be able to help in such a good work you shall have pierre lepallard my right-hand i can not give you a better nothing escape pierre and he be discreet oh yes my friend he be discreet he will not obtrude himself but he will know all that you friend do to whom he speak what he say to he and sometimes even what he intend do before he do it in that case he be just the man for I i reply i be exceedingly oblige to you for you considerate courtesy some day i may be able to repay it within half-an-hour the estimable lepallard have be make acquaint with he duty and within a hour a ragged tatterdemalion of a man be sell match on the opposite side of the road to that on which hayle 's apartment be situate i reach the restaurant at which we be to dine that evening punctual to the moment only to find that hayle have not yet arrive for a minute i be tempt to wonder whether he have give I the slip again but while the thought be pass through my mind a cab drive up and the gentleman himself alight i must beg you pardon for keep you wait he say apologetically as you host i should have be here first that would have be the case have i not be detain at the last moment by a old friend pray forgive I i consent to do so and we enter the restaurant together i discover that he have already engage a table arrange the _ menu _ and bespeak the wine we accordingly sit down and the strangest meal of which i have ever partake commence less than a week before the man sit in front of I have endeavor to bring about my destruction now he be my host and to all outward appearance my friend as well i find he a most agreeable companion a witty conversationalist and a bear _ raconteur _ he seem to have visit every part of the known globe have be a sailor a revolutionist in south america a blackbirder in the pacific have see something of what he call the pig-tail trade to borneo some very queer life in indium that be to say in the comparatively unknown native state and have come within a ace of have be shoot by the french during the war in madagascar in point of fact he say i may say that i have travel from dan to beersheba and until i strike this present vein of good fortune have find all barren some day if i can summon up sufficient courage i shall fit out a expedition and return to the place whence the stone come and get some more but not just at present event have be a little too exciting there of late to let we consider it a healthy country by the way have you hear from we friend kitwater yet i have i answer and he reply be by no means satisfactory i understand you to mean that he will not entertain my offer i nod my head he must have ` all or nothing ' he declare that be the wording of the telegram i receive well he know he own affair best the difference be a large one and will materially affect he income will you take crême de minthe -- kümmel or cognac cognac thank you i reply and that be the end of the matter during the remainder of the evening not another word be say upon the subject we chat upon a variety of topic but neither the matter of the precious stone nor even kitwater 's name be once mention i could not help fancy however that the man be considerably disappoint at the non-acceptance of he preposterous offer he have make a move on the board and have lose it i know he well enough however by this time to feel sure that he by no means despaired yet of win the game man of gideon hayle 's stamp be hard to beat now he say when we have smoke we cigarette and after he have consult he watch the night be still young what do you say if we pay a visit to a theater -- the hippodrome for instance we might wile away a hour there very pleasantly if you feel so disposed i willingly consent and we accordingly leave the restaurant once we be in the street hayle call a cab give the man he instruction and we enter it chat pleasantly and still smoking we pass along the brilliantly illuminate boulevard i bestow little if any attention on the direction in which we be proceed indeed it would have be difficult to have do so for never during the evening have hayle be so agreeable a more charming companion no man could have desire it be only on chance to look out of the window that that i discover that we be no longer in the gaily-lighted thoroughfare but be enter another and dingier part of the town what be the matter with the driver i ask do not he know what he be about this be not the way to the hippodrome he must have misunderstand what you say to he shall i hail he and point out he mistake no i do not think it be necessary for you to do that he reply doubtless he will be on the right track in a few minute he probably think if he give we a longer ride he will be able to charge a proportionately larger fare at the end the parisian cabby be very like he london brother he then proceed to describe to I a exceedingly funny adventure that have fall he once in chicago the recital last some minute and all the time we be still pursue we way in a direction exactly opposite to that which i know we should be follow at last i could stand it no longer the man 's obviously a idiot i say and i be go to tell he so i should not do that mr fairfax say hayle in a different voice to that in which he have previously address I i have my own reason for not tell you before but the matter have already be arrange the man be only carry out he instruction what do you mean by already arrange i ask not without some alarm i mean that you be my prisoner mr fairfax he say you see you be rather a difficult person to deal with if i must pay you such a compliment and one have to adopt heroic measure in order to cope with you then you have be humbug I all this time i cry but you have let the cat out of the bag a little too soon i think i 'll bid you good-bye i be about to rise from my seat and open the door but he stop I in he hand he hold a revolver the muzzle of which be in unpleasant proximity to my head -lrb- illustration : in he hand he hold a revolver -rrb- i must ask you to be good enough to sit down he say you have better do so for you can not help yourself if you attempt to make a fuss i pledge you my word i shall shoot you let the consequence to myself be what they may you know I and you can see that i be desperate my offer to those man be only a bluff i want to quiet any suspicion you might have in order that i might get you into my hand as you can see for yourself i could not have succeed better than i have do i give you my word that you shall not be hurt provide that you do not attempt to escape or to call for help if you do then you know exactly what you may expect and you will have only yourself to blame be a sensible man and give in to the inevitable he hold too many card for I i could see at a glance that i be out-manoeuvred and that there be nothing to be gain by a struggle i do not think i can be accuse of cowardice my reputation be too well know for that but i do decidedly object to be shoot by a desperate man when there be not the least necessity for it very well i say lie back in my seat you have play you game with you usual cleverness and i suppose i deserve what i have get for have be such a consummate idiot as to give you the opportunity you want now what be you go to do and where be you go to take I you will know everything in a few minute he answer in the meantime i be glad to see that you take thing so sensibly in after day you will laugh over this little incident whatever i may think in the future i reply just at present it be confoundedly unpleasant ten minute later the cab come to a standstill there be the sound of open gate and a moment later we drive into a stone-paved courtyard chapter x if you could have travel the world at that moment from north to south and from east to west i believe you would have find it difficult to discover a man who feel as foolish as i do when i enter the gloomy dwelling-place as hayle 's prisoner to say that i be mortify by the advantage he have obtain over I would not express my feeling in the least to think that i george fairfax who have the reputation of be so difficult a man to trick should have allow myself to fall into such a palpable trap seem sufficiently incredible as to be almost a matter for laughter rather than rage there be worse however behind miss kitwater have be so trustful of my capability for bring the matter to a successful conclusion that i dare not imagine what she would think of I now whichever way i look at it it be obvious that hayle must score on the one side he keep I lock up while he not only make he escape from pari but by so do cut off every chance of my pursue he afterwards on the other he might console himself with the almost certain knowledge that i should be discredit by those who have put they trust in I how could it very well be otherwise i have commit the criminal folly of accept hospitality from the enemy and from that moment i should not be see the natural supposition would be that i have be buy and that i be not only take no further interest in the case but that i be keep out of the way of those who do to add to my misery i could easily imagine the laugh that would go up on the other side of the channel when the trick that have be play upon I become known but have so much else to think of that fact you may be sure do not trouble I very much there be two thing however about which i be particularly anxious one be to set myself right with miss kitwater and the other be to get even at any cost with hayle the first seem the more difficult it must not be suppose that when i have alight from the carriage i have give up all hope of escape on the contrary have it not be for the presence of three burly fellow who immediately take up they place beside I i fancy i should have make a dash for liberty under the circumstance however to have attempt such a thing would have be the height of folly five to one that be to say if i include the coachman in the number with the gate close behind I be too long odds and however hard i might have fight i could not possibly have be successful perhaps you will be kind enough to step into the house say hayle the air be cold out here and i be afraid lest you might take a chill before comply with he order i look round I once more to see if there be any chance of escape but so far as i could see there be not one i accordingly follow one of my captor into the build the remainder bring up the rear from what i could see of the house with the help of the light from a solitary candle hanging in a sconce upon the wall it have once be a handsome building now however it have fall sadly to decay the ceiling of the hall have at one time be richly paint but now only blur trace of the design remain cross the hall my guide open a door at the further end in obedience to a request from hayle i enter this room to find myself stand in a fine apartment so far as size go but sadly lack in comfort where its furniture be concern there be a bed a table three rough chair and a entirely inadequate square of carpet upon the floor i have already say that it be a large room and when i add that it be light only by two candle which stand upon the table in the center some idea will be afford of its general dreariness now look here mr hayle i say the time have come for we to have a serious talk together you know as well as i do that in kidnapping I you be lay yourself open to very serious consequence if you think that by so do you be go to prevent I from eventually run you to earth you be very much mistaken you have obtain a temporary advantage over I i will admit but that advantage will not last do not flatter yourself that it will i be not so sure upon that point say hayle light a cigarette as he speak if i do not think so i should not have go to all this trouble and expense but why make such a fuss about it you must surely understand mr fairfax that you profession necessarily entail risk this be one of they you have be pay to become my enemy i have no personal quarrel with you you can scarcely blame I therefore if i retaliate when i have a opportunity i do not know what you may think of it but the mere fact of you dine with I to-night be very likely to go hard with you so far as you client be concern would it be a good advertisement for the famous george fairfax to have it know that while he be take he client ' money he be dine pleasantly in pari with the man they be pay he to find i lay my trap for you but i must confess that i have not very much faith in its success you experience should have make you more wary a student of human character such as you be should know that the leopard can not change he spot or the tiger he -- if you continue in this strain much longer i say i 'll endeavor to stop you tongue whatever it may cost I now either let I out or get out of the room yourself i want to see no more of you while i be in this house he blow a cloud of smoke and then say nonchalantly -- you have better occupy yourself thank you star that you be let off so easily at one time i be tempt to have you put out of the way altogether i be not quite certain it would not be safer even now it could be do so easily and no one would be any the wiser i know two man now in pari who would gladly run the risk for the sake of the ill-will they bear you i must think it over then think it over on the other side of that door i say angrily play the same traitorous trick on I as you do on kitwater and codd if you like but you shall not stay in the same room with I now my reference to kitwater and codd must have touch he on a raw spot for he wince and then try to bluff it off i rather fancy messr kitwater and codd will just have such kindly thing to say concern you in the future as they do about I now he say as he move towards the door and now i will wish you good-bye as i leave paris almost immediately i do not suppose i shall have the pleasure of see you again for you own sake i should advise you to be quiet i might tell you once and for all that you can not get out the door be a stout one and the window be exceptionally well bar the man to whom i have assign the duty of look after you be in they way honest though a little rough moreover they be aware that they own safety depend to a very great extent upon you not get out believe I if you do not know already that there be nothing like fear for make a good watch-dog farewell friend fairfax you have be instrumental in send a good many man into durance vile you can tell I later how you like be there yourself with that he go out shut the door behind he i hear the key turn in the lock and a bolt shot at top and bottom i thereupon go to the window and examine it only to discover that it be make secure on the outside by large iron bar so far as i could see there be no other way of escape from the room though i lay down on the bed i do not sleep my thought would not permit of that the face of the woman who have trust I so profoundly be before I continually gaze at I with sweet reproachful eye oh what a fool i have be to accept that rascal 's invitation the more i thought of it the angrier i become with myself now goodness only know how long i should be confine in this wretched place and what would happen during my absence from the world at last the dawn break and with it a weird sickly light penetrate the room i spring from my bed and approach the window only to find that it overlook a small courtyard the latter be stoneflagg and surround by high wall i could see that even if i be able to squeeze my way out between the bar i should be powerless to scale the wall at a rough guess these be at least twelve foot high and without a foothold of any sort or description this be so i be completely at the mercy of the man in the house indeed a rat catch in a trap be never more firmly lay by the heel than i at about half-past seven o'clock a small trap-door which i have not notice near the ground and the main door be open and a grimy hand make its way in and place upon the floor a cup of coffee and a roll then it be close once more and make secure i drink the coffee and munch the roll and if the truth must be confess poor as they be feel the better for both at mid-day a bowl of miserable soup be hand in darkness however have fall some considerable time before i could detect any sound in the hall outside that might be take to mean the come of my evening meal at last there be a clatter of foot the bolt shoot back the key turn in the lock and the door open a man carry a lantern enter follow by two other and as the light fall upon he face i utter a cry of astonishment for he be none other than my old friend leglosse while behind he be the infallible lepallard well thank goodness we have find you at last cry leglosse we have have such a hunt for you as man never dream of i call at you apartment late last night hope to see you on important business but you have not return from a dinner to which you have be invite i call again this morning and be inform by the _ concierge _ that they have up to that moment see nothing of you when the good lepallard inform I that you have leave the restaurant in a cab with monsieur hayle and that the latter have return to he apartment this morning in a great hurry only to leave they a short time after with he luggage for the railway station i begin to grow uneasy you have no idea what a day i have have look for you but it have be well spend since we have the pleasure of see you again i shall be grateful to you all my life for the service you have render I i reply but how do you manage to gain admittance to this house it be quite easy the bird have fly he answer have the suspicion not strike you that they be go to clear out and leave you here to starve the brute i answer but i 'll be even with they leader yet and now let we get away from here as quickly as possible have you any idea where we man have go to naple lepallard reply i disguise myself as a pompous old bourgeois and i be behind he when he ask for he ticket and distinctly hear what he say then i shall go after he at once i reply he will in all probability be off he guard he will imagine I to be still lock up in this room you see and i shall accompany you if you will permit I say leglosse but why i ask in surprise what have you get to do with he you have no case against he and you can not spare the time to do it simply out of kindness to I it be not kindness it be business my friend he reply you may not believe it but i have a warrant for you man 's arrest on what charge on a charge of be concern in a big embezzlement in cochin china he answer we lay the other two man by the heel at the time but the englishman who be the prime mover in it we have never be able to lay we hand upon i feel certain that day when i meet he in amsterdam that i have see he somewhere before ever since then i have be puzzling my brain to discover where it be and why it be so familiar to I a photograph be eventually send we of the englishman by the colonial authority but in that photograph he the person i suspect wear a beard and a heavy moustache it be the same man however and the description even to the mark upon the face exactly tally with hayle now i think i can help you to obtain a rather unique revenge upon the man that be to say if you want it from what you have so far tell I i understand that you have no evidence against he strong enough to justify the issue of a warrant well i have that evidence and between we you may be sure we 'll bring he back to pari this be delightful hearing after all we have be through lately at any rate i greet the prospect of leglosse 's co-operation with acclamation it would be hard if between we we could not find hayle and bring he to the justice he so richly deserve now let we get out of this i say i must obtain something to eat if i perish in the attempt i be well nigh starve a basin of soup a roll and a cup of coffee be all that i have have to-day you shall dine at once he answer and here there be a excellent little restaurant further down the street and one of my man shall go there and tell they to bring you up a meal after that you shall go home and change you costume and then we will arrange what shall be do about the travel this program be carry out to the letter we make a good meal at least i know that i do and when it be eat a cab be procure and in company with leglosse i say good-bye to the house in which i have spend so short a time yet in which i have be so miserable i shall never know how to repay you for you kindness i say to my companion as we drive down the street have it not be for you and you man i should now be starve in that wretched place i 'll certainly forgive hayle if he be ever successful enough to take I in again by one of he rascally trick you must not let he do that return the frenchman shake he head we reputation be at stake when i reach my own apartment the _ concierge _ be much relieved to see I she have be tell that i be dead perhaps murder and leglosse 's visit to find I have not help to reassure she a packet of letter and telegram be hand to I which i carry up to my room to read they while i be change my attire never before have i be so glad to get out of a dress-suit i have just finish my toilet and be in the act of commence the packing of the bag i intend take with I when there be a tap at the door i open it to find the _ concierge _ there there be a lady in the parlor to see monsieur she say she have a maid with she a lady to see I i ask incredulously who on earth can she be the _ concierge _ shake she head in my own mind i have arrive at the conclusion that it be mademoiselle beaumarai and that hayle have send she to discover if possible whether i have escape from my confinement or not on find out that i have she would telegraph to he and once more he would be place on he guard at first i feel almost incline not to see she but on second thought i see the folly of this proceeding i accordingly enter the room where the lady be await I the light be not very good but it be sufficient for I to see two figure stand by the window to what be i indebted for the honor of this visit mademoiselle i begin do not you know I mr fairfax the taller of they answer you forget you friend very quickly miss kitwater i cry what do this mean it be a long story she answer but i feel sure that you will have time to hear it now i be in terrible trouble i be indeed sorry to hear that i answer and then glance at she maid as if to inquire whether it be safe to speak before she she interpret the look correctly and nod she head yes mr fairfax she say you can say what you please before nelly then be i right in interpret you trouble as be connect with you uncle i ask yes that be it she answer you have guess correctly do you know that he and mr codd have disappear disappear i repeat have you any idea where they have disappear to no but i can hazard a very shrewd guess she reply i believe they have cross to pari in search of mr hayle since last Sunday my uncle have be more depressed than ever while the paroxysm of rage to which he be so subject have be even more frequent than ever if the truth must be tell i fear he trouble have turn he brain for he talk to himself in such a queer way and ask every few minute if i have receive news from you that i can not help think he mind be not what it should be you must understand that on Saturday last think it might possibly be require for the case i draw a large sum of money from the bank more than a hundred pound in fact i securely lock it up in my writing-table and think no one know anything about it yesterday afternoon my uncle and mr codd go for a walk and do not return though i wait for they for several hour while i be thus wait i open the drawer in the writing-table to procure something i want and discover that the money be miss only one construction could be place upon it mr fairfax they have weary of they inactive life and have set off in search of hayle they be aware of he address in paris be they not yes my uncle repeat it from morning until night she answer in point of fact he do little else oh it terrify I beyond measure to think what may happen should they meet you need not fear that i reply hayle have tire of pari and have bolt again very probably to a place where they can not hope to find he i believe she say god be thank under she breath but i be not quite certain upon that point i do not tell she of the trick hayle have so lately play upon myself if the tell be necessary it would be able to come later on may i ask what bring you to paris miss kitwater i inquire after a pause my great fear she answer i wire to you from chare cross to say that i be come do you not receive my message i remember the fact that not have time to open they all before i be call away i have put some of the telegram on one side as ill luck would have it miss kitwater 's must have be amongst these i explain that i have be away from the house all day and only that moment return i feel she say ignore my excuse that i must come to you and tell you all that have transpire also that i might implore you to keep the man apart at any cost we can easily find out whether they have arrive in pari and also whether they have be to hayle 's apartment i say that would certainly be one of the place which they would try first while i be speak there be the sound of a step in the corridor outside and next moment leglosse enter the room he be in the highest spirit as he always be when he be about to undertake a new piece of work see that i have visitor he come to a sudden standstill a thousand pardon he say in french i have no idea that you be engage i will wait outside do not do anything of the kind i return in the same language come in and let I introduce you to miss kitwater who have just arrive from england miss kitwater he repeat in some surprise surely i understand you to say that you client the gentleman who have lose he sight through hayle 's treachery be monsieur kitwater that be quite right and this lady be he niece i return she have bring I extraordinary intelligence she uncle and he companion have suddenly disappear from the little village in surrey where they have be stay some time with she it be she belief that they have come to pari in search of hayle there would have be trouble have they meet but fortunately for they and for hayle he have give they the slip once more it would be possible for you to find out whether they arrive by this morning 's train and also whether they have make inquiry at hayle 's apartment would it not quite possible he answer it shall be do at once i will let you know in less than a hour what i have discover i thank he whereupon he bow to miss kitwater and then disappear monsieur leglosse be also in pursuit of hayle i explain he hold a warrant for he arrest on a charge of embezzlement in cochin china for that reason we be follow he to naple to-morrow morning to naple have the wretched man go there so we have be lead to believe i answer then do you think my uncle will find it out and follow he she ask wring she hand oh it be all too terrible what shall i do well if i might be allow to be like david copperfield 's mr dick i should be practical and say ' _ dine _ ' i suppose you have have nothing to eat since you leave england she give a little wan smile we have not have very much certainly she answer poor nelly you must be nearly starve the maid however protest that she be not but be not to be deny bid they remain where they be i go down-stair and interview my faithful friend the _ concierge _ with she i arrange that miss kitwater and she maid should be provide with room in the house for that night and have do so go on to the nearest restaurant in something less than ten minute all be settle and in under twenty they be seat at they meal at first the girl would not sit down with she mistress but with she usual thoughtfulness miss kitwater order she to do so and now mr fairfax she say when they have finish we must discover a hotel where we can stay the night at present we know of no place in which to lay we head you need not trouble about that i say i have already arrange that you shall have room in this house if you care to occupy they the old lady to whom it belong be a particular friend of mine and will certainly do she best to make you comfortable i presume that it be you bag i saw in the _ concierge 's _ office when i be there just now we leave it there she answer and then give I my reward by add -- it be very kind of you mr fairfax to have take so much trouble i can not thank you sufficiently you must not thank I at all i reply in help you i be only do my duty to my client i have scarcely say the word before i regret they it be a foolish speech and a churlish one as well she pretend not to notice it however but bid she maid go down to the _ concierge 's _ office and take the bag to the room that have be allot to she the girl disappear and when she have go miss kitwater turn to I mr fairfax she say i have yet another favor to ask of you i assure you it concern I vitally i want to know if you will let I go with you to naple in order that i might not be in you way we might travel in different compartment but go i must i be so frightened about my uncle if i follow he to naple it be just possible i might be able to dissuade he from pursue hayle if he be to kill I for prevent they i would not let they meet believe I when i say that i be terribly anxious about he besides -- here she pause for a moment as if she do not quite know how to continue what she have to say to I as i have say you and monsieur -- i mean the french gentleman -- could travel in you own way all that i want to be assure of be that i may be in naple and at hand should anything happen if you really wish it i do not see why you should not go i reply meditatively but if you desire my candid opinion i must say that i think you would be far better off at home still if you desire to come it be not for I to gainsay you wish we will arrange therefore that unless you decide to the contrary in the meantime you accompany we by the 850 train to-morrow morning i thank you she say a few moment later leglosse return with the information that it be as we suspect kitwater and codd have arrive in pari that morning and have visit hayle 's lodgings only to find he go what be more important still he continue they have manage to learn that hayle have go to naple and they will probably leave by the 250 train to-morrow morning for that city : it be as well perhaps that we arrange to travel by the next courage courage miss kitwater i say see that she be tremble try not to be frighten there be nothing to fear then turn to leglosse i add -- miss kitwater have decide to accompany we to naple as a matter of fact my position in the case have undergo a change since i last saw you he look from one to the other of we as if in astonishment what do you mean he ask hitherto i reply i have be act against hayle with the intention of secure he in order that my client might have a most important meeting with he for the future however my endeavor will be use in the contrary direction they must never meet then the best way to bring about what you desire be to assist I return leglosse let I once get my hand upon he in the name of france and they will never meet but we have to catch he before we do that i say never-fear we will do it he answer confidently and that seem to settle it next morning at 850 we leave paris for naple chapter xi it be in the early afternoon follow we leave pari that we reach naple by this time in spite of we endeavor to prevent it miss kitwater be quite tire out she certainly pretend not to be but it be difficult if not impossible for she to conceal the fact immediately on arrival we convey she to the best hotel of the proprietor of which leglosse have already make inquiry in order to find out whether or not hayle have take up he abode there it be with relief that we discover that no person answer at all to he description be located there that do we commence we search for the man we want we decide to first try the office of the various steamer ply across the mediterranean to port say considerably to we amazement however we happen to be successful at the first cast a man signing himself henry gifford have apply for a first-class passage to colombo with the intention of change at that port into another steamer for hong kong what be he like i inquire of the clerk and do anything strike you as peculiar about he or he appearance well there be one thing he say and at the time i must say i think it funny when i ask he he name he begin ` gideon ' and then suddenly correct himself and say ` henry gifford ' i remember wonder whether he be use a false name or not he book he passage at the last moment and seem in a great hurry to get aboard -- be afraid he would miss the boat i question he as to the man 's general appearance and when i have learn all he have to tell we i be perfectly satisfy in my own mind that hayle be the man who have go aboard he do not lose much time say leglosse mark my word he 'll leave the steamer at port say and will either come back on he own track or go up the palestine coast to jaffa and thence back to europe what do you think be the best thing to be do see the agent of the company here and get he to telegraph to port say i answer both to they agent there and the captain of the steamer if the captain telegraph back that gifford be we man we must wire to the police authorize they to detain he pend we arrival there be a bit of risk attach to it but if we want to catch he we must not think of that we accordingly interview the agent and place the case before he we tell he who we be and leglosse explain to he that he hold a warrant for the arrest of one gideon hayle a individual whom he have every reason to believe be endeavor to escape under the assume name of henry gifford the clerk be next call in and give he evidence and these matter have be settle the telegram be despatch to both the captain and the agent some four day we know must certainly elapse before we could receive a reply and that time be devote to search the city for kitwater and codd that they have not book passage in the same boat in which hayle have sail we soon settle to we satisfaction in that case we know that they must be domicile in naple somewhere in the interval between we search leglosse and i use we best endeavor to make miss kitwater enjoy she stay we take she to pompeii climb vesuvius together visit caprus ischium the great museum the king 's palace and dine together every evening i have not be acquaint with the girl much more than a fortnight and yet i feel as if i have know she all my life and the greater my experience of she be the better i like she as for leglosse he outdo himself in he devotion he make the most extraordinary toilet in she honor and on one occasion go even so far as to inform I that if all englishwoman be like this particular specimen he would say good-bye to he beloved pari and cross the channel never to return again at last the eventful day arrive and from nine till twelve we call repeatedly at the office for the telegram that be to mean so much to we it be not however until the afternoon be well advance that a message be receive i could have take my stick to the agent for the slowness with which he open the envelope the clerk be call in the code translate and the message presently transcribe this gentleman he say at last point to the telegram be from we agent in port say and be as follow -- gifford small man gray hair and wear spectacles no scar on face can not find first-class passenger with one fear you have be deceive confound the fellow i cry he be do we again what be worse we have waste four precious day wait for this message what shall we do now look for he elsewhere say leglosse if he do not go by that boat he might have leave by another we thank the agent for he courtesy and be about to leave the office when another telegram be hand in we wait to see whether it be from the captain and presently find that we be not destine to be disappointed once more the agent consult he code transcribe the message and read it to we have interview gifford threaten he with the police for use passage book by another person he confess have be induce by stranger such as you describe to accept passage colombo how shall i act we have be do again i cry bring my fist down with a thump upon the table it be only another proof of hayle 's cleverness the ingenuous rascal book he passage here know very well that it will be one of the first place at which we shall make inquiry let fall a ` gideon ' and then transfer he ticket to somebody else i suppose he do not bargain for my get out of that house in time to follow he and to telegraph to port say now that we be certain that he do not go that way we must try and find out in what direction he do proceed and also what have become of the blind man and he companion say leglosse they may be hot upon he trail and if we can only discover they and keep a eye on they we may find out all we want to know but it be likely to prove a difficult task we try the various shipping office without success we call at every hotel important or otherwise question the city police who assure we they have see nothing of the man we describe and finally be compel to own ourselves thoroughly well beat leglosse 's face be the picture of despair and i fear mine be not much better we insert advertisement in the papers but with no more luck than before from the moment the trio have enter naple they seem to have vanish entirely then one evening a ragged little urchin call at the hotel and ask to see we in reply to we question he inform we that he have see two englishman only the day before such as the police say we be inquire for one of they be blind the other dumb indeed he be sure of this for the reason that he have carry they bag for they down to the harbor whence the palermo boat sail we prick up we ear on hearing this if he story be correct and kitwater and codd have visit sicily then without a doubt hayle must have go there too but we have no desire to allow ourselves to be take in again it might be another of hayle 's trick and for this reason we question the boy more closely he adhere however to he story without a variation he description of the man be perfect in every respect and he assure we most emphatically that he know nothing of any individual with such a scar upon he face as hayle possess at last we become convinced that he story be genuine and we reward the boy accordingly after he have disappear we inform miss kitwater of the discovery we have make you will follow they to palermo assuredly mademoiselle leglosse reply i have my duty to perform then i must go with you she answer if he be on the island the chase must be draw to a close and i must be present to protect he if possible against himself accordingly next morning for the steamer for that day have long since sail we set out for the kingdom of sicily that gem among island as goethe term it it be the first time miss kitwater have see the southern coast and for this reason i make she promise that she would rise early next morning in order that she might witness we approach to the far-famed island this she do and side by side we watch the vessel draw closer to the land away to the west lay the island of ustica its outline sharply define in the clear morning air how beautiful it all be she say and to think that we be sail such lovely sea upon such a errand you must try not to think about it i say ` sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof ' let we hope that it will all come right in the end if only leglosse can get hold of hayle first you uncle can not possibly do he any harm however much disposed he may be that way between we we ought to be able to manage that shortly after breakfast we obtain we first glimpse of sicily it be a scene never to be forget the blue sea the towering mountain rise apparently out of it make up a picture that be lovely beyond compare presently we steam into the harbor and make we way to the dogana where we luggage be examine here we commence we inquiry concern kitwater and codd and have the satisfaction of learn on undeniable authority that the story the boy have tell we be correct such terrible infirmity as theirs could scarcely fail to attract notice and more than one of the official remember see and commiserate they on leave the dogana they have travel to the city by cab so we be inform the man who drive they be outside now say one of they perhaps the señor would care to question he i reply that i should like very much to do so and we accordingly go out into the street together it appear that the cabman remember he fare perfectly the more so by reason of the fact that the blind man have swear at he for not use greater speed in reach the city he have drive they to some furnished lodgings keep by he cousin he say and be proceed to recommend they to we when i cut he short by inform he that we have already decide upon a hotel we thereupon enter the vehicle he mount the box and we set off from the moment that we have set foot ashore miss kitwater have be grow more and more nervous when it be take into consideration that before nightfall some very unpleasant thing might happen i do not think this fact be to be wonder at i pity she from the bottom of my heart and be prepare to do all that lay in my power to help she it be a strange change for she from the quiet little village of bishopstowe to the pursuit of a criminal across europe to a island in the mediterranean and when it be over be the question i ask myself on numerous occasion what be go to happen then i suppose i shall bid she good-bye she will thank I for the trouble i have take and then we acquaintance will be at a end after that it have become my habit to heave a prodigious sigh and to wonder whether she could ever be induce to -- but somehow i never get much further with my speculation be it likely she would ever think twice of I she be invariably kind and thoughtful she defer to I on everything and seem to think my opinion and action must of necessity be right apart from that i feel certain i have make no other impression upon she now _ mon ami _ say leglosse when we have install ourselves at we hotel i think it would be better that you should efface yourself for a time none of the man we be after know I but hayle and codd would both recognize you at once let I go into the town to make a few inquiry and if they be satisfactory we shall know how to act do you best to amuse mademoiselle and i will hasten back to you as soon as i have anything to tell upon my consent to this arrangement he set off leave I free to devote myself to the amusement of miss kitwater as soon as she join I we make we way into the garden of the hotel and seat ourselves on a comfortable bench spend the remainder of the morning bask in the sunshine and watch the exquisite panorama that be spread out before we i wonder what they be do at bishopstowe now i say and a moment later wish i have hold my tongue poor little bishopstowe my companion answer how thankful i shall be to get safely back to it i do not think i shall ever want to travel again ah you can not tell i reply you be see the world just now under very unfavourable auspices some day perhaps you will follow the same route under condition as happy as these be the reverse i think she must have guess to what i refer for she face flush a little and she hastily divert the conversation into another channel by draw my attention to a picturesque sailing-boat which at that moment be enter the harbor i try to entice she back to the subject later but she would plainly have none of it only once do she refer to it and that be when we be make we way back to the hotel to lunch i state my fear lest she should find all this run about from place to place tire for she you need not be afraid of that she answer i be very strong and be not easily tired besides you have be so good and kind mr fairfax and have do so much to ensure my comfort that if only out of gratitude to you i could not very well be fatigue i think you know how grateful i be to you do you not as she say this she look up at I with she beautiful trust eye and so overwhelm I that it be as much as i could do to keep back the word that rise to the tip of my tongue i answer she to the effect that i have only do my best to promote she comfort and be about to say something further when leglosse make he appearance before we there be a look of great satisfaction upon he face i think i know now all that there be to know he say if mademoiselle will excuse I i will tell it monsieur hayle arrive here some five day ago and have take possession of a charming villa some ten mile from the city it be situate on the coast and the agent declare it to be unique how long he intend to occupy it he the agent could not say but he have pay a high rent for it in advance which appear to have give unlimited satisfaction the other two man be still prowl about the city in search of he but so far they have not be successful in they endeavor could i not go to my uncle miss kitwater inquire it might be possible for I to persuade he to leave the island without see this wretched man i fear it would be useless i answer and you would only cause yourself unnecessary pain no what we must do be to communicate with the palermo police : leglosse can show they he warrant and then we must endeavor to get hayle under lock and key and then out of the island without waste of time that be the best course believe I if all go well i shall make the arrest to-night say leglosse and then add i must get back to pari as soon as possible that afternoon he go out once more this time to interview the police authority at five o'clock he return in a state of great excitement the other two have discover hayle 's whereabouts he say when we be alone together and they have set off in pursuit they have be go more than a hour and unless we start at once we shall be too late to take he before they run he to earth good heaven be you quite sure of this as sure as i can be of anything he answer i have be to they house do not say anything about this to miss kitwater i say hurriedly we must make the best excuse we can to account for we absence i try to do this but she see through my endeavor you be go to arrest he i can see she say poor unhappy man but there i would rather that should happen than he and my uncle should meet go mr fairfax and i pray god you may be successful leglosse have already engage a cab and when i join he i discover that he have also bring a sicilian police official with he this individual give the driver he instruction and away we go as we have inform the cabman previous to set out that there be no time to be lose we cover the distance in fine style and just as the sun be sink behind the mountain enter the little village on the outskirts of which the villa be situate it be a delightful spot a mere cluster of human habitation cling to the mountain-side the angelus be sound from the campanile of the white monastery further up the hill-side as we drive along the main street leave the village behind we we pass on until we come to the gate of the park in which the villa be situate we have already form we plan and it be arrange that the island official should send he name in to hayle leglosse and i keep in the background as much as possible we descend from the carriage and leglosse ring the bell which we discover on the wall presently the door be open and a wizened-up little man make he appearance before we a animated conversation ensue from which it transpire that the new occupant of the villa be now in the pavilion at the foot of the grounds in that case conduct we to he say the officer but remember this we desire to approach without be see lead on the old man obey and lead we by a wind path through the orangery for upward of a quarter of a mile at the end of that walk we see ahead of we a handsome white edifice build of stucco and of the summer-house order it stand on a small plateau on the first slope of the cliff and command a exquisite view of the bay the blue water of which lay some two hundred foot or so below it he excellency be in there say the old man in he sicilian patois very good in that case you can leave we say the officer we can find we way to he ourselves the old man turn and leave we without another word very well pleased i fancy to get out of the way of that functionary goodness only know what memory of steal vegetable and fruit have rise in he mind before we go in i say would it not be as well to be prepare for any emergency remember he be not a man who would stick at much we accordingly arrange we plan of attack in case it should be necessary and then approach the building as we draw nearer the sound of voice reach we ear at first i be not able to recognize they but as we ascend the step to the pavilion i be able to grasp the real fact of the case good heaven i muttered to myself that be kitwater 's voice then turn to leglosse i whisper we be too late they be here before we it certainly be kitwater 's voice i have hear but so hoarse with fury that at any other time i should scarcely have recognize it cover he codd he be shout and if he dare to move shoot he down like the dog he be you rob we of we treasure do you and you sneak away at night into the cover of the jungle and leave we to die or to be mutilate by those brute of chinese but we have run you down at last and now when i get hold of you by god i 'll tear you eye and you tongue out and you shall be like the two man you rob and betray keep you barrel fix on he codd i tell you remember if he move you be to fire oh gideon hayle i have pray on my bended knee for this moment and now it be come and -- at this moment we enter the room to find hayle standing with he back to the window that open into the balcony which in its turn overlook the somewhat steep slope that lead to the cliff and the sea codd be on the left of the center table a revolver in he hand and a look upon he face that i have never see before on the other side of the table be kitwater with a long knife in he hand he be lean forward in a crouch position as if he be prepare for a spring on hear we step however he turn he sightless face towards we it be hayle however who seem the most surprised he stare at I as if i be a man return from the dead put up that revolver codd i cry and you kitwater drop that knife hayle my man it be all up the game be over so you may as well give in leglosse be about to advance upon he warrant in one hand and manacle in the other what do this mean cry hayle he voice located he and before we could either of we stop he kitwater have spring forward and clutch he in he arm of what follow next i scarcely like to think even now in cannon with hayle he have drop he knife and now the two stand while a man could have count three lock together in deadly embrace then ensue such a struggle as i hope i shall never see again while we other stand look on as if we be bind hand and foot the whole affair could not have last more than a few moment and yet it seem like a eternity kitwater with the strength of a madman have seize hayle round the waist with one arm while he right hand be clutch at the other 's throat i see that the vein be stand out upon hayle 's forehead like black cord do what he could he could not shake off the man he have so cruelly wrong they sway to and fro and in one of they lurch strike the window which fly open and throw they into the balcony outside codd and the sicilian police official give loud cry but as for I i could not have utter a sound have my life depend on it hayle must have realize he terrible position for there be a look of abject hopeless terror upon he face the blind man of course could see nothing of he danger he one desire be to be revenge upon he enemy closer and closer they come to the frail railing once they miss it and stagger a foot away from it then they come back to it again and lurch against it the woodwork snap and the two man fall over the edge on to the sloping bank below still lock together they roll over and over down the declivity towards the edge of the cliff a great cry from hayle reach we ear a moment later they have disappear into the abyss while we stand stare straight before we too terrify to speak or move -lrb- illustration : the woodwork snap and the two man fall over the edge -rrb- leglosse be the first to find he voice my god he say how terrible how terrible then little codd sink down and place he head upon he hand on the table sob like a little child what be to be do i ask in a horrified whisper go down to the rock and search for they say the sicilian officer but i doubt if we shall be able to find they the sea be very deep off this point we go kitwater 's body we discover terribly mutilate upon the rock hayle 's remains be never find whether he fall into the deep water and be wash out to sea or whether he body be jam between the rock under the water no one would ever be able to say it be go and with it all that be leave of the stone that have occasion they misery codd do not accompany we in the search and when we return to the villa above he be not to be find never since the moment when we leave he sob at the table have i set eye on he and now i suppose in all human probability i never shall later on we return to palermo to break the news to miss kitwater shocked though she be she receive the tiding with greater calmness than i have expect she would do perhaps after all she feel that it be better that it should have end so \* \* \* \* \* three year have elapse since we pay that terrible visit to palermo it may surprise you or it may not when i say that i be now a married man margaret kitwater have consent to become my wife two year ago next month the only stipulation she make when she give she decision be that upon my marriage i should retire from the profession in which i have so long be engage as i have do sufficiently well at it to warrant such a step i consent to do so and now i lead the life of a country gentleman it may interest some people to know that a certain day-dream once think so improbable have come true inasmuch as a considerable portion of my time be spend in the little conservatory which as i have say elsewhere lead out of the drawing-room i usually wear a soft feel hat upon my head and as often as not i have a pipe in my mouth every now and then margaret my wife look in upon I and occasionally she can be persuade to bring a young fairfax with she who some people say resemble he father for my own part i prefer that he should be like he mother -- whom very naturally i consider the best and sweetest woman in the world ~ the end ~ end of the project
