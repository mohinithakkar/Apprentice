produce by john orcutt count the cost a address to the people of connecticut on sundry political subject and particularly on the proposition for a new constitution by jonathan steadfast 1804 however combination or association of the above description may now and then answer popular end they be likely in the course of time and thing to become potent engine by which cunning ambition and unprincipled man will be enable to subvert the power of the people and to usurp to themselves the rein of government destroy afterwards the very engine which have lift they to unjust dominion washington 's farewell address a address to the people of connecticut for which of you intend to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost a interesting question be here ask by the direction of infinite wisdom this question contain the follow useful and important instruction : that no man or body of man should attempt the accomplishment of any great object without duly estimate the evil and benefit probably result from it such a rule of life and adopt and adhere to would have prevent many scheme and project which have cost much and which have be productive of nothing but the disgrace to they author and misery to the human race -- it would induce man to obey the dictate of experience rather than the dream of enthusiasm and would drive from the world a species of wisdom which be indeed folly a attempt be now make in this state to change the vital principle of we government to remove from office all we present ruler and to introduce a new order of thing to these innovation the people be invite allured and exhorted -- to effect these object no pain be spare -- no exertion be omit a important question here arise viz would the accomplishment of the object be worth the cost -- a individual who neither hold a office nor seek one -- who can have nothing in view but the maintenance of that order of thing which shall most effectually promote public and private happiness and who have the same interest in the welfare of society as the great body of he fellow citizen request the dispassionate attention of the reader while he consider this important subject he will use no weapon but truth and truth will be regard by all except those who love darkness rather than light to exhibit a correct view of the subject it will be proper first to enquire into the present condition of connecticut and secondly to examine the various plan or project propose for we adoption and estimate the probably cost attend they we can then in the third place form a just opinion of the propriety of the propose change the condition of connecticut first claim we attention that we climate soil and situation be such as to insure as much health riches and prosperity as any people can rationally wish seem not to be doubt we natural advantage do not indeed promise such a accumulation of wealth as might satisfy that avarice which like the horse leach be constantly cry give -- give -- they be such however as will in ordinary case ensure to industry a ample reward and this should satisfy a virtuous mind the diffusion of knowledge be greater than in any other part of the globe of equal dimension such be the excellent provision of we law and the virtuous habit of we citizen that school of instruction in all useful knowledge be to be find in every place where they be need there be no village in this state which will not attest to this fact in various place also flourish academy be support in which the higher branch of science be teach and we college be at once we ornament and we pride religious instruction be also bring almost to every man 's door so that none can justly complain that they be deny the means of grow wiser and better by the liberality of the benevolent private library be every where find which with the other source of information evince the superiority of we condition to that of any other people in the means of gain valuable knowledge to those who with the writer believe that ignorance be the parent of vice and that the civilized be preferable to the savage state we situation in the above particulars demand the gratitude of every heart we constitution and government be perfectly free and we law be mild equitable and just to the truth of this position there be the most ample and unequivocal proof 1 those who seek to revolutionize the state declare this to be the nature of we government with few exception -- such testimony can not be doubt -- it be the testimony of a man against himself ask you neighbor to point you to the evil under which he labor -- ask he to name the man who be oppressed except by he vice or he folly and if he be honest he will tell you that there be no such man -- if he be dishonest he silence will be proof in point 2 stranger who reside here a sufficient time to learn we law universally concur in they declaration on this subject they will ask with surprize why the people of connecticut should complain they see every man indulge in worship god as he please and they see many indulge in neglect he worship entirely -- they see man every where enjoy the liberty of do what be right -- and such liberty they rightly decide be the perfection of freedom 3 the experience of a century and a half afford irresistible proof on this subject during this long period convulsion have shake many part of the earth and there have be a mighty waste of human happiness empire and kingdom have be prostrate and the sword have be devour without cessation this state too have be threaten -- cloud have gather and portend a dreadful desolation but we have be defend protected and save no essential change in we government have ever take place -- form by man who know the important difference between liberty and licentiousness it have be we shield -- we strong tower -- we secure fortress -- to the call of we country we have ever be obedient -- no state have more cheerfully meet danger -- no state have more readily or effectually resist foreign aggression washington while living be a witness to this fact and tho ' dead he yet speaketh while plot insurrection and rebellion have distressed many state and nation connecticut have enjoy a internal peace and tranquility which forcibly demonstrate the wisdom and equity of she government -- such a government administer by man of virtue and talent have produce the most benign effect and we prosperity be calculate to excite the warmest expression of gratitude rather than the murmur of disaffection 4 we treasury exhibit the truth of these remark it be clear from the statement in the appendix to which every reader will advert with pleasure that the people of connecticut annually receive thirty seven thousand four hundred and fifty-five dollar and seventy six cent more from the treasury than they pay into it by tax and duty -- at the close of the late war such have be we exertion we be encumber with a debt of nearly two million of dollar now that debt be pay and we have nearly that sum in advance where be the state which can justly boast of greater prosperity notwithstanding this enviable situation a clamor be excite the people be agitate and discord with its train of evil be prevail some of we citizen in the height of political prosperity be seek to destroy a order of thing which have prevail a hundred and fifty year and throw themselves into the arm of projector and reformer be there nothing unaccountable in such conduct be there nothing calculate to excite indignation my fellow citizen shall any considerable portion of the people of connecticut subject themselves to the reproach which rest on a ancient people the ox knoweth he owner and the ass he master 's crib but my people do not know israel doth not consider secondly let we examine some of the plan and project propose for we adoption and estimate the probably cost attend they -- here we must speak with less certainty -- what the present condition of connecticut be we know -- respect its future destiny we can only judge by argue from cause to effect why a man who regard the happiness of he fellow man should attempt a change here be too wonderful for a ordinary capacity no prudent farmer ever pull up a hill of corn which be flourish to see if there be not a worm at the root one of these project be the repeal of all law for the support of religious institution the language of those who favor the measure be that religion will take care of itself -- that no external aid be necessary -- that all legislative interference be impious many and it be believe by far the greater part of those who make these declaration intend to throw down all the barrier which christianity have erect against vice they be obstinately determine to banish from the public mind all affection and veneration for the clergy and respect for the institution of religion and to reduce connecticut to that condition which know no distinction between he who serveth god and he who serveth he not they wish to see a republic without religion and should they be gratify the consequence would speedily be a miserable race of man without virtue walling in vice and ripen for a dreadful destruction if infinite truth be to be credit god will pour out he indignation on the heathen who know he not these reformer under the specious pretext of exercise unbounded liberality in matter of religion become intolerant to all who differ from they charge the professor of christianity with breathing out a spirit of persecution they become the most furious persecutor and while they affect to possess great moderation and candor towards all denomination of christian they clearly evince that they would grant indulgence or protection to none on the other hand a great majority of the people and the legislature insist that every man in the community who be able should contribute in some way towards the support of the institution of religion no wish be entertain to legislate in matter of faith or to establish one sect in preference to another we law permit every man to worship god when where and in the manner most agreeable to he principle or to he inclination and not the least restraint be impose all idea of dictate to the conscience be discard and every man sit under he own vine and fig tree we law only enforce the great principle abovemention that the member of the community should contribute towards the support of these institution as means to promote the prosperity of the people in the same manner as they provide for the public accommodation peace and happiness by the maintenance of the road and bridge the organization of the militia and the support of school of instruction should objection be urge by any individual that they can not conscientiously contribute to the promotion of these object they objection would be disregard there be a class of man very respectable for the sobriety of they habit and they peaceful deportment who always refuse to be tax for military defense no one doubt that in they opposition they be conscientious and yet few doubt the propriety of enforce such tax the principle now advocate be interweave with all we law and habit -- it have exist from the first settlement of the state -- it have produce much good -- it ought not therefore to be abandon without the utmost deliberation the clamor against this principle be the clamor of those who wish to see the state revolutionize -- it be the clamor of those turbulent spirit which delight in confusion and which pull down and destroy with a dexterity which they never shew in build up let the sober citizen of connecticut look at the author of this clamor -- let they view such man as abraham bishop and eye the path which they have trodden from they youth and then ask they own heart if they be not under some apprehension lest if they should enlist under such leader and fight they cause they may be find contend against the best interest of society and fight against god another project zealously support be that of districting the state for the choice of assistant and representative in congress the only argument which be urge for the adoption of this measure with any plausibility be that in the district election the candidate would be better know to this argument it may be reply the state of connecticut be so limited in its extent information of all kind be so generally diffuse and there be such a flood of newspaper that the character of all the candidate for office may be thoroughly know by all who will bestow any attention to the subject this state be scarcely more extensive than a single county in many other state and the intercourse of the inhabitant of the various part with each other be such that no evil can exist in we present mode of election -- but there be serious and weighty objection against district election 1 such election open wide the door for intrigue -- as this door already too widely extend the most alarming mischief enter -- mischief which sap the foundation of a elective government by corrupt the mind of the freeman and this convert a election ground into a theater on which be display the most vile and demoralizing practice let the reader satisfy himself as to the truth of this observation by examine the history of a election in the southern state where this mode alone be adopt let he learn that they candidate for office and he host of dependent and tool be employ for week before and on the day of election in the most infamous intrigue and that falsehood and bribery be so much in fashion and be so universally resort to that success invariably attend the most impudent and the most profligate while the man of modesty and virtue though possess the fairest claim to promotion be abashed confound and overwhelm 2ndly the candidate when elect become the creature of the district and not the ruler of a state -- he be and must be devote to the interest of that portion of the community which have elect he and they view and scheme must be patronize though they oppose the welfare of the whole 3rdly such election do not secure the best talent if talent and worth be of consideration surely they should be at the command of the public it be of no moment where a man dwell but it be of immense importance that he be a wise man rather than a fool -- a man of integrity rather than a knave 4thly experience the only save and unerring guide be altogether in favor of election at large rather than by district the representation of this state in congress have ever be of the most respectable character -- it be not too much to say that no state in the union can justly claim a superiority to connecticut in this respect the fame may be affirm with truth of the upper house of the legislature of this state have there not be a constant succession of able and wise man in that branch of the administration of connecticut for more than a century we have preserve a unexampled prosperity -- shall we hazard we interest on the speculation of zealous partizan who be constantly bewildering themselves and they follower in new scheme another project be that of universal suffrage the street resound with the clamor that man be deprive of the invaluable privilege of choose they ruler and the people be invite to extend this privilege to all who pay tax and do military duty it be now discover that connecticut in this particular be not free -- the great argument urge in support of universal suffrage be that taxation and representation should go hand in hand -- it be say that this maxim be deem just during the revolutionary war and that american adhere to it as a fundamental principle -- this principle the writer readily recognize as a sound and indisputable position in every free government but what be the meaning of the maxim do it intend that every person who be tax can of right claim the privilege of give he suffrage if so person convict of offence or who be infamous for they vice may vote -- for such person be not outlaw -- on this principle woman of full age and unmarried be also to be admit -- minor also whose property be tax should be permit to exercise this franchise at least by guardian or proxy what then be the true meaning of the maxim that representation and taxation be inseparable here all writer agree -- it mean that no community should be tax by the legislature unless that community be or might have be represent in such legislature -- hence several town in this state till lately be not represent in the general assembly and of course not tax -- barkhempsted colebrook and winchester it be believe be of this description this state and the other state understand this maxim precisely as now explain in they opposition to great-britain -- we complain that the colony should not be tax because they be not represent in parliament in this view of the subject the maxim be wise and just again be not every town in connecticut now represent in the legislature and of course each individual equally with every other in the representative of hartford for example a representative of the freeman of hartford or of the town of hartford the truth be every man woman and child be represent but it be say that many person be exclude from give they suffrage who have life liberty and reputation to protect on a close attention to this fact it will be find that the number of those worthy member of society who do not possess the legal qualification be small and if man be to have a influence in election accord to the amount of they tax why should not the man who pay fifty dollar be entitle to more than one vote no one plead for such a privilege but there be many who insist that the man without a cent of property shall have the same direction in the choice of those who be charge with the interest of the community as he who be worth thousand of dollar a friend to the rights of man seem to feel no alarm at the idea that one who exhaust he earnings in the grog-shop should have a influence in election in proportion to strength of he lung or he activity in intrigue but he be greatly agitate from a apprehension that man who have property to protect will not promote the well be of society a juror who be to decide on the controversy of he neighbor -- a appraiser of land -- a distributor of a deceased person estate must be freeholder by a standing law which be the subject of no ensure and yet it be say that in the important transaction of choose man to enact law and to appoint those who be to decide on and execute those law no qualification be necessary again it be insist by those who oppose universal suffrage and the reader be desire to notice the remark with attention that no community can be safe unless the power of election reside principally with the great body of the landholder such a influence have this principle on those wise man who form we law that a mere trifle in real property give the right of suffrage while a man may be exclude who be the proprietor of personal property to a large amount landholder have a enduring interest in the welfare of the community they be lord of they own soil and of course to a certain degree independent -- they therefore will resist tyranny -- they will equally oppose anarchy because they be aware that in any storm which may arise they must abide its fury the merchant with he thousand can seek a shelter -- to the mere bird of passage who have no abide country and who seek none to come it be of little moment whether stability or confusion predominate but to the former who be enchain to the state peace and order be of inestimable value what my fellow citizen be the attempt now make what be the language of those who advocate universal suffrage it be nothing less than a effort to rest from the farmer of connecticut that controul over the election which be they only fortress of safety let man who wish to protect they invaluable rights ponder on these thing and let they at the same time remember that no nation in which universal suffrage have be allow have remain free and happy another project urge with great vehemence be to displace all we present ruler -- by those be mean we legislator in the general and state government -- we judge and magistrate of every grade that such be a darling object with those who seek to revolutionize connecticut there be no doubt be such a measure wise who be these ruler a candid observer must reply they be man in whose hand power have be wisely place by the people and who have never abuse that power man of unquestionable talent and of spotless fame among they be you trumbull you ellsworth you hillhouse you griswold you goodrich and you cavenport man try and approve among they there be one who be side by side with you beloved washington during the revolutionary war who have repeatedly be elect you first magistrate and against whom the tongue of slander never move but in the hard service of a harder master there be another who for more than twenty year have be employ in the first office in the gift of he country and whose probity and talent be second to those of none of he contemporary among these be many who must enjoy the affection and veneration of they countryman while superior worth be regard against these man the cry be raise -- not the cry of the oppress for god know no man in connecticut be oppressed but the cry of those who pant for office and who can rise only on the ruin of other you judge also to whom be commit the administration of justice be mark out as the victim of party spirit be not a wise and faithful execution of the law the chief object of every good government without this who be safe for a moment without this liberty can exist only in name -- the name indeed may be blasphemously utter but the substance be go with the liberty of all who have rely on profession let the people of connecticut look at they tribunal of justice be they not fill with man of incorruptible integrity where have innocence receive a more ample protection be not the transgressor punish and be not the wrong of the injured redressed be not we mild law execute in mercy and be not justice award with impartiality to individual can you look at the seat of justice and say iniquity be there dare any man say that the judge of we high court be not upright intelligent and learn who then can justly complain yet the stripling of yesterday -- the bold projector -- the unprincipled ad ambitious with a host of deceive follower with matchless effrontery arraign the conduct of these magistrate and loudly demand that they be drive from they office and from public confidence another favorite scheme be to elevate to all the office of importance man who have never enjoy the public confidence the language of these revolutionist be respect the man in power in connecticut we will not have these man to rule over we -- we will fill they place with man of we choice -- the creature of we hand and who will be subservient to we view but my countryman before you join in this project pause and enquire who be these man who thus assert they claim to rule over you who be these man who place themselves in the corner of the street and cry oh that we be make judge in the land it be no part of the writer 's design to hunt vice from its guilty retreat to expose before a insult people the horrid feature which distinguish certain individual who challenge popular applause or to attach private character but justice demand that man who boldly claim to be the ruler of the free and happy state of connecticut should be know the man who be to stand in the place of we trumbull and we ellsworth should not shrink from public investigation to those who respect the authority of god it be a matter of no small moment that those who rule over man should be just rule in the fear of god nor will man accustom to revere this solemn declaration lend they aid to elevate man of vicious and corrupt life without some dismay it be not enough to tell we that man will be select of more virtue and talent than those now in power -- such a pretence be vain -- no man in he sens will regard it -- no man make such a pretence but for wicked purpose if we be direct to turn we eye to those who for year past have be hold up in the unsuccessful nomination and be tell that these be to be substitute for the man who now guide we council what be we to expect a appeal may be make to every man not bewilder in this new and destructive madness -- he may be ask who among these man stand-forth with fair claim to public confidence where among they can be find the polished scholar -- the able civilian the enlighten judge do we see in a single individual a assemblage of talent unite with virtue sufficient to qualify he for the seat of justice if there be such man they have hitherto hide they talent i the earth it will not here be forget that the attempt be to reject man long know and respect and to fill they place with those who be without a witness in they favor a still more mischievous and alarming project be that of make a new constitution for connecticut this project originate entirely in a spirit of jacobinism -- it be a new theme on which to descant to effect a revolution in connecticut the object be by false assertion to induce a belief that no constitution exist and that tyranny prevail this party always address the passion and never the understanding -- review they measure for a few year and you will distinctly perceive they motive and aim to create disaffection and hatred towards those who formerly administer the general government it be boldly assert that the treasury have be plunder even the illustrious savior of he country be accuse of embezzle public money and he follower could not expect a less happy fate man of the most unsuspected integrity be openly attack by anonymous publication or dispoiled of they good name by secret insinuation these calumny be keep in circulation by they author till impudence itself be abashed and the object in view obtain -- not a tittle of proof be ever adduce and investigation always shew that the charge be not only false but entirely groundless for the same unworthy purpose it be assert in every circle of opposition that salary be too high and the income of office enormous every tavern resound with this grievance at length the principal author of this clamor get into place and the clamor be hushed yes man who urge the people of connecticut almost to rebellion on this account stept into the place and without a blush take more from the people than they predecessor look at mr babcock 's paper in 1799 and 1800 and see its column fill with railing against high salary -- look at it since abraham bishop take 3000 dollar a year and alexander wolcott more than four and find if you can a complaint on this subject such meanness such baseness such hypocrisy in office seeker exhibit in strong color the depravity of human nature and teach we what dependence may justly be place on pretension and profession to inflame the passion and to create animosity various subject have be successively seize upon and press into the service of the revolutionist -- every quarrel however trivial be notice -- every seed of discord however small be nourish to disseminate murmur and to further the great object-various class of the community be tell with apparent anxiety for they welfare that they be oppressed and that a new order of thing must arise or that they will be enslave new subject be start as old one cease to operate and thus all that ingenuity and art industry and perseverance can devise or effect be accomplish thus that numerous and respectably body of christian call episcopalian have be tell and repeatedly tell that the more numerous denomination be seek to deprive they of they just and equal rights and to subject they to the tyranny of a overbearing majority -- these tale be reiterate till they author find they useless from they folly and falsehood at another time the baptist be address by a set of man who deny the reality of any religion and the most earnest yearning for they welfare they tyranny of the legislature be paint in horrid color and they be exhort to lend they aid to vindicate the cause of the oppress those who conscientiously believe that no tax ought to be pay for the support of religion and those who wish that religion might no more infest the residence of man be address with consideration adapt to they respective case at one time man destitute of property be seduce by the alluring doctrine of universal suffrage -- then the farmer be tell that tax be too high on land and with the same breath the mechanic be sagely inform that the poll tax should be repeal and the burden fall back on the land holder festival under the pretence of honor the election of mr jefferson and mr burr and of extol the wisdom of the purchase of louisiana but with a real design to blazen the fame of those who assume the character of friend of the people that they may the more readily destroy the most free and equitable government in the world be continually holden and the discontented the factious the ambitious and the corrupt be collect and flatter with declamation in the various shape of prayer sermon and oration thus a people enjoy the height of political prosperity be cajole into a belief that man without virtue without the restraint of the gospel without a particle of real regard for they fellow man be they best friend and be anxiously labor to promote they good let such remember that when the ethiopian shall change he skin when the leopard shall change he spot and when bitter fountain shall send forth sweet water then will those who flatter the people with they tongue and deceive they with they lip seek they happiness such be some of the measure resort to by those who have swear in they wrath that connecticut shall be revolutionize find all these ineffectual and that the good sence and virtue of connecticut have hitherto oppose a inseparable barrier to all they plan they now exclaim connecticut have no constitution such a gross absurdity could never have be promulgate till the mind be in some degree prepare by be accustom to misrepresentation this be well know to mr bishop who have for year be in the habit of disregard moral obligation in the year 1789 this orator pronounce several inflammatory invective against the constitution of the united state to which he be a bitter enemy till he obtain a office under it worth three thousand dollar a year at that time he language be the constitution of connecticut be the best in the world -- it have grow up with the people and be fit to they condition -- now this consistent man who be endeavor to gull the people that he may successfully tyrannize over they avow that they be without a constitution my fellow citizen examine this head of clamor with candor read the solemn declaration of washington in the title page attend to the follow remark and then tell I if you do not perceive in this project with the manner in which it be support and attempt to be accomplish enough of the revolutionary spirit of france to excite the indignation of every real friend to the peace and happiness of connecticut 1 if there be no constitution in connecticut then you huntington you trumbull you sherman you wolcott and you davenport with many other worthy who be you defense in war and you ornament in peace and who be now sleep with they father be wicked usurper -- they rule they fellow citizen without authority -- they be tyrant let judd and bishop approach the sepulchure of these venerable man -- let they lift the cover from these venerable ash and in the face of heaven pronounce they tyrant could you see they approach they dust with such language on they tongue you would see they retreat with horrible confusion from these relick of depart worth 2 the present ruler be act also without authority and they law be void -- then you be already in the midst of anarchy and wild misrule -- then have no man a title to a inch of land and you be ready for a equal of division of property -- all protection of life and liberty be at a end and the will of a mob be now to prevail 3 if indeed there be no constitution then the oath which have be administer in you freeman 's meeting for twenty year by which each man have swear to be true and faithful to the constitution of the state be worse than impious profanation of the name of god -- then you judge magistrate and juror have strip man of they property condemn some to newgate and other to the post the pillory and the gallows without a warrant and be therefore murderer -- o thou god of order in this we condition but 4 we have a constitution -- a free and happy constitution it be to we father like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land -- it have enable they to transmit to we a fair and glorious inheritance -- if we suffer revolutionist to rob we of this birth right then we be bastard and not son it be a fact as well authenticate as the settlement of the state that a constitution be form by the people of the then colony of connecticut before the charter of king charle this charter be a guarantee of that constitution trumbull 's history of connecticut

he appearance and good behavior in the mean time unless it be for capital crime contempt in open court or in such case wherein some express law doth allow of or order the same these proceedings have be regard as the ark of we political safety by the great and the good of all party who have go before we never till this year have we hear or even suspect that we state be govern by lawless mob now as a means to effect a revolution for the first time have a few design man endeavor to excite alarm -- they have indeed excite alarm -- sober man of they own party be alarm -- honest man who be not misguided see the whole extent of this project and they will frown it into contempt 5 mr edward as chairman of a body of man whom he call a state committee on the 30th of July without consult even he brethren of the committee order delegate to meet at new-haven on the 5th Wednesday of August in those town where enough could not be assemble to elect a member the person write to be authorize to attend and take a seat in some town the proposition be reject even by republican the delegate thus choose with all who unite with they opinion and choose to attend meet at the time and place appoint -- shut they door against every eye and ear -- sit one day form a address order ten thousand copy print and dissolve this address we have see it deserve some notice : the first thing that attract we attention be that william judd esq of farmington be appoint chairman this be a admirable provision -- such a meeting should certainly have such a head a man with the habit of devote he feeble talent to intrigue and who be noticeable only for a ostentatious parade would preside in such a assembly with peculiar grace he acquaintance could not but approve of this exhibition of the power of inflammable air and be please with its effect -lrb- on -rrb- a exhaust receiver the meeting thus organize proceed to stile this convention as follow : at a meeting of delegate from ninety-seven town of the state of connecticut convene at new-haven on the 29th of August 1804 delegate -- delegate do they stile themselves the people would be oblige to this convention to disclose they authority who commission these gentleman for this important labor of provide they with a constitution the truth be not a man in that convention be choose by a majority of the people of -lrb- they -rrb- town -- in many instance with less than a quarter part and in general with less than a tenth -- yet they call themselves delegate thus -lrb- the -rrb- convention with major judd in the chair precede they address -lrb- with -rrb- a grosly deceptive declaration -- a declaration notoriously false and -lrb- impu -rrb- dent they then declare it as they unanimous opinion that the people of this state be at present without a constitution of civil government this be to have be expect mr edward order they to meet for that purpose and shall they not obey they master bishop and wolcott have repeatedly direct they to make this declaration and major judd know it to be true can any man doubt either the truth of this remark or the sincerity with which it be utter be it not clear that this whole proceeding originate in a pure unmixed affection for the people and a sacred regard to truth my fellow citizen look at the whole course of the life of judd -lrb- i place he first on the list because he be chairman -rrb- of bishop and of wolcott and say if they have not ever be under the influence of the most disinterested virtue and the most exalted patriotism look also at these delegate from ninety - seven town and say if they can have any other object in view but the dignity happiness and glory of they country individual can only vouch for individual the writer can vouch for about thirty with major judd at they head if any reader shall think that the subject be treat with too much levity he should reflect that we be now animadvert on this convention in they appointment of chairman they stiling themselves delegate from ninety-seven town and they declaration that we have no constitution on these subject it be scarcely possible to be serious the address proceed to declare how many of the confederated state have make for themselves constitution we ask which of they be more prosperous than connecticut in which of they be the great interest of society better secure in new-york a convention be call about three year since to amend they constitution in pennsylvanium they have have two constitution and they be now on the eve of a civil war duane the great move spring of all jacobin society a vile outcast from europe reign with uncontroled sway in every measure and every man of virtue be denounce in georgium they have have two constitution and in vermont two and who dare pronounce they political situation equal to that of connecticut the people of france have have six constitution within fifteen year and where be those constitution in the grave of anarchy and despotism with million of deluded inhabitant who have be sacrifice by the robespiere and the bishop of that suffer nation to that suffer nation turn you eye and reflect that the mighty mass of woe under which they have groan be produce by a ambition fierce cruel and destructive as hell and that a ambition alike terrible reign every where read this address attentively and you will be strike with the idea that no grievance be mention -- not a single evil be point out -- indeed the convention declare that they must be excuse a detail of the numerous wrong which have arrive to we under this government -- these be they word -- they be excuse indeed -- yes they be excuse from not pollute they address with falsehood in this particular -- full well they know that no such wrong exist -- full well they anticipate that a certain detection would follow any such attempt at imposition the leader in this convention know full well that there be intelligence enough in connecticut to meet they on any complaint and to shew that it be groundless they therefore prudently decline to be explicit and yield to we that the government be now well administer they shew a great anxiety for the safety of the next generation what a astonishing display of philanthropy bishop and wolcott be not at ease in they heart while there be a prospect that even the generation which succeed we will experience a woe after many remark direct to the passion without propose in specific term a single provision of they newly project constitution without lay they finger upon a single grievance without urge a single argument tend to shew that a constitution do not exist the address unmake itself -- it unmask the convention -- it unmask these patriotic delegate and discover the true cause of this jacobinic meeting towards the close of it speak of the people it say by they vote will be know they decision if a constitution appear desirable they will vote for man who be in favor of it here the convention speak which all may understand -- but lest they have not make themselves sufficiently intelligible they add we ask man of all party to attend punctually at proxy and to continue a contest of vote till the great question whether this state shall have a constitution be settle finally and forever now the plain english of these sentence be this we who be here assemble in convention wish the people of connecticut to vote for such man in future for office as be in favor of a new constitution -- we have already declare that we be in favor of such a constitution -- pray therefore vote for we and continue the context till we succeed and then -- yes -- my fellow - citizen and then what will they do why laugh at you folly -- take all the office and leave you to take care of yourselve if such would not be they conduct then the sun will no more rise in the east gentleman of the convention pray cease you pretension to promotion till the people discover you merit if you be honest great and wise you will certainly be notice and promote -- if you be pygmy politician the mushroom growth of a hour dress only with the little brief authority of self create delegate to a self create convention to aggrandise yourselve then probably you will live with little further notice and it will only be say hereafter of you that you belong to a assembly convene at new-haven on the 29th of August 1804 which spring up in a day choose major judd chairman and like jonah 's gourd wither in a day in this convention the question be much discuss whether the address should be make to the people or to the constitute authority of we state the legislature some honest republican insist that it be proper to apply to the legislature but this be oppose by the young lawyer and the leader of the party universally -- full well they know that such a measure would not answer they purpose -- mob never talk of any authority except that of the sovereign people -- to the sovereign people they go and to the sovereign people they appeal till a sovereign people be cruelly insult cajole and enslave marat robespierre and bonaparte tell the sovereign people that they be all in all till they have rob they of they dearest interest and enchain they in despotism and they now mock they with such declaration as these \* the perfectability of human nature the worst disease of man-the caprice of election must be destroyed-the people can not govern themselves have examine some of the plan or project propose for we adoption we will now estimate the probably cost attend they it be to be recollect that the proposition be to change the vital principle of we government -- to displace we present ruler and to fill they place with man who never enjoy the public confidence to determine whether these object be worth accomplish it be necessary to count the cost 1 one part of this cost will be a increase of the violence of party man who regard they property they liberty and they life will not yield they a willing sacrifice to the demand of the ambitious and unprincipled -- man who face danger and brave death during a seven year war -- man whose vein be warm with the blood of they venerable ancestor who plant this happy state and defend it amidst innumerable hardship and calamity -- man who deem they birthright sacred -- they own freedom valuable and they child dear as they own blood will not calmly nor cowardly suffer those who have no claim but they impudence to storm they fortress and to capture they they will defend it in all lawful ways-bishop and wolcott and a thousand other mercenary hireling may attempt to subdue or terrify they -- a proud and haughty leader who under the guise of patriotism be attempt to undermine the happiness of the best regulate and freest state in the union with a thousand sycophant conspire to bring we under the yoke of virginium may exhaust they ingenuity and malice still connecticut will remain unshaken she will never crouch like isachar to chain and fetter while any portion of the noble spirit of she ancestor who transmit this fair inheritance at a mighty expense remain to impel they to noble exertion -- it be ardently to be wish that the passion of those who seek to overturn the venerable institution of connecticut my subside and that a spirit of reconciliation and moderation may succeed to that madness which threaten we peace -- if however the controversy be to be continue and a mob insist on the right to rule freeman will protect they life and they liberty -- and be not the peace and tranquility of the state of importance we have be tell with more truth than sincerity that life itself be a dreary thing without harmony in social intercourse happy would it have be if the author of that just and pertinent remark have not contribute more than any other man in the united state to embitter party and to render life indeed a dreary thing 2 another item in the expense of accomplish these project be a corruption of moral to revolutionize connecticut it will be necessary to circulate without any intermission many gross falsehood respect the man in power the judge legislator and magistrate and the act and proceedings of the general assembly we have see the column of the mercury and the republican farmer fill with vile libel -- we have see abraham bishop follow by hundred enter a temple devote to the service of god and we have hear he there utter the most malignant slander on the clergy the legislature and the court of law -- we have see he publicly denounce one class and another of he fellow citizen as hypocrite old tory and traitor -- we have see he receive for this the applause of a wretched collection of disappointed ambitious and corrupt man this have be bear and the author despise and indignantly hiss from the society of the respectable and virtuous -- but the end be not gain -- new theme of revile -- new subject of abuse must be seek and the party who wish to effect a revolution be pledge to uphold and protect the agent however wicked what then may now be expect that dreadful declaration truth be fall in they street will soon be but a inconsiderable part of we miserable character it need not be add that such a condition evince great corruption of moral 3 another part of this expense will be the elevation of man to office who be unworthy of public confidence what can a nation or state expect from such man what could now be expect from these man but that they become immediately the creature of a party -- the tool of a faction be it worthy of no consideration that judge who be to be the arbiter of controversy -- who be to adjudicate on the life of they fellow citizen and to whom be commit the dearest and highest interest of society should be man of virtue -- of wisdom and of unsullied reputation can a court be a shield against the proud oppressor when a daring leader can crush they with he nod be not deceive my fellow citizen -- no nation have yet make such a experiment without feel its bitter and dreadful effect see the revolutionary tribunal of france -- see in they a melancholy picture of corrupt court and unprincipled judge -- the cruelty of that nation have appear no where more infernal than through they form of law and in they sanctuary of justice -- a corrupt judgment seat be the greatest curse with which a people can be punish in the mean time all subordinate tribunal will partake of the same character -- thus instead of a government of law there will be the tyranny of a desperate faction -- let no one reply that there be no danger of such evil in connecticut we now see a few leader controul a party of several thousand -- we have see six hundred meet and applaud the purchase of louisiana when not one in five of they could form any opinion on the merit of the bargain -- we have see a few leader direct the offering of incense to burr while the great body of they follower curse he -- we see a party suffer the pride of virginium to controul the government of the union and to oppress new-england with a heavy impost because she would not submit to internal tax -- we see a few leader direct a convention of about two hundred to issue a address to the people of connecticut which address contain on the face of it many palpable falsehood -- and can not these same leader controul a court 4 another part of the cost of these project be the loss of all we institution of religion -- it be not here intend that these institution will be at once abolish -- such a measure would alarm some honest man of the party -- a gradual but sure destruction be the evil to be fear the constitution of the united state be first attack by a unconstitutional repeal of a law and now the independence of the supreme court be to be destroy by impeachment of the judge so will it fare with you institution the principle openly advocate be that none shall be oblige to contribute for the support of religious institution this once establish destroy the vitals of the system and the residue of its existence will be misery and wretchedness shall a party avow this sentiment and seek by every artifice to give it effect receive the support of a people who have derive such substantial benefit from these institution shall we look in vain thro ' the rank of that party for one to lift up he voice against this daring and dangerous innovation be there not many who either do not believe this to be the object of they leader or if such shall be they object who be determine to resist they yes there be many who act with they who still intend to progress to no such excess let such view the conduct of similar party -- let such not be deceive -- this be indeed they object -- they do not avow it to you they know you would reject it but they have make a vow that the influence of the clergy shall be destroy -- this can be do in no other way nor can you resist they -- they regard you now because they wish you assistance to confer on they power but will they regard you when you exertion can neither aid nor defeat they design -- surely not -- such have be the conduct of all faction -- it will be theirs should they prevail -- the world have not furnished one solitary exception nor can you expect one in this case they seek they own good and not the good of other if inspiration be to be credit in return for these loss what good be to acrue to the people will you hazard these evil without a fair and reasonable expectation of some solid benefit be it then unreasonable to enquire what good be to be obtain do the character of these man elevate you hope you know many of they in private life -- do they there abound in good work shall they be hear and regard when they demand of you to displace you faithful and approve ruler and commit to they you all modest man will wait you notice and rise at you request shall the impudent banish they from you affection and usurp they place in you heart let it again be ask what good will result to connecticut by a new constitution by the prevalence of revolutionary principle france switzerland the netherland italy and holland have see revolution after revolution one new constitution after another and liberty have a thousand time be immovably establish altar have be demolish -- temple polluted king queen noble and priest murder in the cause of liberty -- million have perish -- religion banish and the worship of god prohibit -- projector have exhaust they ingenuity -- the treasure of wealth have be waste and the peace of the world sacrifice what be the result a accumulation of misery which baffle all description not a individual be more happy or more virtuous not a nation more prosperous -- not a tittle add to human felicity ye reformer look at france -- behold the crime which have rise up to demand the vengeance of god -- see the woe which you have bring on the race of man and tremble lest you work should follow you if this picture be too glaring look at we sister state in which revolution have be effect and shew we the benefit a noisy or seditious individual have obtain a lucrative office -- a ambitious leader be in the char of state satiate he pride or like abraham bishop gratify he passion for ignoble pelf upon he thousand -- he drive he carriage by he industrious neighbor who have toil for he at a election crack he whip and laugh at the folly of he dupe and will laugh till he may need he service again and then he will again cringe and bow and flatter and gull but be the mechanic the farmer the merchant profit be society enriched or the public good promote in this view of the subject we will briefly ask in the third place be it proper to make the propose change -- to adopt these project if no benefit will result -- if much evil will probably ensue -- the course of duty and interest be plain aware however that it may be say many of the danger be imaginary and be found upon the supposition that we shall act with as little discretion and prudence as the people of other country it be important to observe that revolution be the same in nature in every nation those who speak of a new constitution and of thorough reform should recollect that the promoter of these scheme in france constantly amuse the people with the idea that a new order of thing -- new rights -- new principle be to arise who do not recollect to have read of the perfectability human nature -- of the enlighten age of regenerated france she boldly proclaim herself the example of the world and all nation be invite to see she glory and enjoy she bless liberty and she glorious equality but mark the issue -- not twelve year have elapse before she have return to a inglorious despotism -- she have exchange she capet for a foreign usurper with a incalculable loss and here she history end such be the constant termination of such revolution and shall we claim to be a exception how do we judge as to the propriety of any course of life except by observation experience or history we see industry and integrity reward with competence or wealth -- we see intemperance and sloth follow with disease loss of reputation and poverty these be sure grounds on which to predict respect we neighbor and by which to regulate we own conduct on similar principle a wise people regard the conduct of other nation and be solemnly admonish by they example let not then the projector persuade we to adopt he theory with proof of they danger thus glare before we eye look at the conduct of we revolutionist for four year past and see if you do not discover the genuine principle of the jacobin of france -- recollect also that they have first a convention -- then a executive directory -- then a consul for year -- then a consul for life and then a usurper with a hereditary descent in he family at each successive revolution the people be court -- be flatter -- be promise transcendent felicity the people swear eternal hatred to monarchy and eternal fidelity to constitution till heaven weary of they perjury send they a despot in he wrath my fellow citizen human nature be the same here as in france -- then before you give ear to the song of enchantment count the cost -- before you sell you birthright for a mess of pottage count the cost before you consent to yield up the institution of you wise and pious ancestor count the cost -- before you admit universal suffrage count the cost -- before you submit to the mischievous doctrine of district election count the cost -- before you reject from office the man whom you heart approve count the cost the great cost of weak and wicked ruler -- before you consent to be govern by man whose impudence and vice constitute many of they claim to promotion count the cost this evil you can prevent by attend with punctuality on we election the freeman of connecticut be mighty when they arise in they strength no freeman can justify absence except from necessity -- that people who will not faithfully attend upon the choice of they ruler can not expect to retain they freedom -- trust not to a majority -- say not that thing will go well without I -- such language be unbecome freeman -- despair not of a majority -- if you will not go with the multitude to do evil go against they to do good before you neglect a election count the cost -- if the loss of you vote should prove the loss of a election of a single man then will you not have count the cost my fellow citizen -- we have a government which have protect we a century and a half -- we have enjoy unexampled prosperity -- we may transmit a glorious inheritance to posterity -- the writer have child dear to he as he own blood -- these child be to he a sacred deposit -- he can with confidence commit they political interest to such a government as connecticut have enjoy -- he be persuade that if they feel the iron hand of despotism it will not be from such a government and such ruler as we now possess -- before he yield he own and they dear and inestimable rights to the wild project of the reformer of this age he be firmly resolve to sit down and count the cost and he entreat he fellow citizen to adopt similar resolution
