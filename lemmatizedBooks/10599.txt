wonder at for both have be discharge recently from army aviation service -- bruce in canada and barney in the united state each have serve he country well now they be employ in the work of develop the wild of northern canada near hudson bay and there be no region more romantic than this with all its half-gleaned history and its million secret of wonder wealth and beauty as they stand in the doorway gaze at the forest-lined river and distant bluff hear the clang of steel on steel as construction work go forward catch the roar of cataract in nelson river and tingle with the keen air of the northern summer life seem a new creation so different be it from the day of war what be this bruce be look at a file contain bills-of-lading a messenger have hand he car 564963 c p r consign to major a bronson airplane and supplies he read it aloud and whistle barney jump to snatch it from he stand back give I air bruce gasp a airplane at the present end of the hudson bay railroad what be do now what be they up to go to quit construction here and use plane the rest of the way fancy freight wheat fish fur and whale blubber by airplane both lad laugh at the idea i do not wish he pilot any bad luck say barney but if he must die by break he neck or something i hope he do it before he reach the hudson bay terminus i would like to take he place in that big air-bird say would not it be glorious you have steal my thunder reply bruce laughing i be take that job myself tell you what i 'll fight you for it what weapon do you choose rope-handed spiking hammer or pick-axis let 's go down and see if it be here like as not it be a machine neither of we would risk he neck in some old junk-pile the government 's sell to the chap for a hundred and fifty or so that this idea be not take seriously by either be show by the double-quick at which they go down the line and over the half-laid track to where the accommodation train be stand thorough inspection of car number convince they that no 564963 cpr have not arrive oh well perhaps to-morrow she 'll be in then we 'll see what we see yawned bruce as he turn back toward the roughly-built log shack where work await they what be that bruce who be in the lead stop before the trunk of a scraggly spruce tree on its barkless trunk a sheet of white paper have be tack the two boy read it eagerly : notice to trapper hunter camper and prospector $ 500 reward will be pay to any person locate anywhere within the bound of the canadian northland at any point north of 55 ° north a wireless station operate without license or permit the notice sign by the provincial authority be enough to quicken they keen mind what do you suppose they want to know that for ask barney the war 's over perhaps further intrigue by we former enemy perhaps smuggler perhaps -- well do you own perhapsing but say bruce exclaim would not it be great to take pack rifle and mosquito-bar net and go hunting that fellow in that northern wilderness great sport all right grin barney but you would have about as much chance of find he as you would of locate german u boat m 71 by walk the bottom of the atlantic that be true all right say bruce thoughtfully but just think of that wilderness lake no white man have see river no canoe have travel mountain top no human ever look from say i have live in canada all my life and up to now i have be content to let that wilderness just be wild but the war come and i guess it shake I out of myself now that wilderness call to I and the first chance that offer i be go to turn explorer the wireless station offer a excuse do not you see barney grin he be a hard-headed practical yankee boy the kind who count the cost and appraise the possible result if you be talk of hunting fishing and a general good time in the wood then i be with you but if you be talk of a search for that wireless then i say give I some speedier way of travel than tramp give I -- he hesitate then he blurt out : give I a airplane the boy stare at one another as if they have discover a state secret then bruce voice they thought : do you suppose this major what-you-may-call-him be bring up he plane for some commission like that i do not know say barney but if he be he say the word slowly if he be then all i have get to say be that it be mighty important something affect the government i believe you be right about that say bruce but what it be i have not the least shadow of a notion and what complicate it still more be the major come from down in the state maybe it be something international suggest barney yes grin bruce suddenly awake from these wild speculation and maybe he be just some sort of bloomin ' sport come up here to take move picture of caribou herd or to shoot white whale in hudson bay guess we better get back to work ye 'll pardon a old man 's foolish question both boy turn at the word a old man with bent shoulder sunken chest and tremble hand stand beside they there be a eager question

tired shoulder and glance at bruce he be in a brown study what be on you mind bruce he ask that money think what it would do for la vaune five thousand seven hundred and twenty-four dollar bruce roll the word out slowly though they say no more about it the old man 's story be the inspiration of many a wild plan the truth be it be destine to play a important part in shape they future \* \* \* \* \* he be here she be -- it be here bruce burst into the office all excitement and half out of breath who be he she it grin barney slip he pen behind he ear the major and the airplane and the plane 's a hummer it be barney 's turn to get excite now he jump from he stool so suddenly that he pen go clatter let 's have a look at she he grab he cap and dash out bruce at he heel some greek freight handler be unload the car when they reach the track the work be be do under the direction of a rather tall man erect and dignified he the boy feel sure be the major he face bear some peculiar scar not deep but wide and as he walk he limp slightly might be he be lose some toe mutter barney have a cousin who limp that way the machine 's a handley-page bombing plane make over for some purpose or other say bruce with a keen eye for every detail that be the plane that would have bomb berlin if the war have last long enough they be carry mail from pari to rome in 'em now those machine carry four engine and develop a thousand horse-power this one be a lighter model and carry two engine one 's a rolls-royce and one a liberty motor the fellow that plan the major 's trip for he have select he equipment well they do not make they any better just look at the sweep of the plane exclaim barney they be make for high altitude work -- up where the air 's thin no one would be come up here for a high altitude test would he surely not there be no particular advantage at this point for that the boy watch the unload with eager and experienced eye as barney put it make I feel like some shipwrecked gob on a desert island when he see a launch come ashore yes grin bruce and soon you 'll be feel like you gob would when the launch come about and put out to sea again no chance for you on that boat barney guess you be right groan barney little enough we 'll have to do with that bird as he speak several of the man recklessly jerk a plane to free it from its wrapping the major he back to they be superintend the unload of the liberty motor hey you go easy there barney spring forward impulsively and show the workman how to handle the plane when the job be do he step back with a apologetic air the major have turn and be watch he you seem to understand such matter he smile i have work with they a bit say barney would you mind let I know where you be located ask the major my aviator and mechanic have disappoint I so far you might be of some assistance to I we be over at the bookkeeping shack -- the office of the construction company say barney red with embarrassment he -- that be my bunkie here know more about those boat than i do say if we can be any help to you we 'll jump at the chance will not we bruce surest thing grin bruce as they turn regretfully toward the dull office and duller work say you do not suppose exclaimed barney that night at supper -- you remember those awful wide plane of the major 's you do not suppose he be start for -- barney hesitate you do not mean -- bruce hesitate in turn sure the pole you do not suppose he would try it of course not exclaim bruce the conservative who ever think of go to the pole in a plane through canada bartlett 's get a plan of go to the pole in a plane but he be go from greenland say bruce that be different why steamboat farthest point of land north and everything that be just it exclaim barney disgustedly steamboat and everything you be not a real explorer unless some society back you up with somebody 's money to the tune of fifty thousand or so till you have get together a group of scholar and seaman for the voyage then the proper thing to do be to get catch in the ice you be all but lose but -- the ice clear at the crucial moment you push on and on for two year you live on seal meat and whale blubber half you seaman get scurvy and die you dog go mad you eskimo prove treacherous you shoot one or more you take long sled journey you freeze you starve you erect cairn at you farthest point north or west or whatever it be then if you be lucky you lose you ship in a ice-jam and walk home ragged and emaciate a man that do it that way get publicity write a book get to be somebody you see he go on we have sort of get in the way of think that it take a big expedition to do explore but after all what good do a big expedition do peary do not need one he land at the pole with two eskimo and a negro well now it ought to be easy as nothing for two or three man in a plane like that one of the major 's to go to the pole from here there be a fort and trading post on great bear lake with maybe a power-boat and gasoline then if there happen to be a whaler or something to give you a second lift why there you be sound pretty good admit bruce but nobody would ever attempt it of course not retort barney it be too simple the two follow day the boy find themselves take morning and evening walk down the track to the airplane which still lay pile in section by the track they be surprise to see that no effort be be make to assemble it the reason for the delay be make clear to they by a unexpected encounter on the evening of the second day find the major pacing up and down before the machine he slight limp aggravate by he very evident irritation they be about to pass as if they do not know there be a plane within a hundred mile when they be halt by the upraised hand of the major immediately both boy click heel and salute then they feel foolish for salute in civy i see you be military all right smile the major but how much do you really know about airplane oh say barney with exaggerated indifference bruce here know a little and i know a little too between we we might be able to assemble you machine if that be what you want in spite of he heroic attempt at self-control he voice betray he eagerness truth be he finger itch for pliers and wrench that be part of what i want but not all the major say briskly i be not a aviator myself and my man have fail I at the last moment have a trifling smash which result in a dislocate thigh out of service for the season i need a aviator and a good one he say there be only one other not attach to military unit that he could recommend -- a canadian but the plague of it be the man can not be located might i ask the nature of you propose trip ask bruce -- then bit he lip a second too late you might not the major snap out the word then in a kindlier tone my secret be not entirely my own i can say however that it be not a exceedingly long trip nor a dangerous one as aviation go but it be a important one and besides if it come out well and i believe it will i might wish to go on a more hazardous journey in that case of course you can see i should wish a veteran pilot at the wheel and one who will take a chance he turn to bruce you be a canadian be you not yes sir then perhaps you can tell I of the whereabouts of this young canadian aviator he name be -- the major stop to think he name be -- ah i have it it be man -- bruce man bruce 's jaw drop in astonishment he be too surprised to speak it be barney who almost shout in he excitement say : he be bruce manning major what the major stand back and look at bruce you oh come you be hardly more than a boy yes say barney he be hardly more than a boy but some of the best flyer the ally have be hardly more than boy they be boy when they go into it over there but the boy who go up after the german two or three time come down man major do not forget that you be right -- and i beg you pardon say the major bow to they i speak thoughtlessly so then i have the good fortune to be speak to the very man i seek he go on turn to bruce now i suppose the remain question be : will you be at liberty to take up aviation again and -- do you want to that say bruce struggle to keep he voice steady will depend upon at least one thing : if you will answer one question now we will promise you a definite answer to-morrow morning at seven o'clock the question my friend here barney menter be quite as skilled a aviator as i be if i go he go what there be in it in pay or peril we will share equally barney step forward to protest but bruce hold he back and continue : you machine be equip for two man besides yourself will you take we both most certainly say the major heartily in case you decide to accompany I i shall wire the mechanic not to come and you two may divide the work between you as you may see fit i might say he add that the pay will be double that which you be now receive and the journey will consume the remainder of the season should we decide on something more hazardous the pay will be in proportion and there be besides a substantial i might even say a rich reward offer for the successful completion of this latter task however enough of that for the present you can give I you decision in the morning and i hope you accept he bow and stride away now why do not you say ` yes ' on the spot demand barney impatiently we be require to give only a week 's notice to the company and the night and morning of that week we can use get the machine together and take a trial flight i always sleep over a thing answer bruce it be a habit i inherit from my father long after in quite different circumstance barney be to remember this remark and bless bruce 's inheritance mail have be deliver during they absence barney find a letter on he desk he puzzle over the postmark which be from some pacific port he tear the envelope open glance at the letter then read it with sudden eagerness bruce he exclaim listen to this it be from a old pal of mine david tower enter the navy same time i do the army and he read aloud : dear barney : i be off for somewhere far north guess not the pole but pretty well up that way second officer on a u s sub she be loan to a queer old chap they call doctor no particulars yet hope this find you ` up in the air ' as per usual dave that _ be _ a coincidence say bruce perhaps we 'll meet he up there somewhere among the iceberg i 'll suggest it exclaim barney reach for he pen dear dave he write be thinking of a little trip north myself we ship 's a 500 hp handley-page bring you guitar and oboe along my partner and i be bring saxophone and mandolin we 'll have a little jazz till we meet as ever barney if the boy have know under what strange condition this particular jazz performance would be give he might have feel queer sensation creep up he spinal column i say exclaimed bruce suddenly who be this major chap anyway i have a notion he be something rather big maybe the biggest -- you do not mean -- i be not say anything protest bruce but this other man i be think of leave a toe or two in the arctic and he face have freeze scar on it he name 's -- well you know it as well as i do shuck it could not be exclaim barney he would not be up here alone this way no i guess not sigh bruce but it would be great sport if it be he after all ten day later a girl in she late teens stand shade she eye watch a tiny object against the sky it might have be a hawk but it be not it be a airplane -- the handley-page with the two young pilot and the major on board the girl be la vaune she stand there watch till the plane have dwindle to a dot and the dot have disappear hold she apron to she eye to hide she tear she walk blindly into the house the adventurer be well on they way chapter ii the strange landing i do not like the way the rolls-royce be act bruce grumble through he telephone to barney for though they be not four foot apart not a word could they hear so great be the din of they two powerful engine same here answer barney old major ought to have give we more time to try 'em out brand new barren land far away force to land in tree-top good-night after that there come only the monotonous roar of the engine the major 's order have be due north by west and now though they have put fully two hundred mile between themselves and the last sign of civilization they be still hold to they course they also have be direct to fly as low as be safe three time the major have bark a order into the receiver always to circle some spot while he sweep the earth with a binocular as powerful as could be use in a airplane three time he have give a second order to resume they course he seem to be look for something barney say to himself and at once he begin wonder what it could be mine of fabulous wealth be say to be hide away in the hill and forest over which they be pass -- rich outcropping of gold silver and copper perhaps the major be try to locate they from the air here and there they pass over broad stretch of prairie the grass of which would feed numberless herd of cattle perhaps too the major be examine these with a eye to future gain then again barney thought of the illegal wireless station and he idly speculate on how it could be so important now that the war be over there be little to do but think as they scud away now race a cloud then plunge through the mass of vapor to reappear suddenly in the sunshine beyond barney have always keenly enjoy watch the land slip by beneath he as he fly but on this journey there be the add joy of sailing over land unknown he reflection be suddenly cut short by a strange jarring rattle from the rolls-royce instantly the thunder be cut in half as also be they power bruce have stop the big motor if now something go wrong with the liberty they must make a forced landing this with the level stretch of prairie give place to rough roll swell cover with scrub timber be not a pleasant thing to think of and even less pleasant to attempt the sun send a last yellow glow across the land sink from sight and soon the moon with silvery light and black band of shadow be play strange trick with the stolid world beneath they all day when duty permit bruce have keep a eye open for a cabin hide among the pine now he shout through the telephone to barney what 'll i do if i catch a square of light below barney know he be think of the boy timmie and la vaune 's money he carry into the wood a square of light of course would have be a cabin window kill you engine if you see a chance to light and explain later he shout back but no square of light appear and soon the thought of it be drive from they mind for of a sudden the plane shudder like a man with a chill it be the second engine bruce throw off the power then with a sput-sput-sput start it again once more come the shudder again he try with no better result half its power be go something be seriously wrong he turn to the other engine it would not start at all here be trouble they be pass over ridge after ridge and all be roughly timbered surely here be no landing-place and if the second engine stop altogether -- bruce 's heart lose a beat at thought of it he give the engine more gas and head the plane upward she climb slowly sluggishly like a tired bird but at length the keener air tell he they be a safer distance above the earth better chance to pick a landing-place from here think barney they have scarcely reach this higher level when the engine stop no effort of the pilot avail to start it he companion silently watch bruce 's mute struggle the major a perfect sport sit stoically in he place barney know that suggestion be useless also be silent so they volplan slowly downward every eye strain for a safe landing-place they know what a crash would mean at such a place loss of life perhaps a wreck plane at least then a struggle through the wood till starvation end it they be four hundred mile from the last trace of white man 's habitation they have come down to three thousand foot when it become evident that only rough ridge lay beneath they no landing-place here certainly they could only hang on as long as possible in the hope the ridge would give way to level ground bruce thank they luck for the wide-spreading wing which would impede they fall a moment later he groan for just ahead of they he see a rocky ridge higher than any they have pass over here then be the end he think but the tricky moonlight have deceive he they clear those rock by a hundred foot and just beyond bruce gasp and look again a miracle murmur barney or a mirage whisper bruce before they lay a square of level land green -- in the moonlight all about the square the land be black with tree but there be a landing place it be as if they trip have be long plan they coming anticipated and that a level field be clear for they it be only a matter of moment till they be bump along over the ground soon they be stand free from they harness and silently shake hand barney be the first to speak say do you know he say we be in somebody 's wheat-field impossible exclaim the major see for yourself the boy hold before they astonished eye a handful of almost ripened head of wheat then what be happen demand the major have you go due south by west instead of north by west unless my compass lie and it have never do so before we have go north by west since we start and we be -- or ought to be at this moment -- four hundred mile from what the white man call civilization well say the major since we be here wherever that be i suggest that we unpack we blanket and get out of the man 's wheat-field whoever he may be the mystery will keep until morning this they proceed to do a clump of stubby heavy-stemmed spruce tree offer they shelter from the chill night wind and there roll in blanket they prepare to sleep but bruce could not sleep drive a plane through cloud mist and sunshine for hour have make every nerve alert and the strain of that last sag slide through the air be not to be relieved instantly so he lay there in he blanket a tumult of idea in he mind this wheat-field now have he really be misdirect by the compass on the plane to prove that he have not he draw from he pocket a small compass and place it in a spot of moonlight take the relative direction of the last ridge over which they have pass and the plane in the wheat-field he be right the compass have be true they be four hundred mile northwest of the last mile of track lay on the hudson bay railroad deep in a wilderness over which they have travel for hour without sight a single sign of white man 's habitation yet here they be at the edge of a wheat-field what be the answer have some indian tribe take to farm with the forest alive with game the stream with fish this seem impossible of a sudden the boy start it be of course -- the sudden snap of a twig in the underbrush bring he mind back with a jerk to they present plight he wish they have bring the rifle from the plane some animal be lurk there in the shadow wolf grizzly some unknown terror perhaps then in another second he eye bulge in a open space between two spruce tree where the moon shine brightly have appear for a moment a patch of white then amid the crash of small twig the thing be go in childhood bruce have be tell many story of ghost and goblin by he irish nurse he have never overcome he dread of they but it be with the utmost difficulty that he suppress a shout then he laugh softly for the crackling twig tell he he have see a creature of flesh and blood no ghost he chuckle again and far in the dark a hoot-owl seem to answer he and he company be a source of comfort yet here be after all another problem : what be this white-coated creature of all the wild thing of the forest none be white save the arctic wolf it be doubtful if he roam so far south especially in summer and besides this creature be too large and heavy to be a wolf bruce thought of all the animal he know and give it up it might have be a cow cow in this wilderness do not seem more improbable than a wheat-field but the creature have be too light of tread for that could it have be a indian dress in white tan deerskin he be incline to take this for the right solution and wonder if he should awaken he companion he could not tell what danger threaten finally he decide to let they sleep he would keep watch the three of they could do no more once more he mind turn to the problem of the wheat what be it that he have just conclude oh yes timmie why might not timmie have camp here and plant this wheat but twelve year how have he live whence have come the seed wheat there be a hundred question connect with such a solution ah well morning would tell there would be a cabin somewhere on the edge of the field and they would eat eat for the first time bruce realize that he have not eat for hour be very hungry secure some malted-milk tablet carry for emergency ration he dissolve they in he mouth a wonderfully soothing effect they have prop himself against the tree he close he eye for a second and before he could pry they open again he too be fast asleep when he awake it be broad daylight and he companion be already astir do you fellow wake up last night he ask rub he eye sleepily barney and the major shake they head then you do not see it see what the white thing barney stare the major 's face be noncommittal bruce tell they of he experience he be be see a ghost declare barney with a laugh on the contrary say the major slowly i think he have not there be white creature in the arctic just such one as he have describe i have see they myself no not white bear either but i have never see they this far south i will not say now what i think bruce saw but i will say i do not think it be a indian look exclaim barney suddenly in a whisper he point to a thin column of smoke that be rise over the tree-top to the left of the wheat-field listen whisper bruce somebody 's chop wood the freshen wind bring the sound of the axe plainly to they ear a second later they hear the distant laugh of a child come on say the major throw he roll of blanket at the foot of a tree where there be child there be no danger maybe they 'll have hot-cake for breakfast a moment later find the three of they steal silently through the forest what they see as they peer into the clearing bring they up stand a man wield a axe before a cabin he be tall and strong smooth-shaven and clean no indian but a white man he clothing be of white-tanned buckskin the cabin be of log but large with a comfortable porch and several window the pane of the window seem near-glass it be impossible to tell from where they stand whether the two laughing child who play by the door be white or half-breed the appearance at that door of a neatly-dressed indian woman seem to settle that question the three man have go half-way across the narrow clearing before the man look up from he work see they instantly he face blanch with a quick step backward he reach for a rifle that stand by the door then the arm fall limp by he side well you have come he say in a lifeless tone i could have kill you one or two of you but i will not i may be a thief but not a murderer besides there be probably more of you back there in the tree on the contrary smile the major we be only three we be not arm so you see you might easily kill we all but why you should want to and why you expect we when the last thing we think to do be to land in you wheat-field last night be more than i can guess land the man 's face show he bewilderment i know exclaimed bruce impulsively i 'll explain you be timmie -- timmie -- he hesitate well anyway that be you first name i know all about you -- again the man 's tremble hand half-reached for the rifle then -- then you have -- come for I he choke bruce realize he mistake hasten to correct it you be mistaken he say quickly we have not come for you in the way you mean you will not need to go a step with we unless that be you wish timmie we be here to help you to tell you that you be forgive long ago be -- be that true the man falter the log company the partner be dead they only heir la vaune forgive you and the province the red rider the province forget the case year ago thank -- thank god the man choke then turn to hide he face he face they again in a moment and speak steadily i have get the money here in the cabin every cent of it god know i do not mean to do it but the temptation be too great and -- and once i have do it i be afraid to go back i would have die in prison how do you come be you go back will you take the money to the little girl la vaune we be go farther smile bruce happy in the realization of what all this mean to the maid in the camp we be go on we fly here and will fly back -- or try to and we 'll be more than glad to return the money he wish to add but remember that he would not have that to decide he end la vaune be no little girl now but quite a young lady she need the money too and -- and he laugh sheepishly she be rather a good friend of mine timmie draw he hand across he eye as if to brush away the vision of long year then with a smile he say briskly : of course you 'll have breakfast we be have hot-cake what do i tell you chuckle the major slapping barney on the back eager as the visitor be to hear the strange story of this man of the wilderness they be willing that breakfast should come first as they step upon the porch the keen eye of the major fall on some white and spotted skin hang over a beam a close observer might have notice a slight nod of he head as if he say i think so but the boy be follow the scent of brown griddle-cake and see neither the skin nor the major 's nod but barney miss a familiar pungent odor that should go with such a breakfast in a wilderness hurry back to the plane to return with a coffee pot and a sack of coffee within the cabin they find everything scrupulously clean strange cooking utensil of copper and stone catch they eye while the translucent window-pane puzzle they but all this be forget when they sit down to a polished table of white wood and attack a towering stack of cake which vie with cup of coffee in send a column of steam toward the rafter with memory stir by draught of long untasted coffee it be not difficult for timmie to tell he story when i leave the settlement he begin as he turn he mooseskin hammock-like chair toward the open fireplace and invite he guest to do likewise i strike straight into the wilderness i have a little food a small rifle and fishing-tackle to I a summer in the wood with such equipment be no problem at all i mean to go northwest for perhaps two hundred mile camp there for the summer then work my way back by go southwest i would then be far from my crime and would be safe that be what i mean to do but once in the silent wood i begin to think of the wrong i have do i would have give world to be back but it be too late i have to keep go ford river creep through underbrush climb ridge cross swampy beaver-meadow fight the awful swarm of mosquito i get through the summer living on fish game and berry you see i have become terribly afraid of the red rider -- the mount police i have hear that sooner or later they always get a man i be determine they would not get I at last snow-fall warn I to prepare for winter i be in this valley that day and i have be here ever since if i have ever get any pleasure from that steal money which i have not i would have pay for that pleasure a hundred time that first winter fortune favor I in one thing : the caribou come by in great drove and before my ammunition be exhaust i have secure plenty of meat but at that i come near die before i learn that one who live upon a strictly meat diet must measure carefully the proportion of lean and fat someway i learn and somehow starve freezing half-mad of lonesomeness i get through the winter but i be glad you do not see I when the first wild goose come north if ever there be a wild man dress in skin and dancing in the sun it be i but the wheat ask barney how do that happen i be come to that smile he host early that spring he continue pass he hand across he forehead as if to brush away the memory of that terrible winter the indians come they come from the dismal lake region drive south by forest fire they be starve i have a little caribou meat and share it with they that make they my everlasting friend and you get the wheat from they interpose barney hardly i doubt if they have ever see a grain of wheat well we live together that summer but i be get ahead of my story shortly before they arrive i notice some strange-looking caribou in the clearing i have no ammunition so could not shoot they anyway they be skin-poor and would be of little use to I but they seem strangely tame come close to my cabin at night they be company and i be careful not to frighten they away one night in the moonlight i catch a glistening flash from the ear of the oldest doe then too i notice that one of they have unnaturally short antler a closer look tell I that these antler have be cut off then come the wonderful discovery : these be not caribou but reindeer escape from some herd in alaska right then i decide to capture and use they i would put they in pound until they rightful owner come for they which would be never he smile well i try make a lasso of caribou skin for a long time i could not come near enough to reach they with the lasso but one night while they rest i creep up to they and my lasso catch one by the antler then there be a battle and all the while i be think that now i should have milk butter and cheese meat and clothing and then there be a snap the skin-rope break and away go the reindeer -- and my hope i then hit on the plan of build a corral and drive they into it this be a pretty big job for one man but with tree line both side of a narrow run where the deer go to drink i manage to weave willow branch into the spruce tree and make a stout barrier well -- one morning i find myself with six reindeer in pound -- a bull three do a yearling and a old sled-deer not long after the herd be increase by four fawn by good luck just at this time the indians come they be all for kill the reindeer but i stop that we feed as i say before on my caribou meat and then come the wild-fowl and the stream open up for fishing it be fortunate that the indian come they help I to build corral big enough to give the reindeer plenty of pasturage and pretty soon they be fat and sleek pardon I interrupt the major but be some of the reindeer white two of they be milk-white and now i have many of they run free in the forest barney grin and bruce poke he in the rib my ghost he whisper the wheat say the host be no great mystery after all the bank cashier have put into the money-sack two sample of wheat and one of bean which he want to have try in this north country i have try they with what luck you can see i do not need to fence my reindeer now for in winter when the moss be bury deep under the snow i turn they in on stack of wheat hay finally when the indian go back north the follow winter they leave I a wife as you see he smile toward he dusky mate who be industriously scour a copper griddle there be silence for some time then the major speak : the thing that interest I be how you manage to keep up you standard of neatness and cleanliness it be not so hard say timmie i come of a good old scotch family when i be a boy my mother teach I that ` cleanliness be next to godliness ' and i make up my mind that -- well that i would at least be clean that be all there be leave for I to be you know i think you may call yourself both say the major stoutly you have pay well for you mistake by twelve year of exile and as for the money we 'll take that back with we timmie smile i 'll be happy for the first time in twelve year when it be go he say i say major exclaimed bruce i have be think of those white reindeer do not you suppose that solve the problem of peary 's white reindeer there be a peculiar twinkle in the major 's eye as he ask : how do you make that out well there have be reindeer in alaska for twenty-five year when peary discover he on the eastern coast of we continent there be many white one among the domestic herd and they be constantly wander away or be drive away by pack of wolf if they wander this far might they not easily have go on to the other side of the continent possibly possibly the twinkle in the major 's eye grow brighter but he say no more presently he rise and step outside say exclaimed barney i feel like turn right around and go back bruce know that he be think of la vaune 's money but we can not he sigh it be not we plane nor we expedition we be bind by agreement to go on besides there be no real need of go back la vaune 's all right for the winter i arrange for she at my old college at brandon she will attend the academy and help in the dining-room well then say barney i guess it be we for union-all and at those engine they be soon at they task but as bruce work that day he think often of the mysterious twinkle he have see in the major 's gray eye as he speak of the white reindeer who be this major anyway and where be they go the major alone could tell and apparently he have no intention of do so chapter iii in the midst of the pack i think say the major on the third morning after they strange landing that we would make a great mistake to set out again at this time we be not likely to have the luck of we last landing a second time then too if we remain here until the lake and river be freeze over we can find a safe landing place every few mile and now the major continued stir the fire thoughtfully now i think it would be right that i tell you something of the purpose of this journey the boy lean forward eager for the story even now he say slowly i do not feel like confide to you what i may consider my great secret plan -- plan for which this journey be but a trial-trip into the frozen north that may follow in good time but as for this present journey you be perhaps aware that a illegal wireless station have be operate somewhere in these wood and hill yes -- yes we see the offer of reward exclaim barney the reward be a small matter smile the major should we be so fortunate as to capture the culprit or be able to certify to he death i will gladly turn over the reward to you boy thanks say barney who already have he share of the prize in he purse first i shall tell you the purpose of that wireless and why it be so important to locate it the major go on it be one of the link in a chain around the world -- a chain that threaten to bind civilization to a burning stake of sedition anarchy and bloodsh the operator be a anarchist or at least belong to a ally organization and these one and all have for they purpose the destruction of the present order of thing now there be not one of we but believe that there be many evil possible -- yes and put in operation under the present order but we do not believe that matter be go to be better by a world-revolution we believe that in time justice will come very much nearer be do under the old system therefore we be fight to maintain it that be why i volunteer to attempt to hunt out and if possible destroy this powerful wireless station which be relay revolutionary message direct from russium to all important point in north america my long experience in the north seem to fit I for that task and it be a task that i be determine to accomplish it be my theory that this wireless be located on the shore of great bear lake in fact i believe it be run by a independent trader operating at the east end of that lake on conjurer 's bay a year ago he bring in a small electric plant to light he trading post he say now this plant be capable of produce a almost unlimited amount of electrical power provide only time be give battery of great power might easily be produce on the spot chemical for produce acid be find in abundance so also be copper and zinc for the plate all he would have to do then would be to make wooden box for the chemical erect he wire -- he could string they from spruce pole -- and the thing be do it be impossible to reach the station by water after i have guess its location and there be of course the possibility that i be wrong that it be nearer civilization in that case i might be able to locate it provide i make the trip by plane that explain why we circle three time during we first day 's flight you be look -- for the wireless tower smile the major and now he go on i think we will just rest easy on we wing for a few week you will get the engine in shape take a few trial flight if you wish but be careful to conserve gasoline we must have enough to carry we to great bear lake there we will find a sufficient supply to carry we on any other journey we may decide on the trader use gasoline to run he electric plant and will have a supply it will not be of very high test but with two engine i think we will make it answer we purpose if we find that my theory regard the location of the tower be not correct we will buy a supply from he and if it _ be _ correct -- he do not finish but smile and poke the fire again take it all in all say barney to bruce some time later i think we trip promise to be dangerous enough to satisfy even a bloodthirsty young savage from the canadian army or a young cherokee from the wild of boston common laugh bruce heave a wrench in the general direction of he companion but though they go about they work in a playful mood they do it with great care after they have take the two little timmy for several ride they declare the airship quite ready for further voyaging and as for gasoline say bruce we still have two hundred and forty gallon in the tank which will give we a-plenty for the trip and several hour to spare but come back -- that be another matter barney realize that this be indeed another matter and though he share the major 's hope of secure a supply at the trading station he face grow grave at thought of be strand more than a thousand mile from civilization at the beginning of winter and with only a few day ' supply of provision what if this trading station be one of those myth that float down from the north or what if it have be abandon barney shake himself free from these thought and seize he mandolin go to join bruce and timmie on saxophone and rudely-devised indian kettledrum in a wild-woods symphony while the child dance wild step the boy have never see \* \* \* \* \* well we be off barney say this as he buckle on he harness and touch the start lever the wheel of the start gear bump over the thin-crusted snow and jolt through timmie 's wheat stubble then the great bird begin to rise winter have set in now they glide over dark forest of spruce and now sweep above great stretch of barren land the air be bite cold they be thankful enough for they face-protector they electric hand and foot warmer they fur-lined leather union-all but best of all be the glorious freedom of it soar on and on over untrodden wilderness with no thought of danger know and unknown make they feel like explorer of a new world the engine work in perfect harmony a gentle breeze from the south urge they on they way the sun soon set and a long night begin but what of that the moon and snow light the earth as if by day and with a silvery glory and now the northern light begin to flicker flash and shoot across the sky now they pass over a wide expanse of white which they know to be dismal lake this be freeze over then surely great bear lake two hundred mile farther north would be freeze too they safe landing would be assure but as they near they goal the boy ' mind could scarcely escape misgiving if the major 's supposition be correct if indeed this trader be the hire agent of a fanatical clan would he not be arm and on the alert would he not perhaps have indian and half-breed hire to help guard he secret they be but three the enemy might number a score as barney thought of all this he be thankful for one thing : by some strange chance a small machine-gun and two thousand round of ammunition have be ship north with the plane they first thought have be to leave this behind but after a discussion they have decide to bring it and there it be now hang in its swivel before he in a emergency there remain but to load it and go into action but it be quite a unexpected emergency that soon make he bless that bit of equipment they be now well into the arctic the air cut like a knife and chill they to the marrow barney begin to long for warmth food and sleep he hold he electric glove to the glass of the small clock before he when the frost have thaw he note the hour twelve o'clock midnight he mutter and no landing in sight yet there remain but to carry on but what be this far to the north there show a small red ball of light and it be not the aurora boreali they be travel fast the ball of fire seem to roll toward they along the earth at terrific speed grow larger and more lurid and now beside it waft from it like the tail to a comet they could discern a swirl cloud black in the moonlight it be a fire bruce gasp through he mouthpiece but what -- begin barney just at that moment he catch the faint white line that mark the shore of great bear lake they be then near they destination tilt the plane upward that they might get a better panorama of the region and so direct they course barney give the great engine more gas on they sweep presently the outline of bay and frozen stream of scrub forest and barren land be plainly visible a map under glass be just before he brushing the frost from it barney examine it by the light of a small electric bulb then he look away at the fire which be now clearly visible he heart sink the trading post be indeed a reality or have be at the present moment it be a ball of fire it be the trading post he bark to the major ` fraid so grumble the major hoarsely and the gasoline for we return -- there it go sing bruce with a note of despair at that instant the whole ball of fire seem to rise in air to burst like some gigantic rocket there be no question in the boy ' mind but that the supply of gasoline have be reach by the flame after the great flash come blackness the fire seem for a time to have be extinguish gradually here and there far below bit of burn tinder gleam fiery star in a inverted heaven soon the ruin be again blaze they soar close but high avoid the dangerous pocket of smoke gas do they see dark figure dance about the ruin or be it merely the flicker shadow of post and tree stump indian murmur barney instantly he mind mirror to he picture he have see in history of paint savage burn a settler 's cabin he blood run cold here they be three man in the frozen wilderness with little gasoline for they machine with scant provision and ammunition and rush toward peril they could not even guess to kill and to escape would both be easy for these desperado go along down the lake and back again use as little gas as possible but keep in the air we better not land at present the very steadiness of the major 's tone tell barney that this experienced man of the north expect the worst as they rush down the white expanse many thought race through barney 's mind it seem that hunger and cold grow upon he with every whirl of the engine-shaft he think of bruce and la vaune would they ever return to la vaune with the money which be rightfully hers and timmie would they ever be able to help he blot the stain from he name barney 's friend dave tower who have go north in a submarine on a mission as mysterious as they own would they ever meet they have now turn and be make they way slowly back the fire have burn down to a dull red glow the forest about have escape the flame and this be fortunate should the indian leave they unmolested they might possibly find a means of sustain life by hunting and trapping when we get to the bay might as well land grumble the major it be mighty tough up here barney assure he that it certainly be tough he be glad they be to land be very sure that if a indian do shoot he he would not feel it so thoroughly benumb be he with cold then suddenly he give a cry of surprise they be near a point where conjurer 's bay should appear instead of the bay he see what appear to be merely a broad shoulder of frozen water and beyond that perhaps two mile be a small lake line by the forest it be on the edge of this small lake that the fire smoulder the boy rub he eye then look again have the cold benumb he sens be he see thing be he asleep and dream apparently not for from bruce through the receiver come a groan then what be happen the whole shape of the lake have change within a hour barney shut off the engine in the welcome silence which follow as they drift downward in a slow spiral not a man speak they eye be focus upon the earth but now there come to they ear a sound like the distant rush of many water this grow rapidly louder and finally divide itself into rattle and snap sound presently the major let out a roar of laughter caribou he explode they pass south from the barren land in herd of hundred of thousand so thick they look like land tip she nose up for another circle see there be the end of the herd away there in the distance we 'll be able to land where they have pass in fifteen minute a ideal landing-place -- tramp hard with a grin barney obey order and as he engine begin to revolve feel himself shooting skyward now it be clear roar the major barney do not respond on the instant he be think of something he have read about the camp-follower of the barren-ground caribou a chill not of the wind and cold creep into he heart but what be to be do he feel that another hour aloft would so benumb he sens that a crash would be inevitable to land at a point other than that trample by the caribou involve great risk for there be undoubtedly a thick coating of drift snow on the lake 's surface so he stop the engine and they spiral once more toward the earth now they be near the surface of the lake the distance be a thousand foot now eight hundred do he see shadow flit across the ice at five hundred foot he be sure that he do he say nothing so intent on landing be he that no risk seem too great at three hundred foot he see they distinctly -- gray streak scoot across the trodden snow or rest on haunch they shadow stretch before they great scott he mutter must be hundred of they oh well they be coward he tilted the machine for the final glide there come a sudden exclamation from the major then from bruce they too have see it be too late now for they landing wheel be almost touch the surface as they glide on and now strangely enough some of the gray streak begin to chase the plane as if imagine it a bird with flesh to eat and bone to gnaw they come on then all at once barney realize what they follow -- the scent of fresh meat timmie have kill a reindeer in honor of they departure and have present they with a hind-quarter this be now rope on the fuselage behind the major they would have a fight he know that now he think of they weapon -- two rifle they be almost useless against five hundred gaunt hungry wolf and they be gaunt he could see that as he fly by they evidently camp-following this year have not give they a over-abundant supply of food the season 's calf be fleet and strong by now and every herd have its thousand of antlered bull that form bristle hedge to defend they own bump the plane strike the ice and bound then strike again barney 's mind be now work fast yes there be other weapon -- the oxy-acetylene torch -- yes the machine-gun he shout to bruce to get the torch and as soon as the plane slow down free he hand from he glove and begin fumble at the gun before he the major be unstrapp the two rifle the wolf-pack be crowd around in a grin circle barney catch he breath as he eye sweep the circle five hundred if one dripping-jawed red-eyed gray creatures-of-prey they wait as ever for the coward 's chance to fight with great odds in they favor do not shoot until force to say bruce turn to the major if you do you may bring the whole pack down upon we in this emergency bruce take the lead and assuredly that be the wise plan for rear as he have be in the forest and plain of the northland he know wolf just now he be drag from they hiding-place in the fuselage two iron tube perhaps eighteen inch long and six in diameter one tube contain oxygen the other acetylene gas the tube be connect by a set of register valve to these in turn be fasten a wire-wound rubber hose with a long brass nozzle once the valve be turn the acetylene gas force out by a pressure of a thousand pound and unite with oxygen as a accelerator would produce a shooting flame that burn metal as if they be sun-dried pulp the machine stop and the pack crowd in with a electric flash lamp in one hand and the rubber hose in the other bruce stand watch with ache clumsy finger and bleared eye barney work on the machine-gun that with oil fairly freeze in its part seem about to refuse to respond hurry exclaim bruce as a gaunt form with patch of brown and double nose tell of mixed blood spring forward eager to drag the fresh meat from the fuselage instead of firing the major beat the beast over the head and with a snarl he resume he place in the ever-narrowing circle and now the time for concerted action on the part of the pack seem to have come for with one savage snarl the first row rush straight on there come a flash then the hiss of a white-tongued fiery serpent as the first wolf rear on he haunch the smell of burn hair and roast flesh halt the half-maddened pack and fall over one another again they retreat it be a tense moment slapping he hand to warm they barney adjusted cartridge and sweep the circle with a imaginary volley what if the machine-gun jam there could be but one result the torch would not long hold the beast off besides the gas would not last well shoot if you can exclaim bruce this gas be precious stuff we can not waste it at that there come the staccato music of the machine-gun with steady eye barney sweep the inner circle they go down like grain before a gale with strange wild snarl they bit at they wound at one another at the snow the gun sweep again with its merciless fire the furthermost member of the pack begin to slink away then as barney raise he gun and send a rain of bullet patter about they the whole snarl pack flee in yelp confusion the battle be win bruce cut off the gas barney cease he fire the major loose he harness stand up and stretch himself then they look at one another and laugh some fight exclaim barney some fight agree bruce some fight reechoe the major and the next thing be to put the injure out of they misery after that we must skin 'em and make a cache for the meat meat the boy question sure smile the major wolf meat be not bad at all you perhaps forget that we have not a hundred mile of gas in the tank we may be here quite some time chapter iv a modern battle with criminal when dave tower barney menter 's one-time pal receive the letter suggest a bit of jazz somewhere within the arctic circle he be on twelve-hour shore leave they be to start on that mysterious subsea journey at high-tide next day he grin as he show the note to ensign blake he commander then he go around the corner and purchase a second-hand guitar and a oboe look he exclaim point to a pair of battered kettledrum in the corner there be the original pair -- make by the adam and eve of the south sea island or wherever kettledrum originate i 'll buy 'em and teach some gob to drum we 'll have a whole band when we arrive a few hour later find they aboard the snug shapely hull of u boat n 12 of the usa submarine fleet the sub be a small one pattern after the most recent british model know as the k class fleet as a flying-fish she make twenty-two knot on the surface and ten knot when submerge she present a rather odd appearance have a short square funnel which be swing over into a recess in the deck when the craft submerge she gun and torpedo have be remove the weight of those have be replace by a additional supply of oil and by quantity of provision the provision together with bale of skin clothing be pack into every available space she make splendid progress as she leave the harbor and wind she way in and out among the island of puget sound to emerge finally round cape flattery and strike away into the open sea it become evident at once that this be no coastwise journey further than that not even ensign blake know its purpose the sub be register at the navy-yard as off on detach duty the crew of ten man be all volunteer for the trip the expedition be under the direction of a doctor a man past middle age he sit in a wicker chair below smoking innumerable cigar and say nothing far be i can dope it out blake say to dave the old fellow do some good service for the government during the war he be have plenty of experience in the north have some theory he want to work out about sub and the arctic the government have some little trick they want pull off up in that north country the doctor volunteer to lead the expedition and here we be but what do you suppose -- do not suppose a thing say blake gaze astern at the last fading bit of land there be a lot of thing that might be but like as not none of my guess be correct let 's hear you guess well first you know uncle sam have some valuable seal island in the aleutian group maybe during the war the jap or russian have get careless about drift around that way and carry off a few hundred skin might be you know but i be not say that be it a sub would be a mighty fine craft for watch that sort of game though and then there be another thing i have think of there be gold in russium on the kamchatkan peninsula you know that do not you no dave open he eye wide in surprise heap of it ton and ton just wait for the digging and before we go into the war when russium be still with the ally and need money we government or independent capitalist i do not know which furnish the russian a lot of machinery for mine the gold about a million dollar ' worth i guess then come the revolution in russium i doubt if a cent have be realize from the sale of machinery who be in possession of that peninsula at the present time god alone know japan would like to meddle there i be sure perhaps we be be send up there to conduct a investigation those be my two guess take 'em for what they be worth you do not think say dave that we would attempt the pole the ensign be silent for a time no he say at last i do not of course stefansson have say that a ` sub ' be the most practical way to go there that ice-floe be never more than ten foot thick and twenty-five mile wide and all that but there be too many unsettled problem relate to such a trip but say exclaim dave who be this doctor of ours anyway blame if i know say blake as he turn away to go below well anyhow dave remark whoever he be he be go to take we where the white ice-floe be drift look at the color of this craft blue-white like the ice itself the journey north save for a storm which they avoid by submerge be uneventful until they find themselves in the company of scatter ice-cake with the snow-capped ridge of the aleutian island loom up before they in no time at all every man on the craft realize that on these island be to be find one of the object of they quest for once they have sight the shore the funnel be drop electric power apply and watcher dress in white to match the color of the craft set to scan the shore for sign of life they steal through the water like some ghost craft believe it be that seal-fishery business ask dave as he and the ensign take they watch no dave be certain from the tone that the doctor have confide he secret to the ensign he ask no more question so they drift on the wind have drop the swell roll they craft as it plow along here and there a sea-lion thrust its ugly head from the water twice a seal attempt to climb upon the slippery hull for a rest but to the amusement of the boy slide back into the water a offer to assist the third one be not appreciate and the ridiculously human-like head disappear beneath the water with great alacrity dave have be search the hill with he binoculars for some time when he suddenly give the glass to the ensign what be that tangle above the cliff there he ask the ensign study the cliff for some time then he touch a button with he foot and they turn silently shoreward that be it he say with a air of finality what ask dave eagerly the wireless then the ensign explain to dave the purpose of they journey they have be send into the arctic to locate a wireless station suppose to be place in the aleutian island a station run by radical propagandist part of a world-federation which propose to wreck all organize society have dave realize that the mission of sub and airplane be alike he would have be startle as it be he face take on a tense expectant look he cheek burn hot with excitement the doctor be call to the conning-tower after study the contour of the island for some time he say : they shack build of rock and driftwood log be at the base of the cliff that be good we will divide into two party four of we will go up the cliff and get above they while four other will skirt the cliff and under cover await my signal we support party will take rope rifle and a machine-gun i will go with the party to the top of the cliff we will carry only rifle and some special instrument of attack which i have store in canvas sack below two man must remain on board head in close to those rock before we they be out of sight of the shack and there be ice strand there -- a straggler will scarcely tell we craft from it i have no doubt there be a number of they and that they be hardy ruffian we must proceed with great care hark he put he hand to he ear they be send message now in the future continue the doctor as he hand dave two strange-looking sphere the size of a man 's head the work of sheriff policeman and other officer of the law be not go to be quite so hazardous when a criminal run amuck he will not kill a half-score of brave man before he be capture the officer of the law will do what we will soon be do and a child can do the rest only he continue watch you step go up that hill it do not take much of a bump to get one of these funny little ball excite dave have be detail to assist the doctor ensign blake would lead the support party around the cliff there to await the doctor 's signal besides the sack in which dave carry the large sphere there be another carry by a seaman this one give forth a metallic clinking as if it be full of iron egg with the doctor and the other seaman carry two rifle each the four man make they way slowly around the rocky hillside and be soon advance silently single-file up the surface of one of those perpetual snow-bank for which the island be note the rock above be much larger than they have seem from the sub twice as he climb over they dave 's foot slip and each time he heart be in he mouth one stumble misstep and all might be over for he but he have the clear cool head of a clean boy who have live right and a appreciation of the joy of living which would take he far and keep he safe through many a adventure so safely they reach the top of the cliff the doctor motion dave to come back with he to a box-like edge of rock which would give they a view of what lay some three hundred foot below all be still the moon a great yellow ball float in the sky above and in the sea beneath a lone sea-gull awaken by the support party sail scream away not a move not a sound be to be detect below yet there in a rocky cavern be a number of world-criminal and behind some crag be three jacky and they commander soon all this would be change fight perhaps death would end the quiet of that arctic scene dave 's hand tremble with excitement as he arrange the two sack beside the doctor even the doctor 's hand shake as he open one sack and draw forth a number of small iron object the size and shape of a bicycle handle-bar grip he face grow stern understand mill 's grenade he ask yes all right when i say ` go ' drop ten of these as fast as you can release the pin drop 'em on they shack dave 's heart thump violently he have throw mill 's grenade at manikin enemy but never have he hurl they where human flesh be the target slowly mechanically he arrange the ten grenade in a row go the word sing in he ear ten seconds later from below come two sharp report -- he grenade and the doctor 's they be off together crash follow crash in quick succession until the row be finish silence follow for a single second then come the cry and curse of man as they stagger from they half-demolished shelter and begin to scatter dave 's heart thump there be fifteen at least now exclaim the doctor and lift one of the large sphere he drop it over the ledge 's edge just as that instance dave see one of the rascal raise he rifle and fire immediately there come a cry of distress dave think he recognize the voice and a lump rise in he throat but now there come a dull muffle explosion -- the strange bomb instantly the man below begin act like madman throw away they rifle they stagger about tear at they eye they throat they clothing and utter wild cry of distress at the same time three automatic pistol crack and dave know the doctor have give he signal to he surprise he see the three jacky emerge from hide wear gas mask quickly they overpower the wild man tie they and carry they around a point of land as they do this the doctor and he band keep guard above rifle ready for any man who might by some chance recover sufficiently from the gas to shoot but none do it will not do they the least bit of harm the doctor say as he notice the look of surprise on dave 's face it be only chlorpicrin -- a tear gas it come in liquid form so must be associate with a explosive which transform it into a gas and scatter it you will see that we man be carry they out of it as soon as they have they secure it be a safe and harmless way of handle criminal the war teach we that but the ensign exclaimed dave as he see the last ruffian in the hand of the jacky something must have happen to he say the doctor rise hastily there be a shot dave remind he together they hastily make they way down the rough hillside slip slide fall to rise again they come to the lower surface and hurry around the point where the prisoner have be carry a strange scene await they sixteen man lie in a row all tightly bind and what a motley crew they be -- jap russian mexican greek and even american they have gather here for a common purpose but it be doubtful if one of they could have tell what the next step would be should they first task be accomplish off to one side lay ensign blake white and still one of the seaman be bend over he get a ugly one in the chest he say simply think we can save he the doctor bent over and tear away blake 's garment make a thorough examination he 'll pull through he say but we must get he to the mission hospital at unalaska at once begin throw those rascal aboard there be a prison there for they accommodation at that moment the two other jacky appear carry a moan burden in the shape of a jap radical one 's do in for good the foremost man explain we search the ruin maybe we can save this fellow take he aboard say the doctor then turn he direct the man who carry they fall commander to the craft \* \* \* \* \* well that about end we present career in the arctic the doctor be speak to dave and emphasize he word with a sigh i have hope we might do something really big but blake will not be out again this season he 'll get around again all right but it be a slow process dave sit think suddenly he jump to he foot doctor he say eagerly there be a gob on board who be sure a wonder at navigation do not you think -- think he and i might manage the sub for you -- you trip h -- m the doctor grow thoughtful but a flash of hope gleam in he eye tell you what he say presently there be a considerable ice-floe between the island the north wind bring it down last night have you crew ready for a try-out in the morning with a heart that ache from pure joy of anticipation dave hurry to a ancient sealer 's bunk-house where he man be house a try-out try-out try-out keep ring in he ear what do it mean if they be successful something big wonderful he be sure russian gold chart northeast passage north pole he do not know but nothing seem too difficult for he daring young heart and the next day the try-out come and such a ordeal as it be gob have surely never be put to a test like that in any navy-yard training station for five long hour they dive and rise and dive again they rise suddenly rise slowly they tip glide shoot through the water they pass for mile beneath the ice-floe to emerge at last and bump a cake or lift themselves toward a dark spot not larger than the sub itself -- a patch of open water in the midst of the floe with mind all in a whirl dave give the final command to make for port it have be a great day that night after chow the doctor call dave into he room at the hospital young man he say motion the boy to a seat you and you crew have surprise I beyond belief i feel that we shall be risk little in attempt what to many might seem the most difficult task ever undertake by a submarine i do not yet feel free to tell you what that trip will be you 'll have to take that on faith i can only tell you that we will proceed from here directly to nome alaska there we will get more oil and provision we will then sail through behring strait due north for a time the two sit in silence the doctor 's face grow mellow then sad at recollection of year that have go i do not mind tell you he say after awhile that i be a explorer you almost might say ` by profession ' that some year ago another explorer and i seek the same goal we go from different point both claim to have reach it but he get the honor and you really reach -- do not matter now what i do in the past interrupted the doctor quickly what i be to do in the future be all that count and the immediate future be big with possibility the crew will be with you to a man dave assure he as he rise to go as he step into the cool night air dave find that he face be hot with excitement there be leave in he mind not one doubt as to they final destination : it be to be a try for the pole only one think saddened he that he good friend blake would not continue as one of the party two day later they cross over to the island of the illicit wireless station they find the apparatus in perfect condition and the doctor at once begin send message i be let the world know of we purpose he explain at least try to send message by code to a friend of mine in chicago hope seattle will pick it up and if not perhaps that radical operator who be suppose to be relay message to canada and the state from the north-central portion of the continent will catch it and think it one of he own message in a new code pass it on have the doctor know what kind of radical be in control of the station on great bear lake at that moment perhaps he would have be more careful what message he send if you do not mind say dave for the sake of my friend and especially of my mother i wish you would include my name in the message it be already do smile the doctor chapter v a infernal machine when bruce barney and the major find themselves strand on the shore of a vast frozen lake at the beginning of a arctic winter they at once take step to conserve all resource build a cache between three scrub spruce tree they pile upon it they wolf meat and skin to barney the thought of eat dog meat as he call it be most repulsive but necessity give man little choice in the arctic so he munch he roast wolf 's back that night in silence but at the same time he vow that sure as the caribou have not all pass he would dine on caribou roast before long once the cache be complete they begin scout the wood near the ruin of the burned trading station there they find plain sign of indian a circle of beaten track make certain a pow-wow have be hold there do not look very good to I admit the major these indian of the little stick be a fierce and cruel people full of superstition and live up to the old law of ` blood revenge ' there be only one thing in we favor : they have a superstition about a giant creature know as the thunder-bird the story of this terrible bird be know to almost all indian tribe but the little stick believe they literally from the track i should judge that they leave in great haste what could cause this fright save the sound and sight of we plane hover over they since it be almost certain that they have never see a airplane it seem likely that they consider it to be old thunder-bird come to carry they off if that be true i shall not look for they back in a hurry what puzzle I be where 's the remains of the fellow 's generator and wireless say barney do not see anything down there in the ruin do you instantly all eye be turn toward the smoulder pile of ash the place be wire all right say the major point to a mass of tangled lighting wire say what be that out in the center exclaim barney look like the bone of a man so it do say the major and surely be well there can not be any further doubt about the rascal be burn in the ruin of he own house then there come a shout from barney he have be trace out the mass of blacken wire look he exclaim here 's where the lead-wire go into the ground must be a separate power-house three lead-wire instead of two what do you suppose that mean he clip the soft wire off with he heavy knife and bent they apart to avoid short circuit then closely follow by the other go plow away through the snow to search out the point where the wire leave the ground they trace they through the scrub timber and almost at once come upon a strange frame-like structure end in a tall pole and have at its center a house build of log the whole affair be quite invisible outside the timber it be he wireless station breathe the major no further doubt remain he step to the door and find himself gaze into a well-arranged room -- electric generator storage battery in row and instrument of every description along the wall and the floor but what catch bruce 's eye be two row of ten-gallon can pile in the rear with a cry of joy he spring toward they but he joyful look change to a anxious one as he lift can after can and find it empty only one contain gasoline and that be but half-full not enough to give we thunder-bird a drink he groan disgustedly well at any rate say the major we have find a place that will not make a bad shelter from arctic blizzard i suggest that we bring the plane up to the edge of the wood nearest this point and camp here what be that exclaim bruce in a startled whisper as he detect some noise outside he push the door open fearlessly then laugh there stand a dog not a bad find say the major he may be a lot of help to we and look there be four other they be the trader 's dog run away when the place burn i have not a doubt barney run and get some wolf meat we 'll have a team at once and we 'll need it can not move the plane without it they be soon on good term with the strange dog the major who appear to know all there be to know about arctic life fashion some eskimo style harness from wolfskin and before many hour they have they plane by the edge of the wood and be settle in they new home that night after they have enjoy reindeer steak as a special treat the major rather playfully put the receive piece of the wireless over he head and click the machine almost instantly he exclaim : jove i be get something give I a note-book and pencil for fifteen minute he scratch strange dot and dash across innumerable page at last he pause and remove the receiver guess that be about all for this time let 's see what we have get three head bent over the message but after hour of study the only conclusion they could come to be that the message have be send in a secret code which they might never be able to decipher well say the major with a sigh station 's close for to-night tell the gentleman to call again in the morning at that he creep into he sleeping-bag and be soon snore the two boy gladly follow he example barney make the first announcement in the morning he be go caribou hunting he have have quite enough dog meat bruce offer to go with he but on second thought decide to try fishing through the ice barney be soon lose in the wilderness of scrub spruce but though he hunt far he find no fresh caribou track it be on he return trip that he receive the first surprise of the day the wind be blow fine snow along the surface and he find he out-going trail half-buried then suddenly he come upon strange footprint the person apparently have be go north but upon see the white boy 's track he have turn and retreat the track be fresh and have be make by a heelless skin-shoe indian barney gasp even as he speak he catch the gleam of a camp-fire through the tree then another and another without a moment 's delay barney start for the camp two mile away he have reach the open space where the trading station have stand have nearly cross it when out of the edge of the ruin there rise the form of a man not a indian but a white man barney 's first thought be that it be bruce or the major he second look bring action he drop flat behind some fire-blackened debris the man wear a tomato-colored mackinaw such as be not to be find in they outfit whoever he be he back be turn and he have not see the boy creep a little forward barney peer around the pile what he see set the cold chill chase up he back the man have tear two of the lead-wire from the frosted earth slowly he place they point together in that instant the boy understand he know now the reason for the three wire lead to the power-house two be for carry light to the building if the third one be connect with the right one of the lighting-wire a infernal-machine would be set go and the power-house with all in it would be blow to atom and at this moment bruce and the major be there the man whoever he be have since the wire be break find it necessary to test the pair out he first trial have be wrong he be bend over for a second try when something strike he bowl he over like a ten-pin it be barney the man be heavier than barney and evidently older he be fit too one thing barney have notice -- the gleam of a automatic in the man 's hip-pocket in he sudden attack he have manage to drag this out and drop it upon the snow the struggle which follow be furious hold be lose and win blood fleck the snow arm be wrench and face bruise slowly steadily barney feel he strength leave he at last with a glide grip the man 's hand reach he throat it be all over now barney 's sens reel as the grip tighten he lung burn he head seem burst he be about to lose consciousness when through he mind there flash picture of bruce and the major he must he must with one last heroic effort he throw the man half from he then faintly far distant there seem to echo a shot a single shot then all sensation leave he when the boy feel himself come back to consciousness he hardly know whether he be still in the land of the living he dare not move or open he eye where be he what of the stranger the major and bruce have they be blow into eternity again and again these problem whirl through he dizzy mind then all at once he hear a voice i think he be come ` round someone very far off be say it be the gruff voice of the major barney open he eye to find he companion bend over he what happen he ask weakly he eye search they face that be what we would like to know answer bruce we hear a shot and hurry out here find you unconscious beside a dead man dead barney sit up dizzily sure be do you shoot he shoot -- i shoot -- the boy try to steady he whirling brain no i do not shoot he gradually the world cease whirling about he and he be able to think clearly then together they piece out the story barney tell what have happen and you may be very sure it be a sober pair that listen well my boy say the major solemnly we owe we life to you there be no doubt about that as for he he add point to the dead man he must have roll upon the automatic when you make you last effort and accidentally discharge it he have a bullet-hole in the back of he head where a pin-prick would have kill he a case of pure providence i would call it let 's get out of here say barney showing sign of weakness i have have quite enough of it with a arm on either of he comrade ' shoulder he make he way back to the station where a bowl of hot reindeer broth completely revive he the next thing say bruce be to hunt out that infernal contraption which threaten we life it be a delicate and dangerous undertaking but little by little they trace out the wire and disconnect they at last they find it in a small box which have be skillfully fit into a beam innocent look little thing say bruce hold it up for inspection to-morrow i be go to take it out to the lake hook it up with a couple of battery and see if it be get any kick after a hearty meal the three resume they previous evening 's occupation attempt to decipher the strangely code message here be a theory to try out say bruce a message be usually compose of nearly a equal number of word of one to three letter and of those have more than three these be likely to be use alternately if then you find two or three word of four or more letter it be likely to be a name the man whoever he be have sign only a code name but there may be more name in the body of the message look it over yes here be two word together of five letter each exclaim barney think of name you know that be spell with five letter say bruce excitedly instantly there come into barney 's mind the name of he former pal there be dave tower he say he would sign it david of course just fit exclaimed bruce more excited than ever and by all that be canadian the first and last letter of the first name be the same just as they be here i believe we be on the right track but what would he pal have to do with it ask the astonished major he go north about the time we start barney dance over the floor in he excitement while the boy be too excite to do further decipher the major 's cooler brain be busy soon he rise and begin pacing rapidly back and forth across the room he face wear anything but a pleased expression and he limp be greatly increase by he irritation do you get it ask barney i should say i do exclaim the major right in the neck and to think he sputter here we be without gasoline to carry we a hundred mile and he start with everything in he favor if we just have gas for three hundred mile there 's plenty on the schooner gussie brown i call nome yesterday and find that out but they can not bring it to we and we can not go to they we be stick stuck right here and he be start to-morrow the boy stare in speechless amazement as the major drop into a chair cover he face with he hand it be many minute before he be calm enough to tell they the simple truth of the matter which be of course that the wireless message be that one send by the doctor on the aleutian island tell of he intended journey northward also that this same doctor be a hate rival explorer whom he have beat a few year before that he have not intend go north at this time but this action of he rival make it imperative that he do so now finally that the trading gasoline schooner gussie brown be freeze in the ice three hundred mile north of conjurer 's bay and great bear lake and have a ample supply of gasoline but after all i guess we be beat say the major wearily if we succeed in get out of this scrape alive we 'll be fortunate cheer up the worst be yet to come smile barney let 's turn in two interesting problem await the party in the morning be the man who have be accidentally shoot the night before the anarchist trader if so who be the person whose bone lay in the ruin be the infernal-machine a genuine affair and if so would it explode while the major be still brooding over he disappointment the boy be so eager for these investigation that they quite forget the affair of the wireless message the identity of the dead man be soon establish by papers find in he pocket he be the trader the skull find in the ruin be unmistakably that of a indian a break in this skull show that the person have die a violent death and have not be catch by the fire the conclusion the boy arrive at be that the trader have kill the indian and have flee to the wood the indian in revenge have burn he trading station that he have intend to destroy the explorer be beyond question he have therefore meet a well-deserved fate he body be bury eskimo-style on top of the ground with stone pile over it to protect it from wolf when this work have be complete the two boy take the infernal-machine down to the frozen surface of the lake where there could be no danger from a explosion and connect it with wire which they lay along the surface from the steep snow-buried shore must be twenty foot of snow in there exclaim bruce as for the third time he lose he footing and slide to the bottom of the slope presently they be well behind the ridge in the forest and out of range of any fly splinter of machine or ice i feel as i use to when i be a schoolboy and hide with the rest of the gang out in the wood and shoot off charge of gunpowder in a gas-pipe bomb grin barney as he screw one wire to a post of a battery now we 'll -- he exclaim breathlessly he last word be lose in the roar of a tremendous explosion the shore of the bay take up the sound and send it echo and reecho through the forest fine bit of ice come rattle down through the tree while a great cloud of smoke and mist float lazily over they head whew some explosion murmur barney bruce be silent he face be white what be up ask barney nothing i be all right bruce smile grimly i be only think what might have happen yesterday forget it grumble barney c'mon let 's see the ruin fish exclaimed bruce as they emerge from the forest and assuredly there be fish in abundance the thirty-foot wide pool from which the ice have be blow be white with they there be salmon salmon-trout white-fish lake-trout flounder and other the boy do not know hundred and hundred of they stunned by the explosion float on the surface only wait to be harvest we 'll have to work carefully say barney start forward the ice be pretty well shatter a plunge in that water and the temperature at thirty below would not be pleasant but i believe we can save every one of they get a pole he begin cut a large branch from a spruce tree bruce follow he example now barney exclaimed prepare to slide down the bank but he pause in surprise the snow-bank shatter by the blast have go tumble down to the surface of the lake and what be that protrude above what remain of the snow it be dark and v-shaped like the gable of a roof barney be for investigate at once but bruce be more practical the fish must be secure immediately this food might yet stand between they and starvation they be soon whipping the pool with they pole and as the fish come to the ice edge they gather they in some be monster two or three foot in length it be indeed a great haul they pile they on the ice like cord-wood already they be freezing they would remain fresh for month chapter vi the race be on and now for the lakeside secret exclaimed barney toss the last fish upon the pile and throw he frosty pole aside eagerly bruce spring to he foot together they race around the pool clamber over the tumbled avalanche of snow they be soon within sight of the strange triangle barney 's heart beat fast what be it could it be only a bit of bent timber lodge there on the log-roof of a long-abandoned indian shack or be it -- be it what he know bruce hope it might be -- a supply-house for gasoline or perhaps a motor-boat with a supply of gasoline on board excitedly they attack the pile of snow lack shovel they work with hand and foot hope grow with every kick and scoop this be no mere bit of timber nor yet a abandon shack it be too recently build to leave a doubt about that and now they have reach the top of the door i say we have find it pant bruce redouble he effort wait do not hope too much gasp barney toss aside snow like a dog burrow for a rabbit the door have a spring padlock on it barney hurry to the lake for some piece of ice crack the lock as he would a nut between stone then prying the door open a bit at the top he try to peer in dark he mutter can not see a thing breathlessly they resume work and now the door be free to the very bottom it be bruce 's turn force the door open a foot he take one good look then let out a whoop gasoline he shout bedon of it may be empty suggest barney i 'll see say bruce a instant more and have crowd himself through the narrow space he strike a hundred-gallon steel bedon with he fist no hollow sound come from it full he exclaim and the strain over sink to the floor with a sigh of relief the more hardy barney begin to explore the place to the back be a small gasoline launch apparently in perfect condition range along the right wall be the bedon five of they all full but one and each contain a hundred gallon well say barney sit on a bedon and kick he heel against its steel side now we can take the major to the moon or any other do place he wish to go that be if we want to for a long time bruce be silent now that the excitement be over he realize he be homesick then too the danger of yesterday have shake he nerve he be think also of la vaune work she way through the academy when money much money belong to she lay idle and of timmie who await they return to assist he in the retrieving of he good name but there come the after-thought : have it not be for the major 's trust in he and in barney none of these thing would have be possible yes they owe a debt to the major and that debt must be pay and i guess we want to take he where he want to go say he straighten up as he look he friend in the eye good exclaimed barney i be go to leave it to you but i know you would do it it be the chance of we life i be sure he mean the pole -- the north pole think of it and then there be the reward guess we have better squeeze out of here and go break the glad news say bruce he be up there fairly eat he heart out the race be on muttered barney as they hurry up the bank the race be on echo the major a few minute later as he walk the floor in high glee yes sir it be say barney and a good clean race it will be if dave tower be skipper of that submarine i never know a squarer fellow the major limber up he wireless instrument send a message snap-snapping across the frozen expanse what you do ask barney just let that foxy old rival of mine know i get he message and that i be on the job chuckle the major i 'll get off other message every three hour for a time would you mind mention my name in the message ask barney you see i have get a date for a little jazz with dave up at the pole and i would like he to know i be plan to keep the appointment the major chuckle again and include this in he message : barney menter pilot the party at the aleutian station catch the major 's second send of the message the doctor 's face grow gray as he realize its meaning great providence he exclaim will he beat I again then strike the table with he fist he will not we be cripple by the loss of a important member of we party he have the swiftest conveyance but it be not the surest we will win we start to-morrow the race be on as for dave he be more than glad at the prospect of meeting barney at the pole he be confident that both expedition would succeed the only question in he optimistic young mind be which would arrive first if he try could decide it the sub would get there first he and barney have be chum since boyhood but they have be keen competitor in all they play study and work now they wit be once more fairly match it be the army and the navy he exclaim a fair square race and may the best one win i might say remark the doctor that there be a bountiful prize offer to the first person who next reach the pole and who bring back three witness who can make reading of latitude and longitude to testify to the fact should we win the prize will go to you and the crew i 'll go tell they say dave don he cap a moment later the doctor hear cheer which sound like : rah rah rah for doctor rah rah rah for the north pole the race be on she secret service day over for the present the sub have be give a coat of black paint now as she scud through the dark water of behr sea dave standing in the conning-tower thought how much she must resemble a whale during the war many a leviathan of the deep have meet death because he resemble a submarine now in peace time in this feeding ground of the greatest of all prey the table might be turn the submarine take for whale the race be on across behr sea they speed through foam-flecked wave and drive mist pause only a day at nome they push on past port clarence round cape prince of wale and enter boldly into the great unknown the arctic ocean a million wild fowl return to the southland shoot away over they head here and there they see little brown seal bob out of the water to stare at they once they run a race with a great white bear and again they sight a school of whale they give these a wide berth for should they grow friendly and mix they great flipper with the sub 's propeller trouble would follow walrus too be avoid for they have a playful habit of bump the under-surface of any craft they might chance to meet at last far to the north there appear a glaring white line they have reach the ice they day of merry sailing on the surface be well-nigh over from this time on life would be spend in stuffy steel-lined electric-lighted compartment but for all that it would not be so bad opening in the floe would offer they opportunity to rise for a breath of fresh air and danger seem few enough since the ocean everywhere be deep and ice-bergs sinking dangerously to a great depth below the surface be few only the pile of ice and great six-foot-thick pan would make a white roof to the ocean which be not without its advantage for here the water would always be delightfully calm shut off the engine drop the funnel close the hatch they sink quickly beneath the water 's surface and be soon pass below a marvelous panorama of light and shadow through the thick glass of the observation window there flood tint vary from pale-blue to ultramarine and deep purple no sunset could vie with the color scheme that kaleidoscop above they here a great pile of ancient ice give the whole a reddish tinge and here a broad pan of transparent new ice cast down the deep-blue of the sky and again a thicker floe admit a light as mellow as expert decorator could have devise it be wonderful murmur the doctor chapter vii a strange people ten hour after the start of the submarine dave tower 's eye anxiously watch the dial which indicate a rapidly lessen supply of oxygen while he keenly appraise mind measure time in term of oxygen supply they be still scud along beneath that continuous kaleidoscopic panorama of green and blue light and shadow but no one notice the beauty of it now all eye be strain on the plate-glass window above and they look but for one thing -- a spot black as night itself which would mean open water above there it be to starboard exclaim the doctor careful backing and steer to starboard bring merely the disclosure that the doctor 's eye-strain have develop to the point where it produce optical illusion the oxygen be all this time dwindle to avoid further waste of time dave tell he first mate to close he eye for three minute while he keep watch then to open they and spell he at the watch straight ahead quick mutter the mate as the dial hang flutter at zero seize a lever here and there watch this gauge then that one dave send the craft slant upward like some dark sea monster seek air the sub shot toward the opening and now -- now the prow tilted through space another lever and another and she balance for a second on the surface for a second only then come a crash too much eagerness too great haste have send the conning-tower against the solid six-foot floe with lip straight and white dave grasp two lever at once the craft shot backward there follow a sickening grind which could only tell of interference with the propeller too quick a reverse have send it against the ice astern shut off all power dave allow she to rise silently to the surface then as silently one member of the crew open the hatch and they all file out propeller 's still there breathe one of the gob in relief ` fraid that will not help say dave jarvi he say turn to the engineer go below and start she up at lowest speed in a moment there follow a jangling grind the engineer reappear as i fear sir he report it be the shaft sir she 'll have to go to shore for repair only a hot fire and heavy hammering can fix she can not be do on board or on the ice ashore dave rub he forehead pull he forelock and try to imagine which way land might be after ten hour of travel in the uncharted water of the great arctic sea i 'll leave it to you jarvi he smile if you can locate land and show we how to get there across these pile of ice with a disabled submarine you shall have a medal from the national geographic society the engineer be not a gob strictly speak he be a old english seaman who have often sail the arctic in a whaler now he go below with the word : i 'll find the nearest land right enough I lad but as to gittin ' there that be quite another matter thereafter the engineer might be see from time to time dash up the hatchway to take a observation then back to the chart-table where he examine first this chart then that one some of the chart be new just from the hand of the hydrographic bureau these belong to the craft other be soil and tear patch here and there or reinforce by cloth from a discard shirt these belong to jarvi himself have be with he on many a journey and be now most often consult near 's h ' i can make it sir he say at last we be some two hundred mile from point hope on the alaska shore and a bit farther from a point on the russian shore which the native call on-na-tak though what the place be like h ' i can not say never ` aving be there far 's h ' i know no white man 's be there h ` either leastwise not in we generation he study the chart and make one further observation : far 's h ' i can tell sir he smile on-na-tak 's h ` we only chance current set that way h ` at three knot a hour that mean we 'll drift there in four or five day there 'll be driftwood on the beach and with good luck we can fix ` er up there mayhap there be coal in the bank by the sea and that be greater luck for we if there be the doctor who have sit all this time in silence smoking he black cigar now rise and begin pacing the deck four or five day four or five do you say great creation that will mean the losing of the race jarvi nod he head h ` anything less would mean that and more say the old engineer go down with such a shaft would mean death to all of we the doctor sigh we can not help it i suppose -- but it be a cruel blow there be many a break in a long airplane voyage anywhere he console himself and i think the chance for accident in the arctic be about treble i do not wish we rival any fatal catastrophe but a little tough luck -- say a wing demolish or a engine burn out -- might not be so much to my displeasure the day that follow be spend in various way hunting seal and polar bear be something of a out-the-way pleasure for seafare man then there be checkers and card besides the daily guess as to they position at noon strangely enough for once in the history of arctic current they find themselves be carry where they want to go in a direct line for point on-na-tak and during the entire four day and a half there be hardly a point 's deviation from the course on the evening of the fourth day dave think he sight land and the midnight watch report definitely that there be land to the port bow two point one more easily discern than the other this news bring the whole crew on deck and for two hour there be wild speculation as to the nature of the country ahead of they the possibility of inhabitant and they treatment of stranger azazruk the eskimo think that he have hear from a old man of he tribe that the point be inhabit by a people who speak a different language from that speak by the chukch of east cape and whaling on the russian side of behr strait but of this he could not be sure if the old engineer know anything of these shore other than the fact he have already state concern wood and coal he do not venture to say and no one ask so they drift on until the bleak snow-capped peak show plainly morning reveal a bay lie between the two point toward the entrance to this bay they be drift one obstacle remain between they and land a half mile of the floe in which they be drift lay between they and the black stretch of open water which extend to the edge of the solid shore ice upon which the submarine might be drag and over which the shaft might be carry to land but how be that stretch of tumbled icefloe to be cross this indeed be a problem it be finally decide that dave and the old engineer should spend the forenoon explore the ice to landward for a possible narrow channel that would open a way to the water beyond for this journey they take only field-glasses alpine staff and a lunch in a sealskin sack have they known better the nature of the land they be about to visit they might have go more fully equip h ' i do not mind tell ' y ' lad that we be ` ead for this point way back some'er in the late ninety say the engineer but there come a nor ` wester a ' the cap ` in ' e lose ` be ` ead and turn to run we would freeze in for the winter but we have a see thing if we ` ad we have a see ` um they be struggle over some pressure ridge and neither have breath to spare for further talk just then but presently as they pause on a high ridge of ice for a survey of they surroundings jarvis say : h ' i say back there they might be coal in the bank there be a ' other mineral there be ` ere too h ` it be a rich land a ' now we be ` ere we would make we fortune if that daffy doctor be not ` ead straight fer the pole a ' nobody ` ere to stop ` im what do you make of it dave who have be study the shore with the glass hand it to jarvis : do you see something like a village sure i do exclaim the other excitedly sure there be a village a ` ole ` eap of bloomin ' ` eathen live up ` ere h ` only they hai not dull and stupid like they down below it be a strange-looking village sure it be make all of reindeer skin and walrus pelt sure it be different they native up ` ere ` ave get reindeer ` erd and ` erd of 'em i suppose they have get walrus ivory too say dave warm to the subject ho yes walrus h ` ivory a-plenty they ` eathen ` ave get but walrus h ` ivory haus not so much too ` eavy to make a good cargo a ' not ` alf so good as h ` elephant h ` ivory but there be mineral ` eap of mineral a ' we would all be rich man a ' it be not for the bloomin ' doctor no channel to the shore have appear they be now make they way along the edge of the open water suddenly the old engineer start : do you see ` im he whisper what where dave stare at the old man think he have suddenly lose he head h ` it be a man ' e pop ` be ` ead out then beat it one o ' they bloomin ' ` eathen probably we would better turn back huh sniff the old man ` oo care for the bloomin ' ` eathen ` armless they be ` armless as baby they continue they travel but the old man seem distinctly uneasy he see head here and there and soon dave who do not have the trained eye of the seaman see one also at once he decide that they must turn back to the submarine hardly have they take this course when head seem to be peer out at they from every ice-pile it be when they be cross a broad flat pan that matter come to a crisis suddenly brown fur-clad figure emerge from the pile at the edge of the pan and approach they they soft rawhide boot make no sound on the ice they lip be ominously silent there be a sinister gleam to the spear which they bear half-way to the man at a sign from the leader they all pause then a little knot gather about the leader three man do the greater part of the talk they appear to be urge the leader to action dave who know that the old seaman be acquaint with several native dialect say : what do you make of it can not get 'em straight say jarvi but they three ` eathen that be talkin ' loudest they 's ` eathen from another tribe ` er somethin' they be not the right color they eye hai not right a ' they do not speak the language right i think they get it in they ` ead that we h ` ought ter be pinch fer trespassin ' ` er somethin' the like but we 'll fight the bloomin ' ` eathen we will h ` if they start a bloomin ' rumpus what with smile dave the old seaman look nonplused for a moment ho well he grin then can not be any ` arm in goin ' with the bloomin ' idgit a piece h ` if they request it the horde of native do at last request it in a rather forceful and threatening way the three man whom jarvi have single out as ` eathen from another tribe become so insulting that dave could scarcely restrain jarvi from brain they leader on the spot they be lead to the edge of the ice-floe where hide in a remote corner be a oomiak a native boat of skin from here they be quickly paddle over to the shore they be then lead up a steep bank down a street line with innumerable dome-like house cover with walrus-skin and be finally drag into the largest of these house and rudely thrust into a inner room the door slam and jarvi laugh humph he chuckle fancy put a man in a bloomin ' jail make of deer skin much ` ead as the bloomin ' ` eathen ` ave let 's ` ave a look at ` er he scratch a match and the look of astonishment that dave find on he face as he stare about the inclosure cause he to laugh in spite of they dilemma h ` ivory walrus h ` ivory wall floor and ceilin ' all h ` ivory who have ever think of that mutter the old seaman wood 'll burn and iron 'll rust but h ` ivory h ` ivory who have ever think of that for a prison chapter viii the walrus hunt meanwhile on the ice-locked shore of great bear lake preparation for departure be be make by the airplane party the gasoline must all be strain through a chamois-skin to insure they against water in the engine and this with the temperature at thirty to forty below be no mean task there be a careful selection of foodstuff to be take along it be decide also that the five dog should go for they would provide transportation in case of accident and could be kill and eat as a last resort the entire equipment be give a thorough overhaul all this take three day of arduous toil when at last all be in readiness and the earth begin to drop away beneath they the dog put they nose in the air and chorus a canine arctic dirge but they howl be lose in the noise of the engine as for the boy they cheek burn truly this be to be they greatest adventure -- a adventure quite worthy the heart of a true soldier as the major have express it many problem they leave behind unsolved but these be quite crowd out of they mind by the one supreme problem : would they reach the pole and would they reach it first somewhere on the shore of melville bay near the bank of melville island freeze in the ice for the winter be the little gasoline schooner which have engage to furnish they fuel for the last lap of the journey north and the return the gas would cost a pretty penny to be sure for it would compel the trader to return to nome earlier than he have intend do but money seem no object to the zealous explorer set they course a little east of north they shoot directly away bruce who be drive settle back easily in he place the machine be soar beautifully the engine work in perfect time everything promise a safe and speedy trip now and again a belated flock of snow-goose as if draw by a invisible thread shoot by they and now far below they catch sight of move brown speck which tell of caribou still pass southward from the summer pasture in the unexplored land far to the north the fleeting panorama be of constantly change interest and beauty soon they leave the land behind they be pass over prince albert sound its surface be already white with ice land again then melville sound -- last lap on this three hundred mile journey bruce find himself unable to believe they be over a great body of salt water surely these square rise from the surface white and glistening in the moonlight be village roof cover with snow surely these other square lie flat upon the surface be town lot and the broader one stretch of field and meadow where grain would ripen in summer and flower bloom and the spot of open water make black by the whiteness about they be fishing-pond where one might lazily dip he line and dream but as he shake himself back into reality a startling question have come to he he lip put it in word how be we go to tell that schooner when we see it he bark through the major 's telephone will not she be bury in snow probably will admit the major but there be sure to be a native village near by and though they house be build of snow they always have a litter of black thing about -- sled hunting implement skin and the like we can not miss it native m-m-m bruce mumble nagyuktogmiut or something like that hope the white man happen to be about when we land i have read stefansson 's account of they they treat he all right but when old thunderbird he own self bring they some white man they may not be so glad to see they and those chap have copper-point spear and arrow not to speak of rifle the indian do not bother we phone back the major that be right well i hope this be we lucky day bruce again give he whole attention to drive then as they make out in the distance some high elevation that might be land or might be cloud he drop to a lower level and scan the surface of the ice for a black spot which would tell of human habitation the village he know might be fifty mile from land for these eskimo live on the ocean 's roof during the entire winter and hunt seal and great-seal move only now and again when game become scarce there they be over to the right he exclaim presently he set he machine in the general direction indicate soon a black patch begin to appear among the light and shadow surely here be the village they seek the realization set he heart thump violently drop in close and look for a landing the major twist in he seat and scan the ice narrowly as he speak just beyond they seem to be a broad flat pan look safe try it bruce cut off he engine and begin circle down it be the dead of night apparently every person about the village be asleep now he could distinguish sled and skin hang on ice-pile to dry now he locate the double row of dome house they be go to pass right over these but high enough to miss they then rapidly thing happen a vagrant current of wind seize they and they bump in air the next instant it be evident that a crash be inevitable they be swoop straight down upon a row of snow-dome but the machine be heavy the snow-house mere shell without the sign of a shock yield to the compact go spin away in little bit reveal score of sleeper snug beneath they deerskin they have awaken bedlam man shout woman and child scream dog bark like knock over a bee-hive chuckle barney bruce with a remarkably cool head bring he machine to the smooth surface beyond in a moment she be slow up to a perfect landing quick the machine-gun exclaimed barney bruce give one startled look behind they then begin work feverishly already barney and the major be unstrapp themselves across the ice in the vague moonlight a motley throng a hundred strong be charge down upon they half-naked they brown arm gleam they seem the inhabitant of some south sea isle rather than eskimo of the farthest north copper-pointed spear gleam yellow and gold while here and there the dark barrel of a hunting rifle be to be see go slow warn the major remember it be man woman and child instead of wolf this time they be wild but they be human send a volley into the ice-pile at the leave show 'em what you have get and they 'll stop -- perhaps as bruce turn the barrel of he deadly weapon he catch the low rumble of many voice the native be chant a witching song to destroy the power of evil spirit tat-tat-tat-tat the machine-gun speak bit of ice fly wildly the mob halted for a moment then plunge on still chant that maddening song just at the moment when a massacre seem inevitable there come a roar from the right turn bruce see the form of a bearded man apparently rise from a hole in a giant ice-cake at the sound the wild mob halt hey you fellow the stranger bellow what be the matter with you then he turn to the native and begin to harangue they in a tongue quite unknown even to the major the instant bruce see the red-whiskered giant rise seemingly from the ocean he hand relax on the machine-gun and he stand in ready expectation the eskimo appear to understand the word which the stranger fling at they for though they continue they weird incantation they lower they weapon and do not attempt to approach nearer the white man presently they weapon begin clatter to the ice take this as a sign of friendliness the explorer step out to meet they see this the native gather into a compact group they song rise to a wild hum howl but they make no move to attack when the stranger be quite close one native braver than he companion step forward still chant he hand each explorer a small cube of whale blubber one cube remain in he own hand this he proceed to swallow indicate at the same time that the stranger be to follow he example the moment the cube disappear the wild chorus cease and the native crowd forward to extend a hearty welcome it be however a very long time before one of they be persuade to come near the airplane i have not a doubt say the major that they still believe that we ride here on the back of old thunder-bird himself and why not if we can build schooner many time as large as they largest skin-boat and run they by noise alone if we can kill at a distance by a magic of great noise why could not we tame the thunder-bird himself and make he carry we it be my firm conviction that if one of we be to return here in a year or two he would hear the most outlandish tale of the kabluna who ride the thunder-bird the native have return to they camp to dress and to repair the damage do by the airplane the white man be approach what appear to be the den of the bearded stranger when the major give a cry of joy : mast boy we have finish the first lap of we journey the den of the stranger be the cabin to he schooner he be the trader who be to furnish we gasoline the major 's surmise prove to be correct and they be soon sit happily around a rough galley table sip at steam mulligan -- a rich arctic stew -- and coffee and now say the major for a few hour of sleep after that you time be you own for twelve hour twelve hour exclaim bruce in surprise do not we start for the pole at once young gentleman say the major smile you enthusiasm be gratify in the extreme but fly especially in high latitudes be very try on the nerve -- even such nerve as yours remember that in the arctic where anything at all be liable to happen at a moment 's notice we must always be at we best so get some relaxation what will you do with you twelve hour i hear a walrus bark a half-hour ago exclaimed barney eagerly i be for a walrus hunt agree bruce good that will stretch you leg a bit say the major but do not go too far nor take too many chance remember you have a mission to accomplish here in the north the three adventurer be soon sleep soundly in the bunk of the gussie brown and far away bob he head through a water-hole and shake the icicle from he moustache a great bull-walrus bark at the moon when they awake from dreamless slumber the boy ' first thought be of the promise walrus hunt they scramble into they fur garment and hurry to the surface of the floe listen for the hoarse call of they quarry the walrus they do not have to wait long there he bark exclaimed bruce put he hand to he ear and again barney hurry below to secure a native harpoon and skin-rope bruce provide himself with a high-power magazine rifle we be off barney shout joyously to the major as he gulp down a cup of steam coffee and take a last bite of sour-dough bread good luck and may you come back banter the major have he known how real be he jest prophecy of danger he would not have joke as a rule walrus-hunting in the arctic be not a sport it be a task -- the day 's work of provide food for a village it be as exciting as the hog-killing day of a middle-west farmer the hog may run amuck of the farmer and so may the walrus of the hunter the chance be about equal the walrus seldom show fight before he be harpoon he either be quite indifferent to the presence of the hunter or slip away to the water at sight of he if harpoon he make every effort to escape and only in rare instance show fight the boy have be tell all this by the trader over they coffee the night before it be evident then that they must slip up on they prey without be see this would be a comparatively simple matter since the tumbled ridge of ice afford ideal hiding-place when close enough barney who be the stronger of the two be to drive the harpoon-point through the thick skin of the creature this harpoon-point be fasten to a rawhide rope he must instantly drive a copper-pointed lance into the ice and wrap the skin-rope about it close to the ice-surface hold on like grim death until bruce dispatch the creature with he rifle wherever the beast be in a small water-hole keep open by himself or a larger one form by the shift floe they success would depend on barney 's ability to keep the rope free from jagged edge which might cut it and bruce 's skill at quickly get in a fatal shot at regular interval the walrus must rise for air and this would give the opportunity for bruce to get in he work he be a moose whisper bruce as they creep close to the rather broad waters-hole and eye the creature through a crack between upended ice-cakes tusk two foot and a half long must weigh a ton and a half already barney feel he muscle ache from the strain well here be for it he exclaim coil he skin-rope the next instant there come a loud thwack which tell that the boy 's shaft have find its mark instantly there be a hoarse bellow and then a wild splash in the water bruce be at the top of a pressure ridge ready for action barney have make he shaft secure but then there come a strain that make the vein stand out on he forehead suddenly the strain slacken be ready he be come -- barney do not finish for from the churn water the walrus thrust he massive head snort and foam the rifle crack silently the great creature sink but this time the foam water show a fleck of red where the walrus disappear get he cry bruce triumphantly but this time the strain on the lance be redoubled try -- try to hit a vital -- vital spot pant barney as the strain lessen once more behind front flipper -- in the eye again the water foam again the rifle crack more blood another plunge and again the strain seem redoubled i -- can not -- hold much -- longer barney gasp spring down from the pinnacle bruce run to the edge of the pool and leap upon a float ice-cake wait again this time he aim be better the strain when the walrus sink be not so great do fine breathe barney next time we 'll -- again he do not finish for unexpectedly he friend shoot up in the air to fall sprawl upon the cake of ice and cling there while it tilted to a angle of forty-five degree the walrus have rise beneath the cake and split it in two bruce be stun by he fall but barney 's warning cry rouse he one glance reveal he perilous position the piece of ice to which he cling have be thrust toward the center of the pool even now the gap be too wide for he to leap to plunge into the water with the thermometer forty below be to court death while he hesitate the walrus rise to the surface with a bellow that spray bloody foam about he he charge the cake of ice if ever there be need for a cool brain it be now bruce grip he rifle crouch and wait reach the cake the walrus hook he tusk over its edge till it tilted to a perilous angle bruce 's foot shoot from under he but by a quick movement he catch the upper edge of the ice pull himself up till he could brace he foot he take steady aim at the beast 's wild and bloodshot eye it be a perfect shot the walrus crumpling begin to sink into the water see this bruce cling to the cake until the tusk slip off in another moment the uncertain raft be at rest well we get he he pant sit limply on the ice but for mine in the future give I the cozy danger of aviation i do not see much relaxation in this game the ice-cake soon drift so that bruce could jump ashore with they combined effort the boy be able to draw the dead walrus close in and tie he securely to the ice edge then they return to camp to send a happy band of native out for the meat and blubber that head will make a fine trophy to hang in the front parlor of that five-room bungalow laugh barney as a native bring it in that night you may have it for you den say bruce with a shiver i never want to look a walrus in the face again to-morrow say the major as they prepare to retire the race will be resume chapter ix fight they way out a careful examination of they ivory jail show dave and the submarine engineer that they be in a narrow chamber completely line with walrus tusk the tusk have be so ingeniously cut and fit that only the grain of the glisten surface tell where one tusk join another as for the door so closely be it fit that it be not to be located at all in two corner be seal-oil lamp these have feed-pipe of some form of dry sea-weed they could thus be feed from without two narrow opening strongly bar with ivory tusk one in the floor and one in the ceiling permit air to enter but one peer through they into utter darkness taus not no wonder they leave we we knife grumble jarvi the bloomin ' ` eathen knowed we would wear 'em away before we make any h ` impression on that ivory but mind you lad this haus not the work of no bloomin ' ` eathen -- not no regular ` eathen it hai not ' e hai not smart enough for that you regular ` eathen hai not 'twa some one else it be should not be surprise if it be they three stranger as for dave he be worry less about himself than about he companion out in the bay know the grow impatience of the doctor he be prepare to expect he to attempt anything in case of they prolonged absence should he try to submerge the craft to bring she to land under the ice it be a even chance every one on board would perish miserably -- catch in the sunken sub that he and jarvi might be keep prisoner indefinitely seem certain for after some five or six hour food be thrust in to they and they be leave apparently for the night the food consist of boil fish and liver probably walrus liver soak in rank seal oil they eat a little fish and thrust the liver through the opening in the floor the better to escape its nauseating odor h ` i would die before h ` i would h ` eat ` be bloomin ' victuals snarl jarvi contemptuously that bloomin ' ` eathen he begin poke about the narrow confines of the jail not be able to see to suit himself he strike a match and touch it to the mass place on the edge of a brimming seal-oil lamp in lieu of a wick immediately a line of fire be kindle and its light reflect again and again by the dazzling whiteness of they prison wall make the whole place as light as day at once jarvi give a cry of surprise and begin crawl toward the farthest side h ' i tell you there be mineral he exclaim e 's a rich un this bloomin ' ` eathen h ` it be gold h ` i 'll be blow he begin digging away with he knife at some yellow spot in the ivory they be bit of inlaid gold what be the idea ask dave in surprise be all prison up here make of ivory inlay with gold y ' can not tell lad ` e 's a queer one the bloomin ' ` eathen and if h ' i be ` anged sputter jarvis what be one pole more or less when you have gold call to come and take it what -- he pause he mouth agape word unsay the door of the ivory den have be softly open and frame in it be the dark crafty face of the three native who have bring about they captivity and imprisonment in they hand gleam knife with long blade of a curious oriental type \* \* \* \* \* but we must return to the doctor and he crew of gob who have be leave on the submarine when the young captain and he chief engineer do not return at sunset deep concern for they safety be feel three search party be send out while from time to time flare be light to show they the way to the submarine should they chance to have lose they direction on the ice-floe the flare guide the search party back to the boat but so far as find trace of the missing one be concerned neither flare nor searcher be of any avail in the meantime the doctor pace the deck anxiously they be lose valuable time if only they could find a way to shore the damage shaft might be repair and during the interval the captain and engineer would doubtless turn up at the first hint of dawn the watch discover a lead half-way through the ice-floe at once the doctor order the submarine run into this narrow channel the result be what might have be expect the ice close in and the sub be lock in the center of the floe there remain but one way it could move -- down under the ice otherwise it might drift indefinitely in this solid mass of ice they would be carry away from the bay away from they friend and all hope of rescue they would be lose it be indeed a terrible plight just at this time a bright young gob tom rainey come forward with a ingenious scheme the sub carry a sufficient length of steel cable to reach to the farther edge of the ice-floe why he reason might they not pole this cable beneath the rather loosely-joined ice mass until they reach the open water then submerge the submarine and with a capstan drag it like a hooked trout to the channel it be a wild scheme but the doctor be in a mood for anything the crew be set to work at once cut hole in the ice-floe here and there and pass the cable from open to open it be slow and freezing work but in time the job be do when the cable be ready the doctor insist that a sufficient crew be aboard the submarine when she submerge to man she in case she break loose this be indeed a hazardous mission but volunteer be not lack and with all speed the trial be make the scheme work better than they have dare to hope when the sub pass from beneath the ice-floe the second engineer in he superabundance of joy hazard a few turn of the disabled shaft this set the whole craft vibrate and drive she half-way across the narrow channel as the submarine rise to the surface the doctor see a dark shadow pass over the glass window at the top at the same time he feel a slight jar must have tilted a small cake of ice he chuckle then as he lift the hatch : by jove no it be not it be a skin-boat full of native there they be in the water watch they scramble back into they boat if we have a safer power we would go to they rescue but they 'll be all right now they be all aboard that the native be in a frenzy of fear while in the water the doctor attribute to they dread of attack by a walrus but when they begin paddle away at top speed he open he eye in wonder ah well he say at last who would marvel at that ship be not in the habit of come up out of the sea in the arctic and now i wonder -- i just wonder do they have anything to do with the disappearance of we friend dave and the engineer when all hand be on board lunch be serve by the time this be over the submarine have drift to the solid shore-ice she be at once tie up with the aid of ice-anchor and preparation make for drag she out of the water but first say the doctor let we visit we friend ` the bloomin ' ` eathen ' as jarvi style they it be a strange sight that meet they gaze as they enter the village man woman and child with a wild wail throw themselves flat on they stomach utter the most melancholy moan that ever come from human lip intersperse with the cry be apparent appeal address to the visitor what be all this rumpus the doctor demand of azazruk the eskimo can you understand they jargon they say say the eskimo show he white tooth in a grin that they know we be spirit -- spirit of dead whale since we come out of a whale 's back that come up from under the sea they say not kill they we please they say this that one they say kill plenty whale that one chief native they say fire for spirit of dead whale not make that they they say that this one native but they say not kill they and for sure they make fire sing song for spirit of dead whale the doctor who understand this to be one of the superstition of the native and know that they have take the submarine for a whale begin to laugh but at once he check himself turn a scowling face at the only two stand native one of whom have a fresh cut across he cheek he storm : and why have these fellow no shame tell they to fall down at once or i will step on they azazruk repeat the message and surprised and frighten the two man obey the doctor eye the two curiously for a moment as they lay there squint up at he they slant eye gleam with suppress anger look like they would be in a fight he remark and so they do the darker of the two have the cut on he cheek before mention he fur parka be tear half off he display some ugly bruise he companion have lose half a sleeve and he right hand be bleed they be surely rascal but you must play the good samaritan at all time he say as he bent over one of they rainey get my case from the locker will you rainey hurry to the submarine a half mile away while the native still half sprawl on the frozen earth eye the hardier fellow while the doctor bent over they as if expect at any moment to see they drop dead as a result of the magic power of these great spirit from the belly of a whale it be jarvi and dave who be responsible for the condition of the two native of the strange bearing when jarvi see they ugly face and gleam knife at the door of the ivory prison he be ready for a fight he face turn purple as he mutter between clinched tooth : h ` it be we chance ` ere 's where h ' i make a killin ' at 'em dave and lead by he sturdy engineer dave hove at they right royally they knife be short but they arm long and as for skill there be no better train man in the army than dave and jarvi they make quick work of it the bloomin ' ` eathen surprise by the sudden onslaught be on they back in a trice two of they fare as i have say and as for the third he come out with a head so badly pummel by jarvi ' fist that he be content to crawl into a dark igloo and stay there once outside the prison jarvi and dave glance quickly about they for a hiding-place much to they surprise they do not see a native about the village make bold by this they skirt the rear of the last row of hut and dodge down a snowed-in ravine hide at last in the ice-heap not twenty rod from the submarine not be aware however that they friend have succeed in reach the shore-ice they crouch in they icy shelter they tooth chatter from cold and excitement jarvi have a ugly slash on he right arm dave have just succeed in bind this up when they hear footstep approach jam themselves hard into a crevice of ice jarvi whisper : h ` i 'll fight t ' a finish before h ' i go back to that white prison of the bloomin ' ` eathen dave make no response the step come nearer then begin to die away do not sound like the bloomin ' ` eathen muttered jarvis no near 's soft and glidin ' ` ere ' e come back h ` i 'll ` ave a look creep close to a corner he peer cautiously out then with a roar : blime I it be rainey he spring from concealment almost embrace the young gob in he delight it be a joyful meeting that take place between the unite party when jarvi see the doctor work over the disabled native he roar first with laughter then with anger he last desire be to put they out of the way at once for sir he argue they hai not no natural ordinary ` eathen indeed not sir they be the very h ` old nick ` isself sir but dave suggest put they in they own ivory prison and this advice prevail after they wound be dress they be thrust in and the door bar from without wiser man than the sub crew have learn that a man be seldom safe in a prison of he own making but the sailor never give the prisoner another thought rainey say the engineer as he find himself alone with the young gob we 'll all be rich man how ask he companion there be mineral mineral gold I lad ton of it the older man 's wrinkled face catch the tint of the sunset and seem to take on the hue of the metal of which he speak chapter x to the treasure city once all the member of the submarine party be reunite they one thought be to repair they damage craft as soon as possible and start again on they way to the pole perhaps the engineer waste a think now and again on the suppose great mineral wealth of that peninsula but if he do he say nothing the man be divide into three group the first the mechanic undertake the task of remove the shaft the second guard the craft against possible attack by the native while the third be dispatch up the beach to search for firewood which the mechanic must have the work of the guard seem a joke not one of the native could be induce to approach the dark spirit-whale which some of they comrade have see rise from the water even after the steel shaft have be bring ashore as tangible evidence that the craft be a thing of metal they could not be induce to approach it the wood hunter find they task a hard one for either there never have be much driftwood on these shore or the native have use it for summer camp-fire they search far down the bay without find a sufficient quantity to make a decent fire over which to roast ` hot-dog ' as rainey express it but as the engineer round a point he suddenly exclaim there be not h ' i be sayin ' hit i ` ate to think ` ow jolly stupit som ` um of ye be he be point to the bank which overhang the sea the man who be look only for driftwood do not at first see the cause of he exclamation coal my lad jarvi exclaimed half beside himself coal crop from the bank it be true a careful examination show a four-foot vein of soft coal it be not long until reindeer sled secure from the native be draw quantity of the fuel to a point beneath a cliff where a crude forge have be make out of granite rock while this work be go on the engineer disappear in the direction of the village in a half-hour he come tear back he face red with rage they be h ` out he sputter the bally blither unnatural ` eathen hev fly the h ` ivory coop t ` be to be expect i ` ate t ' think what h ` i would a-do ` ad h ' i ` ad the say of it oh well say the doctor who be incline to take jarvi ' quarrel with the native rather lightly in twenty-four hour we 'll be away from these shore never to return return exclaim jarvi h ` i 'll return a ' dave ` ere 'll return we 'll be rich man we 'll be i ` ate t ' think ` ow rich ` im a ' I 'll be but the doctor be too busy hurry the mechanic in they repair to heed the word of the excited engineer finally the forge be ready and as by the arctic moonlight a black smoke rise higher and higher above the cliff and a fire blaze a thousand time larger and hotter than that black shore have ever know the native appear to grow more and more certain that these man who come up from the depths of the sea be indeed the spirit of all the dead whale that they and they forefather before they have kill they look on in silent awe it be with the greatest difficulty that jarvi succeed in find one of they who be able to speak the chukche language of behr strait a language that be understand by azazruk the eskimo when at last he do find a man who know chukche and who be not too frightened to talk he ply he with many question who be the three strange-appearing native who have attack he and he companion in the jail where do they come from what be they do here how do they happen to have such a strange jail how do they chance to have a jail at all where do the gold come from that have be use to inlay the ivory be there much of it to be find these and many other question the engineer put to the tremble native while with one eye he watch the operation of the mechanic who labor by the fire the man do not know the exact place from which the three stranger have come it be somewhere far south know as ki-yek-tuk the three have be a long time in the village and have inspire all the people with a great dread by tell they of a giant race who wear fierce beard like the walrus who kill with a great noise at long distance and who would break any jail except one of ivory they have say that probably one or two of these fierce man would come at first and perhaps if these be make prisoner no other would follow hence the jail and hence too the imprisonment of dave and jarvi the native have feel sure that they be the advance guard of these wicked cruel man who have come to rob and kill but now of course they know they be spirit of dead whale and would do they no harm as for the tusk with the inlay gold the man say they have be trade for by a very old man who have make a journey with a reindeer ten night and day from they village due west there beside a great river he have find a numerous people who live in house of log very large and warm he say too that these people have great quantity of this yellow metal they house be decorate with it they fur garment glisten with it they council house be encrust with it but he add at the end the metal be too soft for spear point and arrowhead too heavy for garment and not good for food as for house do they not have they deerskin and walrus-pelt so the old man never go back for more dave have be sit by the old engineer as he secure this information bit by bit through the interpreter he eye sparkle with excitement when he speak well he ask when the native have finish what do you make of it make of it exclaim the old man it be plain as the nose on you face h ` as h ' i see it there be gold in this land just h ` as h ' i say before plenty of it h ` and this ` ere tribe way west there some'er they be be drive there by the roosian er by other tribe mayhap they 's roosian h ` exile themselves mayhap they be one of the seven lose tribe of h ` israel what you read of in the book ` owever that may be it be there and h ' i ` ate to think ` ow rich you h ` and h ` i would be h ` if h ` it be not fer this ` ere crazy doctor 's achin ' to see th ' pole jarvi dave lean forward eagerly we 'll take the doctor to the pole then we 'll hire a submarine or a schooner and work we way back here we will that I lad say the old man grip the boy 's hand but then he add more soberly maybe it will not be a bit o ' use maybe the jap will get it first the jap sure the jap ar ' ye that blind do not ye know all the time the three rascal we well-nigh kill be jap can not ye see ` ow they do not want the h ` american or th ' roosian to git t ' the treasure of this peninsula can not ye see ` ow bloomin ' easy h ` it would be for 'em to put two or three spy in h ` every bloomin ' native village on the whole roosian coast and take the entire peninsula fer th ' jap kaiser or whatever they call ` im can not ye see ` ow th ' thing would work dave sit a long time in think at last he decide what to do perhaps you be right jarvi he say finally rise but we first job be the pole the shaft must be nearly fit by now let 's see how they be come perhaps we 'll be away in the morning as they round a block of ice by the shore jarvi give a start and seize he companion by the arm d' y ' see ` im he whisper ' e be starin ' h ` at we from behint they ice-pile ' e be a jap i 'll swear it aw you be see jap to-night laugh dave ow be she jarvi ask of a gob whom they meet right as they make 'em -- now but i 'll say it be some job that the shaft be twist something awful -- like a corkscrew but it be some steel that shaft and we just het she up a ' twist she straight again the doc say he guess it would be a bit short but when we get she back in place she fit like paint then we slide the old boat back in the water and try she out and she run like a watch grand we be off in the mornin ' dave and jarvi turn to make they way to the submarine where a single gob pacing the white ice-surface have laugh at he job of watch native who could not be induce to come within a half-mile of he suddenly the engineer jump forward do y ' see that jarvi grab dave by the arm and urge he into a run ' e go down -- the guard i see ` im panted jarvis i saw ` im then h ' i do not h ` it be the jap listen there come distinctly the sound of a drag hawser h ` it be the jap the bloom bloody ` eathen jarvis pant they be h ` after the submarine dave drag he behind a ice-covered boulder quick he whisper if the submarine go we go with she inside or outside somewhere we have get to take the chance dart from ice-pile to ice-pile they soon reach the water 's edge there lay the guard unconscious a ugly bruise on the side of he head and there lay the submarine silent and close she be off breathe the engineer it be true the craft already show a line of dark water between she and the shore without hesitation the old engineer spring upon she deck and crouch by the conning-tower instantly dave follow he they soft skin-boot make no sound and as they crouch there the submarine head for the channel and then toward the west to the treasure city h ` i 'll be bind whisper jarvi chapter xi a battle beneath the arctic moon the treasure city we 'll stick ` ere behint th ' connin ' - tower the engineer explain to dave as the submarine turn put off up the dark channel which separate the solid shore-ice from the great drift of ice-floe that lay beyond if they submerge suggest dave we 'll have a slim chance h ' i doubt if they understant that much mumble the engineer between chatter tooth h ` anyway right ` ere 's where h ' i stick h ` and once th ' bloomin ' ` eathen show a ` ead above the ` atchway h ' i ` ate t ' think what 'll ` appen to ` im perhaps the channel will close in and drive they ashore suggest dave hopefully as he draw he mackinaw more closely about he and crouch nearer to the conning-tower that he might avoid the cut air and icy spray which reach he from the prow of the submarine mayhap mumble the engineer snuggle close but the channel do not close also the submarine do not submerge it plow straight on through the dark water of the channel night pass and the pale arctic sun reveal the two figure huddle half-frozen behind the conning-tower daylight bring little comfort serve only to remind they that they have no coffee for breakfast indeed have no breakfast at all this set the engineer to mutter threat against the stranger who have steal the submarine and cause he for the hundredth time to remark : h ' i ` ate t ' think what 'll ` appen t ' 'em once h ' i get I ` and on 'em but the intruder stay below while slowly the sun run its brief course and then paint the ice-spire with shadow of deep purple as the night come on the two man be force to move about to keep from freezing tip-toeing along avoid heavy glass window they converse in low tone we have be h ` at h ` it now goin ' h ` on twenty-four ` ours murmured jarvi h ` it be two hundred h ` a ' forty mile h ` a ' h ` we course u would be shorter than a reindeer 's h ` if that bloomin ' ` eathen that speak of th ' treasure city tell truth h ` i be one fer believin ' we be nearin ' th ' spot jarvi speak more cheerfully than he have at any time during the strange journey dave smile as he wonder whether this be due to the fact they walk have warm they somewhat or he rise hope that they would at least get to see the fabled treasure city tell I jarvis whisper do my h ` old h ` eye deceive I or h ` be there a line of dark h ` over t ' th ' right of y ' he hand tremble as he point dave look long and earnestly the moon shine very brightly the snow bring out dark object with such vividness that it would not be too much to expect to see large object twenty mile away i think you eye be all right he say slowly then that ` ud be th ' forest by the river th ' treasure city ` ud be just by the ` arbor h ` at th ' mouth of th ' river dave h ' i ` ate t ' think ` ow richer we 'll be the old man grip dave 's hand as for dave he be silent he be think first of the struggle that could not now be far distant it would be a bitter fight with odds in favor of the other party however he hope the enemy have be weaken by the earlier combat then he think of the man they have so unexpectedly leave behind of the doctor who depend upon he and of the gob who have serve under he a boy so faithfully such thought leave he in no mood to think of treasure he be about to say as much to he companion when there come a rattle at the hatch of the sub quickly he and the engineer crouch behind the conning-tower they breath come hard they heart beat fast they wait the throbbing of the engine stop the submarine glide silently on the deathlike stillness be end by the dull groan of a hatchway lifting armed each with a knife and a heavy ice-anchor the two man wait \* \* \* \* \* in the meantime during this twenty-four hour so eventful to dave and the engineer other thing be happen on the shore by the native village when rainey who have be on guard at the time of the stealing of the sub have be find and bring back to consciousness he could give no account of affair other than that he have be strike a violent blow on the head and after that remembered nothing for a single moment dark suspicion rest on dave and the engineer some of the crew have hear they talk of the treasure city ten day ' journey to the west and have hear jarvi remark that he ` ate t ' think ` ow rich they would be could it be possible they have seize the submarine and desert the party for the sake of gain to themselves for a moment faith waver then they better nature triumph not they they declare not dave and old jarvi to this the doctor heartily agree and though he disappointment be great at have the expedition again delay and perhaps entirely thwart he turn he mind at once to matter of the hour gather he man about he he outline hastily a line of action for they in the present crisis they be he reason in a perilous situation several hundred mile west of any point reach by white whaler and trader maroon with two hundred superstitious native who to-day worship they but to-morrow upon discover the disappearance of the spirit-whale might turn upon they they would be oblige to make use of every resource and every strategy to save they life should the submarine fail to return he plan be to deal fairly with the native and keep they good will if that be possible fortunately they have take from the submarine ten good rifle with a hundred round of ammunition native be see at all hour of the day drag behind they the carcass of seal oogrook -lrb- big-seal -rrb- and even polar bear if these could be secure with the aid of such primitive weapon as harpoon and lance they with they rifle might hope to secure a ample supply of the meat and it have be prove that even a white man could live the winter through on a diet of meat and blubber in right proportion they might also at time be able to trade for reindeer meat they would remain at the village until no hope remain that the submarine would return then they would endeavor to get a store of meat some reindeer and deerskin sleeping bag and make they way east to some point reach in summer by trader three of the large skin-house have already be turn over to they by the native these would provide ample shelter two be at once arrange as bunk-house and the third as cook-shack when this have be do with two man on guard they turn in and sleep next morning at six o'clock four hour before daylight every man be call out and assign duty it be the custom of the native to depart for the hunting-ground at that hour they should follow the same custom divide themselves into two party one to watch camp the other to hunt they immediately set about they task the first day 's hunt be under the direction of azazruk the eskimo the result be more than gratify two ringed seal one oogrook ten foot long and one young polar bear be the bag for the day a full week 's supply of meat smile the doctor rub he hand in high glee in he interest in this new game he have for the moment quite forget he great disappointment at the loss of the sub it be while they be smack they lip over a hamburger make of bear meat that they be surprise by a young native who rush into they tent without the accustomed shout salutation seemingly quite beside himself with fear for some time nothing intelligible could be gather from he excited chatter but finally azazruk make out that only a hour before as he watch the reindeer a great hairy monster have dash at the herd scatter it far and wide and carry away a yearling buck as easily as if it have be a rabbit probably a white bear suggest rainey not probable say the doctor a bear would eat he prey where it be slay a wolf could not do it well what then all eye be turn toward the doctor you will judge I insane if i tell you what i think it be he answer but here you be i think it be a tiger a tiger tiger every man voice he unbelief a tiger in the arctic impossible that be absurd for answer the doctor draw from he notebook a newspaper clipping bidding rainey read it aloud the article be entitle the russian tiger and be a account of the slaying of a gigantic man-eater by a american officer when american troops be station at vladivostok in eastern russium at that point explain the doctor they have about eight month of winter with a thermometer that drop far below zero it may well be consider a part of the arctic yet as you see they have tiger there indeed i be tell they be not at all uncommon so why not up here no one have a ready answer and at last the doctor speak again : in the meantime what be we go to do about it it would seem that the native be appeal to we for aid rainey at once spring to he foot exclaim : count I one to go hunt the beast whatever it be at once the other be on they foot shout they eagerness for the hunt the doctor choose a gob name thompson to accompany rainey on he tiger hunt or whatever it might prove to be rainey be well pleased at the choice for thompson be a sure shot and a cool nervy hand in time of danger if i do not hear from you by morning say the doctor i shall send a relief expedition rainey have fully recover from the affair of the previous day both he and thompson have be among the guard party that day so be fresh and keen for work they find the moonlight make the wide stretch of ice and snow light as day _ some _ night and _ some _ game murmur rainey as they emerge from the tent \* \* \* \* \* when the man in native garb who have steal the submarine lift the hatch to take a observation they be utterly unaware of the presence of two figure crouch behind the conning-tower this in spite of the fact that the man wear they long knife strap to they waist give dave and the engineer a decide advantage -- a advantage they be not slow to make the most of fortunately the robber crowd up the hatchway all eager to catch a first view of the reputed gold valley in which lay the treasure city as the third head peep above the hatch jarvi spring at they swing he ice-anchor a ugly cudgel of bent iron with a chill steel point he send two of the villain sprawl at a single blow meanwhile dave who have grapple with the third man make a misstep and together they plunge down the hatchway he opponent land full on dave 's stomach and so crushed the breath from he that for a second the lad could not move but instantly he realize that he must act the man be attempt to draw he long knife thrust out a hand dave grip the point of the blade in its soft leather sheath so tightly that it could not be withdraw struggle with every ounce of strength the two man be roll over and over on the deck the stranger be heavier and evidently older than dave but the american have one advantage he be dress only in woolens the heavy skin clothing of he antagonist hamper he action in spite of this dave feel himself lose out in the battle the stranger 's hand be grip closer and closer to he throat and he feel he own hand lose its hold on the knife-blade when he hear a welcome roar from the hatchway it be jarvi with one leap he be at dave 's side for a old man he be surprisingly quick yet he be not too quick for the murderous knife be swing above dave 's chest and a hand be at he throat when jarvi cleave the assailant 's skull with he ice-anchor with a groan the man collapse the knife clatter to the deck jarvi drop to the floor panting be you hurt he gasp no be you not a scratch some jolly little weapon they ice-h ` anchor h ` i 'll wear one of 'em h ` in I belt from now on h ' i ` ate t ' think ` ow cold th ' water be when h ' i pitch 'em h ` in they other two kill 'em not that bad but mebby they 'll drown h ` i 'll go see h ` i would ` eat t ' see 'em climbin ' back he hurry up the hatchway follow closely by dave not a sign of the two man be to be see either on the submarine in the water or on the solid shore-ice a few rod away what d' y ' think of that ask jarvis mop he brow they be go perhaps they drown mebbe drown -- mebby they be ` id h ` in th ' h ` ice well anyway we be rid of they say dave we 'll sew the dead one up in a blanket and throw he overboard then we 'll be go back think how all fuss up the doctor will be the boy chuckle go back jarvi stare as if unable to believe he ear go back and the treasure city within peep of h ` we h ` eye go back do y ' say h ' i ` ate t ' think ` ow rich we 'll be you a ' I the sun be set behind the dark line of timber some object at a point where the timber end and the tundra begin cast back the sunlight with a golden glow d' y ' see it lad exclaim the excited old man d' y ` see it h ` it be gold chapter xii the russian tiger when rainey and thompson accompany by the native leave the village to hunt the strange creature that be work havoc with the village reindeer herd they walk directly away from the row of deerskin house toward the tundra at the foot of the hill where some five mile away the deer be herd the five mile be accomplish mostly in silence each man be busy with he own thought as for the little native he seem quite without fear as long as he be with the powerful spirit of dead whale when they approach the brown line of the herd that spread itself across the horizon the boy lead they around it to a point beyond where the beast attack the young deer there though the ground have be much trample by the madden herd they find many trace of the attack splotch of blood stain the snow and make a well-defined trail where the creature have carry off its prey soon they be beyond the patch of trampled snow and then the native leave they to follow the trail alone faintly from the distance come the rattle and clatter of reindeer antler as the herd move about above they in all its silver glory shine the moon now and again the hunter give a start as a ptarmigan rouse from its slumber go whir away to they every purple shadow of rock or bush or snow-pile might be the beast crouching over he kill the doctor 's right exclaimed rainey bend over the trail which still show a bloodspot here and there it be no polar bear -- here be the scratch of he claw where he climb this bank polar bear have no claw only a sort of hard lump on the end of each toe no wolf either say thompson examine the track carefully the scratch be too long and too far apart but for that matter who would even dream of a wolf large enough to carry off a two hundred pound deer the beast 's soft paw on the snow hard-packed by arctic wind leave a trail very difficult to follow but bit by bit they trace it out at last the creature have climb a hill have take down a narrow ravine where scrub willow grow thick and here they find unmistakable evidence that it have be some form of a great cat that have pass this way just like a cat 's track say rainey and look at the size of 'em must measure five inch across they pause at the edge of the willow they be brave man but not fool only fool would venture into that thicket where every advantage would be on the side of the lurk monster there be a ridge up there run right along the side of this scrub say rainey we 'll climb up there and walk along it may get a glimpse of he then again he may have come out on the other side and go on they climb the bank and start along the ridge every yellow bunch of dead willow leave at once become for the moment a crouching tiger but each in turn be pass up so they walk the ridge and have pass the willow clump when rainey grip he companion 's arm whispering : what be that down there to the right i think i see it move thompson gaze down the narrow pass for a moment then whisper : c'mon it be the very old chap we can skirt the next bank of rock and be right above he we be in luck it will be a easy shot creep on hand and knee with bated breath and nerve a-tingle the boy come presently to a point above the half-hidden beast as they peer down at he they could barely suppress exclamation of surprise it be indeed a tiger and such a tiger never in any zoo or menagerie have they see he equal he be a monster with massive head deep chest and powerful limb and he thick fur -- nature 's protection against the arctic cold -- seem to emphasize both he size and he savageness you be the best shot whisper rainey try he thompson lift he rifle and with steady nerve aim at a point back of the fore-leg the tiger who up to this time have apparently neither hear nor scented they but have be crouch half asleep beside he mangled prey seem suddenly to become aware of they presence just as the rifle crack he spring up the bank he deafening roar tell that the bullet have find a mark but it do not check he charge then come a catastrophe rainey lean too far forward cause some rock and loose snow to slide from beneath he and in another second he shoot down a steep incline to what seem certain death to he surprise he find himself drop straight down a hidden cliff here jut out over the drift snow to he much greater surprise instead of be knock senseless he be immediately engulf in what seem a avalanche of snow leap up to meet he he alert mind tell he what have happen a blizzard of a few day previous have drive great quantity of snow against the cliff this snow be not hard-packed and he have be bury in it by the fall the problem now be to avoid the tiger who be sure to spring upon he at the first glimpse and tear he in piece then suddenly there flash through he mind a picture leave over from he boyhood day it be that of a cat endeavor to catch a mole which burrow industriously beneath the snow raise a ridge as he burrow could he play the part of the mole as the tiger be sure to play the part of the cat it be he only chance he companion would not dare to shoot until he know where rainey be put himself in the position of a swimmer the sailor begin paw at the snow and kick it with he foot the snow be hard pack against he face and he think he lung would burst but he be make progress now he dare back off a trifle and take a long breath of air from the burrow he have make then a sound stir he to renew effort it be the thud and jar of a impact the tiger have make he first leap have miss how many more time would he do this the boy once more jam he head against the snow renew he swimming motion again he be oblige to pause for breath again the tiger spring this time seemingly he be more accurate again the race be renew the boy 's mind be in a whirl would he companion understand and risk a shot as the tiger prepare for another spring he hope so surely he could not endure the strain much longer one thing he be certain of he could not hear the report of the rifle if a shot be fire he must struggle on in ignorance of what be go on above he the thought be madden the air in the narrow channel be stifle yet he burrow on and hear again the heavy impact he have burrow he length and back off again for breath when he be force to the realization that he could endure the air of the channel no longer apparently the tiger 's last leap have completely close it resolve to fight he way out and then to trust all to flight he thrust he hand upward and again begin to burrow with dizzy brain and wildly beat heart he feel at length the fresh frosty air upon he cheek but what be this that reach he ear surely not the roar of the tiger instead it be the joyous cry of he companion drag the snow from he eye rainey stare about he there not five pace from he lay the tiger with a bullet in he brain while beside the body stand thompson well say the hunter with a grin you be sure some mouse and you be some shot say rainey flounder through the snow to he companion 's side i guess that be the finest tiger skin in the world it be yours as much as mine answer thompson we 'll go share and share alike chapter xiii bruce and the bear during this time of mishap and adventure for the submarine party what be happen to the boy and the major in they airplane with fair wind and weather they might well have be on the return journey from the pole but fair wind and weather be not for long in the arctic they be indeed on they way as they shoot away into the air from the native village near the trader 's schooner they hear the native call one word in unison it be the eskimo name for thunder-bird the major smile happily at the boy as the plane soar upward barney be again at the wheel two thing he dread now : engine trouble which might be bring on by poor gasoline and a arctic blizzard if force to land at any time they would be in great danger of a crash and a storm would double the danger but there could never have be a more wonderful day than that on which they leave the little camp for the great adventure not a cloud whiten the blue dome of the sky not a breath of air stir soon the sun sink from sight and twilight strange and wonderful last through three long hour fade slowly into night then below they lay yellow light and deep purple shadow with here and there a stretch of black which tell of open water between floe the air grow colder as night come on and speed northward they see the thermometer drop degree by degree and feel the chill creep through they garment in defiance of they electrical heating device barney begin to worry about the effect of this intense cold on the temper steel of he engine and the many-layered wood of he propeller but as they speed on hour after hour this restlessness leave he but what be this he find the machine shooting through space with greater freedom one answer there be : a storm they have be catch in the advance of a blizzard how great and terrible none could tell go to storm better land telephone the major obey he order the boy drop to a lower level here the wind be more intense and the air be fill with fine particle of snow which race with they only to glide away into the background the whole ice-floe be already gray and indistinct from the drift to pick a landing-place seem impossible for several moment of agonizing suspense they speed on then just as they be about to despair there appear before they a long expanse of white wide as three city boulevard endless in extent it appear to offer just the opportunity they be seek with a sign barney shut off he engine and sailing on the wind wait for a lull to give he a safe landing the lull come then with a swoop like a wild duck seek water they hover settle then touch the surface the landing-wheel be shoot along over the snow with barney 's keen eye strain ahead that he might avoid possible rough spot when there come a cry of dismay from bruce with one startle glance about barney see all to the right and left of they the ice seem to rise like the wall of a inverted tent rubber-ice he mind tell he like a flash they have attempt to land where the water have but recently freeze over and be cover with a deceptive coating of snow only one hope remain : to rise again once the weak rubber-ice -- thin elastic salt-water ice -- give way nothing could save they tilt the plane and tail to they utmost capacity barney set first one engine in motion and then the other but the yield ice give they no purchase at the same time it impede they progress by offer they the slope of a mountain side to climb one thing favor they the peril of a moment before become a blessing the wind freshen at every blast at last with a terrific swoop it seize they and send they whirling upward in the down-swoop they be all but crash on a towering pile of ice but escape this fate once more they be away despite this near-catastrophe barney be determine to make a landing the chill of the storm be so benumbing to muscle and sens that further fly could only result in stupor then death again he sink low and scud along on the wing of the wind to he great joy he soon see that they be pass over flat stretch of white there could be no mistake this time they be ice-pans perhaps a quarter-mile across such pan as form in quiet bay to float away and drift north in the spring again he stop he engine determine if he must to circle and return to the flat he have pass this do not prove necessary however and to they great relief the three be soon thresh they arm and stamp they foot on a solid cake of ice and so vast that it seem they must be on land not hundred of mile from shore on the bosom of a great ocean which might at the very point they stand be a half-mile in depth they first concern be to make camp this storm might rage for day and already they see white spot form on one another 's cheek tell of frost-bite we can not camp here in the open say the major have to carry we blanket and sleeping-bag to the rougher ice yonder where we can build a house of snow the suggestion be no sooner make than the boy be delving into the inner recess of the plane and drag out equipment and supplies primus stove dry potato pemmican evaporate egg pickle butter hard-tack chocolate beef tea coffee barney call off not bad for near the pole the dog be hitch to the small sled and soon all be race away before the wind to the spot choose for the camp in a short time they be busy construct a rude shelter and the airplane for the moment be forget in the meantime the wind be increase and the wing of the plane catch first this swirl then that one begin make great gyrate circle cut the air with a crack and a burr that might be hear rod away though these sound do not reach the man busy with the snow-shack they do reach listen ear -- a great white bear wander the floe in search of some sleep seal stand first on all fours then on he haunch to listen then with many a misgiving and many a pause he make he cautious way to the edge of that particular ice-flat where the plane rest thence after more misgiving he trundle he awkward body across the flat and take a position close to the plane where on he haunch he stand and watch the apparently playful antic of the plane as if he think it some great bird that have come to infest he domain presently when the plane nearest he seem about to swoop down and touch the ice he move to a position beneath it and with tongue loll stand on he haunch again and swing he giant paw to accompany the swing of the plane strike out as it approach he to he surprise the plane do not come within twenty foot of the ice surface he sink back on he haunch and await further development when the snow-hut be complete the first thought of the major and the boy be of something to eat something hot exclaimed barney rattle away at the primus stove then he sit up with a look of disgust on he face the needle for the primus he groan they be still over in the plane i 'll get they say bruce begin to draw on he heavy parka soon he be fight the wind back to the position of the plane he have not battle with the element long before he begin to realize that all would not be well if the plane be leave in its present position unanchored as it be and when he catch the hum and whirr of the wind through the wing he be more thoroughly convince of the fact than ever as he come near and could see the long tilt toss of the wing he realize that something must be do and at once for a second he hesitate should he return and call he companion or should he attempt to anchor the plane temporarily at least unaided he decide upon the latter course and go at once to the body of the plane where be store light strong rope of silk and ice-anchor he do not see the bear sit patiently on he haunch beneath the tip of the long wing indeed the snow-fog make it impossible and it be equally impossible for the bear to see he have secure four rope and four ice-anchor bruce take two of the rope and begin climb out on the right wing of the plane he plan be to attach the rope to the extremity of the wing cast they down to the surface where he would anchor they later in each direction away from the tip of the wing he would repeat the operation with the other wing and draw the rope down snugly thus make the plane tight and steady he have climb quite to the extremity of the wing and be about to tie he first rope when a fierce gust of wind threaten to tear he from the rigging and crash he to the ice a dangerous distance below with a quick clutch he save himself but lose the rope it be with a grunt of disgust that he see it wind and twirl toward the white surface below then it be for the first time that he see the yellowish-white object huddle there on the ice wait a bear he groan and instinctively reach for he automatic but at that instant there come a fresh swoop of wind that set the plane gyrate more violently than ever cling grimly to the bar bruce feel the wing swing down down then in toward the bear till it seem it must crash into the great creature before the plane rise bruce feel a chill run down he spine not ten foot beneath he be the savage face of the bear all he gleaming white tooth show in a ugly grin as he stand on he haunch one mighty fore-paw raise in air like a traffic policeman signal a car to stop then again the wing whirl to dizzy height bruce be now quite ready to climb back the length of the wing and depart for camp to summon assistance but to loosen he grip even of one hand for a instant be to court death again he feel the sickening sink of the plane as if it be a elevator-car loose from its cable and this time he feel instinctively the wing would scrape the ice and the bear if he be still there well there be go to be a crash and a general mix-up bruce have be a football player in he day and be aware that there be time if one be at the bottom of the heap when relaxation be the play as far as he position make it possible he relax and in the meantime the plane sweep downward for one fleeting instant he see the white traffic cop of the arctic wilderness still stand with paw upraised then everything be a blinding deafening crash of ice and snow wood canvas and white bear bruce gather himself up some rod from the scene of the crash relax as he be he have roll like a football over the ice and have escape with a few bruise but the plane as he catch a fleeting glimpse of it disappear in the murky fog he feel sure that it would take day perhaps week to repair it and the worst be not yet she be still swing he groan rise stiffly but immediately he mind be turn to the white cop how have he fare the boy feel for he automatic fortune favor he it be still in he holster this be well for the white bear very much shake but still game have work further havoc with the debris leave by the demolish wing be charge down upon he stand he ground bruce wait until the bear be within six pace one stroke from that giant paw would end the struggle he aim must be true and certain suddenly he hand go to he side for a hip-shot put-put-put-put four bullet smash into the bear bring he to a standstill put-put-put-put with a roar the bear sink to the ice in a second he be dead it be with a feeling almost of regret that bruce bent over the giant beast but it be with a sense of new power that he note that seven of he bullet have crash through the arctic goliath 's skull again he mind be turn toward the plane cold and hungry as they be he realize that he and he two companion must spend the next hour make they craft safe from further damage three hour indeed elapse before they be again seat in the snow-cabin this time the primus stove be go and the coffee come to a boil well say the major i be glad we be all here we 'll be delay for several day we may have lose the race but we will not give up as long as we plane have wing we 'll keep on no race be ever lose until the goal be reach and pass let 's eat anyway say barney as he sip he cup of hot coffee we will not run out of dog meat and hamburger soon i 'll bet bruce 's bear weigh a thousand pound dress fourteen inch between the ear grin bruce proudly chapter xiv bomb stand silently beside the aged engineer dave tower gaze thoughtfully at the golden dome that flash then slowly darken in the setting sun that yellow gleam do not lure he on for the honor of help to reach the pole be more to he than money but jarvi he perhaps have learn in he long year of labor that the path of glory lead but to the grave and now that he be grow old wealth would mean escape from toil and worry perhaps too somewhere in the state a gray-haired wife await he to whom just a little of that gleaming gold would mean rest and peace as long as she might live so dave look at the golden dome and ponder what he ought to do when at last he speak he tone be kind : jarvi he begin as you know i be in command of this craft the fact that it have be steal and win back more by you effort than by anything i have do do not change matter any i be still commander jarvi look up with a impatient gesture as if about to speak but dave keep on : as captain of this submarine i might order you below and you refusal to do so would be mutiny but from the time we come aboard this craft we have be more like pal than commander and engineer i give you my word of honor i will never order you below if you go you go of you own free will jarvi raise he face for a moment and upon it be a look of grow hope you know dave continue what we duty be we ship under the order of the doctor those order still go no matter how fine the chance be that we be let slip we be bind to do as the doctor want more than that we have friend back there who have only two day ' supply of food when we leave they they be live in a village of superstitious treacherous savage who may attack and murder they at any moment jarvi he touch the old man 's hand we be american seaman will you forget you flag and you shipmate for gold for a second the old man stand in silence then with a rush he stumble down the hatchway and in another moment dave hear he tinker away at he engine before dave wrap the dead stranger in he burial blanket he search the pocket of he clothing there be no mistake the garment they be oriental in make and have there remain any doubt it would have be dispel by two packet of papers take from a inside pocket these bear the official stamp of that oriental government which have be name by jarvi i must tell jarvis say the boy to himself it will please he to know that he be right and that night while they glide silently back toward the native village they have leave not many hour before leave the treasure city a mystery unexplained he _ do _ tell jarvi as he finish the old man 's face light the thing that be troublin ' I just now he say slowly be the question of th ' two bloomin ' ` eathen that fade from h ` we h ` eye h ' i ` ate to think they live a ' h ' i ` ate to trust my ` ope they be do for if they be h ` alive they may get the treasure yet a ' h ' i ` ate t ' be beat by a bloody bloomin ' ` eathen they be a long way from home base say dave with a grin they may find the treasure but get it home 's another thing i want you to know he go on huskily that i appreciate you standing by I and if we get out of this alive you and i with we discharge papers i promise i 'll be you partner in this new enterprise -- the quest for treasure that be if you 'll take I on will h ' i jarvis spring to he foot a new glad light in he eye will h ' i ` ere give we a ` and on that h ` and we 'll win lad we 'll win a ' that in spite of th ' bloomin ' ` eathen it be early the next morning that the doctor who be enjoy with the gob the native festival of rejoice over the killing of the great and to they unknown beast which have attack they reindeer herd he notice a young native come run from the direction of the sea he pause now and again to shout : tomaus tomaus which be the native call for the arrival of a boat instantly the crowd be throw into commotion native rush hither and thither but the white man realize at once that this could mean nothing less than the return of the submarine and while they do not at all understand it they whoop they joy and rush toward the shore to see a dark body round the point the sub the sub hurray hurray they shout toss they cap high in air and the submarine indeed it be dave and jarvi be overjoy to rejoin they companion the story of adventure be soon tell and then everyone be set to hustle the last bit of equipment on board there would be neither meal nor sleep until everything be in readiness and they be away as the doctor and dave stand on deck watch the casting off of the rope the doctor speak of he plan we may have lose the race he remark rather grimly but we be go to the pole just the same it will mean something to you boy at least to be able to say that you have be there it be my purpose to lay we course directly for the pole without establish a base but since we have be carry out of we way so far and have use so much fuel i feel that it will be wise to head for the farthest-north point of alaska -- point barrow i be assure in nome that there be two oil-burning whaler winter near there and i have no doubt that we can depend on they for extra fuel the hatch be lower the submarine sink from sight amid the ah-ne-ca 's and mat-na 's of the awe stricken native who line the cliff a half-mile away the sub with all on board be again on its way to enter the race for the pole the race be on say dave i wonder smile the doctor three time they rise in dark waterway for air the fourth time it seem they must be near land -- yes as the submarine bump the edge of a ice-floe a point of land show plainly to port dave with field-glass in hand spring to the nearest ice-cake then climb to a pinnacle to take a observation clear water to the left of we he report too close ashore ask the doctor i think not be dave 's answer we 'll have to submerge for three or four mile then we 'll be clear of the ice signal bell clang and again they be glide under the ocean 's armor of ice as he listen to the hum of the machinery one question puzzle dave he have see something along the end of that ice-floe what be it a sail if so it be a very strange one -- half white and half black he could not be sure it be a sail but what else could it have be but now they have sweep out from under the ice it be time to rise instantly he press the button the craft slow again another press and as before they rise this time no white surface would interrupt they a current come from land catch they forward and tilted the craft she slant from fore to aft this do not matter she would right herself on the surface like a cork but what be this as the point shot from the water something ring out against the steel this be follow immediately by what in the narrow apartment amount to a deafening explosion then come the sound of rush water great god we be bomb shout the doctor dave 's cool head save they for the moment he hand seize a electric switch and he pull it desperately the bow compartment be quickly close check the rush of water into the rest of the sub fortunately no one have be forward at the time but now they be sink rapidly then come the throb of the pump force out the water from the compartment aft slowly the sickening sinking of they ship be check will she rise again ask the doctor white-faced but cool i think so sir respond dave dave watch a gauge with anxious eye the pump be still work would the craft stand the test would she rise one two three minute he watch the dial then a fervent thank god escape he lip the sub be rise again but once more he brow be cloud what await they on the surface one more he mutter just one more and we be do for every man aboard the submarine have a different explanation for the bomb which have disable they craft jone the electrician have just finish read the adventure of a young british gunner in these very water somewhere back in the eighty the story have to do with the defense of seal fishery against the jap and jone be sure that a japanese seal-poaching boat have bomb they mcpherson who have see active service chase german sub be certain they have encounter one of the miss u boat wilder believe it have be a russian cruiser and of course jarvi blame it to the bloomin ' ` eathen the first and third of these theory could be discard at once since no craft be to be see when last they submerge and a cruiser or schooner of any size could scarcely have escape they attention as for dave he have another theory but be too busy to talk about it he have read a great deal regard the eskimo and they method of hunting meanwhile the submarine be rise slowly toward the surface she be come up with she stern tilted high this time for the water in she forward compartment disturb she balance every heart beat fast as the water above grow lighter mcpherson be ready to throw open the hatch the minute we be clear command dave all life belt on he ask aye aye sir come in chorus rifle at hand sir ready then there come a sudden burst of light the creak of hinge the thud of the hatch then the thud of foot as the man rush for the deck in another moment the crew find themselves outside cling to the tilted and unsteady craft blinking in the sunlight and see -- principally white ice and dark water off in the distance indeed be a innocent-looking native skin-boat there be perhaps ten native aboard think so chuckled dave you think what demand the doctor every eye be turn on the young commander think we would be shoot by native with a whale-gun take we for a whale do not you see whale-gun throw a bomb that explode inside the whale and kill he in this case it explode against we and raise the very old dickens here they come you 'll see i be right and he be right the crew of christianize native be soon alongside very humble in they apology and very anxious to assist in undoing the damage they have work have we any extra steel plate ask the doctor yes sir have to be shape though reply dave can we do it i think so on shore all right then get these native to give we a hand and we 'll go on the sand-bar for repair bad cess to the whaling industry of the eskimo it be lose we a full two day and perhaps the race but we must not give up thing can happen to airplane as well it take a hard half-day 's work to bring the craft to land but at last the task be do and the mechanic be hammer merrily away on the steel with acetylene torch sputtering and forty native stand about open-mouthed exclaim at everything that happen and offer profound explanation in they own droll way chapter xv the mystery cavern once they craft be repair the submarine party push northward at a average rate of ten mile a hour it be two day before any further adventure cross they path but each hour of the journey have its new thrill and add charm now with engine in full throb they be scurry along narrow channel of dark water and now submerge for a sub-sea journey now shadowy object shoot past they and dave utter a prayer that they might not mix with the propeller -- seal walrus or white whale whatever they might be in he mind at such time he have vision of float beneath the arctic pack powerless to go ahead or backward and as powerless to break through the ice to freedom wonderful change light be ever filter through ice and water to they and at time as they drive slowly forward the light and shadow seem to have a motion of they own a restless shift like the play of sunlight and shadow beneath the tree dave know this be no work of the imagination he know that the ice above they be the plaything of current and wind that great cake many yard wide and eight foot thick be grind and pile one upon another once more he brow wrinkle for he say to himself it may be true enough that the average ice-floe be only twenty-five mile wide but if the wind and current jam a lot of they together what limit can there be to they extent and if we be to find ourselves in the center of such a vast field of ice with oxygen exhaust what chance would we have dave shudder in answer to the question he be think of these thing on the eve of the second day they be plow peacefully through the water when of a sudden there come a grate blow at the side of the craft it be as if they have strike some solid object and glance off what be that exclaim the boy he cut the power then turn to the doctor : ice or -- there it go again exclaim the doctor this time the blow be heavier it send they against the side of the compartment ice beneath the ocean impossible exclaim the doctor must be rock another blow hurl they in the opposite direction both realize the gravity of this new peril if one of these blow catch the craft squarely it would crush the sub like a egg-shell but the boat be slow up there be hope in that dave attempt to look out of one of the porthole be throw to the floor by another shock and this time the craft seem to have stick for she do not move where can we be ask dave rub a bruised head it be a strange sight which meet they eye as they look from the con tower on every side appear to be giant pillar of ice between these be narrow water passage while above they could make out a mass of ice far more opaque than any they have yet pass beneath one of two thing say the doctor we be beneath a iceberg or the end of a glacier probably a glacier and the pillar which support it reach to the bottom which must not be far below we we have drive between two pillar and stick there like a mouse in a trap say dave and if we can not set ourselves free we be -- it must be do exclaim the doctor start the power slowly and see what the propeller will do dave give the signal there follow a harsh grating sound but the boat do not move stuck muttered dave not so fast say the doctor there be hope yet shut off the power and order all hand aft now say the doctor when they be assemble we will go to the starboard side then all together dash to port and throw we weight against the side then turn and rush back -- we want to make she roll be you ready go the craft stir a trifle at the shock the second attempt seem to promise still better after they have repeat the operation half a dozen time they be get considerable side-wise movement out of the trap submarine now say the doctor start the power slowly engine reverse the instant she be free shut off the power on the precision of this operation depend all we life for should the propeller strike one of those pillar it will be tear away and we hope of escape go dave 's hand tremble as he move the lever for one second the propeller spin around then with a shudder the craft start backward that instant dave shut off the power the submarine drift free so far they be safe the doctor consult he watch time of low tide he observe guess we should be able to rise and get some air try it slowly they rise to the surface and there the craft rest it be a eager throng that rush from the conning-tower and it be a wonderful and awe-inspiring sight which meet they gaze cathedral of the polar god exclaim the doctor and indeed so the great cavern seem to be great pillar of ice not yet worn away by the wash of water support giant arch of ice blue as a mid-june night the least echo be echo and reechoe through the vast corridor the murmur of distant wave seem to come from everywhere what i want to know say dave be which way be out the careless god seem to have neglect to mark the exit we 'll find a exit say the doctor and we would better be about it for it 'll be much easier at low-tide than at high the engine be start and slowly they steer they way through countless aisle and broad hall but the finding of the way out do not seem so easy after all they have penetrate far enough into the cavern to hide they from the pale outer moonlight and they be not certain that they course be not take they farther from it dave be think of turn about when the sub come to a stop with a suddenness which threaten to pitch the party into the sea what now demand the doctor order the power shut off then flash a light before they dave exclaim : a beach a sandy beach then with the enthusiasm of a boy he spring forward leap into shallow water and wade ashore once ashore he flash he light about in the icy cavern which leave but a narrow sandy beach then with a cry of horror he spring backward before he tower a immense hairy monster with tusk three time the length of a man 's arm the instant the cry have leave he lip he know the laugh be on he but the cry have go forth echo through the corridor it bring the jacky and the doctor splash through the water to he rescue only a frozen mastodon he grin sheepishly as they come to he side guess he be be dead ten thousand year to say the least but honest do not he look natural standing there in the ice he flash the light suddenly upon the ice-encased monster and the jacky jump as if they too expect to be attack a beautiful corpse i would say exclaim one of they a most remarkable specimen comment the doctor i have hear of case like this but never see one before say exclaimed jone if we could only get he out of here like that and put he down in alcohol we would have a side-show that would make barnum jump out of he grave not a bad idea say the doctor the only hitch would be get he out of here as dave back away for a better view he foot strike something hard flash he light upon it he find it to be the skull and tusk of a walrus they be as black as coal i have make a find he exclaim these tusk we may take with we and old ivory be about as valuable as precious stone the discovery seem to waken the doctor to they peril that walrus he say wander in here and be drown by the rise tide he can breathe under water but can not stay down over ten minute we can not breathe at all under water the tide be set in these word send the crew scurry back to the submarine already the tide have rise sufficiently to float the craft all hand hasten to re-embark if we set we course directly at right-angle to this beach and keep it there say dave it should bring we to safety this be do and after many a turn and twist they catch a gleam of light submerge they be soon beneath the ice-floe once more with a sigh of relief dave give the order to rise at the first water-hole there they might take they bearing a half-hour later the party be gather on the deck gaze away at a island above which there tower a snow-capped mountain down the side of the mountain might be distinguish the wind blue course of a great glacier we glacier say dave some glacier i 'll say we glacier repeat a jackie long may she glide the course be set at a angle to the island this would carry they past any treacherous sand-bar they would then take another tack and resume they former course at a few minute before noon that day they rise far from the island the sun a pale yellow disk shone through a thin haze close to the surface of the pack and yet it be high noon this be perhaps to be they last bearing take by the light of the sun henceforth the moon and the star must guide they whereas all former polar expedition be carry forward only during the summer month when the sun shone night and day they as well as they rival must drive on straight into the deep mystery of the dreaded arctic night chapter xvi wreck all aboard change here for all way station we next stop be the pole barney the daring aviator sing the word cheerfully as he settle himself in he place at the wheel he hardly feel the cheerfulness he tone imply true they have spend twelve day repair the damage do to the plane by the wind and its collision with the white bear but it be a rather patched-up affair now it be finish -- as it need must be with the few material and tool at they command as he have express it to bruce only the night before : they have a cripple wing and a bird with a broken pinion never soar so high again even if it be a bird of fabric wood and steel however he be truly glad to be get away on what they hope might be they last lap the grave-like silence of the arctic with its glistening whiteness everywhere have grip he nerve well here 's hope he murmur to bruce as the plane hop off as for the major he sit with face fix as a bronze statue he gaze be toward the pole for fourteen hour they soar steadily onward only the air which grow crisper and more stinging as they advance steadily northward tell they they be near the pole observation from the plane be impossible the sun which have be appear less and less each day be now quite lose to they only the moon in all its glory tint the blue ice-pile with waver ghost color the wind for once be still not a bird appear in the sky not a animal meet the gaze of they binoculars as they peer below it be as if the whole northern realm have become suddenly silent at the magnificent spectacle of three man sailing alone over space never yet travel by man and where danger lurk at every turn the plane too be surprising its driver it answer he least touch on the lever control the engine be work perfectly only now and again he catch a faint lurch which tell he practiced sens that some of the rudely improvise splice be work loose even these give he no great alarm at least they do not seem sufficiently serious to warrant a immediate landing but suddenly as they be soar over the wildest most treacherous-looking stretch of floe ice that eye have ever rest upon the plane give a lurch a shudder run through she from wing to wing and with a plunge she shoot side-wise the outer half of she right wing have double up on the inner half like a blade to a jack-knife bruce take in the situation at a glance before a hand could stop he he have unbuckle he strap and creep to the extremity of the remain half of the wing he cling there thus add he weight to its balance power already barney have shut off the engine with the add weight to the right the plane become steadier danger of a whirling spin to the ice-surface seem for the time avert what a landing-place groan barney almost touch the start lever in he eagerness to save the plane but he stay he hand to start the engine under such condition would be madness some form of landing they must make even if it be but to crash so they speed steadily downward realize that the goal they seek must now with the aid of they dog-team be easily within they grasp yet realize also that all means of return be likely to be deny they unless indeed one be to call five dog a means of travel over hundred of mile of tangled tumble mountain of ice suddenly barney 's heart leap for joy just before they within possible area of landing lay a perfectly level stretch of ice it be not large be in fact perilously small yet it offer a possible landing tilt the left plane to its utmost adjust the tail barney glide onward with bated breath he see the white plain rise to meet they with tremble hand he touch a lever here a button there then -- a jar -- the landing-wheel have touch they touch again the move plane fairly eat up the scant level space yet she slow and slow until at last with hardly a tremor she rest against the outcropping ridge of ice at the floe 's edge with a glowing smile the major unstrapped himself to reach out he hand in thanks and congratulation to he pilot but -- where be they they have disappear he find they in front of the plane call to he for assistance then he see the danger they more practiced eye have already notice the ice at this point be pile at this moment the very cake against which they have stop be begin to rise within a space of moment the plane unless turn and thrust backward would be crushed beneath hundred of ton of ice if we can get she back we can save she panted bruce swing she shout barney throw he whole strength against the right wing now she move yell bruce joyously now heave ho the great craft turn slowly on she wheel now the plane be clear the ice now -- now in just a second -- she would be safe but no -- the right wheel catch in a ice-crevice three desperate effort they make to free she then just as the giant cake tower crumble above they the major shout the word of warn that send they leap back to safety but cost they they machine true it stand there still the mechanism be perfect the engine uninjured but the right wing be completely demolish bury beneath ton and ton of ice the craft that have carry they so far be crush beyond all hope of repair with despair tug at they heart the three stand look at the wreckage but they be not of the breed that quit we would better get we stuff and what be left of the plane out of the way of danger say bruce at length the stuff -- blanket grub and the like yes but -- barney smile in spite of himself -- why the plane she be do for because say bruce you can never tell what will happen the pressure which be pile the ice diminish rapidly and the back edge of the cake prove a safe place to make camp soon they be boil tea over a small oil stove and discuss the future as calmly as they might have do have they be in the old office-shack back on the hudson bay railroad now to find where we be exclaim the major knock the tea leave from he cup the interest in this project be keen after work out he reckon estimate the speed of they flight and count the hour they have be in the air the major lay down he pencil fifty mile southeast of the pole he say at last shall we attempt to go on or turn back the boy look at one another bruce read in he companion ' eye the desire to attempt the return with the dog-team at the same time he realize that the real genius of a explorer lay in he desire to push on the major have that genius as for I bruce say finally i never decide anything of great importance until i have sleep over it barney smile in spite of he anxiety and weariness but the major see the strained expression in the boy ' face realize that the ultimatum of bruce be a good one soon the three companion be snug in they sleeping-bag dream of a land of grass and flower far far away \* \* \* \* \* as soon as the submarine be safely on its course after the glacier incident dave who have not sleep for many hour turn in for three wink he three wink have stretch on into hour when he be waken by a sudden jarring that shake the craft from stem to stern he be on he foot in the passage-way at once what happen he demand of a sailor blame if i know say the other he be white as a sheet one thing dave make sure of as he hurry toward the wheel-room they be drift under the ice-floor of the ocean be the motor simply dead or be the propeller go he have but a instant to wait there come the purr of the motor then the sudden sound of race machinery which tell plainer than word that the worst have happen i think it be a walrus sir say rainey who have be in charge of the wheel-room i have just catch sight of a dark blotch glide by and reach for the power when the racket start what be you make ask dave quietly we usual ten knot the compartment they be in be fill with lever and adjust wheel of all description the wall be line with gauge and dial of many style and size a person on enter and take the operator 's position might fancy himself in the center of a circle of gear and drive wheel of many automobile dave glance at a gauge then at another he touch a wheel and the hand on the second dial begin to drop they be now rise as a usual thing they travel some forty foot below the surface iceberg be scarce in these water and the ordinary floe do not lie more than twenty foot below sea-level still it be safer lower down but now -- now they safety rest in glide to a point beneath a water channel or hole and once they be under it they must not fail to rise no not if it take we conning-tower to do it dave say savagely as he finish explain they be still drift through the water at a rather rapid rate but little by little a speed gauge be fall soon they would be lie motionless beneath the arctic floe as helpless as a dead whale and should no dark water-hole appear before that time come they be doom dave wipe the cold perspiration from he brow as the hand on the dial drop lower and lower he touch a wheel again and they rise another ten foot must be nearly bump the ice by now but at such a time as this one take risk he mutter what be that do he sense the dark shadow which always presage open water surely if walrus be about there must be open water to give they air and yes -- there it be a hole in the floe he tremble hand again touch the wheel the hand on the dial have drop to nearly nothing if the water-hole be narrow if they miss it but no -- up -- up they shoot and in just another moment man be swarm from the conning-tower say exclaim dave wipe he forehead do you remember the obstacle-race they use to have at county fair when you be a boy the jackie he speak to grin and nod well this be a obstacle-race and the worst i ever see the worst of it be there be two prize -- one 's the pole and the other we own life the open water they have reach at so fortunate a moment prove to be a channel between floe they be in no immediate danger now but to repair the damage do to the shaft and adjust a new propeller it be necessary that they drag the submarine to the surface of a broad ice-cake this task be not as difficult as one might imagine with the aid of ice-anchors iron pulley and cable they without much delay harness they engine and finish the job all ship shape look say one of the seaman point at the narrow stretch of water she be closin ' in as the man look they know it to be true the channel be certainly narrower than when they first rise upon its surface secure a light line the doctor attach it to a plummet throw the plummet across the space he draw the line taut he then mark the point where the ice-line cross it then for five minute he divide he attention between the line and he watch as he rise he mutter two hour two hour how long will it take to complete the repair four hour at least dave reply calmly then we be defeat the doctor begin pacing the surface of the ice we be stick -- beat in two hour the channel will be close and there be not another patch of open water within five mile if dave seem unnaturally calm on receipt of such news it be because he have in he bag of trick one of which the doctor be not aware while in nome he have make the acquaintance of a former british seaman who have cruise arctic water in the late eighty when japan be dispute the rights of great britain and the united state to close the seal fishery this man have tell he how the gunboat have open they way through the ice-floe the idea have appeal to the young skipper consequently on board the submarine he have carry under he arm a package which he handle very carefully and finally deposit in the very center of a great bale of fur clothing there it still remain i suppose i might tell he he say to himself but i guess i will not ` bless be he that expecteth nothing ' the trick might not work i 'll wait he turn to where the mechanic be hard at work adjust the new propeller the repair have go on for something over two hour the water-channel have completely close the doctor be pacing the ice lose in reflection like a flash there come into dave 's mind a new problem : would the current be content merely to close the channel or would the ice soon begin to buckle and pile with a uneasy mind he urge the workman to hasten at the same time keep a eye on the line of ice where the channel have so lately be chapter xvii so this be the pole many of the disaster which threaten we in this life pass we by so it be with the impending disaster of pile ice near the submarine it do not pile but there remain the problem of get the submarine through that six-foot roof to the water beneath how be it to be do the doctor still pace back and forth he unrest write in the furrow of he brow the jacky cheerful as ever work at they shift of repair the craft or when not at work play at duck-on-rock with chunk of ice once a seal appear in a water-hole have he not depart promptly there would have be fry seal steak and roast seal heart for supper a lumbering bear that have evidently never see a human be before be not so fortunate he pelt be add to the trophy of the expedition and he meat be ground into rather tough hamburger finally the mechanic announce that the submarine be again in perfect condition now be the time to try dave 's last trick send three man to stretch a hundred-fathom cable from the submarine and to anchor its farther end to a great ice-pan he drop below to return at once with a package caution the man not to follow he he walk away seventy-five yard bent over the center of a ice-pan seemingly to adjust certain thing and put other in order this do he string a black cord-like affair from he little pile of object he then measure off ten pace and repeat these operation he then light a small gasoline torch and hold the tip of the second cord-like affair to it then race to the other for the same purpose when this be do he speed away toward he companion he action be quickly understand by the watch crew the furrow on the doctor 's brow have become mere line he be smile hopefully when dave trip over a ice boulder there be a cry of alarm but he be up in a second and find shelter with he man instinctively everyone duck then come two roar explosion in quick succession bit of splintered ice fall around they like hail before the ice fragment have cease fall everyone be climb to the top of the ice-pile what they see cause a shout of joy where the ice-pan have be be a long stretch of black water that slowly widen until it be quite large enough to float the submarine and allow it to submerge at once every man be at he task the submarine move slowly toward the water there follow a dip a great splash a wild hurrah and five minute later they be once more on they way to the pole but during this time dave 's active mind have be work on another problem which might appear to have be settle but have not be : the drift of the floe if the ice do not pile when the floe come together why be it it seem to he there could be but one answer other water-channel beyond the drift under which they now travel be be close by counter-current and if they close one after the other more rapidly than the advance of the submarine what be finally to become of the submarine crew would they not perish for lack of air dave do not share the cheerful mood of the doctor and the crew it be he turn to look worried many hour later he worst fear have be realize he find himself again in the little room of many wheel and dial hour after hour they have shoot beneath the vary surface of the floe but not for one hopeful second have they catch the dark shadow of open water as near as he could reckon allow for the ever-present current dave believe they be near the pole but he brain be now throb as if a hundred trip-hammer be pound upon it moment alone would tell the tale for the oxygen in the air be exhaust already half the crew be unconscious other be reel like drunken man the doctor have be the first to succumb to the poison of polluted air in this crisis dave be not alone at the wheel the eskimo boy azazruk be by he side it be for just such a time as this that he have teach the bright young native something of the control of the mechanism each wheel of the operating device be number he have teach the eskimo a formulum by pains-taking repetition if ever the time come when all be sick no one can move but you he have say many time and if at that time you see black water above act quickly one -- seven -- ten -- three -- five remember that one wheel at a time quickly but surely one -- seven -- ten -- three -- five one -- seven -- ten -- three -- five the eskimo boy have faithfully repeat after he and roll he eye half in amusement and half in terror wheel one be for rise seven for fan ten to stop three to lift the outer-hatch five the inner-hatch dave have explain but you only need to remember one -- seven -- ten -- three -- five somehow dave have come to believe that this hardy young alaskan rear as he have be under perfect condition of food air light and exercise could if the test ever come survive he civilized companion now as he reel and a great wave of dizzy sickness come over he while he sink to the floor dave be glad he have teach azazruk for the boy with a strange strained look of terror in he eye stand still at the wheel dimly he feel rather than see a dark shadow pass over they as in a dream he whisper the magic formulum : one -- seven -- ten -- three -- five faintly he hear the grind of the wheel feel the fan 's breath on he cheek then all be lose in unconsciousness \* \* \* \* \* after ten solid hour of sleep the airplane party awake to find they dog whine and paw at the entrance to they shelter guess they be hungry say barney rub he eye sleepily now if we could only locate a seal in some water-hole it would help out we scanty supply of food suppose we try say bruce slip into he skin garment and look to he rifle all right say barney and without delay they be hurry to a pressure ridge of ice from whose top they might hope to locate the nearest water-lead this take they some distance from they camp but since the air be still and the moon flood everything with light as of day this do not worry they they have reach the height and be scan the long lead of water something like a mile to the left of they when bruce give a cry of surprise and point to the south end of the lead exclaim : what be that immense black thing rise from the water can not be a whale up here can it impossible and look there be something rise from the center of it it can not be -- yes -- it be it be the submarine barney tumble from the ice ridge and go sprint away over the ice he boyhood pal dave tower be on that submarine with greater deliberation bruce attract the attention of the major together they hurry after they companion the sight that meet they eye as they reach the edge of the water-channel fill they with consternation the eskimo boy and barney be hurriedly carry limp motionless form from the submarine into the outer air they worst fear be groundless however for after two hour of faithful work they restore the last one of the crew to consciousness the last to recover be the doctor which go to prove smile dave that when you most need a doctor that be the time he be most likely to be sick there be a moment of joyful reunion between the two pal barney and dave as for the explorer after the danger have pass they seem to take little notice of one another the doctor soon be able to rise unsteadily and support by two of he man he drag himself back and forth across the ice when at last he have full possession of he faculty he suddenly dart into the submarine reappear a moment later with instrument at sight of these the major 's attention once more turn to the task he have leave with back turn not twenty yard apart the two great rival begin take observation carefully they spread line of mercury for a artificial horizon and painstakingly adjust they instrument begin to take reading then turn to they nautical almanac they figure for some time a awed silence fall on the little group presently the two man rise face one another smile play about they lip for a second they stand thus then start toward each other they extend hand for a clasp -- the grip of a mutual admiration gentleman say the major the huskiness in he voice betray he emotion we be now within five mile of the pole and that be as close a observation as any man can hope to make might as well call it the pole
