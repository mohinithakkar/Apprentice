bald crown he look so timid and nervous as he fidget incessantly with a piece of string he long lean and tremble finger tie and untie it into knot of wonderful and complicated proportion have carefully study every detail of the quaint personality polly feel more amiable and yet she remark kindly but authoritatively this article in a otherwise well-informed journal will tell you that even within the last year no fewer than six crime have completely baffle the police and the perpetrator of they be still at large pardon I he say gently i never for a moment venture to suggest that there be no mystery to the _ police _ i merely remark that there be none where intelligence be bring to bear upon the investigation of crime not even in the fenchurch street _ mystery _ i suppose she ask sarcastically least of all in the so-called fenchurch street _ mystery _ he reply quietly now the fenchurch street mystery as that extraordinary crime have popularly be call have puzzle -- as polly well know -- the brain of every thinking man and woman for the last twelve month it have puzzle she not inconsiderably she have be interested fascinate she have study the case form she own theory think about it all often and often have even write one or two letter to the press on the subject -- suggest argue hint at possibility and probability adduce proof which other amateur detective be equally ready to refute the attitude of that timid man in the corner therefore be peculiarly exasperating and she retort with sarcasm destine to completely annihilate she self-complacent interlocutor what a pity it be in that case that you do not offer you priceless service to we misguided though well-meaning police be not it he reply with perfect good-humour well you know for one thing i doubt if they would accept they and in the second place my inclination and my duty would -- be i to become a active member of the detective force -- nearly always be in direct conflict as often as not my sympathy go to the criminal who be clever and astute enough to lead we entire police force by the nose i do not know how much of the case you remember he go on quietly it certainly at first begin even to puzzle I on the 12th of last December a woman poorly dress but with a unmistakable air of have see better day give information at scotland yard of the disappearance of she husband william kershaw of no occupation and apparently of no fixed abode she be accompany by a friend -- a fat oily-looking german -- and between they they tell a tale which set the police immediately on the move it appear that on the 10th of December at about three o'clock in the afternoon karl müller the german call on he friend william kershaw for the purpose of collect a small debt -- some ten pound or so -- which the latter owe he on arrive at the squalid lodging in charlotte street fitzroy square he find william kershaw in a wild state of excitement and he wife in tear müller attempt to state the object of he visit but kershaw with wild gesture wave he aside and -- in he own word -- flabbergast he by ask he point-blank for another loan of two pound which sum he declare would be the means of a speedy fortune for himself and the friend who would help he in he need after a quarter of a hour spend in obscure hint kershaw find the cautious german obdurate decide to let he into the secret plan which he aver would place thousand into they hand instinctively polly have put down she paper the mild stranger with he nervous air and timid watery eye have a peculiar way of tell he tale which somehow fascinate she i do not know he resume if you remember the story which the german tell to the police and which be corroborate in every detail by the wife or widow briefly it be this : some thirty year previously kershaw then twenty year of age and a medical student at one of the london hospital have a chum name barker with whom he room together with another the latter so it appear bring home one evening a very considerable sum of money which he have win on the turf and the follow morning he be find murder in he bed kershaw fortunately for himself be able to prove a conclusive _ alibi _ he have spend the night on duty at the hospital as for barker he have disappear that be to say as far as the police be concerned but not as far as the watchful eye of he friend kershaw be able to spy -- at least so the latter say barker very cleverly contrived to get away out of the country and after sundry vicissitude finally settle down at vladivostok in eastern siberium where under the assume name of smethurst he build up a enormous fortune by trading in fur now mind you every one know smethurst the siberian millionaire kershaw 's story that he have once be call barker and have commit a murder thirty year ago be never prove be it i be merely tell you what kershaw say to he friend the german and to he wife on that memorable afternoon of December the 10th accord to he smethurst have make one gigantic mistake in he clever career -- he have on four occasion write to he late friend william kershaw two of these letter have no bearing on the case since they be write more than twenty-five year ago and kershaw moreover have lose they -- so he say -- long ago accord to he however the first of these letter be write when smethurst alia barker have spend all the money he have obtain from the crime and find himself destitute in new york kershaw then in fairly prosperous circumstance send he a # 10 note for the sake of old time the second when the table have turn and kershaw have begin to go downhill smethurst as he then already call himself send he whilom friend # 50 after that as müller gather kershaw have make sundry demand on smethurst 's ever-increasing purse and have accompany these demand by various threat which consider the distant country in which the millionaire live be worse than futile but now the climax have come and kershaw after a final moment of hesitation handed over to he german friend the two last letter purport to have be write by smethurst and which if you remember play such a important part in the mysterious story of this extraordinary crime i have a copy of both these letter here add the man in the corner as he take out a piece of paper from a very worn-out pocket-book and unfold it very deliberately he begin to read : -- ` sir -- you preposterous demand for money be wholly unwarrantable i have already help you quite as much as you deserve however for the sake of old time and because you once help I when i be in a terrible difficulty i be willing to once more let you impose upon my good nature a friend of mine here a russian merchant to whom i have sell my business start in a few day for a extended tour to many european and asiatic port in he yacht and have invite I to accompany he as far as england be tire of foreign part and desirous of see the old country once again after thirty year ' absence i have decide to accept he invitation i do not know when we may actually be in europe but i promise you that as soon as we touch a suitable port i will write to you again make a appointment for you to see I in london but remember that if you demand be too preposterous i will not for a moment listen to they and that i be the last man in the world to submit to persistent and unwarrantable blackmail ' i be sir ` yours truly ` francis smethurst ' the second letter be date from southampton continue the old man in the corner calmly and curiously enough be the only letter which kershaw profess to have receive from smethurst of which he have keep the envelope and which be date it be quite brief he add refer once more to he piece of paper ` dear sir -- refer to my letter of a few week ago i wish to inform you that the _ tsarskoe selo _ will touch at tilbury on Tuesday next the 10th i shall land there and immediately go up to london by the first train i can get if you like you may meet I at fenchurch street station in the first-class waiting-room in the late afternoon since i surmise that after thirty year ' absence my face may not be familiar to you i may as well tell you that you will recognize I by a heavy astrakhan fur coat which i shall wear together with a cap of the same you may then introduce yourself to I and i will personally listen to what you may have to say ` yours faithfully ` francis smethurst ' it be this last letter which have cause william kershaw 's excitement and he wife 's tear in the german 's own word he be walk up and down the room like a wild beast gesticulate wildly and mutter sundry exclamation mr kershaw however be full of apprehension she mistrust the man from foreign part -- who accord to she husband 's story have already one crime upon he conscience -- who might she fear risk another in order to be rid of a dangerous enemy woman-like she think the scheme a dishonourable one for the law she know be severe on the blackmailer the assignation might be a cunning trap in any case it be a curious one why she argue do not smethurst elect to see kershaw at he hotel the follow day a thousand why and wherefore make she anxious but the fat german have be win over by kershaw 's vision of untold gold hold tantalisingly before he eye he have lend the necessary # 2 with which he friend intend to tidy himself up a bit before he go to meet he friend the millionaire half a hour afterwards kershaw have leave he lodgings and that be the last the unfortunate woman saw of she husband or müller the german of he friend anxiously he wife wait that night but he do not return the next day she seem to have spend in make purposeless and futile inquiry about the neighborhood of fenchurch street and on the 12th she go to scotland yard give what particulars she know and place in the hand of the police the two letter write by smethurst chapter ii a millionaire in the dock the man in the corner have finish he glass of milk he watery blue eye look across at miss polly burton 's eager little face from which all trace of severity have now be chase away by a obvious and intense excitement it be only on the 31st he resume after a while that a body decompose past all recognition be find by two lighterman in the bottom of a disused barge she have be moor at one time at the foot of one of those dark flight of step which lead down between tall warehouse to the river in the east end of london i have a photograph of the place here he add select one out of he pocket and place it before polly the actual barge you see have already be remove when i take this snapshot but you will realize what a perfect place this alley be for the purpose of one man cut another 's throat in comfort and without fear of detection the body as i say be decompose beyond all recognition it have probably be there eleven day but sundry article such as a silver ring and a tie pin be recognizable and be identify by mr kershaw as belong to she husband she of course be loud in denounce smethurst and the police have no doubt a very strong case against he for two day after the discovery of the body in the barge the siberian millionaire as he be already popularly call by enterprising interviewer be arrest in he luxurious suite of room at the hotel cecil to confess the truth at this point i be not a little puzzle mr kershaw 's story and smethurst 's letter have both find they way into the papers and follow my usual method -- mind you i be only a amateur i try to reason out a case for the love of the thing -- i seek about for a motive for the crime which the police declare smethurst have commit to effectually get rid of a dangerous blackmailer be the generally accept theory well do it ever strike you how paltry that motive really be miss polly have to confess however that it have never strike she in that light surely a man who have succeed in build up a immense fortune by he own individual effort be not the sort of fool to believe that he have anything to fear from a man like kershaw he must have _ know _ that kershaw hold no damning proof against he -- not enough to hang he anyway have you ever see smethurst he add as he once more fumble in he pocket-book polly reply that she have see smethurst 's picture in the illustrated papers at the time then he add place a small photograph before she : what strike you most about the face well i think its strange astonished expression due to the total absence of eyebrow and the funny foreign cut of the hair so close that it almost look as if it have be shave exactly that be what strike I most when i elbowed my way into the court that morning and first catch sight of the millionaire in the dock he be a tall soldierly-looking man upright in stature he face very bronzed and tan he wear neither moustache nor beard he hair be crop quite close to he head like a frenchman 's but of course what be so very remarkable about he be that total absence of eyebrow and even eyelash which give the face such a peculiar appearance -- as you say a perpetually astonished look he seem however wonderfully calm he have be accommodate with a chair in the dock -- be a millionaire -- and chat pleasantly with he lawyer sir arthur inglewood in the interval between the calling of the several witness for the prosecution whilst during the examination of these witness he sit quite placidly with he head shaded by he hand müller and mr kershaw repeat the story which they have already tell to the police i think you say that you be not able owe to pressure of work to go to the court that day and hear the case so perhaps you have no recollection of mr kershaw no ah well here be a snapshot i manage to get of she once that be she exactly as she stand in the box -- over-dressed -- in elaborate crape with a bonnet which once have contain pink rose and to which a remnant of pink petal still cling obtrusively amidst the deep black she would not look at the prisoner and turn she head resolutely towards the magistrate i fancy she have be fond of that vagabond husband of hers : a enormous wedding-ring encircle she finger and that too be swathe in black she firmly believe that kershaw 's murderer sit there in the dock and she literally flaunt she grief before he i be indescribably sorry for she as for müller he be just fat oily pompous conscious of he own importance as a witness he fat finger cover with brass ring grip the two incriminate letter which he have identify they be he passport as it be to a delightful land of importance and notoriety sir arthur inglewood i think disappointed he by state that he have no question to ask of he müller have be brimful of answer ready with the most perfect indictment the most elaborate accusation against the bloated millionaire who have decoy he dear friend kershaw and murder he in heaven know what a out-of-the-way corner of the east end after this however the excitement grow apace müller have be dismiss and have retire from the court altogether lead away mr kershaw who have completely break down constable d 21 be give evidence as to the arrest in the meanwhile the prisoner he say have seem completely take by surprise not understand the cause or history of the accusation against he however when put in full possession of the fact and realize no doubt the absolute futility of any resistance he have quietly enough follow the constable into the cab no one at the fashionable and crowded hotel cecil have even suspect that anything unusual have occur then a gigantic sigh of expectancy come from every one of the spectator the ` fun ' be about to begin jame buckland a porter at fenchurch street railway station have just swear to tell all the truth etc after all it do not amount to much he say that at six o'clock in the afternoon of December the 10th in the midst of one of the densest fog he ever remember the 55 from tilbury steam into the station be just about a hour late he be on the arrival platform and be hail by a passenger in a first-class carriage he could see very little of he beyond a enormous black fur coat and a travel cap of fur also the passenger have a quantity of luggage all marked f and he direct jame buckland to place it all upon a four-wheel cab with the exception of a small hand-bag which he carry himself have see that all he luggage be safely bestow the stranger in the fur coat pay the porter and tell the cabman to wait until he return he walk away in the direction of the waiting-room still carry he small hand-bag ' i stay for a bit ' add jame buckland ` talk to the driver about the fog and that then i go about my business seein ' that the local from southend ` ad be signal ' the prosecution insist most strongly upon the hour when the stranger in the fur coat have see to he luggage walk away towards the waiting-room the porter be emphatic ` it be not a minute later than 615 ' he aver sir arthur inglewood still have no question to ask and the driver of the cab be call he corroborate the evidence of jame buckland as to the hour when the gentleman in the fur coat have engage he and have fill he cab in and out with luggage have tell he to wait and cabby do wait he wait in the dense fog -- until he be tire until he seriously think of deposit all the luggage in the lose property office and of look out for another fare -- wait until at last at a quarter before nine whom should he see walk hurriedly towards he cab but the gentleman in the fur coat and cap who get in quickly and tell the driver to take he at once to the hotel cecil this cabby declare have occur at a quarter before nine still sir arthur inglewood make no comment and mr franci smethurst in the crowded stuffy court have calmly drop to sleep the next witness constable thoma taylor have notice a shabbily dress individual with shaggy hair and beard loaf about the station and waiting-room in the afternoon of December the 10th he seem to be watch the arrival platform of the tilbury and southend train two separate and independent witness cleverly unearth by the police have see this same shabbily dress individual stroll into the first-class waiting-room at about 615 on Wednesday December the 10th and go straight up to a gentleman in a heavy fur coat and cap who have also just come into the room the two talk together for a while no one hear what they say but presently they walk off together no one seem to know in which direction franci smethurst be rouse himself from he apathy he whisper to he lawyer who nod with a bland smile of encouragement the employés of the hotel cecil give evidence as to the arrival of mr smethurst at about 930 pm on Wednesday December the 10th in a cab with a quantity of luggage and this close the case for the prosecution everybody in that court already _ see _ smethurst mount the gallows it be uninterested curiosity which cause the elegant audience to wait and hear what sir arthur inglewood have to say he of course be the most fashionable man in the law at the present moment he loll attitude he drawling speech be quite the rage and imitate by the gilded youth of society even at this moment when the siberian millionaire 's neck literally and metaphorically hang in the balance a expectant titter go round the fair spectator as sir arthur stretch out he long loose limb and lounge across the table he wait to make he effect -- sir arthur be a bear actor -- and there be no doubt that he make it when in he slowest most drawly tone he say quietly ` with regard to this alleged murder of one william kershaw on Wednesday December the 10th between 615 and 845 pm you honor i now propose to call two witness who see this same william kershaw alive on Tuesday afternoon December the 16th that be to say six day after the suppose murder ' it be as if a bombshell have explode in the court even he honor be aghast and i be sure the lady next to I only recover from the shock of the surprise in order to wonder whether she need put off she dinner party after all as for I add the man in the corner with that strange mixture of nervousness and self-complacency which have set miss polly burton wonder well you see _ i _ have make up my mind long ago where the hitch lay in this particular case and i be not so surprised as some of the other perhaps you remember the wonderful development of the case which so completely mystify the police -- and in fact everybody except myself torrianus and a waiter at he hotel in the commercial road both depose that at about 330 pm on December the 10th a shabbily dress individual loll into the coffee-room and order some tea he be pleasant enough and talkative tell the waiter that he name be william kershaw that very soon all london would be talk about he as he be about through a unexpected stroke of good fortune to become a very rich man and so on and so on nonsense without end when he have finish he tea he loll out again but no sooner have he disappear down a turning of the road than the waiter discover a old umbrella leave behind accidentally by the shabby talkative individual as be the custom in he highly respectable restaurant signor torrianus put the umbrella carefully away in he office on the chance of he customer call to claim it when he have discover he loss and sure enough nearly a week later on Tuesday the 16th at about 1 pm the same shabbily dress individual call and ask for he umbrella he have some lunch and chat once again to the waiter signor torrianus and the waiter give a description of william kershaw which coincide exactly with that give by mr kershaw of she husband oddly enough he seem to be a very absent-minded sort of person for on this second occasion no sooner have he leave than the waiter find a pocket-book in the coffee-room underneath the table it contain sundry letter and bill all address to william kershaw this pocket-book be produce and karl müller who have return to the court easily identify it as have belong to he dear and lament friend ` villiam ' this be the first blow to the case against the accuse it be a pretty stiff one you will admit already it have begin to collapse like a house of card still there be the assignation and the undisputed meeting between smethurst and kershaw and those two and a half hour of a foggy evening to satisfactorily account for the man in the corner make a long pause keep the girl on tenterhooks he have fidget with he bit of string till there be not a inch of it free from the most complicated and elaborate knot i assure you he resume at last that at that very moment the whole mystery be to I as clear as daylight i only marvel how he honor could waste he time and mine by put what he think be search question to the accuse relate to he past franci smethurst who have quite shake off he somnolence speak with a curious nasal twang and with a almost imperceptible soupçon of foreign accent he calmly deny kershaw 's version of he past declare that he have never be call barker and have certainly never be mix up in any murder case thirty year ago ` but you know this man kershaw ' persist he honor ` since you write to he ' ` pardon I you honor ' say the accuse quietly ' i have never to my knowledge see this man kershaw and i can swear that i never write to he ' ` never write to he ' retort he honor warningly ` that be a strange assertion to make when i have two of you letter to he in my hand at the present moment ' ' i never write those letter you honor ' persist the accuse quietly ` they be not in my handwriting ' ` which we can easily prove ' come in sir arthur inglewood 's drawly tone as he hand up a packet to he honor ` here be a number of letter write by my client since he have land in this country and some of which be write under my very eye ' as sir arthur inglewood have say this could be easily prove and the prisoner at he honor 's request scribble a few line together with he signature several time upon a sheet of note-paper it be easy to read upon the magistrate 's astounded countenance that there be not the slightest similarity in the two handwriting a fresh mystery have crop up who then have make the assignation with william kershaw at fenchurch street railway station the prisoner give a fairly satisfactory account of the employment of he time since he landing in england ' i come over on the _ tsarskoe selo _ ' he say ' a yacht belong to a friend of mine when we arrive at the mouth of the thame there be such a dense fog that it be twenty-four hour before it be think safe for I to land my friend who be a russian would not land at all he be regularly frighten at this land of fog he be go on to madeira immediately ' i actually land on Tuesday the 10th and take a train at once for town i do see to my luggage and a cab as the porter and driver tell you honor then i try to find my way to a refreshment-room where i could get a glass of wine i drift into the waiting-room and there i be accost by a shabbily dress individual who begin tell I a piteous tale who he be i do not know he _ say _ he be a old soldier who have serve he country faithfully and then be leave to starve he beg of I to accompany he to he lodgings where i could see he wife and starving child and verify the truth and piteousness of he tale ` well you honor ' add the prisoner with noble frankness ` it be my first day in the old country i have come back after thirty year with my pocket full of gold and this be the first sad tale i have hear but i be a business man and do not want to be exactly do in the eye i follow my man through the fog out into the street he walk silently by my side for a time i have not a notion where i be ` suddenly i turn to he with some question and realize in a moment that my gentleman have give I the slip finding probably that i would not part with my money till i _ have _ see the starve wife and child he leave I to my fate and go in search of more willing bait ` the place where i find myself be dismal and desert i could see no trace of cab or omnibus i retrace my step and try to find my way back to the station only to find myself in worse and more desert neighborhood i become hopelessly lose and fog i do not wonder that two and a half hour elapse while i thus wander on in the dark and desert street my sole astonishment be that i ever find the station at all that night or rather close to it a policeman who show I the way ' ` but how do you account for kershaw know all you movement ' still persist he honor ` and he know the exact date of you arrival in england how do you account for these two letter in fact ' ' i can not account for it or they you honor ' reply the prisoner quietly ' i have prove to you have i not that i never write those letter and that the man -- er -- kershaw be he name -- be not murder by I ' ` can you tell I of anyone here or abroad who might have hear of you movement and of the date of you arrival ' ` my late employés at vladivostok of course know of my departure but none of they could have write these letter since none of they know a word of english ' ` then you can throw no light upon these mysterious letter you can not help the police in any way towards the clearing up of this strange affair ' ` the affair be as mysterious to I as to you honor and to the police of this country ' franci smethurst be discharge of course there be no semblance of evidence against he sufficient to commit he for trial the two overwhelming point of he defense which have completely route the prosecution be firstly the proof that he have never write the letter make the assignation and secondly the fact that the man suppose to have be murder on the 10th be see to be alive and well on the 16th but then who in the world be the mysterious individual who have apprise kershaw of the movement of smethurst the millionaire chapter iii he deduction the man in the corner cock he funny thin head on one side and look at polly then he take up he beloved bit of string and deliberately untied every knot he have make in it when it be quite smooth he lay it out upon the table i will take you if you like point by point along the line of reasoning which i follow myself and which will inevitably lead you as it lead I to the only possible solution of the mystery first take this point he say with nervous restlessness once more take up he bit of string and form with each point raise a series of knot which would have shame a navigate instructor obviously it be _ impossible _ for kershaw not to have be acquaint with smethurst since he be fully apprise of the latter 's arrival in england by two letter now it be clear to I from the first that _ no one _ could have write those two letter except smethurst you will argue that those letter be prove not to have be write by the man in the dock exactly remember kershaw be a careless man -- he have lose both envelope to he they be insignificant now it be never _ disprove _ that those letter be write by smethurst but -- suggest polly wait a minute he interrupt while knot number two appear upon the scene it be prove that six day after the murder william kershaw be alive and visit the torriani hotel where already he be know and where he conveniently leave a pocket-book behind so that there should be no mistake as to he identity but it be never question where mr franci smethurst the millionaire happen to spend that very same afternoon surely you do not mean gasp the girl one moment please he add triumphantly how do it come about that the landlord of the torriani hotel be bring into court at all how do sir arthur inglewood or rather he client know that william kershaw have on those two memorable occasion visit the hotel and that its landlord could bring such convincing evidence forward that would for ever exonerate the millionaire from the imputation of murder surely i argue the usual mean the police -- the police have keep the whole affair very dark until the arrest at the hotel cecil they do not put into the papers the usual : ` if anyone happen to know of the whereabouts etc etc ' have the landlord of that hotel hear of the disappearance of kershaw through the usual channel he would have put himself in communication with the police sir arthur inglewood produce he how do sir arthur inglewood come on he track surely you do not mean point number four he resume imperturbably mrs kershaw be never request to produce a specimen of she husband 's handwriting why because the police clever as you say they be never start on the right tack they believe william kershaw to have be murder they look for william kershaw on December the 31st what be presume to be the body of william kershaw be find by two lighterman : i have show you a photograph of the place where it be find dark and desert it be in all conscience be it not just the place where a bully and a coward would decoy a unsuspecting stranger murder he first then rob he of he valuable he papers he very identity and leave he there to rot the body be find in a disused barge which have be moor some time against the wall at the foot of these step it be in the last stage of decomposition and of course could not be identify but the police would have it that it be the body of william kershaw it never enter they head that it be the body of _ franci smethurst and that william kershaw be he murderer _ ah it be cleverly artistically conceive kershaw be a genius think of it all he disguise kershaw have a shaggy beard hair and moustache he shave up to he very eyebrow no wonder that even he wife do not recognize he across the court and remember she never see much of he face while he stand in the dock kershaw be shabby slouchy he stoop smethurst the millionaire might have serve in the prussian army then that lovely trait about go to revisit the torriani hotel just a few day ' grace in order to purchase moustache and beard and wig exactly similar to what he have himself shave off make up to look like himself splendid then leave the pocket-book behind he he he kershaw be not murder of course not he call at the torriani hotel six day after the murder whilst mr smethurst the millionaire hobnob in the park with duchess hang such a man fie he fumble for he hat with nervous tremble finger he hold it deferentially in he hand whilst he rise from the table polly watch he as he stride up to the desk and pay twopence for he glass of milk and he bun soon he disappear through the shop whilst she still find herself hopelessly bewilder with a number of snap-shot photograph before she still stare at a long piece of string smother from end to end in a series of knot as bewildering as irritating as puzzling as the man who have lately sit in the corner chapter iv the robbery in phillimore terrace whether miss polly burton really do expect to see the man in the corner that Saturday afternoon ` twere difficult to say certain it be that when she find she way to the table close by the window and realize that he be not there she feel conscious of a overwhelming sense of disappointment and yet during the whole of the week she have with more pride than wisdom avoid this particular abc shop i think you would not keep away very long say a quiet voice close to she ear she nearly lose she balance -- where in the world have he come from she certainly have not hear the slightest sound and yet there he sit in the corner like a veritable jack-in-the-box he mild blue eye stare apologetically at she he nervous finger toy with the inevitable bit of string the waitress bring he he glass of milk and a cheese-cake he eat it in silence while he piece of string lay idly beside he on the table when he have finish he fumble in he capacious pocket and draw out the inevitable pocket-book place a small photograph before the girl he say quietly : that be the back of the house in phillimore terrace which overlook adam and eve mew she look at the photograph then at he with a kindly look of indulgent expectancy you will notice that the row of back garden have each a exit into the mew these mew be build in the shape of a capital f the photograph be take look straight down the short horizontal line which end as you see in a _ cul-de-sac _ the bottom of the vertical line turn into phillimore terrace and the end of the upper long horizontal line into high street kensington now on that particular night or rather early morning of January 15th constable d 21 have turn into the mew from phillimore terrace stand for a moment at the angle form by the long vertical artery of the mew and the short horizontal one which as i observe before look on to the back garden of the terrace house and end in a _ cul-de-sac _ how long d 21 stand at that particular corner he could not exactly say but he think it must have be three or four minute before he notice a suspicious-looking individual shamble along under the shadow of the garden wall he be work he way cautiously in the direction of the _ cul-de-sac _ and d 21 also keep well within the shadow go noiselessly after he he have almost overtaken he -- be in fact not more than thirty yard from he -- when from out of one of the two end house -- no 22 phillimore terrace in fact -- a man in nothing but he night-shirt rush out excitedly and before d 21 have time to intervene literally throw himself upon the suspect individual rolling over and over with he on the hard cobble-stone and frantically shriek ` thief thief police ' it be some time before the constable succeed in rescue the tramp from the excited grip of he assailant and several minute before he could make himself hear ` there there that 'll do ' he manage to say at last as he give the man in the shirt a vigorous shove which silence he for the moment ` leave the man alone now you must not make that noise this time o ' night wakin ' up all the folk ' the unfortunate tramp who in the meanwhile have manage to get on to he foot again make no attempt to get away probably he think he would stand but a poor chance but the man in the shirt have partly recover he power of speech and be now blurt out jerky half -- intelligible sentence : ' i have be rob -- rob -- i -- that be -- my master -- mr knopf the desk be open -- the diamond go -- all in my charge -- and -- now they be steal that be the thief -- i 'll swear -- i hear he -- not three minute ago -- rush downstairs -- the door into the garden be smash -- i run across the garden -- he be sneak about here still -- thief thief police diamond constable do not let he go -- i 'll make you responsible if you let he go -- ' ` now then -- that 'll do ' admonish d 21 as soon as he could get a word in ` stop that row will you ' the man in the shirt be gradually recover from he excitement ` can i give this man in charge ' he ask ` what for ' ` burglary and housebreaking i hear he i tell you he must have mr knopf 's diamond about he at this moment ' ` where be mr knopf ' ` out of town ' groan the man in the shirt ` he go to brighton last night and leave I in charge and now this thief have be and -- ' the tramp shrug he shoulder and suddenly without a word he quietly begin take off he coat and waistcoat these he hand across to the constable eagerly the man in the shirt fall on they and turn the ragged pocket inside out from one of the window a hilarious voice make some facetious remark as the tramp with equal solemnity begin divest himself of he nether garment ` now then stop that nonsense ' pronounced d 21 severely ` what be you do here this time o ' night anyway ' ` the street o ' london be free to the public be not they ' query the tramp ` this do not lead nowhere my man ' ` then i have lose my way that be all ' growl the man surlily ` and p ` rap you 'll let I get along now ' by this time a couple of constable have appear upon the scene d 21 have no intention of lose sight of he friend the tramp and the man in the shirt have again make a dash for the latter 's collar at the bare idea that he should be allow to ` get along ' i think d 21 be alive to the humor of the situation he suggest that robertson -lrb- the man in the night-shirt -rrb- should go in and get some clothes on whilst he himself would wait for the inspector and the detective whom d 15 would send round from the station immediately poor robertson 's tooth be chatter with cold he have a violent fit of sneeze as d 21 hurry he into the house the latter with another constable remain to watch the burglared premise both back and front and d 15 take the wretched tramp to the station with a view to send a inspector and a detective round immediately when the two latter gentleman arrive at no 22 phillimore terrace they find poor old robertson in bed shiver and still quite blue he have get himself a hot drink but he eye be streaming and he voice be terribly husky d 21 have station himself in the dining-room where robertson have point the desk out to he with its broken lock and scatter contents robertson between he sneeze give what account he could of the event which happen immediately before the robbery he master mr ferdinand knopf he say be a diamond merchant and a bachelor he himself have be in mr knopf 's employ over fifteen year and be he only indoor servant a charwoman come every day to do the housework last night mr knopf dine at the house of mr shipman at no 26 lower down mr shipman be the great jeweller who have he place of business in south audley street by the last post there come a letter with the brighton postmark and marked ` urgent ' for mr knopf and he -lrb- robertson -rrb- be just wonder if he should run over to no 26 with it when he master return he give one glance at the contents of the letter ask for he abc railway guide and order he -lrb- robertson -rrb- to pack he bag at once and fetch he a cab ' i guess what it be ' continue robertson after another violent fit of sneeze ` mr knopf have a brother mr emile knopf to whom he be very much attach and who be a great invalid he generally go about from one seaside place to another he be now at brighton and have recently be very ill ` if you will take the trouble to go downstairs i think you will still find the letter lie on the hall table ' i read it after mr knopf leave it be not from he brother but from a gentleman who sign himself j collin md i do not remember the exact word but of course you 'll be able to read the letter -- mr j collin say he have be call in very suddenly to see mr emile knopf who he add have not many hour to live and have beg of the doctor to communicate at once with he brother in london ` before leave mr knopf warn I that there be some valuable in he desk -- diamond mostly and tell I to be particularly careful about lock up the house he often have leave I like this in charge of he premise and usually there have be diamond in he desk for mr knopf have no regular city office as he be a commercial traveller ' this briefly be the gist of the matter which robertson related to the inspector with many repetition and persistent volubility the detective and inspector before return to the station with they report think they would call at no 26 on mr shipman the great jeweller you remember of course add the man in the corner dreamily contemplate he bit of string the exciting development of this extraordinary case mr arthur shipman be the head of the firm of shipman and co the wealthy jeweller he be a widower and live very quietly by himself in he own old-fashioned way in the small kensington house leave it to he two married son to keep up the style and swagger befitting the representative of so wealthy a firm ' i have only known mr knopf a very little while ' he explain to the detective ` he sell I two or three stone once or twice i think but we be both single man and we have often dine together last night he dine with I he have that afternoon receive a very fine consignment of brazilian diamond as he tell I and know how beset i be with caller at my business place he have bring the stone with he hope perhaps to do a bit of trade over the nut and wine ' i buy # 25000 worth of he ' add the jeweller as if he be speak of so many farthing ` and give he a cheque across the dinner table for that amount i think we be both pleased with we bargain and we have a final bottle of '48 port over it together mr knopf leave I at about 930 for he know i go very early to bed and i take my new stock upstairs with I and lock it up in the safe i certainly hear nothing of the noise in the mew last night i sleep on the second floor in the front of the house and this be the first i have hear of poor mr knopf 's loss -- ' at this point of he narrative mr shipman very suddenly pause and he face become very pale with a hasty word of excuse he unceremoniously leave the room and the detective hear he run quickly upstairs less than two minute later mr shipman return there be no need for he to speak both the detective and the inspector guess the truth in a moment by the look upon he face ` the diamond ' he gasp ' i have be rob ' chapter v a night 's adventure now i must tell you continue the man in the corner that after i have read the account of the double robbery which appear in the early afternoon papers i set to work and have a good think -- yes he add with a smile note polly 's look at the bit of string on which he be still at work yes aid by this small adjunct to continue thought -- i make note as to how i should proceed to discover the clever thief who have carry off a small fortune in a single night of course my method be not those of a london detective he have he own way of go to work the one who be conduct this case question the unfortunate jeweller very closely about he servant and he household generally ' i have three servant ' explain mr shipman two of whom have be with I for many year one the housemaid be a fairly new comer -- she have be here about six month she come recommend by a friend and bear a excellent character she and the parlourmaid room together the cook who know I when i be a schoolboy sleep alone all three servant sleep on the floor above i lock the jewel up in the safe which stand in the dressing-room my key and watch i place as usual beside my bed as a rule i be a fairly light sleeper ' i can not understand how it could have happen -- but -- you have better come up and have a look at the safe the key must have be abstract from my bedside the safe open and the key replace -- all while i be fast asleep though i have no occasion to look into the safe until just now i should have discover my loss before go to business for i intend to take the diamond away with I -- ' the detective and the inspector go up to have a look at the safe the lock have in no way be tamper with -- it have be open with its own key the detective speak of chloroform but mr shipman declare that when he wake in the morning at about half-past seven there be no smell of chloroform in the room however the proceedings of the daring thief certainly point to the use of a anesthetic a examination of the premise bring to light the fact that the burglar have as in mr knopf 's house use the glass-panelled door from the garden as a means of entrance but in this instance he have carefully cut out the pane of glass with a diamond slip the bolt turn the key and walk in ` which among you servant know that you have the diamond in you house last night mr shipman ' ask the detective ` not one i should say ' reply the jeweller ` though perhaps the parlourmaid whilst wait at table may have hear I and mr knopf discuss we bargain ' ` would you object to my search all you servant ' box ' ` certainly not they would not object either i be sure they be perfectly honest ' the search of servant ' belongings be invariably a useless proceeding add the man in the corner with a shrug of the shoulder no one not even a latter-day domestic would be fool enough to keep steal property in the house however the usual farce be go through with more or less protest on the part of mr shipman 's servant and with the usual result the jeweller could give no further information the detective and inspector to do they justice do they work of investigation minutely and what be more intelligently it seem evident from they deduction that the burglar have commence proceedings on no 26 phillimore terrace and have then go on probably climb over the garden wall between the house to no 22 where he be almost catch in the act by robertson the fact be simple enough but the mystery remain as to the individual who have manage to glean the information of the presence of the diamond in both the house and the means which he have adopt to get that information it be obvious that the thief or thief know more about mr knopf 's affair than mr shipman 's since they have know how to use mr emile knopf 's name in order to get he brother out of the way it be now nearly ten o'clock and the detective have take leave of mr shipman go back to no 22 in order to ascertain whether mr knopf have come back the door be open by the old charwoman who say that she master have return and be have some breakfast in the dining-room mr ferdinand knopf be a middle-aged man with sallow complexion black hair and beard of obviously hebrew extraction he speak with a marked foreign accent but very courteously to the two official who he beg would excuse he if he go on with he breakfast ' i be fully prepare to hear the bad news ' he explain ` which my man robertson tell I when i arrive the letter i get last night be a bogus one there be no such person as j collin md my brother have never feel better in he life you will i be sure very soon trace the cunning writer of that epistle -- ah but i be in a rage i can tell you when i get to the metropole at brighton and find that emile my brother have never hear of any doctor collin ` the last train to town have go although i race back to the station as hard as i could poor old robertson he have a terrible cold ah yes my loss it be for I a very serious one if i have not make that lucky bargain with mr shipman last night i should perhaps at this moment be a ruin man ` the stone i have yesterday be firstly some magnificent brazilian these i sell to mr shipman mostly then i have some very good cape diamond -- all go and some quite special parisian of wonderful work and finish entrust to I for sale by a great french house i tell you sir my loss will be nearly # 10000 altogether i sell on commission and of course have to make good the loss ' he be evidently try to bear up manfully and as a business man should under he sad fate he refuse in any way to attach the slightest blame to he old and faithful servant robertson who have catch perhaps he death of cold in he zeal for he absent master as for any hint of suspicion fall even remotely upon the man the very idea appear to mr knopf absolutely preposterous with regard to the old charwoman mr knopf certainly know nothing about she beyond the fact that she have be recommend to he by one of the tradespeople in the neighborhood and seem perfectly honest respectable and sober about the tramp mr knopf know still less nor could he imagine how he or in fact anybody else could possibly know that he happen to have diamond in he house that night this certainly seem the great hitch in the case mr ferdinand knopf at the instance of the police later on go to the station and have a look at the suspect tramp he declare that he have never set eye on he before mr shipman on he way home from business in the afternoon have do likewise and make a similar statement bring before the magistrate the tramp give but a poor account of himself he give a name and address which latter of course prove to be false after that he absolutely refuse to speak he seem not to care whether he be keep in custody or not very soon even the police realize that for the present at any rate nothing could be get out of the suspect tramp mr franci howard the detective who have charge of the case though he would not admit it even to himself be at he wit ' end you must remember that the burglary through its very simplicity be a exceedingly mysterious affair the constable d 21 who have stand in adam and eve mew presumably while mr knopf 's house be be rob have see no one turn out from the _ cul-de-sac _ into the main passage of the mew the stable which immediately face the back entrance of the phillimore terrace house be all private one belong to resident in the neighborhood the coachman they family and all the groom who sleep in the stabling be rigidly watch and question one and all have see nothing hear nothing until robertson 's shriek have rouse they from they sleep as for the letter from brighton it be absolutely commonplace and write upon note-paper which the detective with machiavellian cunning trace to a stationer 's shop in west street but the trade at that particular shop be a very brisk one score of people have buy note-paper there similar to that on which the suppose doctor have write he tricky letter the handwriting be cramped perhaps a disguise one in any case except under very exceptional circumstance it could afford no clue to the identity of the thief needless to say the tramp when tell to write he name write a totally different and absolutely uneducated hand matter stand however in the same persistently mysterious state when a small discovery be make which suggest to mr franci howard a idea which if properly carry out would he hope inevitably bring the cunning burglar safely within the grasp of the police that be the discovery of a few of mr knopf 's diamond continue the man in the corner after a slight pause evidently trample into the ground by the thief whilst make he hurry exit through the garden of no 22 phillimore terrace at the end of this garden there be a small studio which have be build by a former owner of the house and behind it a small piece of waste ground about seven foot square which have once be a rockery and be still fill with large loose stone in the shadow of which earwig and woodlouse innumerable have make a happy hunting ground it be robertson who two day after the robbery have need of a large stone for some household purpose or other dislodge one from that piece of waste ground and find a few shine pebble beneath it mr knopf take they round to the police-station himself immediately and identify the stone as some of he parisian one later on the detective go to view the place where the find have be make and there conceive the plan upon which he build big cherish hope act upon the advice of mr franci howard the police decide to let the anonymous tramp out of he safe retreat within the station and to allow he to wander whithersoever he choose a good idea perhaps -- the presumption be that sooner or later if the man be in any way mix up with the cunning thief he would either rejoin he comrade or even lead the police to where the remnant of he hoard lay hidden needless to say he footstep be to be literally dog the wretched tramp on he discharge wander out of the yard wrap he thin coat round he shoulder for it be a bitterly cold afternoon he begin operation by turn into the town hall tavern for a good feed and a copious drink mr franci howard note that he seem to eye every passer-by with suspicion but he seem to enjoy he dinner and sit some time over he bottle of wine it be close upon four o'clock when he leave the tavern and then begin for the indefatigable mr howard one of the most wearisome and uninteresting chase through the maze of the london street he ever remember to have make up notting hill down the slum of notting dale along the high street beyond hammersmith and through shepherd 's bush do that anonymous tramp lead the unfortunate detective never hurry himself stop every now and then at a public-house to get a drink whither mr howard do not always care to follow he in spite of he fatigue mr franci howard 's hope rise with every half-hour of this weary tramp the man be obviously strive to kill time he seem to feel no weariness but walk on and on perhaps suspect that he be be follow at last with a beating heart though half perish with cold and with terribly sore foot the detective begin to realize that the tramp be gradually work he way back towards kensington it be then close upon eleven o'clock at night once or twice the man have walk up and down the high street from st paul 's school to derry and tom ' shop and back again he have look down one or two of the side street and -- at last -- he turn into phillimore terrace he seem in no hurry he oven stop once in the middle of the road try to light a pipe which as there be a high east wind take he some considerable time then he leisurely saunter down the street and turn into adam and eve mew with mr franci howard now close at he heel act upon the detective 's instruction there be several man in plain clothes ready to he call in the immediate neighborhood two stand within the shadow of the step of the congregational church at the corner of the mew other be station well within a soft call hardly therefore have the hare turn into the _ cul-de-sac _ at the back of phillimore terrace than at a slight sound from mr franci howard every egress be bar to he and he be catch like a rat in a trap as soon as the tramp have advance some thirty yard or so -lrb- the whole length of this part of the mew be about one hundred yard -rrb- and be lose in the shadow mr franci howard direct four or five of he man to proceed cautiously up the mew whilst the same number be to form a line all along the front of phillimore terrace between the mew and the high street remember the back-garden wall throw long and dense shadow but the silhouette of the man would be clearly outline if he make any attempt at climb over they mr howard feel quite sure that the thief be bent on recover the steal goods which no doubt he have hide in the rear of one of the house he would be catch _ in flagrante delicto _ and with a heavy sentence hover over he he would probably be induce to name he accomplice mr franci howard be thoroughly enjoy himself the minute speed on absolute silence in spite of the presence of so many man reign in the dark and desert mew of course this night 's adventure be never allow to get into the papers add the man in the corner with he mild smile have the plan be successful we should have hear all about it with a long eulogistic article as to the astuteness of we police but as it be -- well the tramp saunter up the mew -- and -- there he remain for aught mr franci howard or the other constable could ever explain the earth or the shadow swallow he up no one see he climb one of the garden wall no one hear he break open a door he have retreat within the shadow of the garden wall and be see or hear of no more one of the servant in the phillimore terrace house must have belong to the gang say polly with quick decision ah yes but which say the man in the corner make a beautiful knot in he bit of string i can assure you that the police leave not a stone unturned once more to catch sight of that tramp whom they have have in custody for two day but not a trace of he could they find nor of the diamond from that day to this chapter vi all he know the tramp be miss continue the man in the corner and mr franci howard try to find the miss tramp go round to the front and see the light at no 26 still in he call upon mr shipman the jeweller have have a few friend to dinner and be give they whiskies-and-sodas before say good night the servant have just finish wash up and be wait to go to bed neither they nor mr shipman nor he guest have see or hear anything of the suspicious individual mr franci howard go on to see mr ferdinand knopf this gentleman be have he warm bath preparatory to go to bed so robertson tell the detective however mr knopf insist on talk to mr howard through he bath-room door mr knopf thank he for all the trouble he be take and feel sure that he and mr shipman would soon recover possession of they diamond thanks to the persevere detective he he he laugh the man in the corner poor mr howard he persevere -- but get no farther no nor anyone else for that matter even i might not be able to convict the thief if i tell all i know to the police now follow my reasoning point by point he add eagerly who know of the presence of the diamond in the house of mr shipman and mr knopf firstly he say put up a ugly claw-like finger mr shipman then mr knopf then presumably the man robertson and the tramp say polly leave the tramp alone for the present since he have vanish and take point number two mr shipman be drug that be pretty obvious no man under ordinary circumstance would without wake have he key abstract and then replace at he own bedside mr howard suggest that the thief be arm with some anesthetic but how do the thief get into mr shipman 's room without wake he from he natural sleep be it not simpler to suppose that the thief have take the precaution to drug the jeweller _ before _ the latter go to bed but -- wait a moment and take point number three though there be every proof that mr shipman have be in possession of # 25000 worth of goods since mr knopf have a cheque from he for that amount there be no proof that in mr knopf 's house there be even a odd stone worth a sovereign and then again go on the scarecrow get more and more excited do it ever strike you or anybody else that at _ no _ time while the tramp be in custody while all that search examination be be go on with no one ever see mr knopf and he man robertson together at the same time ah he continue whilst suddenly the young girl seem to see the whole thing as in a vision they do not forget a single detail -- follow they with I point by point two cunning scoundrel -- genius they should be call -- well provide with some ill-gotten fund -- but determine on a grand _ coup _ they play at respectability for six month say one be the master the other the servant they take a house in the same street as they intended victim make friend with he accomplish one or two creditable but very small business transaction always draw on the reserve fund which might even have amount to a few hundred -- and a bit of credit then the brazilian diamond and the parisian -- which remember be so perfect that they require chemical testing to be detect the parisian stone be sell -- not in business of course -- in the evening after dinner and a good deal of wine mr knopf 's brazilian be beautiful perfect mr knopf be a well-known diamond merchant mr shipman buy -- but with the morning would have come sober sense the cheque stop before it could have be present the swindler catch no those exquisite parisian be never intend to rest in mr shipman 's safe until the morning that last bottle of '48 port with the aid of a powerful soporific ensured that mr shipman would sleep undisturbed during the night ah remember all the detail they be so admirable the letter post in brighton by the cunning rogue to himself the smash desk the broken pane of glass in he own house the man robertson on the watch while knopf himself in ragged clothing find he way into no 26 if constable d 21 have not appear upon the scene that exciting comedy in the early morning would not have be enact as it be in the suppose fight mr shipman 's diamond pass from the hand of the tramp into those of he accomplice then later on robertson ill in bed while he master be suppose to have return -- by the way it never strike anybody that no one see mr knopf come home though he surely would have drive up in a cab then the double part play by one man for the next two day it certainly never strike either the police or the inspector remember they only see robertson when in bed with a streaming cold but knopf have to be get out of gaol as soon as possible the dual _ rôle _ could not have be keep up for long hence the story of the diamond find in the garden of no 22 the cunning rogue guess that the usual plan would be act upon and the suspect thief allow to visit the scene where he hoard lay hide it have all be foresee and robertson must have be constantly on the watch the tramp stop mind you in phillimore terrace for some moment light a pipe the accomplice then be fully on the alert he slip the bolt of the back garden gate five minute later knopf be in the house in a hot bath get rid of the disguise of we friend the tramp remember that again here the detective do not actually see he the next morning mr knopf black hair and beard and all be himself again the whole trick lay in one simple art which those two cunning rascal know to absolute perfection the art of impersonate one another they be brother presumably -- twin brother i should say but mr knopf -- suggest polly well look in the trade ' directory you will see f knopf & co diamond merchant of some city address ask about the firm among the trade you will hear that it be firmly establish on a sound financial basis he he he and it deserve to be add the man in the corner as call for the waitress he receive he ticket and take up he shabby hat take himself and he bit of string rapidly out of the room chapter vii the york mystery the man in the corner look quite cheerful that morning he have have two glass of milk and have even go to the extravagance of a extra cheese-cake polly know that he be itch to talk police and murder for he cast furtive glance at she from time to time produce a bit of string tie and untie it into score of complicated knot and finally bring out he pocket-book he place two or three photograph before she do you know who that be he ask point to one of these the girl look at the face on the picture it be that of a woman not exactly pretty but very gentle and childlike with a strange pathetic look in the large eye which be wonderfully appeal that be lady arthur skelmerton he say and in a flash there flit before polly 's mind the weird and tragic history which have break this loving woman 's heart lady arthur skelmerton that name recall one of the most bewildering most mysterious passage in the annals of undiscovered crime yes it be sad be not it he comment in answer to polly 's thought another case which but for idiotic blunder on the part of the police must have stand clear as daylight before the public and satisfied general anxiety would you object to my recapitulate its preliminary detail she say nothing so he continue without wait further for a reply it all occur during the york racing week a time which bring to the quiet cathedral city its quota of shady character who congregate wherever money and wit happen to fly away from they owner lord arthur skelmerton a very well-known figure in london society and in race circle have rent one of the fine house which overlook the racecourse he have enter peppercorn by st armand -- notre dame for the great ebor handicap peppercorn be the winner of the newmarket and he chance for the ebor be consider a practical certainty if you have ever be to york you will have notice the fine house which have they drive and front entrance in the road call ` the mount ' and the garden of which extend as far as the racecourse command a lovely view over the entire track it be one of these house call ` the elm ' which lord arthur skelmerton have rent for the summer lady arthur come down some little time before the racing week with she servant -- she have no child but she have many relative and friend in york since she be the daughter of old sir john etty the cocoa manufacturer a rigid quaker who it be generally say keep the tightest possible hold on he own purse-string and look with marked disfavor upon he aristocratic son-in-law 's fondness for gaming table and bet book as a matter of fact maud etty have marry the handsome young lieutenant in the hussar quite against she father 's wish but she be a only child and after a good deal of demur and grumble sir john who idolize he daughter give way to she whim and a reluctant consent to the marriage be wring from he but as a yorkshireman he be far too shrewd a man of the world not to know that love play but a very small part in persuade a duke 's son to marry the daughter of a cocoa manufacturer and as long as he live he determine that since he daughter be be wed because of she wealth that wealth should at least secure she own happiness he refuse to give lady arthur any capital which in spite of the most carefully word settlement would inevitably sooner or later have find its way into the pocket of lord arthur 's racing friend but he make he daughter a very handsome allowance amount to over # 3000 a year which enable she to keep up a establishment befitting she new rank a great many of these fact intimate enough as they be leak out you see during that period of intense excitement which follow the murder of charle lavender and when the public eye be fix searchingly upon lord arthur skelmerton probe all the inner detail of he idle useless life it soon become a matter of common gossip that poor little lady arthur continue to worship she handsome husband in spite of he obvious neglect and not have as yet present he with a heir she settle herself down into a life of humble apology for she plebeian existence atone for it by condone all he fault and forgive all he vice even to the extent of cloak they before the prying eye of sir john who be persuade to look upon he son-in-law as a paragon of all the domestic virtue and a perfect model of a husband among lord arthur skelmerton 's many expensive taste there be certainly that for horseflesh and card after some successful bet at the beginning of he married life he have start a racing-stable which it be generally believe -- as he be very lucky -- be a regular source of income to he peppercorn however after he brilliant performance at newmarket do not continue to fulfil he master 's expectation he collapse at york be attribute to the hardness of the course and to various other cause but its immediate effect be to put lord arthur skelmerton in what be popularly call a tight place for he have back he horse for all he be worth and must have stand to lose considerably over # 5000 on that one day the collapse of the favorite and the grand victory of king cole a rank outsider on the other hand have prove a golden harvest for the bookmaker and all the york hotel be busy with dinner and supper give by the confraternity of the turf to celebrate the happy occasion the next day be Friday one of few important racing event after which the brilliant and the shady throng which have flock into the venerable city for the week would fly to more congenial clime and leave it with its fine old minster and its ancient wall as sleepy as quiet as before lord arthur skelmerton also intend to leave york on the Saturday and on the Friday night he give a farewell bachelor dinner party at ` the elm ' at which lady arthur do not appear after dinner the gentleman settle down to bridge with pretty stiff point you may be sure it have just strike eleven at the minster tower when constable mcnaught and murphy who be patrolling the racecourse be startle by loud cry of ` murder ' and ` police ' quickly ascertain whence these cry proceed they hurry on at a gallop and come up -- quite close to the boundary of lord arthur skelmerton 's grounds -- upon a group of three man two of whom seem to be wrestle vigorously with one another whilst the third be lie face downward on the ground as soon as the constable draw near one of the wrestler shout more vigorously and with a certain tone of authority : ` here you fellow hurry up sharp the brute be give I the slip ' but the brute do not seem inclined to do anything of the sort he certainly extricate himself with a violent jerk from he assailant 's grasp but make no attempt to run away the constable have quickly dismount whilst he who have shout for help originally add more quietly : ` my name be skelmerton this be the boundary of my property i be smoke a cigar at the pavilion over there with a friend when i hear loud voice follow by a cry and a groan i hurry down the step and see this poor fellow lie on the ground with a knife sticking between he shoulder-blade and he murderer ' he add point to the man who stand quietly by with constable mcnaught 's firm grip upon he shoulder ` still stoop over the body of he victim i be too late i fear to save the latter but just in time to grapple with the assassin -- ` it be a lie ' here interrupt the man hoarsely ' i do not do it constable i swear i do not do it i see he fall -- i be come along a couple of hundred yard away and i try to see if the poor fellow be dead i swear i do not do it ' ` you 'll have to explain that to the inspector presently my man ' be constable mcnaught 's quiet comment and still vigorously protest he innocence the accuse allow himself to be lead away and the body be convey to the station pend fuller identification the next morning the papers be full of the tragedy a column and a half of the _ york herald _ be devote to a account of lord arthur skelmerton 's plucky capture of the assassin the latter have continue to declare he innocence but have remark it appear with grim humor that he quite see he be in a tight place out of which however he would find it easy to extricate himself he have state to the police that the decease 's name be charle lavender a well-known bookmaker which fact be soon verify for many of the murder man 's ` pal ' be still in the city so far the most push of newspaper reporter have be unable to glean further information from the police no one doubt however but that the man in charge who give he name as george higgin have kill the bookmaker for purpose of robbery the inquest have be fix for the Tuesday after the murder lord arthur have be oblige to stay in york a few day as he evidence would be need that fact give the case perhaps a certain amount of interest as far as york and london ` society ' be concerned charle lavender moreover be well know on the turf but no bombshell explode beneath the wall of the ancient cathedral city could more have astonish its inhabitant than the news which at about five in the afternoon on the day of the inquest spread like wildfire throughout the town that news be that the inquest have conclude at three o'clock with a verdict of ` wilful murder against some person or person unknown ' and that two hour later the police have arrest lord arthur skelmerton at he private residence ` the elm ' and charge he on a warrant with the murder of charle lavender the bookmaker chapter viii the capital charge the police it appear instinctively feel that some mystery lurk round the death of the bookmaker and he suppose murderer 's quiet protestation of innocence have take a very considerable amount of trouble in collect all the evidence they could for the inquest which might throw some light upon charle lavender 's life previous to he tragic end thus it be that a very large array of witness be bring before the coroner chief among whom be of course lord arthur skelmerton the first witness call be the two constable who depose that just as the church clock in the neighborhood be striking eleven they have hear the cry for help have ride to the spot whence the sound proceed and have find the prisoner in the tight grasp of lord arthur skelmerton who at once accuse the man of murder and give he in charge both constable give the same version of the incident and both be positive as to the time when it occur medical evidence go to prove that the decease have be stab from behind between the shoulder-blade whilst he be walk that the wound be inflict by a large hunting knife which be produce and which have be leave stick in the wound lord arthur skelmerton be then call and substantially repeat what he have already tell the constable he state namely that on the night in question he have some gentleman friend to dinner and afterwards bridge be play he himself be not play much and at a few minute before eleven he stroll out with a cigar as far as the pavilion at the end of he garden he then hear the voice the cry and the groan previously describe by he and manage to hold the murderer down until the arrival of the constable at this point the police propose to call a witness jame terry by name and a bookmaker by profession who have be chiefly instrumental in identify the decease a ` pal ' of he it be he evidence which first introduce that element of sensation into the case which culminate in the wildly exciting arrest of a duke 's son upon a capital charge it appear that on the evening after the ebor terry and lavender be in the bar of the black swan hotel have drink ' i have do pretty well over peppercorn 's fiasco ' he explain ` but poor old lavender be very much down in the dump he have hold only a few very small bet against the favorite and the rest of the day have be a poor one with he i ask he if he have any bet with the owner of peppercorn and he tell I that he only hold one for less than # 500 ' i laugh and say that if he hold one for # 5000 it would make no difference as from what i have hear from the other fellow lord arthur skelmerton must be about stumped lavender seem terribly put out at this and swear he would get that # 500 out of lord arthur if no one else get another penny from he ` it be the only money i have make to-day ' he say to I ' i mean to get it ' ` you will not ' i say ' i will ' he say ` you will have to look pretty sharp about it then ' i say ` for every one will be want to get something and first come first serve ' ` oh he 'll serve I right enough never you mind ' say lavender to I with a laugh ` if he do not pay up willingly i have get that in my pocket which will make he sit up and open my lady 's eye and sir john etty 's too about they precious noble lord ' ` then he seem to think he have go too far and would not say anything more to I about that affair i see he on the course the next day i ask he if he have get he # 500 he say : no but i shall get it to-day ' lord arthur skelmerton after have give he own evidence have leave the court it be therefore impossible to know how he would take this account which throw so serious a light upon a association with the dead man of which he himself have say nothing nothing could shake jame terry 's account of the fact he have place before the jury and when the police inform the coroner that they propose to place george higgin himself in the witness-box as he evidence would prove as it be a complement and corollary of that of terry the jury very eagerly assent if jame terry the bookmaker loud florid vulgar be a unprepossessing individual certainly george higgin who be still under the accusation of murder be ten thousand time more so none too clean slouchy obsequious yet insolent he be the very personification of the cad who haunt the racecourse and who live not so much by he own wit as by the lack of they in other he describe himself as a turf commission agent whatever that may be he state that at about six o'clock on the Friday afternoon when the racecourse be still full of people all hurry after the day 's excitement he himself happen to be stand close to the hedge which mark the boundary of lord arthur skelmerton 's grounds there be a pavilion there at the end of the garden he explain on slightly elevated ground and he could hear and see a group of lady and gentleman have tea some step lead down a little to the left of the garden on to the course and presently he notice at the bottom of these step lord arthur skelmerton and charle lavender standing talk together he know both gentleman by sight but he could not see they very well as they be both partly hide by the hedge he be quite sure that the gentleman have not see he and he could not help overhear some of they conversation ` that be my last word lavender ' lord arthur be say very quietly ' i have not get the money and i can not pay you now you 'll have to wait ' ` wait i can not wait ' say old lavender in reply ` i have get my engagement to meet same as you i be not go to risk be post up as a defaulter while you hold # 500 of my money you would better give it I now or -- ' but lord arthur interrupted he very quietly and say : ` yes my good man or ' ` or i 'll let sir john have a good look at that little bill i have of yours a couple of year ago if you 'll remember my lord it have get at the bottom of it sir john 's signature in _ you _ handwriting perhaps sir john or perhaps my lady would pay I something for that little bill if not the police can have a squint at it i have hold my tongue long enough and -- ' ` look here lavender ' say lord arthur ` do you know what this little game of yours be call in law ' ` yes and i do not care ' say lavender ` if i do not have that # 500 i be a ruin man if you ruin I i 'll do for you and we shall be quit that be my last word ' he be talk very loudly and i think some of lord arthur 's friend up in the pavilion must have hear he think so too i think for he say quickly : ` if you do not hold you confound tongue i 'll give you in charge for blackmail this instant ' ` you would not dare ' say lavender and he begin to laugh but just then a lady from the top of the step say : ` you tea be get cold ' and lord arthur turn to go but just before he go lavender say to he : ` i 'll come back to-night you 'll have the money then ' george higgin it appear after he have hear this interesting conversation ponder as to whether he could not turn what he know into some sort of profit be a gentleman who live entirely by he wit this type of knowledge form he chief source of income as a preliminary to future move he decide not to lose sight of lavender for the rest of the day ` lavender go and have dinner at the black swan ' explain mr george higgin ` and i after i have have a bite myself wait outside till i see he come out at about ten o'clock i be reward for my trouble he tell the hall porter to get he a fly and he jump into it i could not hear what direction he give the driver but the fly certainly drive off towards the racecourse ` now i be interested in this little affair ' continue the witness ` and i could not afford a fly i start to run of course i could not keep up with it but i think i know which way my gentleman have go i make straight for the racecourse and for the hedge at the bottom of lord arthur skelmerton 's grounds ` it be rather a dark night and there be a slight drizzle i could not see more than about a hundred yard before I all at once it seem to I as if i hear lavender 's voice talk loudly in the distance i hurry forward and suddenly see a group of two figure -- mere blur in the darkness -- for one instant at a distance of about fifty yard from where i be ` the next moment one figure have fall forward and the other have disappear i run to the spot only to find the body of the murder man lie on the ground i stoop to see if i could be of any use to he and immediately i be collar from behind by lord arthur himself ' you may imagine say the man in the corner how keen be the excitement of that moment in court coroner and jury alike literally hung breathless on every word that shabby vulgar individual utter you see by itself he evidence would have be worth very little but come on the top of that give by jame terry its significance -- more its truth -- have become glaringly apparent closely cross-examine he adhere strictly to he statement and have finish he evidence george higgin remain in charge of the constable and the next witness of importance be call up this be mr chipp the senior footman in the employment of lord arthur skelmerton he depose that at about 1030 on the Friday evening a ` party ' drive up to ` the elm ' in a fly and ask to see lord arthur on be tell that he lordship have company he seem terribly put out ' i hask the party to give I ` be card ' continue mr chipp ` as i do not know perhaps that ` be lordship might wish to see ` im but i keep ` im standing at the ` all door as i do not altogether like he look i take the card in he lordship and the gentleman be playin ' card in the smoking-room and as soon as i could do so without disturbing ` be lordship i give he the party 's card ' ` what name be there on the card ' here interrupt the coroner ' i could not say now sir ' reply mr chipp ' i do not really remember it be a name i have never see before but i see so many visit card one way and the other in ` be lordship 's ` all that i can not remember all the name ' ` then after a few minute ' wait you give he lordship the card what happen then ' '' be lordship do not seem at all pleased ' say mr chipp with much guard dignity ` but finally he say : show he into the library chipp i 'll see he and he get up from the card table say to the gentleman : go on without I i 'll be back in a minute or two ' i be about to open the door for ` be lordship when my lady come into the room and then he lordship suddenly change he mind like and say to I : tell that man i be busy and can not see he and ' e sit down again at the card table i go back to the ` all and tell the party ` be lordship would not see ` im ' e say : oh it do not matter and go away quite quiet like ' ` do you recollect at all at what time that be ' ask one of the jury ` yes sir while i be wait to speak to ` be lordship i look at the clock sir it be twenty past ten sir ' there be one more significant fact in connection with the case which tend still more to excite the curiosity of the public at the time and still further to bewilder the police later on and that fact be mention by chipp in he evidence the knife namely with which charle lavender have be stab and which remember have be leave in the wound be now produce in court after a little hesitation chipp identify it as the property of he master lord arthur skelmerton can you wonder then that the jury absolutely refuse to bring in a verdict against george higgin there be really beyond lord arthur skelmerton 's testimony not one particle of evidence against he whilst as the day wear on and witness after witness be call up suspicion ripen in the mind of all those present that the murderer could be no other than lord arthur skelmerton himself the knife be of course the strongest piece of circumstantial evidence and no doubt the police hope to collect a great deal more now that they hold a clue in they hand directly after the verdict therefore which be guardedly direct against some person unknown the police obtain a warrant and later on arrest lord arthur in he own house the sensation of course be tremendous hour before he be bring up before the magistrate the approach to the court be throng he friend mostly lady be all eager you see to watch the dashing society man in so terrible a position there be universal sympathy for lady arthur who be in a very precarious state of health she worship of she worthless husband be well know small wonder that he final and awful misdeed have practically break she heart the latest bulletin issue just after he arrest state that she ladyship be not expect to live she be then in a comatose condition and all hope have perforce to be abandon at last the prisoner be bring in he look very pale perhaps but otherwise keep up the bearing of a high-bred gentleman he be accompany by he solicitor sir marmaduke ingersoll who be evidently talk to he in quiet reassuring tone mr buchanan prosecute for the treasury and certainly he indictment be terrific accord to he but one decision could be arrive at namely that the accuse in the dock have in a moment of passion and perhaps of fear kill the blackmailer who threaten he with disclosure which might for ever have ruin he socially and have commit the deed and fear its consequence probably realize that the patrolling constable might catch sight of he retreat figure he have avail himself of george higgin 's presence on the spot to loudly accuse he of the murder have conclude he able speech mr buchanan call he witness and the evidence which on second hearing seem more damning than ever be all go through again sir marmaduke have no question to ask of the witness for the prosecution he stare at they placidly through he gold-rimmed spectacles then he be ready to call he own for the defense colonel mcintosh ra be the first he be present at the bachelor ' party give by lord arthur the night of the murder he evidence tend at first to corroborate that of chipp the footman with regard to lord arthur 's order to show the visitor into the library and he counter-order as soon as he wife come into the room ` do you not think it strange colonel ' ask mr buchanan ` that lord arthur should so suddenly have change he mind about see he visitor ' ` well not exactly strange ' say the colonel a fine manly soldierly figure who look curiously out of he element in the witness-box ' i do not think that it be a very rare occurrence for race man to have certain acquaintance whom they would not wish they wife to know anything about ' ` then it do not strike you that lord arthur skelmerton have some reason for not wish he wife to know of that particular visitor 's presence in he house ' ' i do not think that i give the matter the slightest serious consideration ' be the colonel 's guard reply mr buchanan do not press the point and allow the witness to conclude he statement ' i have finish my turn at bridge ' he say ` and go out into the garden to smoke a cigar lord arthur skelmerton join I a few minute later and we be sit in the pavilion when i hear a loud and as i think threatening voice from the other side of the hedge ' i do not catch the word but lord arthur say to I : there seem to be a row down there i 'll go and have a look and see what it be i try to dissuade he and certainly make no attempt to follow he but not more than half a minute could have elapse before i hear a cry and a groan then lord arthur 's footstep hurry down the wooden stair which lead on to the racecourse ' you may imagine say the man in the corner what severe cross-examination the gallant colonel have to undergo in order that he assertion might in some way be shake by the prosecution but with military precision and frigid calm he repeat he important statement amidst a general silence through which you could have hear the proverbial pin he have hear the threatening voice _ while _ sit with lord arthur skelmerton then come the cry and groan and _ after that _ lord arthur 's step down the stair he himself think of follow to see what have happen but it be a very dark night and he do not know the grounds very well while try to find he way to the garden step he hear lord arthur 's cry for help the tramp of the patrolling constable ' horse and subsequently the whole scene between lord arthur the man higgin and the constable when he finally find he way to the stair lord arthur be return in order to send a groom for police assistance the witness stick to he point as he have to he gun at beckfontein a year ago nothing could shake he and sir marmaduke look triumphantly across at he oppose colleague with the gallant colonel 's statement the edifice of the prosecution certainly begin to collapse you see there be not a particle of evidence to show that the accuse have meet and speak to the decease after the latter 's visit at the front door of ` the elm ' he tell chipp that he would not see the visitor and chipp go into the hall directly and show lavender out the way he come no assignation could have be make no hint could have be give by the murder man to lord arthur that he would go round to the back entrance and wish to see he there two other guest of lord arthur 's swear positively that after chipp have announce the visitor they host stay at the card-table until a quarter to eleven when evidently he go out to join colonel mcintosh in the garden sir marmaduke 's speech be clever in the extreme bit by bit he demolish that tower of strength the case against the accuse base he defense entirely upon the evidence of lord arthur skelmerton 's guest that night until 1045 lord arthur be play card a quarter of a hour later the police be on the scene and the murder have be commit in the meanwhile colonel mcintosh 's evidence prove conclusively that the accuse have be sit with he smoke a cigar it be obvious therefore clear as daylight conclude the great lawyer that he client be entitle to a full discharge nay more he think that the police should have be more careful before they harrow up public feeling by arrest a high-born gentleman on such insufficient evidence as they have bring forward the question of the knife remain certainly but sir marmaduke pass over it with guard eloquence place that strange question in the category of those inexplicable coincidence which tend to puzzle the ablest detective and cause they to commit such unpardonable blunder as the present one have be after all the footman may have be mistake the pattern of that knife be not a exclusive one and he on behalf of he client flatly deny that it have ever belong to he well continue the man in the corner with the chuckle peculiar to he in moment of excitement the noble prisoner be discharge perhaps it would be invidious to say that he leave the court without a stain on he character for i daresay you know from experience that the crime know as the york mystery have never be satisfactorily clear up many people shake they head dubiously when they remember that after all charle lavender be kill with a knife which one witness have swear belong to lord arthur other again revert to the original theory that george higgin be the murderer that he and jame terry have concoct the story of lavender 's attempt at blackmail on lord arthur and that the murder have be commit for the sole purpose of robbery be that as it may the police have not so far be able to collect sufficient evidence against higgin or terry and the crime have be class by press and public alike in the category of so-called impenetrable mystery chapter ix a broken-hearted woman the man in the corner call for another glass of milk and drink it down slowly before he resume : now lord arthur live mostly abroad he say he poor suffering wife die the day after he be liberate by the magistrate she never recover consciousness even sufficiently to hear the joyful news that the man she love so well be innocent after all mystery he add as if in answer to polly 's own thought the murder of that man be never a mystery to I i can not understand how the police could have be so blind when every one of the witness both for the prosecution and defense practically point all the time to the one guilty person what do you think of it all yourself i think the whole case so bewildering she reply that i do not see one single clear point in it you do not he say excitedly while the bony finger fidget again with that inevitable bit of string you do not see that there be one point clear which to I be the key of the whole thing lavender be murder be not he lord arthur do not kill he he have at least in colonel mcintosh a unimpeachable witness to prove that he could not have commit that murder -- and yet he add with slow excited emphasis mark each sentence with a knot and yet he deliberately try to throw the guilt upon a man who obviously be also innocent now why he may have think he guilty or wish to shield or cover the retreat of _ one he know to be guilty _ i do not understand think of someone he say excitedly someone whose desire would be as great as that of lord arthur to silence a scandal round that gentleman 's name someone who unknown perhaps to lord arthur have overhear the same conversation which george higgin related to the police and the magistrate someone who whilst chipp be take lavender 's card in to he master have a few minute ' time wherein to make a assignation with lavender promising he money no doubt in exchange for the compromise bill surely you do not mean -- gasp polly point number one he interrupt quietly utterly miss by the police george higgin in he deposition state that at the most animated stage of lavender 's conversation with lord arthur and when the bookmaker 's tone of voice become loud and threaten a voice from the top of the step interrupt that conversation say : ` you tea be get cold ' yes -- but -- she argue wait a moment for there be point number two that voice be a lady 's voice now i do exactly what the police should have do but do not do i go to have a look from the racecourse side at those garden step which to my mind be such important factor in the discovery of this crime i find only about a dozen rather low step anyone standing on the top must have hear every word charle lavender utter the moment he raise he voice even then -- very well you grant that he say excitedly then there be the great the all-important point which oddly enough the prosecution never for a moment take into consideration when chipp the footman first tell lavender that lord arthur could not see he the bookmaker be terribly put out chipp then go to speak to he master a few minute elapse and when the footman once again tell lavender that he lordship will not see he the latter say ` very well ' and seem to treat the matter with complete indifference obviously therefore something must have happen in between to alter the bookmaker 's frame of mind well what have happen think over all the evidence and you will see that one thing only have occur in the interval namely lady arthur 's advent into the room in order to go into the smoking-room she must have cross the hall she must have see lavender in that brief interval she must have realize that the man be persistent and therefore a living danger to she husband remember woman have do strange thing they be a far greater puzzle to the student of human nature than the sterner less complex sex have ever be as i argue before -- as the police should have argue all along -- why do lord arthur deliberately accuse a innocent man of murder if not to shield the guilty one remember lady arthur may have be discover the man george higgin may have catch sight of she before she have time to make good she retreat he attention as well we that of the constable have to be divert lord arthur act on the blind impulse of save he wife at any cost she may have be meet by colonel mcintosh argue polly perhaps she be he say who know the gallant colonel have to swear to he friend 's innocence he could do that in all conscience -- after that he duty be accomplish no innocent man be suffer for the guilty the knife which have belong to lord arthur would always save george higgin for a time it have point to the husband fortunately never to the wife poor thing she die probably of a broken heart but woman when they love think only of one object on earth -- the one who be beloved to I the whole thing be clear from the very first when i read the account of the murder -- the knife stab -- bah do not i know enough of _ english _ crime not to be certain at once that no english_man _ be he ruffian from the gutter or be he duke 's son ever stab he victim in the back italian french spaniard do it if you will and woman of most nation a englishman 's instinct be to strike and not to stab george higgin or lord arthur skelmerton would have knock they victim down the woman only would lie in wait till the enemy 's back be turn she know she weakness and she do not mean to miss think it over there be not one flaw in my argument but the police never think the matter out -- perhaps in this case it be as well he have go and leave miss polly burton still stare at the photograph of a pretty gentle-looking woman with a decide wilful curve round the mouth and a strange unaccountable look in the large pathetic eye and the little journalist feel quite thankful that in this case the murder of charle lavender the bookmaker -- cowardly wicked as it be -- have remain a mystery to the police and the public chapter x the mysterious death on the underground railway it be all very well for mr richard frobisher -lrb- of the _ london mail _ -rrb- to cut up rough about it polly do not altogether blame he she like he all the better for that frank outburst of manlike ill-temper which after all say and do be only a very flattering form of masculine jealousy moreover polly distinctly feel guilty about the whole thing she have promise to meet dickie -- that be mr richard frobisher -- at two o'clock sharp outside the palace theater because she want to go to a maud allan _ matinée _ and because he naturally wish to go with she but at two o'clock sharp she be still in norfolk street strand inside a abc shop sip cold coffee opposite a grotesque old man who be fiddle with a bit of string how could she be expect to remember maud allan or the palace theater or dickie himself for a matter of that the man in the corner have begin to talk of that mysterious death on the underground railway and polly have lose count of time of place and circumstance she have go to lunch quite early for she be look forward to the _ matinée _ at the palace the old scarecrow be sit in he accustomed place when she come into the abc shop but he have make no remark all the time that the young girl be munch she scone and butter she be just busy think how rude he be not even to have say good morning when a abrupt remark from he cause she to look up will you be good enough he say suddenly to give I a description of the man who sit next to you just now while you be have you cup of coffee and scone involuntarily polly turn she head towards the distant door through which a man in a light overcoat be even now quickly pass that man have certainly sit at the next table to hers when she first sit down to she coffee and scone : he have finish he luncheon -- whatever it be -- moment ago have pay at the desk and go out the incident do not appear to polly as be of the slightest consequence therefore she do not reply to the rude old man but shrug she shoulder and call to the waitress to bring she bill do you know if he be tall or short dark or fair continue the man in the corner seemingly not the least disconcerted by the young girl 's indifference can you tell I at all what he be like of course i can rejoin polly impatiently but i do not see that my description of one of the customer of a abc shop can have the slightest importance he be silent for a minute while he nervous finger fumble about in he capacious pocket in search of the inevitable piece of string when he have find this necessary adjunct to think he view the young girl again through he half-closed lid and add maliciously : but suppose it be of paramount importance that you should give a accurate description of a man who sit next to you for half a hour to-day how would you proceed i should say that he be of medium height -- five foot eight nine or ten he interrupt quietly how can one tell to a inch or two rejoin polly crossly he be between color what be that he inquire blandly neither fair nor dark -- he nose -- well what be he nose like will you sketch it i be not a artist he nose be fairly straight -- he eye -- be neither dark nor light -- he hair have the same striking peculiarity -- he be neither short nor tall -- he nose be neither aquiline nor snub -- he recapitulate sarcastically no she retort he be just ordinary look would you know he again -- say to-morrow and among a number of other man who be ` neither tall nor short dark nor fair aquiline nor snub-nosed ' etc i do not know -- i might -- he be certainly not striking enough to be specially remembered exactly he say while he lean forward excitedly for all the world like a jack-in-the-box let loose precisely and you be a journalist -- call yourself one at least -- and it should be part of you business to notice and describe people i do not mean only the wonderful personage with the clear saxon feature the fine blue eye the noble brow and classic face but the ordinary person -- the person who represent ninety out of every hundred of he own kind -- the average englishman say of the middle class who be neither very tall nor very short who wear a moustache which be neither fair nor dark but which mask he mouth and a top hat which hide the shape of he head and brow a man in fact who dress like hundred of he fellow-creature move like they speak like they have no peculiarity try to describe _ he _ to recognize he say a week hence among he other eighty-nine double worse still to swear he life away if he happen to be implicate in some crime wherein _ you _ recognition of he would place the halter round he neck try that i say and have utterly fail you will more readily understand how one of the greatest scoundrel unhung be still at large and why the mystery on the underground railway be never clear up i think it be the only time in my life that i be seriously tempt to give the police the benefit of my own view upon the matter you see though i admire the brute for he cleverness i do not see that he be unpunished could possibly benefit any one in these day of tube and motor traction of all kind the old-fashioned ` best cheapest and quickest route to city and west end ' be often desert and the good old metropolitan railway carriage can not at any time be say to be overcrowded anyway when that particular train steam into aldgate at about 4 pm on march 18th last the first-class carriage be all but empty the guard march up and down the platform look into all the carriage to see if anyone have leave a halfpenny evening paper behind for he and open the door of one of the first-class compartment he notice a lady sit in the further corner with she head turn away towards the window evidently oblivious of the fact that on this line aldgate be the terminal station ` where be you for lady ' he say the lady do not move and the guard step into the carriage think that perhaps the lady be asleep he touch she arm lightly and look into she face in he own poetic language he be ` strike all of a ` eap ' in the glassy eye the ashen color of the cheek the rigidity of the head there be the unmistakable look of death hastily the guard have carefully lock the carriage door summon a couple of porter and send one of they off to the police-station and the other in search of the station-master fortunately at this time of day the up platform be not very crowd all the traffic tend westward in the afternoon it be only when a inspector and two police constable accompany by a detective in plain clothes and a medical officer appear upon the scene and stand round a first-class railway compartment that a few idler realize that something unusual have occur and crowd round eager and curious thus it be that the later edition of the evening papers under the sensational head ` mysterious suicide on the underground railway ' have already a account of the extraordinary event the medical officer have very soon come to the decision that the guard have not be mistaken and that life be indeed extinct the lady be young and must have be very pretty before the look of fright and horror have so terribly distorted she feature she be very elegantly dress and the more frivolous papers be able to give they feminine reader a detailed account of the unfortunate woman 's gown she shoe hat and glove it appear that one of the latter the one on the right hand be partly off leave the thumb and wrist bare that hand hold a small satchel which the police open with a view to the possible identification of the deceased but which be find to contain only a little loose silver some smelling-salt and a small empty bottle which be hand over to the medical officer for purpose of analysis it be the presence of that small bottle which have cause the report to circulate freely that the mysterious case on the underground railway be one of suicide certain it be that neither about the lady 's person nor in the appearance of the railway carriage be there the slightest sign of struggle or even of resistance only the look in the poor woman 's eye speak of sudden terror of the rapid vision of a unexpected and violent death which probably only last a infinitesimal fraction of a second but which have leave its indelible mark upon the face otherwise so placid and so still the body of the decease be convey to the mortuary so far of course not a soul have be able to identify she or to throw the slightest light upon the mystery which hang around she death against that quite a crowd of idler -- genuinely interested or not -- obtain admission to view the body on the pretext of have lose or mislay a relative or a friend at about 830 pm a young man very well dress drive up to the station in a hansom and send in he card to the superintendent it be mr hazeldene shipping agent of 11 crown lane ec and no 19 addison row kensington the young man look in a pitiable state of mental distress he hand clutch nervously a copy of the _ st jame 's gazette _ which contain the fatal news he say very little to the superintendent except that a person who be very dear to he have not return home that evening he have not feel really anxious until half a hour ago when suddenly he think of look at he paper the description of the deceased lady though vague have terribly alarmed he he have jump into a hansom and now beg permission to view the body in order that he worst fear might be allay you know what follow of course continue the man in the corner the grief of the young man be truly pitiable in the woman lie there in a public mortuary before he mr hazeldene have recognize he wife i be wax melodramatic say the man in the corner who look up at polly with a mild and gentle smile while he nervous finger vainly endeavor to add another knot on the scrappy bit of string with which he be continually play and i fear that the whole story savor of the penny novelette but you must admit and no doubt you remember that it be a intensely pathetic and truly dramatic moment the unfortunate young husband of the deceased lady be not much worry with question that night as a matter of fact he be not in a fit condition to make any coherent statement it be at the coroner 's inquest on the follow day that certain fact come to light which for the time be seem to clear up the mystery surround mr hazeldene 's death only to plunge that same mystery later on into denser gloom than before the first witness at the inquest be of course mr hazeldene himself i think every one 's sympathy go out to the young man as he stand before the coroner and try to throw what light he could upon the mystery he be well dress as he have be the day before but he look terribly ill and worried and no doubt the fact that he have not shave give he face a careworn and neglect air it appear that he and the decease have be marry some six year or so and that they have always be happy in they married life they have no child mr hazeldene seem to enjoy the best of health till lately when she have have a slight attack of influenza in which dr arthur jone have attend she the doctor be present at this moment and would no doubt explain to the coroner and the jury whether he think that mr hazeldene have the slightest tendency to heart disease which might have have a sudden and fatal end the coroner be of course very considerate to the bereaved husband he try by circumlocution to get at the point he want namely mrs hazeldene 's mental condition lately mr hazeldene seem loath to talk about this no doubt he have be warn as to the existence of the small bottle find in he wife 's satchel ` it certainly do seem to I at time ' he at last reluctantly admit ` that my wife do not seem quite herself she use to be very gay and bright and lately i often see she in the evening sit as if brooding over some matter which evidently she do not care to communicate to I ' still the coroner insist and suggest the small bottle ' i know i know ' reply the young man with a short heavy sigh ` you mean -- the question of suicide -- i can not understand it at all -- it seem so sudden and so terrible -- she certainly have seem listless and troubled lately -- but only at time -- and yesterday morning when i go to business she appear quite herself again and i suggest that we should go to the opera in the evening she be delighted i know and tell I she would do some shopping and pay a few call in the afternoon ' ` do you know at all where she intend to go when she get into the underground railway ' ` well not with certainty you see she may have mean to get out at baker street and go down to bond street to do she shopping then again she sometimes go to a shop in st paul 's churchyard in which case she would take a ticket to aldersgate street but i can not say ' ` now mr hazeldene ' say the coroner at last very kindly ` will you try to tell I if there be anything in mr hazeldene 's life which you know of and which might in some measure explain the cause of the distressed state of mind which you yourself have notice do there exist any financial difficulty which might have prey upon mr hazeldene 's mind be there any friend -- to whose intercourse with mr hazeldene -- you -- er -- at any time take exception in fact ' add the coroner as if thankful that he have get over a unpleasant moment ` can you give I the slightest indication which would tend to confirm the suspicion that the unfortunate lady in a moment of mental anxiety or derangement may have wish to take she own life ' there be silence in the court for a few moment mr hazeldene seem to every one there present to be labor under some terrible moral doubt he look very pale and wretched and twice attempt to speak before he at last say in scarcely audible tone : ` no there be no financial difficulty of any sort my wife have a independent fortune of she own -- she have no extravagant taste -- ' ` nor any friend you at any time object to ' insist the coroner ` nor any friend i -- at any time object to ' stammer the unfortunate young man evidently speak with a effort i be present at the inquest resume the man in the corner after he have drunk a glass of milk and order another and i can assure you that the most obtuse person there plainly realize that mr hazeldene be tell a lie it be pretty plain to the meanest intelligence that the unfortunate lady have not fall into a state of morbid dejection for nothing and that perhaps there exist a third person who could throw more light on she strange and sudden death than the unhappy bereaved young widower that the death be more mysterious even than it have at first appear become very soon apparent you read the case at the time no doubt and must remember the excitement in the public mind cause by the evidence of the two doctor dr arthur jone the lady 's usual medical man who have attend she in a last very slight illness and who have see she in a professional capacity fairly recently declare most emphatically that mr hazeldene suffer from no organic complaint which could possibly have be the cause of sudden death moreover he have assist mr andrew thornton the district medical officer in make a postmortem examination and together they have come to the conclusion that death be due to the action of prussic acid which have cause instantaneous failure of the heart but how the drug have be administer neither he nor he colleague be at present able to state ` do i understand then dr jone that the deceased die poison with prussic acid ' ` such be my opinion ' reply the doctor ` do the bottle find in she satchel contain prussic acid ' ` it have contain some at one time certainly ' ` in you opinion then the lady cause she own death by take a dose of that drug ' ` pardon I i never suggest such a thing the lady die poison by the drug but how the drug be administer we can not say by injection of some sort certainly the drug certainly be not swallow there be not a vestige of it in the stomach ' ` yes ' add the doctor in reply to another question from the coroner ` death have probably follow the injection in this case almost immediately say within a couple of minute or perhaps three it be quite possible that the body would not have more than one quick and sudden convulsion perhaps not that death in such case be absolutely sudden and crush ' i do not think that at the time any one in the room realize how important the doctor 's statement be a statement which by the way be confirm in all its detail by the district medical officer who have conduct the postmortem mr hazeldene have die suddenly from a injection of prussic acid administer no one know how or when she have be travel in a first-class railway carriage in a busy time of the day that young and elegant woman must have have singular nerve and coolness to go through the process of a self-inflicted injection of a deadly poison in the presence of perhaps two or three other person mind you when i say that no one there realize the importance of the doctor 's statement at that moment i be wrong there be three person who fully understand at once the gravity of the situation and the astounding development which the case be begin to assume of course i should have put myself out of the question add the weird old man with that inimitable self-conceit peculiar to himself i guess then and there in a moment where the police be go wrong and where they would go on go wrong until the mysterious death on the underground railway have sink into oblivion together with the other case which they mismanage from time to time i say there be three person who understand the gravity of the two doctor ' statement -- the other two be firstly the detective who have originally examine the railway carriage a young man of energy and plenty of misguided intelligence the other be mr hazeldene at this point the interesting element of the whole story be first introduce into the proceedings and this be do through the humble channel of emma funnel mr hazeldene 's maid who as far as be know then be the last person who have see the unfortunate lady alive and have speak to she ` mrs hazeldene lunch at home ' explain emma who be shy and speak almost in a whisper ` she seem well and cheerful she go out at about half-past three and tell I she be go to spence 's in st paul 's churchyard to try on she new tailor-made gown mr hazeldene have mean to go there in the morning but be prevent as mr errington call ' ` mr errington ' ask the coroner casually ` who be mr errington ' but this emma find difficult to explain mr errington be -- mr errington that be all ` mr errington be a friend of the family he live in a flat in the albert mansion he very often come to addison row and generally stay late ' press still further with question emma at last state that latterly mrs hazeldene have be to the theater several time with mr errington and that on those night the master look very gloomy and be very cross recall the young widower be strangely reticent he give forth he answer very grudgingly and the coroner be evidently absolutely satisfy with himself at the marvellous way in which after a quarter of a hour of firm yet very kind questioning he have elicit from the witness what information he want mr errington be a friend of he wife he be a gentleman of means and seem to have a great deal of time at he command he himself do not particularly care about mr errington but he certainly have never make any observation to he wife on the subject ` but who be mr errington ' repeat the coroner once more ` what do he do what be he business or profession ' ` he have no business or profession ` what be he occupation then he have no special occupation he have ample private means but he have a great and very absorb hobby ' ` what be that ' ` he spend all he time in chemical experiment and be i believe as a amateur a very distinguished toxicologist ' chapter xi mr errington do you ever see mr errington the gentleman so closely connect with the mysterious death on the underground railway ask the man in the corner as he place one or two of he little snap-shot photo before miss polly burton there he be to the very life fairly good-looking a pleasant face enough but ordinary absolutely ordinary it be this absence of any peculiarity which very nearly but not quite place the halter round mr errington 's neck but i be go too fast and you will lose the thread the public of course never hear how it actually come about that mr errington the wealthy bachelor of albert mansion of the grosvenor and other young dandy ' club one fine day find himself before the magistrate at bow street charge with be concern in the death of mary beatrice hazeldene late of no 19 addison row i can assure you both press and public be literally flabbergast you see mr errington be a well-known and very popular member of a certain smart section of london society he be a constant visitor at the opera the racecourse the park and the carlton he have a great many friend and there be consequently quite a large attendance at the police court that morning what have transpire be this : after the very scrappy bit of evidence which come to light at the inquest two gentleman bethink themselves that perhaps they have some duty to perform towards the state and the public generally accordingly they have come forward offer to throw what light they could upon the mysterious affair on the underground railway the police naturally feel that they information such as it be come rather late in the day but as it prove of paramount importance and the two gentleman moreover be of undoubtedly good position in the world they be thankful for what they could get and act accordingly they accordingly bring mr errington up before the magistrate on a charge of murder the accuse look pale and worried when i first catch sight of he in the court that day which be not to be wonder at consider the terrible position in which he find himself he have be arrest at marseille where he be prepare to start for colombo i do not think he realize how terrible he position really be until later in the proceedings when all the evidence relate to the arrest have be hear and emma funnel have repeat she statement as to mr errington 's call at 19 addison row in the morning and mr hazeldene start off for st paul 's churchyard at 330 in the afternoon mr hazeldene have nothing to add to the statement he have make at the coroner 's inquest he have last see he wife alive on the morning of the fatal day she have seem very well and cheerful i think every one present understand that he be try to say as little as possible that could in any way couple he deceased wife 's name with that of the accuse and yet from the servant 's evidence it undoubtedly leak out that mr hazeldene who be young pretty and evidently fond of admiration have once or twice annoy she husband by she somewhat open yet perfectly innocent flirtation with mr errington i think every one be most agreeably impress by the widower 's moderate and dignified attitude you will see he photo there among this bundle that be just how he appear in court in deep black of course but without any sign of ostentation in he mourning he have allow he beard to grow lately and wear it closely cut in a point after he evidence the sensation of the day occur a tall dark-haired man with the word ` city ' write metaphorically all over he have kiss the book and be wait to tell the truth and nothing but the truth he give he name as andrew campbell head of the firm of campbell & co broker of throgmorton street in the afternoon of march 18th mr campbell travel on the underground railway have notice a very pretty woman in the same carriage as himself she have ask he if she be in the right train for aldersgate mr campbell reply in the affirmative and then bury himself in the stock exchange quotation of he evening paper at gower street a gentleman in a tweed suit and bowler hat get into the carriage and take a seat opposite the lady she seem very much astonished at see he but mr andrew campbell do not recollect the exact word she say the two talk to one another a good deal and certainly the lady appear animated and cheerful witness take no notice of they he be very much engross in some calculation and finally get out at farringdon street he notice that the man in the tweed suit also get out close behind he have shake hand with the lady and say in a pleasant way : ' _ au revoir _ do not be late to-night ' mr campbell do not hear the lady 's reply and soon lose sight of the man in the crowd every one be on tenter-hook and eagerly wait for the palpitating moment when witness would describe and identify the man who last have see and speak to the unfortunate woman within five minute probably of she strange and unaccountable death personally i know what be come before the scotch stockbroker speak i could have jot down the graphic and lifelike description he would give of a probable murderer it would have fit equally well the man who sit and have luncheon at this table just now it would certainly have describe five out of every ten young englishman you know the individual be of medium height he wear a moustache which be not very fair nor yet very dark he hair be between color he wear a bowler hat and a tweed suit -- and -- and -- that be all -- mr campbell might perhaps know he again but then again he might not -- he be not pay much attention -- the gentleman be sit on the same side of the carriage as himself -- and he have he hat on all the time he himself be busy with he newspaper -- yes -- he might know he again -- but he really could not say mr andrew campbell 's evidence be not worth very much you will say no it be not in itself and would not have justify any arrest be it not for the additional statement make by mr jame verner manager of messr rodney & co color printer mr verner be a personal friend of mr andrew campbell and it appear that at farringdon street where he be wait for he train he see mr campbell get out of a first-class railway carriage mr verner speak to he for a second and then just as the train be move off he step into the same compartment which have just be vacate by the stockbroker and the man in the tweed suit he vaguely recollect a lady sit in the opposite corner to he own with she face turn away from he apparently asleep but he pay no special attention to she he be like nearly all business man when they be travel -- engross in he paper presently a special quotation interested he he wish to make a note of it take out a pencil from he waistcoat pocket and see a clean piece of paste-board on the floor he pick it up and scribble on it the memorandum which he wish to keep he then slip the card into he pocket-book ` it be only two or three day later ' add mr verner in the midst of breathless silence ` that i have occasion to refer to these same note again ` in the meanwhile the papers have be full of the mysterious death on the underground railway and the name of those connect with it be pretty familiar to I it be therefore with much astonishment that on look at the paste-board which i have casually pick up in the railway carriage i see the name on it frank errington ' there be no doubt that the sensation in court be almost unprecedented never since the day of the fenchurch street mystery and the trial of smethurst have i see so much excitement mind you i be not excite -- i know by now every detail of that crime as if i have commit it myself in fact i could not have do it better although i have be a student of crime for many year now many people there -- he friend mostly -- believe that errington be doom i think he think so too for i could see that he face be terribly white and he now and then pass he tongue over he lip as if they be parch you see he be in the awful dilemma -- a perfectly natural one by the way -- of be absolutely incapable of _ prove _ a _ alibi _ the crime -- if crime there be -- have be commit three week ago a man about town like mr frank errington might remember that he spend certain hour of a special afternoon at he club or in the park but it be very doubtful in nine case out of ten if he can find a friend who could positively swear as to have see he there no no mr errington be in a tight corner and he know it you see there be -- besides the evidence -- two or three circumstance which do not improve matter for he he hobby in the direction of toxicology to begin with the police have find in he room every description of poisonous substance include prussic acid then again that journey to marseille the start for colombo be though perfectly innocent a very unfortunate one mr errington have go on a aimless voyage but the public thought that he have flee terrify at he own crime sir arthur inglewood however here again display he marvellous skill on behalf of he client by the masterly way in which he literally turn all the witness for the crown inside out have first get mr andrew campbell to state positively that in the accuse he certainly do _ not _ recognize the man in the tweed suit the eminent lawyer after twenty minute ' cross-examination have so completely upset the stockbroker 's equanimity that it be very likely he would not have recognize he own office-boy but through all he flurry and all he annoyance mr andrew campbell remain very sure of one thing namely that the lady be alive and cheerful and talk pleasantly with the man in the tweed suit up to the moment when the latter have shake hand with she left she with a pleasant ' _ au revoir _ do not be late to-night ' he have hear neither scream nor struggle and in he opinion if the individual in the tweed suit have administer a dose of poison to he companion it must have be with she own knowledge and free will and the lady in the train most emphatically neither look nor speak like a woman prepare for a sudden and violent death mr jame verner against that swear equally positively that he have stand in full view of the carriage door from the moment that mr campbell get out until he himself step into the compartment that there be no one else in that carriage between farringdon street and aldgate and that the lady to the best of he belief have make no movement during the whole of that journey no frank errington be _ not _ commit for trial on the capital charge say the man in the corner with one of he sardonic smile thanks to the cleverness of sir arthur inglewood he lawyer he absolutely deny he identity with the man in the tweed suit and swear he have not see mr hazeldene since eleven o'clock in the morning of that fatal day there be no _ proof _ that he have moreover accord to mr campbell 's opinion the man in the tweed suit be in all probability not the murderer common sense would not admit that a woman could have a deadly poison inject into she without she knowledge while chat pleasantly to she murderer mr errington live abroad now he be about to marry i do not think any of he real friend for a moment believe that he commit the dastardly crime the police think they know better they do know this much that it could not have be a case of suicide that if the man who undoubtedly travel with mr hazeldene on that fatal afternoon have no crime upon he conscience he would long ago have come forward and throw what light he could upon the mystery as to who that man be the police in they blindness have not the faintest doubt under the unshakable belief that errington be guilty they have spend the last few month in unceasing labor to try and find further and stronger proof of he guilt but they will not find they because there be none there be no positive proof against the actual murderer for he be one of those clever blackguard who think of everything foresee every eventuality who know human nature well and can foretell exactly what evidence will be bring against they and act accordingly this blackguard from the first keep the figure the personality of frank errington before he mind frank errington be the dust which the scoundrel throw metaphorically in the eye of the police and you must admit that he succeed in blind they -- to the extent even of make they entirely forget the one simple little sentence overhear by mr andrew campbell and which be of course the clue to the whole thing -- the only slip the cunning rogue make -- ' _ au revoir _ do not be late to-night ' mr hazeldene be go that night to the opera with she husband -- you be astonished he add with a shrug of the shoulder you do not see the tragedy yet as i have see it before I all along the frivolous young wife the flirtation with the friend -- all a blind all pretence i take the trouble which the police should have take immediately of find out something about the finances of the hazeldene _ ménage _ money be in nine case out of ten the keynote to a crime i find that the will of mary beatrice hazeldene have be prove by the husband she sole executor the estate be swear at # 15000 i find out moreover that mr edward sholto hazeldene be a poor shipper 's clerk when he marry the daughter of a wealthy builder in kensington -- and then i make note of the fact that the disconsolate widower have allow he beard to grow since the death of he wife there be no doubt that he be a clever rogue add the strange creature lean excitedly over the table and peer into polly 's face do you know how that deadly poison be inject into the poor woman 's system by the simplest of all mean one know to every scoundrel in southern europe a ring -- yes a ring which have a tiny hollow needle capable of hold a sufficient quantity of prussic acid to have kill two person instead of one the man in the tweed suit shake hand with he fair companion -- probably she hardly feel the prick not sufficiently in any case to make she utter a scream and mind you the scoundrel have every facility through he friendship with mr errington of procure what poison he require not to mention he friend 's visit card we can not gauge how many month ago he begin to try and copy frank errington in he style of dress the cut of he moustache he general appearance make the change probably so gradual that no one in he own _ entourage _ would notice it he select for he model a man he own height and build with the same color hair but there be the terrible risk of be identify by he fellow-traveller in the underground suggest polly yes there certainly be that risk he choose to take it and he be wise he reckon that several day would in any case elapse before that person who by the way be a business man absorb in he newspaper would actually see he again the great secret of successful crime be to study human nature add the man in the corner as he begin look for he hat and coat edward hazeldene know it well but the ring he may have buy that when he be on he honeymoon he suggest with a grim chuckle the tragedy be not plan in a week it may have take year to mature but you will own that there go a frightful scoundrel unhung i have leave you he photograph as he be a year ago and as he be now you will see he have shave he beard again but also he moustache i fancy he be a friend now of mr andrew campbell he leave miss polly burton wonder not know what to believe and that be why she miss she appointment with mr richard frobisher -lrb- of the _ london mail _ -rrb- to go and see maud allan dance at the palace theater that afternoon chapter xii the liverpool mystery a title -- a foreign title i mean -- be always very useful for purpose of swindle and fraud remark the man in the corner to polly one day the cleverest robbery of modern time be perpetrate lately in vienna by a man who dub himself lord seymor whilst over here the same class of thief call himself count something end in ` o ' or prince the other end in ` off ' fortunately for we hotel and lodging-house keeper over here she reply they be begin to be more alive to the way of foreign swindler and look upon all title gentry who speak broken english as possible swindler or thief the result sometimes be exceedingly unpleasant to the real _ grand seigneur _ who honor this country at time with they visit reply the man in the corner now take the case of prince semionicz a man whose sixteen quartering be duly record in gotha who carry enough luggage with he to pay for the use of every room in a hotel for at least a week whose gold cigarette case with diamond and turquoise ornament be actually steal without he take the slightest trouble to try and recover it that same man be undoubtedly look upon with suspicion by the manager of the liverpool north-western hotel from the moment that he secretary -- a dapper somewhat vulgar little frenchman -- bespoke on behalf of he employer with himself and a valet the best suite of room the hotel contain obviously those suspicion be unfounded for the little secretary as soon as prince semionicz have arrive deposit with the manager a pile of bank note also papers and bond the value of which would exceed tenfold the most outrageous bill that could possibly be place before the noble visitor moreover m albert lambert explain that the prince who only mean to stay in liverpool a few day be on he way to chicago where he wish to visit princess anna semionicz he sister who be marry to mr girwan the great copper king and multi-millionaire yet as i tell you before in spite of all these undoubted security suspicion of the wealthy russian prince lurk in the mind of most liverpudlian who come in business contact with he he have be at the north-western two day when he send he secretary to window and vassall the jeweller of bold street with a request that they would kindly send a representative round to the hotel with some nice piece of jewellery diamond and pearl chiefly which he be desirous of take as a present to he sister in chicago mr winslow take the order from m albert with a pleasant bow then he go to he inner office and consult with he partner mr vassall as to the best course to adopt both the gentleman be desirous of do business for business have be very slack lately : neither wish to refuse a possible customer or to offend mr pettitt the manager of the north-western who have recommend they to the prince but that foreign title and the vulgar little french secretary stick in the throat of the two pompous and worthy liverpool jeweller and together they agree firstly that no credit should be give and secondly that if a cheque or even a banker 's draft be tender the jewel be not to be give up until that cheque or draft be cash then come the question as to who should take the jewel to the hotel it be altogether against business etiquette for the senior partner to do such errand themselves moreover it be think that it would be easier for a clerk to explain without give undue offence that he could not take the responsibility of a cheque or draft without have cash it previously to give up the jewel then there be the question of the probable necessity of confer in a foreign tongue the head assistant charle needham who have be in the employ of winslow and vassall for over twelve year be in true british fashion ignorant of any language save he own it be therefore decide to dispatch mr schwarz a young german clerk lately arrive on the delicate errand mr schwarz be mr winslow 's nephew and godson a sister of that gentleman have marry the head of the great german firm of schwarz & co silversmith of hamburg and berlin the young man have soon become a great favorite with he uncle whose heir he would presumably be as mr winslow have no child at first mr vassall make some demur about send mr schwarz with so many valuable jewel alone in a city which he have not yet have the time to study thoroughly but finally he allow himself to be persuade by he senior partner and a fine selection of necklace pendant bracelet and ring amount in value to over # 16000 have be make it be decide that mr schwarz should go to the north-western in a cab the next day at about three o'clock in the afternoon this he accordingly do the following day be a Thursday business go on in the shop as usual under the direction of the head assistant until about seven o'clock when mr winslow return from he club where he usually spend a hour over the papers every afternoon and at once ask for he nephew to he astonishment mr needham inform he that mr schwarz have not yet return this seem a little strange and mr winslow with a slightly anxious look in he face go into the inner office in order to consult he junior partner mr vassall offer to go round to the hotel and interview mr pettitt ' i be begin to get anxious myself ' he say ` but do not quite like to say so i have be in over half a hour hope every moment that you would come in and that perhaps you could give I some reassuring news i think that perhaps you have meet mr schwarz and be come back together ' however mr vassall walk round to the hotel and interview the hall porter the latter perfectly well remembered mr schwarz send in he card to prince semionicz ` at what time be that ' ask mr vassall ` about ten minute past three sir when he come it be about a hour later when he leave ' ` when he leave ' gasp more than say mr vassall ` yes sir mr schwarz leave here about a quarter before four sir ' ` be you quite sure ' ` quite sure mr pettitt be in the hall when he leave and he ask he something about business mr schwarz laugh and say not bad i hope there be nothing wrong sir ' add the man ` oh -- er -- nothing -- thank you can i see mr pettitt ' ` certainly sir ' mr pettitt the manager of the hotel share mr vassall 's anxiety immediately he hear that the young german have not yet return home ' i speak to he a little before four o'clock we have just switch on the electric light which we always do these winter month at that hour but i should not worry myself mr vassall the young man may have see to some business on he way home you 'll probably find he in when you go back ' apparently somewhat reassure mr vassall thank mr pettitt and hurry back to the shop only to find that mr schwarz have not return though it be now close on eight o'clock mr winslow look so haggard and upset that it would have be cruel to heap reproach upon he other trouble or to utter so much as the faintest suspicion that young schwarz 's permanent disappearance with # 16000 in jewel and money be within the bound of probability there be one chance leave but under the circumstance a very slight one indeed the winslow ' private house be up the birkenhead end of the town young schwarz have be live with they ever since he arrival in liverpool and he may have -- either not feel well or for some other reason -- go straight home without call at the shop it be unlikely as valuable jewellery be never keep at the private house but -- it just might have happen it would be useless continue the man in the corner and decidedly uninteresting be i to relate to you messr winslow 's and vassall 's further anxiety with regard to the miss young man suffice it to say that on reach he private house mr winslow find that he godson have neither return nor send any telegraphic message of any kind not wish to needlessly alarm he wife mr winslow make a attempt at eat he dinner but directly after that he hurry back to the north-western hotel and ask to see prince semionicz the prince be at the theater with he secretary and probably would not be home until nearly midnight mr winslow then not know what to think nor yet what to fear and in spite of the horror he feel of give publicity to he nephew 's disappearance think it he duty to go round to the police-station and interview the inspector it be wonderful how quickly news of that type travel in a large city like liverpool already the morning papers of the follow day be full of the latest sensation : ` mysterious disappearance of a well-known tradesman ' mr winslow find a copy of the paper contain the sensational announcement on he breakfast-table it lay side by side with a letter address to he in he nephew 's handwriting which have be post in liverpool mr winslow place that letter write to he by he nephew into the hand of the police its contents therefore quickly become public property the astounding statement make therein by mr schwarz create in quiet businesslike liverpool a sensation which have seldom be equal it appear that the young fellow do call on prince semionicz at a quarter past three on Wednesday December 10th with a bag full of jewel amount in value to some # 16000 the prince duly admire and finally select from among the ornament a necklace pendant and bracelet the whole be price by mr schwarz accord to he instruction at # 10500 prince semionicz be most prompt and businesslike in he dealings ` you will require immediate payment for these of course ' he say in perfect english ` and i know you business man prefer solid cash to cheque especially when deal with foreigner i always provide myself with plenty of bank of england note in consequence ' he add with a pleasant smile ` as # 10500 in gold would perhaps be a little inconvenient to carry if you will kindly make out the receipt my secretary m lambert will settle all business matter with you ' he thereupon take the jewel he have select and lock they up in he dressing-case the beautiful silver filling of which mr schwarz just catch a short glimpse of then have be accommodate with paper and ink the young jeweller make out the account and receipt whilst m lambert the secretary count out before he 105 crisp bank of england note of # 100 each then with a final bow to he exceedingly urbane and eminently satisfactory customer mr schwarz take he leave in the hall he see and speak to mr pettitt and then he go out into the street he have just leave the hotel and be about to cross towards st george 's hall when a gentleman in a magnificent fur coat step quickly out of a cab which have be station near the curb and touch he lightly upon the shoulder say with a unmistakable air of authority at the same time hand he a card : ` that be my name i must speak with you immediately schwarz glance at the card and by the light of the arc lamp above he head read on it the name of ` dimitri slaviansky burgreneff de la iiie section de la police imperial de sm le czar ' quickly the owner of the unpronounceable name and the significant title point to the cab from which he have just alight and schwarz whose every suspicion with regard to he princely customer bristle up in one moment clutch he bag and follow he impose interlocutor as soon as they be both comfortably seat in the cab the latter begin with courteous apology in broken but fluent english : ' i must ask you pardon sir for thus trespassing upon you valuable time and i certainly should not have do so but for the certainty that we interest in a certain matter which i have in hand be practically identical in so far that we both should wish to outwit a clever rogue ' instinctively and he mind full of terrible apprehension mr schwarz 's hand wander to he pocket-book fill to overflow with the bank-note which he have so lately receive from the prince ` ah i see ' interpose the courteous russian with a smile ` he have play the confidence trick on you with the usual addition of so many so-called bank-note ' ` so-called ' gasp the unfortunate young man ' i do not think i often err in my estimate of my own countryman ' continued m burgreneff ' i have vast experience you must remember therefore i doubt if i be do m -- er -- what do he call himself -- prince something -- a injustice if i assert even without handle those crisp bit of paper you have in you pocket-book that no bank would exchange they for gold ' remember he uncle 's suspicion and he own mr schwarz curse himself for he blindness and folly in accept note so easily without for a moment imagine that they might be false now with every one of those suspicion fully on the alert he feel the bit of paper with nervous anxious finger while the imperturbable russian calmly strike a match ` see here ' he say point to one of the note ` the shape of that w in the signature of the chief cashier i be not a english police officer but i could pick out that spurious w among a thousand genuine one you see i have see a good many ' now of course poor young schwarz have not see very many bank of england note he could not have tell whether one ` w ' in mr bowen 's signature be better than another but though he do not speak english nearly as fluently as he pompous interlocutor he understand every word of the appalling statement the latter have just make ` then that prince ' he say ` at the hotel -- ' ` be no more prince than you and i my dear sir ' conclude the gentleman of he imperial majesty 's police calmly ` and the jewel mr winslow 's jewel ' ` with the jewel there may be a chance -- oh a mere chance these forge bank-note which you accept so trustingly may prove the means of recover you property ' ` how ' ` the penalty of forge and circulate spurious bank-note be very heavy you know that the fear of seven year ' penal servitude will act as a wonderful sedative upon the -- er -- prince 's joyful mood he will give up the jewel to I all right enough never you fear he know ' add the russian officer grimly ` that there be plenty of old score to settle up without the additional one of forge bank-note we interest you see be identical may i rely on you co-operation ' ` oh i will do as you wish ' say the delighted young german ` mr winslow and mr vassall they trust I and i have be such a fool i hope it be not too late ' ' i think not ' say m burgreneff he hand already on the door of the cab ` though i have be talk to you i have keep a eye on the hotel and we friend the prince have not yet go out we be accustom you know to have eye everywhere we of the russian secret police i do not think that i will ask you to be present at the confrontation perhaps you will wait for I in the cab there be a nasty fog outside and you will be more private will you give I those beautiful bank-notes thank you do not be anxious i will not be long ' he lift he hat and slip the note into the inner pocket of he magnificent fur coat as he do so mr schwarz catch sight of a rich uniform and a wide sash which no doubt be destine to carry additional moral weight with the clever rogue upstairs then he imperial majesty 's police officer step quickly out of the cab and mr schwarz be leave alone chapter xiii a cunning rascal yes leave severely alone continue the man in the corner with a sarcastic chuckle so severely alone in fact that one quarter of a hour after another pass by and still the magnificent police officer in the gorgeous uniform do not return then when it be too late schwarz curse himself once again for the double-dyed idiot that he be he have be only too ready to believe that prince semionicz be a liar and a rogue and under these unjust suspicion he have fall a all too easy prey to one of the most cunning rascal he have ever come across a inquiry from the hall porter at the north-western elicit the fact that no such personage as mr schwarz describe have enter the hotel the young man ask to see prince semionicz hope against hope that all be not yet lose the prince receive he most courteously he be dictate some letter to he secretary while the valet be in the next room prepare he master 's evening clothes mr schwarz find it very difficult to explain what he actually do want there stand the dressing-case in which the prince have lock up the jewel and there the bag from which the secretary have take the bank-note after much hesitation on schwarz 's part and much impatience on that of the prince the young man blurt out the whole story of the so-called russian police officer whose card he still hold in he hand the prince it appear take the whole thing wonderfully good-naturedly no doubt he think the jeweller a hopeless fool he show he the jewel the receipt he hold and also a large bundle of bank-note similar to those schwarz have with such culpable folly give up to the clever rascal in the cab ' i pay all my bill with bank of england note mr schwarz it would have be wiser perhaps if you have speak to the manager of the hotel about I before you be so ready to believe any cock-and-bull story about my suppose roguery ' finally he place a small 16mo volume before the young jeweller and say with a pleasant smile : ` if people in this country who be in a large way of business and be therefore likely to come in contact with people of foreign nationality be to study these little volume before do business with any foreigner who claim a title much disappointment and a great loss would often be save now in this case have you look up page 797 of this little volume of gotha 's almanach you would have see my name in it and know from the first that the so-called russian detective be a liar ' there be nothing more to be say and mr schwarz leave the hotel no doubt now that he have be hopelessly dupe he dare not go home and half hope by communicate with the police that they might succeed in arrest the thief before he have time to leave liverpool he interview detective-inspector watson and be at once confront with the awful difficulty which would make the recovery of the bank-note practically hopeless he have never have the time or opportunity of jot down the number of the note mr winslow though terribly wrathful against he nephew do not wish to keep he out of he home as soon as he have receive schwarz 's letter he trace he with inspector watson 's help to he lodgings in north street where the unfortunate young man mean to remain hidden until the terrible storm have blow over or perhaps until the thief have be catch red-handed with the booty still in he hand this happy event needless to say never do occur though the police make every effort to trace the man who have decoy schwarz into the cab he appearance be such a uncommon one it seem most unlikely that no one in liverpool should have notice he after he leave that cab the wonderful fur coat the long beard all must have be noticeable even though it be past four o'clock on a somewhat foggy December afternoon but every investigation prove futile no one answer schwarz 's description of the man have be see anywhere the papers continue to refer to the case as ` the liverpool mystery ' scotland yard send mr fairburn down -- the celebrated detective -- at the request of the liverpool police to help in the investigation but nothing avail prince semionicz with he suite leave liverpool and he who have attempt to blacken he character and have succeed in rob messr winslow and vassall of # 10500 have completely disappear the man in the corner readjust he collar and necktie which during the narrative of this interesting mystery have work its way up he long crane-like neck under he large flappy ear he costume of check tweed of a peculiarly loud pattern have tickle the fancy of some of the waitress who be stand gaze at he and giggle in one corner this evidently make he nervous he gaze up very meekly at polly look for all the world like a bald-headed adjutant dress for a holiday of course all sort of theory of the theft get about at first one of the most popular and at the same time most quickly explode be that young schwarz have tell a cock-and-bull story and be the actual thief himself however as i say before that be very quickly explode as mr schwarz senior a very wealthy merchant never allow he son 's carelessness to be a serious loss to he kind employer as soon as he thoroughly grasp all the circumstance of the extraordinary case he draw a cheque for # 10500 and remit it to messr winslow and vassall it be just but it be also high-minded all liverpool know of the generous action as mr winslow take care that it should and any evil suspicion regard young mr schwarz vanish as quickly as it have come then of course there be the theory about the prince and he suite and to this day i fancy there be plenty of people in liverpool and also in london who declare that the so-called russian police officer be a confederate no doubt that theory be very plausible and messr winslow and vassall spend a good deal of money in try to prove a case against the russian prince very soon however that theory be also bind to collapse mr fairburn whose reputation as a investigator of crime wax in direct inverted ratio to he capacity do hit upon the obvious course of interview the manager of the larger london and liverpool _ agent de change _ he soon find that prince semionicz have convert a great deal of russian and french money into english bank-note since he arrival in this country more than # 30000 in good solid honest money be trace to the pocket of the gentleman with the sixteen quartering it seem therefore more than improbable that a man who be obviously fairly wealthy would risk imprisonment and hard labor if not worse for the sake of increase he fortune by # 10000 however the theory of the prince 's guilt have take firm root in the dull mind of we police authority they have have every information with regard to prince semionicz 's antecedent from russium he position he wealth have be place above suspicion and yet they suspect and go on suspect he or he secretary they have communicate with the police of every european capital and while they still hope to obtain sufficient evidence against those they suspect they calmly allow the guilty to enjoy the fruit of he clever roguery the guilty say polly who do you think -- who do i think know at that moment that young schwarz have money in he possession he say excitedly wriggle in he chair like a jack-in-the-box obviously some one be guilty of that theft who know that schwarz have go to interview a rich russian and would in all probability return with a large sum of money in he possession who indeed but the prince and he secretary she argue but just now you say -- just now i say that the police be determine to find the prince and he secretary guilty they do not look further than they own stumpy nose messr winslow and vassall spend money with a free hand in those investigation mr winslow as the senior partner stand to lose over # 9000 by that robbery now with mr vassall it be different when i see how the police go on blundering in this case i take the trouble to make certain inquiry the whole thing interested I so much and i learn all that i wish to know i find out namely that mr vassall be very much a junior partner in the firm that he only draw ten per cent of the profit have be promote lately to a partnership from have be senior assistant now the police do not take the trouble to find that out but you do not mean that -- i mean that in all case where robbery affect more than one person the first thing to find out be whether it affect the second party equally with the first i prove that to you do not i over that robbery in phillimore terrace there as here one of the two party stand to lose very little in comparison with the other -- even then -- she begin wait a moment for i find out something more the moment i have ascertain that mr vassall be not draw more than about # 500 a year from the business profit i try to ascertain at what rate he live and what be he chief vice i find that he keep a fine house in albert terrace now the rent of those house be # 250 a year therefore speculation horse-racing or some sort of gambling must help to keep up that establishment speculation and most form of gambling be synonymous with debt and ruin it be only a question of time whether mr vassall be in debt or not at the time that i can not say but this i do know that ever since that unfortunate loss to he of about # 1000 he have keep he house in nicer style than before and he now have a good banking account at the lancashire and liverpool bank which he open a year after he ` heavy loss ' but it must have be very difficult -- argue polly what he say to have plan out the whole thing for carry it out be mere child 's play he have twenty-four hour in which to put he plan into execution why what be there to do firstly to go to a local printer in some out-of-the-way part of the town and get he to print a few card with the high-sounding name that of course be do ` while you wait ' beyond that there be the purchase of a good second-hand uniform fur coat and a beard and a wig from a costumier 's no no the execution be not difficult it be the planning of it all the daring that be so fine schwarz of course be a foreigner he have only be in england a little over a fortnight vassall 's broken english mislead he probably he do not know the junior partner very intimately i have no doubt that but for he uncle 's absurd british prejudice and suspicion against the russian prince schwarz would not have be so ready to believe in the latter 's roguery as i say it would be a great boon if english tradesman study gotha more but it be clever be not it i could not have do it much better myself that last sentence be so characteristic before polly could think of some plausible argument against he theory he be go and she be try vainly to find another solution to the liverpool mystery chapter xiv the edinburgh mystery the man in the corner have not enjoy he lunch miss polly burton could see that he have something on he mind for even before he begin to talk that morning he be fidget with he bit of string and set all she nerve on the jar have you ever feel real sympathy with a criminal or a thief he ask she after a while only once i think she reply and then i be not quite sure that the unfortunate woman who do enlist my sympathy be the criminal you make she out to be you mean the heroine of the york mystery he reply blandly i know that you try very hard that time to discredit the only possible version of that mysterious murder the version which be my own now i be equally sure that you have at the present moment no more notion as to who kill and rob poor lady donaldson in charlotte square edinburgh than the police have themselves and yet you be fully prepare to pooh-pooh my argument and to disbelieve my version of the mystery such be the lady journalist 's mind if you have some cock-and-bull story to explain that extraordinary case she retort of course i shall disbelieve it certainly if you be go to try and enlist my sympathy on behalf of edith crawford i can assure you you will not succeed well i do not know that that be altogether my intention i see you be interested in the case but i dare say you do not remember all the circumstance you must forgive I if i repeat that which you know already if you have ever be to edinburgh at all you will have hear of graham 's bank and mr andrew graham the present head of the firm be undoubtedly one of the most prominent notability of ` modern athen ' the man in the corner take two or three photo from he pocket-book and place they before the young girl then point at they with he long bony finger -- that he say be mr elphinstone graham the eldest son a typical young scotchman as you see and this be david graham the second son polly look more closely at this last photo and see before she a young face upon which some lasting sorrow seem already to have leave its mark the face be delicate and thin the feature pinch and the eye seem almost unnaturally large and prominent he be deform comment the man in the corner in answer to the girl 's thought and as such a object of pity and even of repugnance to most of he friend there be also a good deal of talk in edinburgh society as to he mental condition he mind accord to many intimate friend of the graham be at time decidedly unhinge be that as it may i fancy that he life must have be a very sad one he have lose he mother when quite a baby and he father seem strangely enough to have a almost unconquerable dislike towards he every one get to know presently of david graham 's sad position in he father 's own house and also of the great affection lavish upon he by he godmother lady donaldson who be a sister of mr graham 's she be a lady of considerable wealth be the widow of sir george donaldson the great distiller but she seem to have be decidedly eccentric latterly she have astonish all she family -- who be rigid presbyterian -- by announce she intention of embrace the roman catholic faith and then retire to the convent of st augustine 's at newton abbot in devonshire she have sole and absolute control of the vast fortune which a doting husband have bequeath to she clearly therefore she be at liberty to bestow it upon a devonshire convent if she choose but this evidently be not altogether she intention i tell you how fond she be of she deform godson do i not be a bundle of eccentricity she have many hobby none more pronounced than the fix determination to see -- before retire from the world altogether -- david graham happily marry now it appear that david graham ugly deform half-demented as he be have fall desperately in love with miss edith crawford daughter of the late dr crawford of prince 's garden the young lady however -- very naturally perhaps -- fight shy of david graham who about this time certainly seem very queer and morose but lady donaldson with characteristic determination seem to have make up she mind to melt miss crawford 's heart towards she unfortunate nephew on October the 2nd last at a family party give by mr graham in he fine mansion in charlotte square lady donaldson openly announce she intention of make over by deed of gift to she nephew david graham certain property money and share amount in total value to the sum of # 100000 and also she magnificent diamond which be worth # 50000 for the use of the say david 's wife keith macfinlay a lawyer of prince 's street receive the next day instruction for draw up the necessary deed of gift which she pledge herself to sign the day of she godson 's wedding a week later _ the scotsman _ contain the follow paragraph : -- ' a marriage be arrange and will shortly take place between david younger son of andrew graham esq of charlotte square edinburgh and dochnakirk perthshire and edith lillian only survive daughter of the late dr kenneth crawford of prince 's garden ' in edinburgh society comment be loud and various upon the forthcoming marriage and on the whole these comment be far from complimentary to the family concerned i do not think that the scotch be a particularly sentimental race but there be such obvious buying selling and bargaining about this marriage that scottish chivalry rise in revolt at the think against that the three people most concerned seem perfectly satisfied david graham be positively transform he moroseness be go from he he lose he queer way and wild manners and become gentle and affectionate in the midst of this great and unexpected happiness miss edith crawford order she trousseau and talk of the diamond to she friend and lady donaldson be only wait for the consummation of this marriage -- she heart 's desire -- before she finally retire from the world at peace with it and with herself the deed of gift be ready for signature on the wedding day which be fix for November 7th and lady donaldson take up she abode temporarily in she brother 's house in charlotte square mr graham give a large ball on October 23rd special interest be attach to this ball from the fact that for this occasion lady donaldson insist that david 's future wife should wear the magnificent diamond which be soon to become hers they be it seem superb and become miss crawford 's stately beauty to perfection the ball be a brilliant success the last guest leave at four be the next day it be the universal topic of conversation and the day after that when edinburgh unfold the late edition of its morning papers it learn with horror and dismay that lady donaldson have be find murder in she room and that the celebrated diamond have be steal hardly have the beautiful little city however recover from this awful shock than its newspaper have another thrilling sensation ready for they reader already all scotch and english papers have mysteriously hint at ` startling information ' obtain by the procurator fiscal and at a ` impending sensational arrest ' then the announcement come and every one in edinburgh read horror-struck and aghast that the ` sensational arrest ' be none other than that of miss edith crawford for murder and robbery both so daring and horrible that reason refuse to believe that a young lady bear and breed in the best social circle could have conceive much less execute so heinous a crime she have be arrest in london at the midland hotel and bring to edinburgh where she be judicially examine bail be refuse chapter xv a terrible plight little more than a fortnight after that edith crawford be duly commit to stand she trial before the high court of justiciary she have plead ` not guilty ' at the plead diet and she defense be entrust to sir jame fenwick one of the most eminent advocate at the criminal bar strange to say continue the man in the corner after a while public opinion from the first go dead against the accuse the public be absolutely like a child perfectly irresponsible and wholly illogical it argue that since miss crawford have be ready to contract a marriage with a half-demented deform creature for the sake of he # 100000 she must have be equally ready to murder and rob a old lady for the sake of # 50000 worth of jewellery without the encumbrance of so undesirable a husband perhaps the great sympathy arouse in the popular mind for david graham have much to do with this ill-feeling against the accuse david graham have by this cruel and dastardly murder lose the best -- if not the only -- friend he possess he have also lose at one fall swoop the large fortune which lady donaldson have be about to assign to he the deed of gift have never be sign and the old lady 's vast wealth instead of enrich she favorite nephew be distribute -- since she have make no will -- amongst she heirs-at-law and now to crown this long chapter of sorrow david graham see the girl he love accuse of the awful crime which have rob he of friend and fortune it be therefore with a unmistakable thrill of righteous satisfaction that edinburgh society see this ` mercenary girl ' in so terrible a plight i be immensely interested in the case and journey down to edinburgh in order to get a good view of the chief actor in the thrilling drama which be about to be unfold there i succeed -- i generally do -- in secure one of the front seat among the audience and be already comfortably install in my place in court when through the trap door i see the head of the prisoner emerge she be very becomingly dress in deep black and lead by two policeman she take she place in the dock sir jame fenwick shake hand with she very warmly and i could almost hear he instil word of comfort into she the trial last six clear day during which time more than forty person be examine for the prosecution and as many for the defense but the most interesting witness be certainly the two doctor the maid tremlett campbell the high street jeweller and david graham there be of course a great deal of medical evidence to go through poor lady donaldson have be find with a silk scarf tie tightly round she neck she face show even to the inexperienced eye every symptom of strangulation then tremlett lady donaldson 's confidential maid be call closely examine by crown counsel she give a account of the ball at charlotte square on the 23rd and the wear of the jewel by miss crawford on that occasion ' i help miss crawford on with the tiara over she hair ' she say ` and my lady put the two necklace round miss crawford 's neck herself there be also some beautiful brooch bracelet and earring at four o'clock in the morning when the ball be over miss crawford bring the jewel back to my lady 's room my lady have already go to bed and i have put out the electric light as i be go too there be only one candle leave in the room close to the bed ` miss crawford take all the jewel off and ask lady donaldson for the key of the safe so that she might put they away my lady give she the key and say to I you can go to bed tremlett you must be dead tired i be glad to go for i could hardly stand up -- i be so tired i say good night to my lady and also to miss crawford who be busy put the jewel away as i be go out of the room i hear lady donaldson say : have you manage it my dear miss crawford say : i have put everything away very nicely ' in answer to sir jame fenwick tremlett say that lady donaldson always carry the key of she jewel safe on a ribbon round she neck and have do so the whole day precede she death ` on the night of the 24th ' she continue ` lady donaldson still seem rather tired and go up to she room directly after dinner and while the family be still sit in the dining-room she make I dress she hair then she slip on she dressing-gown and sit in the arm-chair with a book she tell I that she then feel strangely uncomfortable and nervous and could not account for it ` however she do not want I to sit with she so i think that the best thing i could do be to tell mr david graham that she ladyship do not seem very cheerful she ladyship be so fond of mr david it always make she happy to have he with she i then go to my room and at half-past eight mr david call I he say : you mistress do seem a little restless to-night if i be you i would just go and listen at she door in about a hour 's time and if she have not go to bed i would go in and stay with she until she have at about ten o'clock i do as mr david suggest and listen at she ladyship 's door however all be quiet in the room and think she ladyship have go to sleep i go back to bed ` the next morning at eight o'clock when i take in my mistress 's cup of tea i see she lie on the floor she poor dear face all purple and distorted i scream and the other servant come rush along then mr graham have the door lock and send for the doctor and the police ' the poor woman seem to find it very difficult not to break down she be closely question by sir jame fenwick but have nothing further to say she have last see she mistress alive at eight o'clock on the evening of the 24th ` and when you listen at she door at ten o'clock ' ask sir jame ` do you try to open it ' ' i do but it be lock ' she reply ` do lady donaldson usually lock she bedroom at night ' ` nearly always ' ` and in the morning when you take in the tea ' ` the door be open i walk straight in ' ` you be quite sure ' insist sir jame ' i swear it ' solemnly assert the woman after that we be inform by several member of mr graham 's establishment that miss crawford have be in to tea at charlotte square in the afternoon of the 24th that she tell every one she be go to london by the night mail as she have some special shopping she wish to do there it appear that mr graham and david both try to persuade she to stay to dinner and then to go by the 910 pm from the caledonian station miss crawford however have refuse say she always prefer to go from the waverley station it be nearer to she own room and she still have a good deal of write to do in spite of this two witness see the accuse in charlotte square later on in the evening she be carry a bag which seem heavy and be walk towards the caledonian railway station but the most thrilling moment in that sensational trial be reach on the second day when david graham look wretchedly ill unkempt and haggard step into the witness-box a murmur of sympathy go round the audience at sight of he who be the second perhaps most deeply stricken victim of the charlotte square tragedy david graham in answer to crown counsel give a account of he last interview with lady donaldson ` tremlett have tell I that she seem anxious and upset and i go to have a chat with she she soon cheer up and ' there the unfortunate young man hesitate visibly but after a while resume with a obvious effort ` she speak of my marriage and of the gift she be about to bestow upon I she say the diamond would be for my wife and after that for my daughter if i have one she also complain that mr macfinlay have be so punctilious about prepare the deed of gift and that it be a great pity the # 100000 could not just pass from she hand to mine without so much fuss ' i stay talk with she for about half a hour then i leave she as she seem ready to go to bed but i tell she maid to listen at the door in about a hour 's time ' there be deep silence in the court for a few moment a silence which to I seem almost electrical it be as if some time before it be utter the next question put by crown counsel to the witness have hover in the air ` you be engage to miss edith crawford at one time be you not ' one feel rather than hear the almost inaudible ` yes ' which escape from david graham 's compress lip ` under what circumstance be that engagement break off ' sir james fenwick have already rise in protest but david graham have be the first to speak ' i do not think that i need answer that question ' ' i will put it in a different form then ' say crown counsel urbanely -- ` one to which my learn friend can not possibly take exception do you or do you not on October 27th receive a letter from the accuse in which she desire to be release from she promise of marriage to you ' again david graham would have refuse to answer and he certainly give no audible reply to the learn counsel 's question but every one in the audience there present -- aye every member of the jury and of the bar -- read upon david graham 's pale countenance and large sorrowful eye that ominous ` yes ' which have fail to reach he tremble lip chapter xvi non proven there be no doubt continue the man in the corner that what little sympathy the young girl 's terrible position have arouse in the public mind have die out the moment that david graham leave the witness-box on the second day of the trial whether edith crawford be guilty of murder or not the callous way in which she have accept a deform lover and then throw he over have set every one 's mind against she it be mr graham himself who have be the first to put the procurator fiscal in possession of the fact that the accuse have write to david from london break off she engagement this information have no doubt direct the attention of the fiscal to miss crawford and the police soon bring forward the evidence which have lead to she arrest we have a final sensation on the third day when mr campbell jeweller of high street give he evidence he say that on October 25th a lady come to he shop and offer to sell he a pair of diamond earring trade have be very bad and he have refuse the bargain although the lady seem ready to part with the earring for a extraordinarily low sum consider the beauty of the stone in fact it be because of this evident desire on the lady 's part to sell at _ any _ cost that he have look at she more keenly than he otherwise would have do he be now ready to swear that the lady that offer he the diamond earring be the prisoner in the dock i can assure you that as we all listen to this apparently damnatory evidence you might have hear a pin drop amongst the audience in that crowded court the girl alone there in the dock remain calm and unmoved remember that for two day we have hear evidence to prove that old dr crawford have die leave he daughter penniless that have no mother she have be bring up by a maiden aunt who have train she to be a governess which occupation she have follow for year and that certainly she have never be know by any of she friend to be in possession of solitaire diamond earring the prosecution have certainly secure a ace of trump but sir jame fenwick who during the whole of that day have seem to take little interest in the proceedings here rise from he seat and i know at once that he have get a tit-bit in the way of a ` point ' up he sleeve gaunt and unusually tall and with he beak-like nose he always look strangely impressive when he seriously tackle a witness he do it this time with a vengeance i can tell you he be all over the pompous little jeweller in a moment ` have mr campbell make a special entry in he book as to the visit of the lady in question ' ` no ' ` have he any special means of ascertain when that visit do actually take place ' ` no -- but -- ' ` what record have he of the visit ' mr campbell have none in fact after about twenty minute of cross-examination he have to admit that he have give but little thought to the interview with the lady at the time and certainly not in connection with the murder of lady donaldson until he have read in the papers that a young lady have be arrest then he and he clerk talk the matter over it appear and together they have certainly recollect that a lady have bring some beautiful earring for sale on a day which _ must have be _ the very morning after the murder if sir jame fenwick 's object be to discredit this special witness he certainly gain he point all the pomposity go out of mr campbell he become flurried then excited then he lose he temper after that he be allow to leave the court and sir jame fenwick resume he seat and wait like a vulture for its prey it present itself in the person of mr campbell 's clerk who before the procurator fiscal have corroborate he employer 's evidence in every respect in scotland no witness in any one case be present in court during the examination of another and mr macfarlane the clerk be therefore quite unprepared for the pitfall which sir jame fenwick have prepare for he he tumble into they head foremost and the eminent advocate turn he inside out like a glove mr macfarlane do not lose he temper he be of too humble a frame of mind to do that but he get into a hopeless quagmire of mixed recollection and he too leave the witness-box quite unprepared to swear as to the day of the interview with the lady with the diamond earring i dare say mind you continue the man in the corner with a chuckle that to most people present sir jame fenwick 's cross-questioning seem completely irrelevant both mr campbell and he clerk be quite ready to swear that they have have a interview concern some diamond earring with a lady of whose identity with the accuse they be perfectly convinced and to the casual observer the question as to the time or even the day when that interview take place could make but little difference in the ultimate issue now i take in in a moment the entire drift of sir jame fenwick 's defense of edith crawford when mr macfarlane leave the witness-box the second victim of the eminent advocate 's caustic tongue i could read as in a book the whole history of that crime its investigation and the mistake make by the police first and the public prosecutor afterwards sir jame fenwick know they too of course and he place a finger upon each one demolish -- like a child who blow upon a house of card -- the entire scaffolding erect by the prosecution mr campbell 's and mr macfarlane 's identification of the accuse with the lady who on some date -- admit to be uncertain -- have try to sell a pair of diamond earring be the first point sir jame have plenty of witness to prove that on the 25th the day after the murder the accuse be in london whilst the day before mr campbell 's shop have be close long before the family circle have see the last of lady donaldson clearly the jeweller and he clerk must have see some other lady whom they vivid imagination have picture as be identical with the accuse then come the great question of time mr david graham have be evidently the last to see lady donaldson alive he have speak to she as late as 830 pm sir jame fenwick have call two porter at the caledonian railway station who testify to miss crawford have take she seat in a first-class carriage of the 910 train some minute before it start ` be it conceivable therefore ' argue sir jame ` that in the space of half a hour the accuse -- a young girl -- could have find she way surreptitiously into the house at a time when the entire household be still astir that she should have strangle lady donaldson force open the safe and make away with the jewel a man -- a experienced burglar might have do it but i contend that the accuse be physically incapable of accomplish such a feat ` with regard to the broken engagement ' continue the eminent counsel with a smile ` it may have seem a little heartless certainly but heartlessness be no crime in the eye of the law the accuse have state in she declaration that at the time she write to mr david graham break off she engagement she have hear nothing of the edinburgh tragedy ` the london papers have report the crime very briefly the accuse be busy shopping she know nothing of mr david graham 's altered position in no case be the break off of the engagement a proof that the accuse have obtain possession of the jewel by so foul a deed ' it be of course impossible for I continue the man in the corner apologetically to give you any idea of the eminent advocate 's eloquence and masterful logic it strike every one i think just as it do I that he chiefly direct he attention to the fact that there be absolutely no _ proof _ against the accuse be that as it may the result of that remarkable trial be a verdict of ` non proven ' the jury be absent forty minute and it appear that in the mind of every one of they there remain in spite of sir jame ' argument a firmly root conviction -- call it instinct if you like -- that edith crawford have do away with lady donaldson in order to become possess of those jewel and that in spite of the pompous jeweller 's many contradiction she have offer he some of those diamond for sale but there be not enough proof to convict and she be give the benefit of the doubt i have hear english people argue that in england she would have be hang personally i doubt that i think that a english jury not have the judicial loophole of ` non proven ' would have be bind to acquit she what do you think chapter xvii undeniable fact there be a moment 's silence for polly do not reply immediately and he go on make impossible knot in he bit of string then she say quietly -- i think that i agree with those english people who say that a english jury would have condemn she i have no doubt that she be guilty she may not have commit that awful deed herself some one in the charlotte square house may have be she accomplice and kill and rob lady donaldson while edith crawford wait outside for the jewel david graham leave he godmother at 830 pm if the accomplice be one of the servant in the house he or she would have have plenty of time for any amount of villainy and edith crawford could have yet catch the 910 pm train from the caledonian station then who in you opinion he ask sarcastically and cock he funny birdlike head on one side try to sell diamond earring to mr campbell the jeweller edith crawford of course she retort triumphantly he and he clerk both recognize she when do she try to sell they the earring ah that be what i can not quite make out and there to my mind lie the only mystery in this case on the 25th she be certainly in london and it be not very likely that she would go back to edinburgh in order to dispose of the jewel there where they could most easily be trace not very likely certainly he assent drily and add the young girl on the day before she leave for london lady donaldson be alive and pray he say suddenly as with comic complacency he survey a beautiful knot he have just twist up between he long finger what have that fact get to do with it but it have everything to do with it she retort ah there you go he sigh with comic emphasis my teaching do not seem to have improve you power of reasoning you be as bad as the police lady donaldson have be rob and murder and you immediately argue that she be rob and murder by the same person but -- argue polly there be no but he say get more and more excited see how simple it be edith crawford wear the diamond one night then she bring they back to lady donaldson 's room remember the maid 's statement : ` my lady say : have you put they back my dear -- a simple statement utterly ignore by the prosecution but what do it mean that lady donaldson could not see for herself whether edith crawford have put back the jewel or not _ since she ask the question _ then you argue -- i never argue he interrupted excitedly i state undeniable fact edith crawford who want to steal the jewel take they then and there when she have the opportunity why in the world should she have wait lady donaldson be in bed and tremlett the maid have go the next day -- namely the 25th -- she try to dispose of a pair of earring to mr campbell she fail and decide to go to london where she have a better chance sir jame fenwick do not think it desirable to bring forward witness to prove what i have since ascertain be a fact namely that on the 27th of October three day before she arrest miss crawford cross over to belgium and come back to london the next day in belgium no doubt lady donaldson 's diamond take out of they setting calmly repose at this moment while the money derive from they sale be safely deposit in a belgian bank but then who murder lady donaldson and why gasp polly can not you guess he query blandly have i not place the case clearly enough before you to I it seem so simple it be a daring brutal murder remember think of one who not be the thief himself would nevertheless have the strongest of all motive to shield the thief from the consequence of she own misdeed : aye and the power too -- since it would be absolutely illogical nay impossible that he should be a accomplice surely -- think of a curious nature warped morally as well as physically -- do you know how those nature feel a thousand time more strongly than the even straight nature in everyday life then think of such a nature bring face to face with this awful problem do you think that such a nature would hesitate a moment before commit a crime to save the loved one from the consequence of that deed mind you i do not assert for a moment that david graham have any _ intention _ of murder lady donaldson tremlett tell he that she seem strangely upset he go to she room and find that she have discover that she have be rob she naturally suspect edith crawford recollect the incident of the other night and probably express she feeling to david graham and threaten immediate prosecution scandal what you will i repeat it again i dare say he have no wish to kill she probably he merely threaten to a medical gentleman who speak of sudden heart failure be no doubt right then imagine david graham 's remorse he horror and he fear the empty safe probably be the first object that suggest to he the grim tableau of robbery and murder which he arrange in order to ensure he own safety but remember one thing : no miscreant be see to enter or leave the house surreptitiously the murderer leave no sign of entrance and none of exit a armed burglar would have leave some trace -- _ some one _ would have hear _ something _ then who lock and unlock lady donaldson 's door that night while she herself lay dead some one in the house i tell you -- some one who leave no trace -- some one against whom there could be no suspicion -- some one who kill without apparently the slightest premeditation and without the slightest motive think of it -- i know i be right -- and then tell I if i have at all enlist you sympathy in the author of the edinburgh mystery he be go polly look again at the photo of david graham do a crooked mind really dwell in that crooked body and be there in the world such crime that be great enough to be deem sublime chapter xviii the theft at the english provident bank that question of motive be a very difficult and complicated one at time say the man in the corner leisurely pull off a huge pair of flame dog-skin glove from he meager finger i have know experienced criminal investigator declare as a infallible axiom that to find the person interested in the committal of the crime be to find the criminal well that may be so in most case but my experience have prove to I that there be one factor in this world of ours which be the mainspring of human action and that factor be human passion for good or evil passion rule this poor humanity of ours remember there be the woman french detective who be acknowledged master in they craft never proceed till after they have discover the feminine element in a crime whether in theft murder or fraud accord to they theory there be always a woman perhaps the reason why the phillimore terrace robbery be never bring home to its perpetrator be because there be no woman in any way connect with it and i be quite sure on the other hand that the reason why the thief at the english provident bank be still unpunished be because a clever woman have escape the eye of we police force he have speak at great length and very dictatorially miss polly burton do not venture to contradict he know by now that whenever he be irritable he be invariably rude and she then have the worst of it when i be old he resume and have nothing more to do i think i shall take professionally to the police force they have much to learn could anything be more ludicrous than the self-satisfaction the abnormal conceit of this remark make by that shrivel piece of mankind in a nervous hesitate tone of voice polly make no comment but draw from she pocket a beautiful piece of string and know he custom of knot such a article while unravel he mystery she hand it across the table to he she positively think that he blush as a adjunct to think she say move by a conciliatory spirit he look at the invaluable toy which the young girl have tantalisingly place close to he hand : then he force himself to look all round the coffee-room : at polly at the waitress at the pile of pallid bun upon the counter but involuntarily he mild blue eye wander back lovingly to the long piece of string on which he playful imagination no doubt already see a series of knot which would be equally tantalise to tie and to untie tell I about the theft at the english provident bank suggest polly condescendingly he look at she as if she have propose some mysterious complicity in a unheard-of crime finally he lean finger seek the end of the piece of string and draw it towards he he face brighten up in a moment there be a element of tragedy in that particular robbery he begin after a few moment of beatify knot altogether different to that connect with most crime a tragedy which as far as i be concern would seal my lip for ever and forbid they to utter a word which might lead the police on the right track you lip suggest polly sarcastically be as far as i can see usually seal before we long-suffering incompetent police and -- and you should be the last to grumble at this he quietly interrupt for you have spend some very pleasant half-hour already listen to what you have term my ` cock-and-bull ' story you know the english provident bank of course in oxford street there be plenty of sketch of it at the time in the illustrated papers here be a photo of the outside i take it myself some time ago and only wish i have be cheeky or lucky enough to get a snap-shot of the interior but you see that the office have a separate entrance from the rest of the house which be and still be as be usual in such case inhabit by the manager and he family mr ireland be the manager then it be less than six month ago he live over the bank with he wife and family consist of a son who be clerk in the business and two or three younger child the house be really smaller than it look on this photo for it have no depth and only one set of room on each floor look out into the street the back of the house be nothing but the staircase mr ireland and he family therefore occupy the whole of it as for the business premise they be and in fact be of the usual pattern a office with its row of desk clerk and cashier and beyond through a glass door the manager 's private room with the ponderous safe and desk and so on the private room have a door into the hall of the house so that the manager be not oblige to go out into the street in order to go to business there be no living-room on the ground floor and the house have no basement i be oblige to put all these architectural detail before you though they may sound rather dry and uninteresting but they be really necessary in order to make my argument clear at night of course the bank premise be bar and bolt against the street and as a additional precaution there be always a night watchman in the office as i mention before there be only a glass door between the office and the manager 's private room this of course account for the fact that the night watchman hear all that he do hear on that memorable night and so help further to entangle the thread of that impenetrable mystery mr ireland as a rule go into he office every morning a little before ten o'clock but on that particular morning for some reason which he never could or would explain he go down before have he breakfast at about nine o'clock mr ireland state subsequently that not hear he return she send the servant down to tell the master that breakfast be get cold the girl 's shriek be the first intimation that something alarming have occur mr ireland hasten downstairs on reach the hall she find the door of she husband 's room open and it be from there that the girl 's shriek proceed ` the master mum -- the poor master -- he be dead mum -- i be sure he be dead ' -- accompany by vigorous thump against the glass partition and not very measure language on the part of the watchman from the outer office such as -- ` why do not you open the door instead of make that row ' mr ireland be not the sort of woman who under any circumstance would lose she presence of mind i think she prove that throughout the many try circumstance connect with the investigation of the case she give only one glance at the room and realize the situation on the arm-chair with head throw back and eye close lay mr ireland apparently in a dead faint some terrible shock must have very suddenly shatter he nervous system and render he prostrate for the moment what that shock have be it be pretty easy to guess the door of the safe be wide open and mr ireland have evidently totter and faint before some awful fact which the open safe have reveal to he he have catch himself against a chair which lay on the floor and then finally sink unconscious into the arm-chair all this which take some time to describe continue the man in the corner take remember only a second to pass like a flash through mr ireland 's mind she quickly turn the key of the glass door which be on the inside and with the help of jame fairbairn the watchman she carry she husband upstairs to he room and immediately send both for the police and for a doctor as mr ireland have anticipate she husband have receive a severe mental shock which have completely prostrate he the doctor prescribe absolute quiet and forbid all worry question for the present the patient be not a young man the shock have be very severe -- it be a case a very slight one of cerebral congestion -- and mr ireland 's reason if not he life might be gravely jeopardise by any attempt to recall before he enfeebled mind the circumstance which have precede he collapse the police therefore could proceed but slowly in they investigation the detective who have charge of the case be necessarily handicapped whilst one of the chief actor concern in the drama be unable to help he in he work to begin with the robber or robber have obviously not find they way into the manager 's inner room through the bank premise jame fairbairn have be on the watch all night with the electric light full on and obviously no one could have cross the outer office or force the heavily bar door without he knowledge there remain the other access to the room that be the one through the hall of the house the hall door it appear be always bar and bolt by mr ireland himself when he come home whether from the theater or he club it be a duty he never allow any one to perform but himself during he annual holiday with he wife and family he son who usually have the sub-manager to stay with he on those occasion do the bolt and bar -- but with the distinct understanding that this should be do by ten o'clock at night as i have already explain to you there be only a glass partition between the general office and the manager 's private room and accord to jame fairbairn 's account this be naturally always leave wide open so that he during he night watch would of necessity hear the faintest sound as a rule there be no light leave in the manager 's room and the other door -- that lead into the hall -- be bolt from the inside by jame fairbairn the moment he have satisfy himself that the premise be safe and he have begin he night-watch a electric bell in both the office communicate with mr ireland 's bedroom and that of he son mr robert ireland and there be a telephone install to the nearest district messenger ' office with a understand signal which mean ` police ' at nine o'clock in the morning it be the night watchman 's duty as soon as the first cashier have arrive to dust and tidy the manager 's room and to undo the bolt after that he be free to go home to he breakfast and rest you will see of course that jame fairbairn 's position in the english provident bank be one of great responsibility and trust but then in every bank and business house there be man who hold similar position they be always man of well-known and try character often old soldier with good-conduct record behind they jame fairbairn be a fine powerful scotchman he have be night watchman to the english provident bank for fifteen year and be then not more than forty-three or forty-four year old he be a ex-guardsman and stand six foot three inch in he sock it be he evidence of course which be of such paramount importance and which somehow or other manage in spite of the utmost care exercise by the police to become public property and to cause the wildest excitement in banking and business circle jame fairbairn state that at eight o'clock in the evening of march 25th have bolt and bar all the shutter and the door of the back premise he be about to lock the manager 's door as usual when mr ireland call to he from the floor above tell he to leave that door open as he might want to go into the office again for a minute when he come home at eleven o'clock jame fairbairn ask if he should leave the light on but mr ireland say : ` no turn it out i can switch it on if i want it ' the night watchman at the english provident bank have permission to smoke he also be allow a nice fire and a tray consist of a plate of substantial sandwich and one glass of ale which he can take when he like jame fairbairn settle himself in front of the fire light he pipe take out he newspaper and begin to read he think he have hear the street door open and shut at about a quarter to ten he suppose that it be mr ireland go out to he club but at ten minute to ten o'clock the watchman hear the door of the manager 's room open and some one enter immediately close the glass partition door and turn the key he naturally conclude it be mr ireland himself from where he sit he could not see into the room but he notice that the electric light have not be switch on and that the manager seemingly have no light but a occasional match ` for the minute ' continued jame fairbairn ' a thought do just cross my mind that something might perhaps be wrong and i put my newspaper aside and go to the other end of the room towards the glass partition the manager 's room be still quite dark and i could not clearly see into it but the door into the hall be open and there be of course a light through there i have get quite close to the partition when i see mr ireland standing in the doorway and hear she say in a very astonished tone of voice : ` why lewis i think you have go to you club age ago what in the world be you do here in the dark ' ` lewis be mr ireland 's christian name ' be james fairbairn 's further statement ' i do not hear the manager 's reply but quite satisfied now that nothing be wrong i go back to my pipe and my newspaper almost directly afterwards i hear the manager leave he room cross the hall and go out by the street door it be only after he have go that i recollected that he must have forget to unlock the glass partition and that i could not therefore bolt the door into the hall the same as usual and i suppose that be how those confound thief get the better of I ' chapter xix conflict evidence by the time the public have be able to think over jame fairbairn 's evidence a certain disquietude and unrest have begin to make itself feel both in the bank itself and among those of we detective force who have charge of the case the newspaper speak of the matter with very obvious caution and warn all they reader to await the further development of this sad case while the manager of the english provident bank lay in such a precarious condition of health it be impossible to arrive at any definite knowledge as to what the thief have actually make away with the chief cashier however estimate the loss at about # 5000 in gold and note of the bank money -- that be of course on the assumption that mr ireland have no private money or valuable of he own in the safe mind you at this point public sympathy be much stir in favor of the poor man who lay ill perhaps die and yet whom strangely enough suspicion have already slightly touch with its poison wing suspicion be a strong word perhaps to use at this point in the story no one suspect anybody at present jame fairbairn have tell he story and have vow that some thief with false key must have sneak through the house into the inner office public excitement you will remember lose nothing by wait hardly have we all have time to wonder over the night watchman 's singular evidence and pend further and fuller detail to check we grow sympathy for the man who be ill than the sensational side of this mysterious case culminate in one extraordinary absolutely unexpected fact mr ireland after a twenty-four hour ' untiring watch beside she husband 's sick bed have at last be approach by the detective and be ask to reply to a few simple question and thus help to throw some light on the mystery which have cause mr ireland 's illness and she own consequent anxiety she profess herself quite ready to reply to any question put to she and she literally astounded both inspector and detective when she firmly and emphatically declare that jame fairbairn must have be dream or asleep when he think he see she in the doorway at ten o'clock that night and fancy he hear she voice she may or may not have be down in the hall at that particular hour for she usually run down herself to see if the last post have bring any letter but most certainly she have neither see nor speak to mr ireland at that hour for mr ireland have go out a hour before she herself have see he to the front door never for a moment do she swerve from this extraordinary statement she speak to jame fairbairn in the presence of the detective and tell he he _ must _ absolutely have be mistake that she have _ not _ see mr ireland and that she have _ not _ speak to he one other person be question by the police and that be mr robert ireland the manager 's eldest son it be presume that he would know something of he father 's affair the idea have now take firm hold of the detective 's mind that perhaps grave financial difficulty have tempt the unfortunate manager to appropriate some of the firm 's money mr robert ireland however could not say very much he father do not confide in he to the extent of tell he all he private affair but money never seem scarce at home certainly and mr ireland have to he son 's knowledge not a single extravagant habit he himself have be dine out with a friend on that memorable evening and have go on with he to the oxford music hall he meet he father on the doorstep of the bank at about 1130 pm and they go in together there certainly be nothing remarkable about mr ireland then he son aver he appear in no way excited and bid he son good night quite cheerfully there be the extraordinary the remarkable hitch continue the man in the corner wax more and more excited every moment the public -- who be at time very dense -- see it clearly nevertheless : of course every one at once jump to the natural conclusion that mr ireland be tell a lie -- a noble lie a self-sacrificing lie a lie endowed with all the virtue if you like but still a lie she be try to save she husband and be go the wrong way to work jame fairbairn after all could not have dream quite all that he declare he have see and hear no one suspect jame fairbairn there be no occasion to do that to begin with he be a great heavy scotchman with obviously no power of invention such as mr ireland 's strange assertion credit he with moreover the theft of the bank-note could not have be of the slightest use to he but remember there be the hitch without it the public mind would already have condemn the sick man upstairs without hope of rehabilitation this fact strike every one grant that mr ireland have go into he office at ten minute to ten o'clock at night for the purpose of extract # 5000 worth of note and gold from the bank safe whilst give the theft the appearance of a night burglary grant that he be disturb in he nefarious project by he wife who fail to persuade he to make restitution take he side boldly and very clumsily attempt to rescue he out of he difficult position -- why should he at nine o'clock the follow morning fall in a dead faint and get cerebral congestion at sight of a defalcation he know have occur one might simulate a faint fit but no one can assume a high temperature and a congestion which the most ordinary practitioner who happen to be call in would soon see be non-existent mr ireland accord to jame fairbairn 's evidence must have go out soon after the theft come in again with he son a hour and a half later talk to he go quietly to bed and wait for nine hour before he fall ill at sight of he own crime it be not logical you will admit unfortunately the poor man himself be unable to give any explanation of the night 's tragic adventure he be still very weak and though under strong suspicion he be leave by the doctor 's order in absolute ignorance of the heavy charge which be gradually accumulate against he he have make many anxious inquiry from all those who have access to he bedside as to the result of the investigation and the probable speedy capture of the burglar but every one have strict order to inform he merely that the police so far have no clue of any kind you will admit as every one do that there be something very pathetic about the unfortunate man 's position so helpless to defend himself if defense there be against so much overwhelming evidence that be why i think public sympathy remain with he still it be terrible to think of he wife presumably know he to be guilty and anxiously wait whilst dread the moment when restore to health he would have to face the doubt the suspicion probably the open accusation which be fast rise up around he chapter xx a _ alibi _ it be close on six week before the doctor at last allow he patient to attend to the grave business which have prostrate he for so long in the meantime among the many people who directly or indirectly be make to suffer in this mysterious affair no one i think be more pity and more genuinely sympathise with than robert ireland the manager 's eldest son you remember that he have be clerk in the bank well naturally the moment suspicion begin to fasten on he father he position in the business become untenable i think every one be very kind to he mr sutherland french who be make act manager ` during mr lewi ireland 's regrettable absence ' do everything in he power to show he goodwill and sympathy to the young man but i do not think that he or any one else be much astonish when after mr ireland 's extraordinary attitude in the case have become public property he quietly intimate to the acting manager that he have determine to sever he connection with the bank the best of recommendation be of course place at he disposal and it be finally understand that as soon as he father be completely restore to health and would no longer require he presence in london he would try to obtain employment somewhere abroad he speak of the new volunteer corps organize for the military police of the new colony and truth to tell no one could blame he that he should wish to leave far behind he all london banking connection the son 's attitude certainly do not tend to ameliorate the father 's position it be pretty evident that he own family have cease to hope in the poor manager 's innocence and yet he be absolutely innocent you must remember how that fact be clearly demonstrate as soon as the poor man be able to say a word for himself and he say it to some purpose too mr ireland be and be very fond of music on the evening in question while sit in he club he see in one of the daily papers the announcement of a peculiarly attractive program at the queen 's hall concert he be not dress but nevertheless feel a irresistible desire to hear one or two of these attractive musical item and he stroll down to the hall now this sort of alibi be usually very difficult to prove but dame fortune oddly enough favor mr ireland on this occasion probably to compensate he for the hard knock she have be deal he pretty freely of late it appear that there be some difficulty about he seat which be sell to he at the box office and which he nevertheless find wrongfully occupy by a determine lady who refuse to move the management have to be appeal to the attendant also remember not only the incident but also the face and appearance of the gentleman who be the innocent cause of the altercation as soon as mr ireland could speak for himself he mention the incident and the person who have be witness to it he be identify by they to the amazement it must be confess of police and public alike who have comfortably decide that no one _ could _ be guilty save the manager of the provident bank himself moreover mr ireland be a fairly wealthy man with a good balance at the union bank and plenty of private mean the result of year of provident living he have but to prove that if he really have be in need of a immediate # 5000 -- which be all the amount extract from the bank safe that night -- he have plenty of security on which he could at a hour 's notice have raise twice that sum he life insurance have be fully pay up he have not a debt which a # 5 note could not easily have cover on the fatal night he certainly do remember ask the watchman not to bolt the door to he office as he think he might have one or two letter to write when he come home but later on he have forget all about this after the concert he meet he son in oxford street just outside the house and think no more about the office the door of which be shut and present no unusual appearance mr ireland absolutely deny have be in he office at the hour when jame fairbairn positively assert he hear mr ireland say in a astonished tone of voice : ` why lewi what in the world be you do here ' it become pretty clear therefore that jame fairbairn 's view of the manager 's wife have be a mere vision mr ireland give up he position as manager of the english provident : both he and he wife feel no doubt that on the whole perhaps there have be too much talk too much scandal connect with they name to be altogether advantageous to the bank moreover mr ireland 's health be not so good as it have be he have a pretty house now at sittingbourne and amuse himself during he leisure hour with amateur horticulture and i who alone in london besides the person directly connect with this mysterious affair know the true solution of the enigma often wonder how much of it be know to the ex-manager of the english provident bank the man in the corner have be silent for some time miss polly burton in she presumption have make up she mind at the commencement of he tale to listen attentively to every point of the evidence in connection with the case which he recapitulate before she and to follow the point in order to try and arrive at a conclusion of she own and overwhelm the antediluvian scarecrow with she sagacity she say nothing for she have arrive at no conclusion the case puzzle every one and have amaze the public in its various stage from the moment when opinion begin to cast doubt on mr ireland 's honesty to that when he integrity be prove beyond a doubt one or two people have suspect mr ireland to have be the actual thief but that idea have soon to be abandon mr ireland have all the money she want the theft occur six month ago and not a single bank-note be ever trace to she pocket moreover she must have have a accomplice since some one else be in the manager 's room that night and if that some one else be she accomplice why do she risk betray he by speak loudly in the presence of jame fairbairn when it would have be so much simpler to turn out the light and plunge the hall into darkness you be altogether on the wrong track sound a sharp voice in direct answer to polly 's thought -- altogether wrong if you want to acquire my method of induction and improve you reasoning power you must follow my system first think of the one absolutely undisputed positive fact you must have a starting-point and not go wander about in the realm of supposition but there be no positive fact she say irritably you do not say so he say quietly do you not call it a positive fact that the bank safe be rob of # 5000 on the evening of march 25th before 1130 pm yes that be all which be positive and -- do you not call it a positive fact he interrupt quietly that the lock of the safe not be pick it must have be open by its own key i know that she rejoin crossly and that be why every one agree that jame fairbairn could not possibly -- and do you not call it a positive fact then that jame fairbairn could not possibly etc etc see that the glass partition door be lock from the inside mr ireland herself let jame fairbairn into she husband 's office when she see he lie faint before the open safe of course that be a positive fact and so be the one that prove to any think mind that if that safe be open with a key it could only have be do by a person have access to that key but the man in the private office -- exactly the man in the private office enumerate he point if you please say the funny creature mark each point with one of he favorite knot he be a man who might that night have have access to the key of the safe unsuspected by the manager or even he wife and a man for whom mr ireland be willing to tell a downright lie be there many man for whom a woman of the better middle class and a englishwoman would be ready to perjure herself surely not she might do it for she husband the public thought she have it never strike they that she might have do it for she son she son exclaim polly ah she be a clever woman he ejaculate enthusiastically one with courage and presence of mind which i do not think i have ever see equal she run downstairs before go to bed in order to see whether the last post have bring any letter she see the door of she husband 's office ajar she push it open and there by the sudden flash of a hastily strike match she realize in a moment that a thief stand before the open safe and in that thief she have already recognize she son at that very moment she hear the watchman 's step approach the partition there be no time to warn she son she do not know the glass door be lock jame fairbairn may switch on the electric light and see the young man in the very act of rob he employer ' safe one thing alone can reassure the watchman one person alone have the right to be there at that hour of the night and without hesitation she pronounce she husband 's name mind you i firmly believe that at the time the poor woman only wish to gain time that she have every hope that she son have not yet have the opportunity to lay so heavy a guilt upon he conscience what pass between mother and son we shall never know but this much we do know that the young villain make off with he booty and trust that he mother would never betray he poor woman what a night of it she must have spend but she be clever and far-seeing she know that she husband 's character could not suffer through she action accordingly she take the only course open to she to save she son even from he father 's wrath and boldly deny jame fairbairn 's statement of course she be fully aware that she husband could easily clear himself and the worst that could be say of she be that she have think he guilty and have try to save he she trust to the future to clear she of any charge of complicity in the theft by now every one have forget most of the circumstance the police be still watch the career of jame fairbairn and mr ireland 's expenditure as you know not a single note so far have be trace to she against that one or two of the note have find they way back to england no one realize how easy it be to cash english bank-note at the smaller _ agent de change _ abroad the _ changeur _ be only too glad to get they what do they care where they come from as long as they be genuine and a week or two later _ m le changeur _ could not swear who tender he any one particular note you see young robert ireland go abroad he will come back some day have make a fortune there be he photo and this be he mother -- a clever woman be not she and before polly have time to reply he be go she really have never see any one move across a room so quickly but he always leave a interesting trail behind : a piece of string knot from end to end and a few photo chapter xxi the dublin mystery i always think that the history of that forge will be about as interesting as any i have read say the man in the corner that day he have be silent for some time and be meditatively sort and look through a packet of small photograph in he pocket-book polly guess that some of these would presently be place before she for inspection -- and she have not long to wait that be old brook he say point to one of the photograph millionaire brook as he be call and these be he two son percival and murray it be a curious case be not it personally i do not wonder that the police be completely at sea if a member of that highly estimable force happen to be as clever as the clever author of that forge will we should have very few undetected crime in this country that be why i always try to persuade you to give we poor ignorant police the benefit of you great insight and wisdom say polly with a smile i know he say blandly you have be most kind in that way but i be only a amateur crime interest I only when it resemble a clever game of chess with many intricate move which all tend to one solution the checkmating of the antagonist -- the detective force of the country now confess that in the dublin mystery the clever police there be absolutely checkmate absolutely just as the public be there be actually two crime commit in one city which have completely baffle detection : the murder of patrick wether the lawyer and the forge will of millionaire brook there be not many millionaire in ireland no wonder old brook be a notability in he way since he business -- bacon curing i believe it be -- be say to be worth over # 2000000 of solid money he younger son murray be a refine highly educate man and be moreover the apple of he father 's eye as he be the spoilt darling of dublin society good-looking a splendid dancer and a perfect rider he be the acknowledged ` catch ' of the matrimonial market of ireland and many a very aristocratic house be open hospitably to the favorite son of the millionaire of course percival brook the eldest son would inherit the bulk of the old man 's property and also probably the larger share in the business he too be good-looking more so than he brother he too ride dance and talk well but it be many year ago that mamma with marriageable daughter have give up all hope of percival brook as a probable son-in-law that young man 's infatuation for maisie fortescue a lady of undoubted charm but very doubtful antecedent who have astonish the london and dublin music-hall with she extravagant dance be too well know and too old-established to encourage any hope in other quarter whether percival brook would ever marry maisie fortescue be think to be very doubtful old brook have the full disposal of all he wealth and it would have fare ill with percival if he introduce a undesirable wife into the magnificent fitzwilliam place establishment that be how matter stand continue the man in the corner when dublin society one morning learn with deep regret and dismay that old brook have die very suddenly at he residence after only a few hour ' illness at first it be generally understand that he have have a apoplectic stroke anyway he have be at business hale and hearty as ever the day before he death which occur late on the evening of February 1st it be the morning papers of February 2nd which tell the sad news to they reader and it be those selfsame papers which on that eventful morning contain another even more startling piece of news that prove the prelude to a series of sensation such as tranquil placid dublin have not experience for many year this be that on that very afternoon which see the death of dublin 's greatest millionaire mr patrick wether he solicitor be murder in phoenix park at five o'clock in the afternoon while actually walk to he own house from he visit to he client in fitzwilliam place patrick wether be as well know as the proverbial town pump he mysterious and tragic death fill all dublin with dismay the lawyer who be a man sixty year of age have be strike on the back of the head by a heavy stick garrot and subsequently rob for neither money watch or pocket-book be find upon he person whilst the police soon gather from patrick wether 's household that he have leave home at two o'clock that afternoon carry both watch and pocket-book and undoubtedly money as well a inquest be hold and a verdict of wilful murder be find against some person or person unknown but dublin have not exhaust its stock of sensation yet millionaire brook have be bury with due pomp and magnificence and he will have be prove -lrb- he business and personalty be estimate at # 2500000 -rrb- by percival gordon brook he eldest son and sole executor the younger son murray who have devote the best year of he life to be a friend and companion to he father while percival run after ballet-dancer and music-hall star -- murray who have avowedly be the apple of he father 's eye in consequence -- be leave with a miserly pittance of # 300 a year and no share whatever in the gigantic business of brooks & son bacon curer of dublin something have evidently happen within the precinct of the brook ' town mansion which the public and dublin society try in vain to fathom elderly mamma and blush _ débutantes _ be already think of the best means whereby next season they might more easily show the cold shoulder to young murray brook who have so suddenly become a hopeless ` detrimental ' in the marriage market when all these sensation terminate in one gigantic overwhelming bit of scandal which for the next three month furnished food for gossip in every drawing-room in dublin mr murray brook namely have enter a claim for probate of a will make by he father in 1891 declare that the later will make the very day of he father 's death and prove by he brother as sole executor be null and void that will be a forgery chapter xxii forgery the fact that transpire in connection with this extraordinary case be sufficiently mysterious to puzzle everybody as i tell you before all mr brook ' friend never quite grasp the idea that the old man should so completely have cut off he favorite son with the proverbial shilling you see percival have always be a thorn in the old man 's flesh horse-racing gambling theater and music-hall be in the old pork-butcher 's eye so many deadly sin which he son commit every day of he life and all the fitzwilliam place household could testify to the many and bitter quarrel which have arise between father and son over the latter 's gambling or racing debt many people assert that brook would sooner have leave he money to charitable institution than see it squander upon the brightest star that adorn the music-hall stage the case come up for hearing early in the autumn in the meanwhile percival brook have give up he racecourse associate settle down in the fitzwilliam place mansion and conduct he father 's business without a manager but with all the energy and forethought which he have previously devote to more unworthy cause murray have elect not to stay on in the old house no doubt association be of too painful and recent a nature he be board with the family of a mr wilson hibbert who be the late patrick wether 's the murder lawyer 's partner they be quiet homely people who live in a very pokey little house in kilkenny street and poor murray must in spite of he grief have feel very bitterly the change from he luxurious quarter in he father 's mansion to he present tiny room and homely meal percival brook who be now draw a income of over a hundred thousand a year be very severely criticise for adhering so strictly to the letter of he father 's will and only pay he brother that paltry # 300 a year which be very literally but the crumb off he own magnificent dinner table the issue of that contest will case be therefore await with eager interest in the meanwhile the police who have at first seem fairly loquacious on the subject of the murder of mr patrick wether suddenly become strangely reticent and by they very reticence arouse a certain amount of uneasiness in the public mind until one day the _ irish time _ publish the follow extraordinary enigmatic paragraph : ` we hear on authority which can not be question that certain extraordinary development be expect in connection with the brutal murder of we distinguished townsman mr wether the police in fact be vainly try to keep it secret that they hold a clue which be as important as it be sensational and that they only await the impending issue of a well-known litigation in the probate court to effect a arrest ' the dublin public flock to the court to hear the argument in the great will case i myself journey down to dublin as soon as i succeed in fight my way to the densely crowd court i take stock of the various actor in the drama which i as a spectator be prepare to enjoy there be percival brook and murray he brother the two litigant both good-looking and well dress and both strive by keep up a run conversation with they lawyer to appear unconcerned and confident of the issue with percival brook be henry oranmore the eminent irish kc whilst walter hibbert a rise young barrister the son of wilson hibbert appear for murray the will of which the latter claim probate be one dated 1891 and have be make by mr brook during a severe illness which threaten to end he day this will have be deposit in the hand of messr wethered and hibbert solicitor to the deceased and by it mr brook leave he personalty equally divide between he two son but have leave he business entirely to he youngest son with a charge of # 2000 a year upon it payable to percival you see that murray brook therefore have a very deep interest in that second will be find null and void old mr hibbert have very ably instruct he son and walter hibbert 's opening speech be exceedingly clever he would show he say on behalf of he client that the will date February 1st 1908 could never have be make by the late mr brook as it be absolutely contrary to he avowed intention and that if the late mr brook do on the day in question make any fresh will at all it certainly be _ not _ the one prove by mr percival brook for that be absolutely a forgery from begin to end mr walter hibbert propose to call several witness in support of both these point on the other hand mr henry oranmore kc very ably and courteously reply that he too have several witness to prove that mr brook certainly do make a will on the day in question and that whatever he intention may have be in the past he must have modify they on the day of he death for the will prove by mr percival brook be find after he death under he pillow duly sign and witness and in every way legal then the battle begin in sober earnest there be a great many witness to be call on both side they evidence be of more or less importance -- chiefly less but the interest centre round the prosaic figure of john o'neill the butler at fitzwilliam place who have be in mr brook ' family for thirty year ' i be clear away my breakfast thing ' say john ` when i hear the master 's voice in the study close by oh my he be that angry i could hear the word disgrace and villain and liar and ballet-dancer and one or two other ugly word as apply to some female lady which i would not like to repeat at first i do not take much notice as i be quite use to hear my poor dear master have word with mr percival so i go downstairs carry my breakfast thing but i have just start clean my silver when the study bell go ring violently and i hear mr percival 's voice shout in the hall : john quick send for dr mulligan at once you master be not well send one of the man and you come up and help I to get mr brook to bed ' i send one of the groom for the doctor ' continued john who seem still affect at the recollection of he poor master to whom he have evidently be very much attach ` and i go up to see mr brook i find he lie on the study floor he head support in mr percival 's arm my father have fall in a faint say the young master help I to get he up to he room before dr mulligan come ` mr percival look very white and upset which be only natural and when we have get my poor master to bed i ask if i should not go and break the news to mr murray who have go to business a hour ago however before mr percival have time to give I a order the doctor come i think i have see death plainly writ in my master 's face and when i show the doctor out a hour later and he tell I that he would be back directly i know that the end be near ` mr brook ring for I a minute or two later he tell I to send at once for mr wether or else for mr hibbert if mr wether could not come i have not many hour to live john he say to I -- my heart be break the doctor say my heart be break a man should not marry and have child john for they will sooner or later break he heart i be so upset i could not speak but i send round at once for mr wether who come himself just about three o'clock that afternoon ` after he have be with my master about a hour i be call in and mr wether say to I that mr brook wish I and one other of we servant to witness that he have sign a paper which be on a table by he bedside i call pat mooney the head footman and before we both mr brook put he name at the bottom of that paper then mr wethered give I the pen and tell I to write my name as a witness and that pat mooney be to do the same after that we be both tell that we could go ' the old butler go on to explain that he be present in he late master 's room on the follow day when the undertaker who have come to lay the dead man out find a paper underneath he pillow john o'neill who recognize the paper as the one to which he have append he signature the day before take it to mr percival and give it into he hand in answer to mr walter hibbert john assert positively that he take the paper from the undertaker 's hand and go straight with it to mr percival 's room ` he be alone ' say john ' i give he the paper he just glance at it and i think he look rather astonished but he say nothing and i at once leave the room ' ` when you say that you recognize the paper as the one which you have see you master sign the day before how do you actually recognize that it be the same paper ' ask mr hibbert amidst breathless interest on the part of the spectator i narrowly observe the witness 's face ` it look exactly the same paper to I sir ' reply john somewhat vaguely ` do you look at the contents then ' ` no sir certainly not ' ` have you do so the day before ' ` no sir only at my master 's signature ' ` then you only think by the _ outside _ look of the paper that it be the same ' ` it look the same thing sir ' persist john obstinately you see continue the man in the corner lean eagerly forward across the narrow marble table the contention of murray brook ' adviser be that mr brook have make a will and hide it -- for some reason or other under he pillow -- that will have fall through the means relate by john o'neill into the hand of mr percival brook who have destroy it and substitute a forge one in its place which adjudge the whole of mr brook ' million to himself it be a terrible and very daring accusation direct against a gentleman who in spite of he many wild oats sow in early youth be a prominent and important figure in irish high life all those present be aghast at what they hear and the whisper comment i could hear around I show I that public opinion at least do not uphold mr murray brook ' daring accusation against he brother but john o'neill have not finish he evidence and mr walter hibbert have a bit of sensation still up he sleeve he have namely produce a paper the will prove by mr percival brook and have ask john o'neill if once again he recognize the paper ` certainly sir ' say john unhesitatingly ` that be the one the undertaker find under my poor dead master 's pillow and which i take to mr percival 's room immediately ' then the paper be unfold and place before the witness ` now mr o'neill will you tell I if that be you signature ' john look at it for a moment then he say : ` excuse I sir ' and produce a pair of spectacles which he carefully adjust before he again examine the paper then he thoughtfully shake he head ` it do not look much like my write sir ' he say at last ` that be to say ' he add by way of elucidate the matter ` it do look like my write but then i do not think it be ' there be at that moment a look in mr percival brook ' face continue the man in the corner quietly which then and there give I the whole history of that quarrel that illness of mr brook of the will aye and of the murder of patrick wether too all i wonder at be how every one of those learn counsel on both side do not get the clue just the same as i do but go on argue speechify cross-examine for nearly a week until they arrive at the one conclusion which be inevitable from the very first namely that the will _ be _ a forgery -- a gross clumsy idiotic forgery since both john o'neill and pat mooney the two witness absolutely repudiate the signature as they own the only successful bit of caligraphy the forger have do be the signature of old mr brook it be a very curious fact and one which have undoubtedly aid the forger in accomplish he work quickly that mr wether the lawyer have no doubt realize that mr brook have not many moment in life to spare have not draw up the usual engrossed magnificent document dear to the lawyer heart but have use for he client 's will one of those regular print form which can be purchase at any stationer 's mr percival brook of course flatly deny the serious allegation bring against he he admit that the butler have bring he the document the morning after he father 's death and that he certainly on glance at it have be very much astonished to see that that document be he father 's will against that he declare that its contents do not astonish he in the slightest degree that he himself know of the testator 's intention but that he certainly think he father have entrust the will to the care of mr wether who do all he business for he ' i only very cursorily glance at the signature ' he conclude speak in a perfectly calm clear voice ` you must understand that the thought of forgery be very far from my mind and that my father 's signature be exceedingly well imitate if indeed it be not he own which i be not at all prepare to believe as for the two witness ' signature i do not think i have ever see they before i take the document to messr barkston and maud who have often do business for I before and they assure I that the will be in perfect form and order ' ask why he have not entrust the will to he father 's solicitor he reply : ` for the very simple reason that exactly half a hour before the will be place in my hand i have read that mr patrick wether have be murder the night before mr hibbert the junior partner be not personally know to I ' after that for form 's sake a good deal of expert evidence be hear on the subject of the dead man 's signature but that be quite unanimous and merely go to corroborate what have already be establish beyond a doubt namely that the will date February 1st 1908 be a forgery and probate of the will date 1891 be therefore grant to mr murray brook the sole executor mention therein chapter xxiii a memorable day two day later the police apply for a warrant for the arrest of mr percival brook on a charge of forgery the crown prosecute and mr brook have again the support of mr oranmore the eminent kc perfectly calm like a man conscious of he own innocence and unable to grasp the idea that justice do sometimes miscarry mr brook the son of the millionaire himself still the possessor of a very large fortune under the former will stand up in the dock on that memorable day in October 1908 which still no doubt live in the memory of he many friend all the evidence with regard to mr brook ' last moment and the forge will be go through over again that will it be the contention of the crown have be forge so entirely in favor of the accuse cut out every one else that obviously no one but the beneficiary under that false will would have have any motive in forge it very pale and with a frown between he deep-set handsome irish eye percival brook listen to this large volume of evidence pile up against he by the crown at time he hold brief consultation with mr oranmore who seem as cool as a cucumber have you ever see oranmore in court he be a character worthy of dickens he pronounced brogue he fat podgy clean-shaven face he not always immaculately clean large hand have often delighted the caricaturist as it very soon transpire during that memorable magisterial inquiry he rely for a verdict in favor of he client upon two main point and he have concentrate all he skill upon make these two point as tell as he possibly could the first point be the question of time john o'neill cross-examine by oranmore state without hesitation that he have give the will to mr percival at eleven o'clock in the morning and now the eminent kc bring forward and place in the witness-box the very lawyer into whose hand the accuse have then immediately place the will now mr barkston a very well-known solicitor of king street declare positively that mr percival brook be in he office at a quarter before twelve two of he clerk testify to the same time exactly and it be _ impossible _ contend mr oranmore that within three-quarter of a hour mr brook could have go to a stationer 's buy a will form copy mr wethered 's write he father 's signature and that of john o'neill and pat mooney such a thing might have be plan arrange practice and ultimately after a great deal of trouble successfully carry out but human intelligence could not grasp the other as a possibility still the judge waver the eminent kc have shake but not shatter he belief in the prisoner 's guilt but there be one point more and this oranmore with the skill of a dramatist have reserve for the fall of the curtain he note every sign in the judge 's face he guess that he client be not yet absolutely safe then only do he produce he last two witness one of they be mary sullivan one of the housemaid in the fitzwilliam mansion she have be send up by the cook at a quarter past four o'clock on the afternoon of February 1st with some hot water which the nurse have order for the master 's room just as she be about to knock at the door mr wether be come out of the room mary stop with the tray in she hand and at the door mr wether turn and say quite loudly : ` now do not fret do not be anxious do try and be calm you will be safe in my pocket nothing can change it or alter one word of it but yourself ' it be of course a very ticklish point in law whether the housemaid 's evidence could be accept you see she be quote the word of a man since dead speak to another man also dead there be no doubt that have there be very strong evidence on the other side against percival brook mary sullivan 's would have count for nothing but as i tell you before the judge 's belief in the prisoner 's guilt be already very seriously shake and now the final blow aim at it by mr oranmore shatter he last linger doubt dr mulligan namely have be place by mr oranmore into the witness-box he be a medical man of unimpeachable authority in fact absolutely at the head of he profession in dublin what he say practically corroborate mary sullivan 's testimony he have go in to see mr brook at half-past four and understand from he that he lawyer have just leave he mr brooks certainly though terribly weak be calm and more compose he be die from a sudden heart attack and dr mulligan foresee the almost immediate end but he be still conscious and manage to murmur feebly : ' i feel much easier in my mind now doctor -- have make my will -- wether have be -- he be get it in he pocket -- it be safe there -- safe from that -- ' but the word die on he lip and after that he speak but little he see he two son before he die but hardly know they or even look at they you see conclude the man in the corner you see that the prosecution be bind to collapse oranmore do not give it a leg to stand on the will be forge it be true forge in the favor of percival brook and of no one else forge for he and for he benefit whether he know and connive at the forgery be never prove or as far as i know even hint but it be impossible to go against all the evidence which point that as far as the act itself be concern he at least be innocent you see dr mulligan 's evidence be not to be shake mary sullivan 's be equally strong there be two witness swearing positively that old brook ' will be in mr wethered 's keep when that gentleman leave the fitzwilliam mansion at a quarter past four at five o'clock in the afternoon the lawyer be find dead in phoenix park between a quarter past four and eight o'clock in the evening percival brook never leave the house -- that be subsequently prove by oranmore up to the hilt and beyond a doubt since the will find under old brook ' pillow be a forge will where then be the will he do make and which wether carry away with he in he pocket steal of course say polly by those who murder and rob he it may have be of no value to they but they naturally would destroy it lest it might prove a clue against they then you think it be mere coincidence he ask excitedly what that wether be murder and rob at the very moment that he carry the will in he pocket whilst another be be forge in its place it certainly would be very curious if it _ be _ a coincidence she say musingly very he repeat with bite sarcasm whilst nervously he bony finger play with the inevitable bit of string very curious indeed just think of the whole thing there be the old man with all he wealth and two son one to whom he be devoted and the other with whom he do nothing but quarrel one day there be another of these quarrel but more violent more terrible than any that have previously occur with the result that the father heartbroken by it all have a attack of apoplexy and practically die of a broken heart after that he alter he will and subsequently a will be prove which turn out to be a forgery now everybody -- police press and public alike -- at once jump to the conclusion that as percival brook benefit by that forge will percival brook must be the forger seek for he whom the crime benefit be you own axiom argue the girl i beg you pardon percival brook benefit to the tune of # 2000000 i beg you pardon he do nothing of the sort he be leave with less than half the share that he younger brother inherit now yes but that be a former will and -- and that forge will be so clumsily execute the signature so carelessly imitate that the forgery be bind to come to light do _ that _ never strike you yes but -- there be no but he interrupt it be all as clear as daylight to I from the very first the quarrel with the old man which break he heart be not with he eldest son with whom he be use to quarrel but with the second son whom he idolise in whom he believe do not you remember how john o'neill hear the word ` liar ' and ` deceit ' percival brook have never deceive he father he sin be all on the surface murray have lead a quiet life have pander to he father and fawn upon he until like most hypocrite he at last get find out who know what ugly gamble debt or debt of honor suddenly reveal to old brook be the cause of that last and deadly quarrel you remember that it be percival who remain beside he father and carry he up to he room where be murray throughout that long and painful day when he father lay die -- he the idolised son the apple of the old man 's eye you never hear he name mention as be present there all that day but he know that he have offend he father mortally and that he father mean to cut he off with a shilling he know that mr wether have be send for that wethered leave the house soon after four o'clock and here the cleverness of the man come in have lain in wait for wethered and knock he on the back of the head with a stick he could not very well make that will disappear altogether there remain the faint chance of some other witness know that mr brook have make a fresh will mr wethered 's partner he clerk or one of the confidential servant in the house therefore _ a _ will must be discover after the old man 's death now murray brook be not a expert forger it take year of training to become that a forge will execute by himself would be sure to be find out -- yes that be it sure to be find out the forgery will be palpable -- let it be palpable and then it will be find out brand as such and the original will of 1891 so favourable to the young blackguard 's interest would be hold as valid be it devilry or merely additional caution which prompt murray to pen that forge will so glaringly in percival 's favor it be impossible to say anyhow it be the cleverest touch in that marvellously devise crime to plan that evil deed be great to execute it be easy enough he have several hour ' leisure in which to do it then at night it be simplicity itself to slip the document under the dead man 's pillow sacrilege cause no shudder to such nature as murray brook the rest of the drama you know already -- but percival brook the jury return a verdict of ` not guilty ' there be no evidence against he but the money surely the scoundrel do not have the enjoyment of it still no he enjoy it for a time but he die about three month ago and forget to take the precaution of make a will so he brother percival have get the business after all if you ever go to dublin i should order some of brook ' bacon if i be you it be very good chapter xxiv a unparalleled outrage do you care for the seaside ask the man in the corner when he have finish he lunch i do not mean the seaside at ostend or trouville but honest english seaside with nigger minstrel three-shilling excursionist and dirty expensive furnished apartment where they charge you a shilling for light the hall gas on sunday and sixpence on other evening do you care for that i prefer the country ah perhaps it be preferable personally i only like one of we english seaside resort once and that be for a week when edward skinner be up before the magistrate charge with what be know as the ` brighton outrage ' i do not know if you remember the memorable day in brighton memorable for that elegant town which deal more in amusement than mystery when mr franci morton one of its most note resident disappear yes disappear as completely as any vanish lady in a music-hall he be wealthy have a fine house servant a wife and child and he disappear there be no get away from that mr franci morton live with he wife in one of the large house in sussex square at the kemp town end of brighton mr morton be well know for she americanism she swagger dinner party and beautiful pari gown she be the daughter of one of the many american millionaire -lrb- i think she father be a chicago pork-butcher -rrb- who conveniently provide wealthy wife for english gentleman and she have marry mr franci morton a few year ago and bring he she quarter of a million for no other reason but that she fall in love with he he be neither good-looking nor distinguished in fact he be one of those man who seem to have city stamp all over they person he be a gentleman of very regular habit go up to london every morning on business and return every afternoon by the ` husband 's train ' so regular be he in these habit that all the servant at the sussex square house be betray into actual gossip over the fact that on Wednesday march 17th the master be not home for dinner hale the butler remark that the mistress seem a bit anxious and do not eat much food the evening wear on and mr morton do not appear at nine o'clock the young footman be dispatch to the station to make inquiry whether he master have be see there in the afternoon or whether -- which heaven forbid -- there have be a accident on the line the young man interview two or three porter the bookstall boy and ticket clerk all be agree that mr morton do not go up to london during the day no one have see he within the precinct of the station there certainly have be no accident report either on the up or down line but the morning of the 18th come with its initial postman 's knock but neither mr morton nor any sign or news from he mr morton who evidently have spend a sleepless night for she look sadly change and haggard send a wire to the hall porter at the large building in cannon street where she husband have he office a hour later she have the reply : ` not see mr morton all day yesterday not here to-day ' by the afternoon every one in brighton know that a fellow-resident have mysteriously disappear from or in the city a couple of day then another elapse and still no sign of mr morton the police be do they best the gentleman be so well know in brighton -- as he have be a resident two year -- that it be not difficult to firmly establish the one fact that he have not leave the city since no one see he in the station on the morning of the 17th nor at any time since then mild excitement prevail throughout the town at first the newspaper take the matter somewhat jocosely ` where be mr morton ' be the usual placard on the evening 's contents bill but after three day have go by and the worthy brighton resident be still miss while mr morton be see to look more haggard and careworn every day mild excitement give place to anxiety there be vague hint now as to foul play the news have leak out that the miss gentleman be carry a large sum of money on the day of he disappearance there be also vague rumor of a scandal not unconnected with mr morton herself and she own past history which in she anxiety for she husband she have be force to reveal to the detective-inspector in charge of the case then on Saturday the news which the late evening papers contain be this : ` act on certain information receive the police to-day force a entrance into one of the room of russell house a high-class furnished apartment on the king 's parade and there they discover we miss distinguished townsman mr franci morton who have be rob and subsequently lock up in that room since Wednesday the 17th when discover he be in the last stage of inanition he be tie into a arm-chair with rope a thick wool shawl have be wind round he mouth and it be a positive marvel that left thus without food and very little air the unfortunate gentleman survive the horror of these four day of incarceration ` he have be convey to he residence in sussex square and we be pleased to say that doctor mellish who be in attendance have declare he patient to be out of serious danger and that with care and rest he will be soon quite himself again ` at the same time we reader will learn with unmixed satisfaction that the police of we city with they usual acuteness and activity have already discover the identity and whereabouts of the cowardly ruffian who commit this unparalleled outrage ' chapter xxv the prisoner i really do not know continue the man in the corner blandly what it be that interested I in the case from the very first certainly it have nothing very out of the way or mysterious about it but i journey down to brighton nevertheless as i feel that something deeper and more subtle lay behind that extraordinary assault follow a robbery no doubt i must tell you that the police have allow it to be freely circulate abroad that they hold a clue it have be easy enough to ascertain who the lodger be who have rent the furnished room in russell house he name be suppose to be edward skinner and he have take the room about a fortnight ago but have go away ostensibly for two or three day on the very day of mr morton 's mysterious disappearance it be on the 20th that mr morton be find and thirty-six hour later the public be gratify to hear that mr edward skinner have be trace to london and arrest on the charge of assault upon the person of mr franci morton and of rob he of the sum of # 10000 then a further sensation be add to the already bewildering case by the startling announcement that mr francis morton refuse to prosecute of course the treasury take up the case and subpoena mr morton as a witness so that gentleman -- if he wish to hush the matter up or have be in any way terrorise into a promise of do so -- gain nothing by he refusal except a additional amount of curiosity in the public mind and further sensation around the mysterious case it be all this you see which have interested I and bring I down to brighton on march 23rd to see the prisoner edward skinner arraign before the beak i must say that he be a very ordinary-looking individual fair of ruddy complexion with snub nose and the beginning of a bald place on the top of he head he too look the embodiment of a prosperous stodgy ` city gent ' i take a quick survey of the witness present and guess that the handsome stylish woman sit next to mr reginald pepy the note lawyer for the crown be mrs morton there be a large crowd in court and i hear whisper comment among the feminine portion thereof as to the beauty of mr morton 's gown the value of she large picture hat and the magnificence of she diamond ring the police give all the evidence require with regard to the finding of mr morton in the room at russell house and also to the arrest of skinner at the langham hotel in london it appear that the prisoner seem completely take aback at the charge prefer against he and declare that though he know mr franci morton slightly in business he know nothing as to he private life ` prisoner state ' continue inspector buckle ` that he be not even aware mr morton live in brighton but i have evidence here which i will place before you honor to prove that the prisoner be see in the company of mr morton at 930 o'clock on the morning of the assault ' cross-examine by mr matthew quiller the detective-inspector admit that prisoner merely say that he do not know that mr morton be a _ resident _ of brighton -- he never deny have meet he there the witness or rather witness refer to by the police be two brighton tradesman who know mr morton by sight and have see he on the morning of the 17th walking with the accuse in this instance mr quiller have no question to ask of the witness and it be generally understand that the prisoner do not wish to contradict they statement constable hartrick tell the story of the finding of the unfortunate mr morton after he four day ' incarceration the constable have be send round by the chief inspector after certain information give by mr chapman the landlady of russell house he have find the door lock and force it open mr morton be in a arm-chair with several yard of rope wound loosely round he he be almost unconscious and there be a thick wool shawl tie round he mouth which must have deaden any cry or groan the poor gentleman might have utter but as a matter of fact the constable be under the impression that mr morton have be either drug or stun in some way at first which have leave he weak and faint and prevent he from make himself hear or extricate himself from he bond which be very clumsily evidently very hastily wind round he body the medical officer who be call in and also dr mellish who attend mr morton both say that he seem daze by some stupefying drug and also of course terribly weak and faint with the want of food the first witness of real importance be mrs chapman the proprietress of russell house whose original information to the police lead to the discovery of mr morton in answer to mr pepy she say that on march 1st the accuse call at she house and give he name as mr edward skinner ` he require he say a furnished room at a moderate rental for a permanency with full attendance when he be in but he add that he would often be away for two or three day or even longer at a time ` he tell I that he be a traveller for a tea-house ' continued mr chapman ` and i show he the front room on the third floor as he do not want to pay more than twelve shilling a week i ask he for a reference but he put three sovereign in my hand and say with a laugh that he suppose pay for he room a month in advance be sufficient reference if i do not like he after that i could give he a week 's notice to quit ' ` you do not think of ask he the name of the firm for which he travel ' ask mr pepy ` no i be quite satisfied as he pay I for the room the next day he send in he luggage and take possession of the room he go out most morning on business but be always in brighton for Saturday and Sunday on the 16th he tell I that he be go to liverpool for a couple of day he sleep in the house that night and go off early on the 17th take he portmanteau with he ' ` at what time do he leave ' ask mr pepy ' i could not say exactly ' reply mrs chapman with some hesitation ` you see this be the off season here none of my room be let except the one to mr skinner and i only have one servant i keep four during the summer autumn and winter season ' she add with conscious pride fear that she former statement might prejudice the reputation of russell house ' i think i have hear mr skinner go out about nine o'clock but about a hour later the girl and i be both in the basement and we hear the front door open and shut with a bang and then a step in the hall ` that be mr skinner say mary so it be i say why i think he have go a hour ago he do go out then say mary for he leave he bedroom door open and i go in to do he bed and tidy he room just go and see if that be he mary i say and mary run up to the hall and up the stair and come back to tell I that that be mr skinner all right enough he have go straight up to he room mary do not see he but he have another gentleman with he as she could hear they talk in mr skinner 's room ' ` then you can not tell we at what time the prisoner leave the house finally ' ` no that i can not i go out shopping soon after that when i come in it be twelve o'clock i go up to the third floor and find that mr skinner have lock he door and take the key with he as i know mary have already do the room i do not trouble more about it though i do think it strange for a gentleman to look up he room and not leave the key with I ' ` and of course you hear no noise of any kind in the room then ' ` no not that day or the next but on the third day mary and i both think we hear a funny sound i say that mr skinner have leave he window open and it be the blind flap against the window-pane but when we hear that funny noise again i put my ear to the keyhole and i think i could hear a groan i be very frightened and send mary for the police ' mr chapman have nothing more of interest to say the prisoner certainly be she lodger she have last see he on the evening of the 16th go up to he room with he candle mary the servant have much the same story to relate as she mistress ' i think it be ` im right enough ' say mary guardedly ' i do not see ` im but i go up to ` be landing and stop a moment outside ` be door i could ` ear loud voice in the room -- gentleman talk ' ' i suppose you would not do such a thing as to listen mary ' query mr pepy with a smile ` no sir ' say mary with a bland smile ' i do not catch what the gentleman say but one of they speak so loud i think they must be quarrel ' ` mr skinner be the only person in possession of a latch-key i presume no one else could have come in without ring at the door ' ` oh no sir ' that be all so far you see the case be progress splendidly for the crown against the prisoner the contention of course be that skinner have meet mr morton bring he home with he assault drugged then gag and bind he and finally rob he of whatever money he have in he possession which accord to certain affidavit which presently would be place before the magistrate amount to # 10000 in note but in all this there still remain the great element of mystery for which the public and the magistrate would demand a explanation : namely what be the relationship between mr morton and skinner which have induce the former to refuse the prosecution of the man who have not only rob he but have so nearly succeed in leave he to die a terrible and linger death mr morton be too ill as yet to appear in person dr mellish have absolutely forbid he patient to undergo the fatigue and excitement of give evidence himself in court that day but he deposition have be take at he bedside be swear to by he and be now place before the magistrate by the prosecute counsel and the fact they reveal be certainly as remarkable as they be brief and enigmatical as they be read by mr pepy a awed and expectant hush seem to descend over the large crowd gather there and all neck be strain eagerly forward to catch a glimpse of a tall elegant woman faultlessly dress and wear exquisite jewellery but whose handsome face wear as the prosecute counsel read she husband 's deposition a more and more ashen hue ` this you honor be the statement make upon oath by mr franci morton ' commence mr pepy in that loud sonorous voice of he which sound so impressive in a crowded and hushed court ' i be oblige for certain reason which i refuse to disclose to make a payment of a large sum of money to a man whom i do not know and have never see it be in a matter of which my wife be cognisant and which have entirely to do with she own affair i be merely the go-between as i think it be not fit that she should see to this matter herself the individual in question have make certain demand of which she keep I in ignorance as long as she could not wish to unnecessarily worry I at last she decide to place the whole matter before I and i agree with she that it would be best to satisfy the man 's demand ' i then write to that individual whose name i do not wish to disclose address the letter as my wife direct I to do to the brighton post office say that i be ready to pay the # 10000 to he at any place or time and in what manner he might appoint i receive a reply which bear the brighton postmark and which desire I to be outside furnival 's the draper in west street at 930 on the morning of march 17th and to bring the money -lrb- # 10000 -rrb- in bank of england note ` on the 16th my wife give I a cheque for the amount and i cash it at she bank -- bird 's in fleet street at half-past nine the follow morning i be at the appoint place a individual wear a gray overcoat bowler hat and red tie accost I by name and request I to walk as far as he lodgings in the king 's parade i follow he neither of we speak he stop at a house which bear the name ` russell house ' and which i shall be able to swear to as soon as i be able to go out he let himself in with a latch-key and ask I to follow he up to he room on the third floor i think i notice when we be in the room that he lock the door however i have nothing of any value about I except the # 10000 which i be ready to give he we have not exchange the slightest word ' i give he the note and he fold they and put they in he pocket-book then i turn towards the door and without the slightest warning i feel myself suddenly grip by the shoulder while a handkerchief be press to my nose and mouth i struggle as best i could but the handkerchief be saturate with chloroform and i soon lose consciousness i hazily remember the man say to I in short jerky sentence speak at interval while i be still weakly struggle : '' what a fool you must think I my dear sir do you really think that i be go to let you quietly walk out of here straight to the police-station eh such dodge have be do before i know when a man 's silence have to be buy for money find out who he be see where he live give he the money then inform against he no you do not not this time i be off to the continong with this # 10000 and i can get to newhaven in time for the midday boat so you 'll have to keep quiet until i be the other side of the channel my friend you will not be much inconvenienced my landlady will hear you groan presently and release you so you 'll be all right there now drink this -- that be better ' he force something bitter down my throat then i remember nothing more ` when i regain consciousness i be sit in a arm-chair with some rope tie round I and a wool shawl round my mouth i have not the strength to make the slightest effort to disentangle myself or to utter a scream i feel terribly sick and faint ' mr reginald pepy have finish reading and no one in that crowded court have think of utter a sound the magistrate 's eye be fix upon the handsome lady in the magnificent gown who be mop she eye with a dainty lace handkerchief the extraordinary narrative of the victim of so daring a outrage have keep every one in suspense one thing be still expect to make the measure of sensation as full as it have ever be over any criminal case and that be mrs morton 's evidence she be call by the prosecute counsel and slowly gracefully she enter the witness-box there be no doubt that she have feel keenly the torture which she husband have undergo and also the humiliation of see she name drag forcibly into this ugly blackmail scandal closely question by mr reginald pepy she be force to admit that the man who blackmail she be connect with she early life in a way which would have bring terrible disgrace upon she and upon she child the story she tell amidst many tear and sob and much use of she beautiful lace handkerchief and beringed hand be exceedingly pathetic it appear that when she be barely seventeen she be inveigle into a secret marriage with one of those foreign adventurer who swarm in every country and who style himself comte armand de la tremouille he seem to have be a blackguard of unusually low pattern for after he have extract from she some # 200 of she pin money and a few diamond brooch he leave she one fine day with a laconic word to say that he be sail for europe by the _ argentina _ and would not be back for some time she be in love with the brute poor young soul for when a week later she read that the _ argentina _ be wreck and presumably every soul on board have perish she weep very many bitter tear over she early widowhood fortunately she father a very wealthy pork-butcher of chicago have know nothing of he daughter 's culpable foolishness four year later he take she to london where she meet mr franci morton and marry he she lead six or seven year of very happy married life when one day like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky she receive a typewritten letter sign ` armand de la tremouille ' full of protestation of undying love tell a long and pathetic tale of year of suffer in a foreign land whither he have drift after have be rescue almost miraculously from the wreck of the _ argentina _ and where he never have be able to scrape a sufficient amount of money to pay for he passage home at last fate have favor he he have after many vicissitude find the whereabouts of he dear wife and be now ready to forgive all that be past and take she to he loving arm once again what follow be the usual course of event when there be a blackguard and a fool of a woman she be terrorise and do not dare to tell she husband for some time she correspond with the comte de la tremouille beg he for she sake and in memory of the past not to attempt to see she she find he amenable to reason in the shape of several hundred pound which pass through the brighton post office into he hand at last one day by accident mr morton come across one of the comte de la tremouille 's interesting letter she confess everything throw herself upon she husband 's mercy now mr francis morton be a business man who view life practically and soberly he like he wife who keep he in luxury and wish to keep she whereas the comte de la tremouille seem willing enough to give she up for a consideration mr morton who have the sole and absolute control of she fortune on the other hand be willing enough to pay the price and hush up the scandal which she believe -- since she be a bit of a fool -- would land she in prison for bigamy mr franci morton write to the comte de la tremouille that he wife be ready to pay he the sum of # 10000 which he demand in payment for she absolute liberty and he own complete disappearance out of she life now and for ever the appointment be make and mr morton leave he house at 9 be on march 17th with the # 10000 in he pocket the public and the magistrate have hang breathless upon she word there be nothing but sympathy feel for this handsome woman who throughout have be more sin against than sinning and whose gravest fault seem to have be a total lack of intelligence in deal with she own life but i can assure you of one thing that in no case within my recollection be there ever such a sensation in a court as when the magistrate after a few minute ' silence say gently to mr morton : ` and now mr morton will you kindly look at the prisoner and tell I if in he you recognize you former husband ' and she without even turn to look at the accuse say quietly : ` oh no you honor of course that man be _ not _ the comte de la tremouille ' chapter xxvi a sensation i can assure you that the situation be quite dramatic continue the man in the corner whilst he funny claw-like hand take up a bit of string with renew feverishness in answer to further question from the magistrate she declare that she have never see the accuse he might have be the go-between however that she could not say the letter she receive be all typewritten but sign ` armand de la tremouille ' and certainly the signature be identical with that on the letter she use to receive from he year ago all of which she have keep ` and do it _ never _ strike you ' ask the magistrate with a smile ` that the letter you receive might be forgery ' ` how could they be ' she reply decisively no one know of my marriage to the comte de la tremouille no one in england certainly and besides if some one do know the comte intimately enough to forge he handwriting and to blackmail I why should that some one have wait all these year i have be marry seven year you honor ' that be true enough and there the matter rest as far as she be concerned but the identity of mr franci morton 's assailant have to be finally establish of course before the prisoner be commit for trial dr mellish promise that mr morton would be allow to come to court for half a hour and identify the accuse on the follow day and the case be adjourn until then the accuse be lead away between two constable bail be refuse and brighton have perforce to moderate its impatience until the Wednesday on that day the court be crowd to overflow actor playwright literary man of all sort have fight for admission to study for themselves the various phase and face in connection with the case mr morton be not present when the prisoner quiet and self-possessed be bring in and place in the dock he solicitor be with he and a sensational defense be expect presently there be a stir in the court and that certain sound half rustle half sigh which prelude a expect palpitating event mr morton pale thin wear yet in he hollow eye the stamp of those five day of suffer walk into court lean on the arm of he doctor -- mr morton be not with he he be at once accommodate with a chair in the witness-box and the magistrate after a few word of kindly sympathy ask he if he have anything to add to he write statement on mr morton reply in the negative the magistrate add : ` and now mr morton will you kindly look at the accuse in the dock and tell I whether you recognize the person who take you to the room in russell house and then assault you ' slowly the sick man turn towards the prisoner and look at he then he shake he head and reply quietly : ` no sir that certainly be not the man ' ` you be quite sure ' ask the magistrate in amazement while the crowd literally gasp with wonder ' i swear it ' assert mr morton ` can you describe the man who assault you ' ` certainly he be dark of swarthy complexion tall thin with bushy eyebrow and thick black hair and short beard he speak english with just the faintest suspicion of a foreign accent ' the prisoner as i tell you before be english in every feature english in he ruddy complexion and absolutely english in he speech after that the case for the prosecution begin to collapse every one have expect a sensational defense and mr matthew quiller counsel for skinner fully justified all these expectation he have no fewer than four witness present who swear positively that at 945 be on the morning of Wednesday march 17th the prisoner be in the express train leave brighton for victorium not be endow with the gift of be in two place at once and mr morton have add the whole weight of he own evidence in mr edward skinner 's favor that gentleman be once more remand by the magistrate pend further investigation by the police bail be allow this time in two surety of # 50 each chapter xxvii two blackguard tell I what you think of it say the man in the corner see that polly remain silent and puzzle well she reply dubiously i suppose that the so-called armand de la tremouille 's story be true in substance that he do not perish on the _ argentina _ but drift home and blackmail he former wife do not it strike you that there be at least two very strong point against that theory he ask make two gigantic knot in he piece of string two yes in the first place if the blackmailer be the ` comte de la tremouille ' return to life why should he have be content to take # 10000 from a lady who be he lawful wife and who could keep he in luxury for the rest of he natural life upon she large fortune which be close upon a quarter of a million the real comte de la tremouille remember have never find it difficult to get money out of he wife during they brief married life whatever mr morton 's subsequent experience in the same direction might have be and secondly why should he have typewrite he letter to he wife because -- that be a point which to my mind the police never make the most of now my experience in criminal case have invariably be that when a typewritten letter figure in one that letter be a forgery it be not very difficult to imitate a signature but it be a jolly sight more difficult to imitate a handwriting throughout a entire letter then do you think -- i think if you will allow I he interrupt excitedly that we will go through the point -- the sensible tangible point of the case firstly : mr morton disappear with # 10000 in he pocket for four entire day at the end of that time he be discover loosely tie to a arm-chair and a wool shawl round he mouth secondly : a man name skinner be accuse of the outrage mr morton although he himself be able mind you to furnish the best defense possible for skinner by deny he identity with the man who assault he refuse to prosecute why he do not wish to drag he wife 's name into the case he must have know that the crown would take up the case then again how be it no one see he in the company of the swarthy foreigner he describe two witness do see mr morton in company with skinner argue polly yes at 920 in west street that would give edward skinner time to catch the 945 at the station and to entrust mr morton with the latch-key of russell house remark the man in the corner dryly what nonsense polly ejaculate nonsense be it he say tug wildly at he bit of string be it nonsense to affirm that if a man want to make sure that he victim shall not escape he do not usually wind rope ` loosely ' round he figure nor do he throw a wool shawl lightly round he mouth the police be idiotic beyond word they themselves discover that morton be so ` loosely ' fasten to he chair that very little movement would have disentangle he and yet it never strike they that nothing be easier for that particular type of scoundrel to sit down in a arm-chair and wind a few yard of rope round himself then have wrap a wool shawl round he throat to slip he two arm inside the rope but what object would a man in mr morton 's position have for play such extraordinary prank ah the motive there you be what do i always tell you seek the motive now what be mr morton 's position he be the husband of a lady who own a quarter of a million of money not one penny of which he could touch without she consent as it be settle on herself and who after the terrible way in which she have be plunder and then abandon in she early youth no doubt keep a very tight hold upon the purse-string mr morton 's subsequent life have prove that he have certain expensive not altogether avowable taste one day he discover the old love letter of the ` comte armand de la tremouille ' then he lay he plan he typewrite a letter forge the signature of the erstwhile count and await event the fish do rise to the bait he get sundry bit of money and he success make he daring he look round he for a accomplice -- clever unscrupulous greedy -- and select mr edward skinner probably some former pal of he wild oats day the plan be very neat you must confess mr skinner take the room in russell house and study all the manners and custom of he landlady and she servant he then draw the full attention of the police upon himself he meet morton in west street then disappear ostensibly after the ` assault ' in the meanwhile morton go to russell house he walk upstairs talk loudly in the room then make elaborate preparation for he comedy why he nearly die of starvation that i dare say be not a part of he reckoning he think no doubt that mr chapman or the servant would discover and rescue he pretty soon he mean to appear just a little faint and endure quietly the first twenty-four hour of inanition but the excitement and want of food tell on he more than he expect after twenty-four hour he turn very giddy and sick and fall from one faint fit into another be unable to give the alarm however he be all right again now and conclude he part of a downright blackguard to perfection under the plea that he conscience do not allow he to live with a lady whose first husband be still alive he have take a bachelor flat in london and only pay afternoon call on he wife in brighton but presently he will tire of he bachelor life and will return to he wife and i 'll guarantee that the comte de la tremouille will never be hear of again and that afternoon the man in the corner leave miss polly burton alone with a couple of photo of two uninteresting stodgy quiet-looking man -- morton and skinner -- who if the old scarecrow be right in he theory wear a pair of the finest blackguard unhung chapter xxviii the regent 's park murder by this time miss polly burton have become quite accustomed to she extraordinary _ vis-à-vi _ in the corner he be always there when she arrive in the selfsame corner dress in one of he remarkable check tweed suit he seldom say good morning and invariably when she appear he begin to fidget with increase nervousness with some tattered and knotty piece of string be you ever interested in the regent 's park murder he ask she one day polly reply that she have forget most of the particulars connect with that curious murder but that she fully remember the stir and flutter it have cause in a certain section of london society the racing and gambling set particularly you mean he say all the person implicate in the murder directly or indirectly be of the type commonly call ` society man ' or ` man about town ' whilst the harewood club in hanover square round which centre all the scandal in connection with the murder be one of the smartest club in london probably the doings of the harewood club which be essentially a gambling club would for ever have remain ` officially ' absent from the knowledge of the police authority but for the murder in the regent 's park and the revelation which come to light in connection with it i dare say you know the quiet square which lie between portland place and the regent 's park and be call park crescent at its south end and subsequently park square east and west the marylebone road with all its heavy traffic cut straight across the large square and its pretty garden but the latter be connect together by a tunnel under the road and of course you must remember that the new tube station in the south portion of the square have not yet be plan February 6th 1907 be a very foggy night nevertheless mr aaron cohen of 30 park square west at two o'clock in the morning have finally pocket the heavy winnings which he have just sweep off the green table of the harewood club start to walk home alone a hour later most of the inhabitant of park square west be arouse from they peaceful slumber by the sound of a violent altercation in the road a man 's angry voice be hear shout violently for a minute or two and be follow immediately by frantic scream of ` police ' and ` murder ' then there be the double sharp report of firearm and nothing more the fog be very dense and as you no doubt have experience yourself it be very difficult to locate sound in a fog nevertheless not more than a minute or two have elapse before constable f 18 the point policeman at the corner of marylebone road arrive on the scene and have first of all whistle for any of he comrade on the beat begin to grope he way about in the fog more confused than effectually assist by contradictory direction from the inhabitant of the house close by who be nearly fall out of the upper window as they shout out to the constable ` by the railing policeman ' ` higher up the road ' ` no lower down ' ` it be on this side of the pavement i be sure ' no the other ' at last it be another policeman f 22 who turn into park square west from the north side almost stumble upon the body of a man lie on the pavement with he head against the railing of the square by this time quite a little crowd of people from the different house in the road have come down curious to know what have actually happen the policeman turn the strong light of he bull 's - eye lantern on the unfortunate man 's face ` it look as if he have be strangle do not it ' he murmur to he comrade and he point to the swollen tongue the eye half out of they socket bloodshot and congest the purple almost black hue of the face at this point one of the spectator more callous to horror peer curiously into the dead man 's face he utter a exclamation of astonishment ` why surely it be mr cohen from no 30 ' the mention of a name familiar down the length of the street have cause two or three other man to come forward and to look more closely into the horribly distorted mask of the murder man ` we next-door neighbor undoubtedly ' assert mr ellison a young barrister reside at no 31 ` what in the world be he do this foggy night all alone and on foot ' ask somebody else ` he usually come home very late i fancy he belong to some gambling club in town i dare say he could not get a cab to bring he out here mind you i do not know much about he we only know he to nod to ' ` poor beggar it look almost like a old-fashioned case of garrote ' ` anyway the blackguardly murderer whoever he be want to make sure he have kill he man ' add constable f 18 as he pick up a object from the pavement ` here be the revolver with two cartridge miss you gentleman hear the report just now ' ` he do not seem to have hit he though the poor bloke be strangle no doubt ' ` and try to shoot at he assailant obviously ' assert the young barrister with authority ` if he succeed in hit the brute there might be a chance of trace the way he go ' ` but not in the fog ' soon however the appearance of the inspector detective and medical officer who have quickly be inform of the tragedy put a end to further discussion the bell at no 30 be ring and the servant -- all four of they woman -- be ask to look at the body amidst tear of horror and scream of fright they all recognize in the murder man they master mr aaron cohen he be therefore convey to he own room pend the coroner 's inquest the police have a pretty difficult task you will admit there be so very few indication to go by and at first literally no clue the inquest reveal practically nothing very little be know in the neighborhood about mr aaron cohen and he affair he female servant do not even know the name or whereabouts of the various club he frequent he have a office in throgmorton street and go to business every day he dine at home and sometimes have friend to dinner when he be alone he invariably go to the club where he stay until the small hour of the morning the night of the murder he have go out at about nine o'clock that be the last he servant have see of he with regard to the revolver all four servant swear positively that they have never see it before and that unless mr cohen have buy it that very day it do not belong to they master beyond that no trace whatever of the murderer have be find but on the morning after the crime a couple of key link together by a short metal chain be find close to a gate at the opposite end of the square that which immediately face portland place these be prove to be firstly mr cohen 's latch-key and secondly he gate-key of the square it be therefore presume that the murderer have accomplish he fall design and ransack he victim 's pocket have find the key and make good he escape by slip into the square cut under the tunnel and out again by the further gate he then take the precaution not to carry the key with he any further but throw they away and disappear in the fog the jury return a verdict of wilful murder against some person or person unknown and the police be put on they mettle to discover the unknown and daring murderer the result of they investigation conduct with marvellous skill by mr william fisher lead about a week after the crime to the sensational arrest of one of london 's smartest young buck the case mr fisher have get up against the accuse briefly amount to this : on the night of February 6th soon after midnight play begin to run very high at the harewood club in hanover square mr aaron cohen hold the bank at roulette against some twenty or thirty of he friend mostly young fellow with no wit and plenty of money ` the bank ' be win heavily and it appear that this be the third consecutive night on which mr aaron cohen have go home richer by several hundred than he have be at the start of play young john ashley who be the son of a very worthy county gentleman who be mfh somewhere in the midland be lose heavily and in he case also it appear that it be the third consecutive night that fortune have turn she face against he remember continue the man in the corner that when i tell you all these detail and fact i be give you the combined evidence of several witness which it take many day to collect and to classify it appear that young mr ashley though very popular in society be generally believe to be in what be vulgarly term ` low water ' up to he eye in debt and mortally afraid of he dad whose younger son he be and who have on one occasion threaten to ship he off to australia with a # 5 note in he pocket if he make any further extravagant call upon he paternal indulgence it be also evident to all john ashley 's many companion that the worthy mfh hold the purse-string in a very tight grip the young man bite with the desire to cut a smart figure in the circle in which he move have often recourse to the vary fortune which now and again smile upon he across the green table in the harewood club be that as it may the general consensus of opinion at the club be that young ashley have change he last ` pony ' before he sit down to a turn of roulette with aaron cohen on that particular night of February 6th it appear that all he friend conspicuous among whom be mr walter hatherell try they very best to dissuade he from pit he luck against that of cohen who have be have a most unprecedented run of good fortune but young ashley heat with wine exasperated at he own bad luck would listen to no one he toss one # 5 note after another on the board he borrow from those who would lend then play on parole for a while finally at half-past one in the morning after a run of nineteen on the red the young man find himself without a penny in he pocket and owe a debt -- gamble debt -- a debt of honor of # 1500 to mr aaron cohen now we must render this much maligned gentleman that justice which be persistently deny to he by press and public alike it be positively assert by all those present that mr cohen himself repeatedly try to induce young mr ashley to give up play he himself be in a delicate position in the matter as he be the winner and once or twice the taunt have rise to the young man 's lip accuse the holder of the bank of the wish to retire on a competence before the break in he luck mr aaron cohen smoking the best of havana have finally shrug he shoulder and say : ` as you please ' but at half-past one he have have enough of the player who always lose and never pay -- never could pay so mr cohen probably believe he therefore at that hour refuse to accept mr john ashley 's ` promissory ' stake any longer a very few heated word ensue quickly check by the management who be ever on the alert to avoid the least suspicion of scandal in the meanwhile mr hatherell with great good sense persuade young ashley to leave the club and all its temptation and go home if possible to bed the friendship of the two young man which be very well know in society consist chiefly it appear in walter hatherell be the willing companion and helpmeet of john ashley in he mad and extravagant prank but to-night the latter apparently tardily sober by he terrible and heavy loss allow himself to be lead away by he friend from the scene of he disaster it be then about twenty minute to two here the situation become interesting continue the man in the corner in he nervous way no wonder that the police interrogate at least a dozen witness before they be quite satisfied that every statement be conclusively prove walter hatherell after about ten minute ' absence that be to say at ten minute to two return to the club room in reply to several inquiry he say that he have part with he friend at the corner of new bond street since he seem anxious to be alone and that ashley say he would take a turn down piccadilly before go home -- he think a walk would do he good at two o'clock or thereabout mr aaron cohen satisfy with he evening 's work give up he position at the bank and pocket he heavy winnings start on he homeward walk while mr walter hatherell leave the club half a hour later at three o'clock precisely the cry of ` murder ' and the report of fire-arm be hear in park square west and mr aaron cohen be find strangle outside the garden railing chapter xxix the motive now at first sight the murder in the regent 's park appear both to police and public as one of those silly clumsy crime obviously the work of a novice and absolutely purposeless see that it could but inevitably lead its perpetrator without any difficulty to the gallows you see a motive have be establish ` seek he whom the crime benefit ' say we french _ confrères _ but there be something more than that constable jame funnell on he beat turn from portland place into park crescent a few minute after he have hear the clock at holy trinity church marylebone strike half-past two the fog at that moment be perhaps not quite so dense as it be later on in the morning and the policeman see two gentleman in overcoat and top-hat lean arm in arm against the railing of the square close to the gate he could not of course distinguish they face because of the fog but he hear one of they say to the other : ` it be but a question of time mr cohen i know my father will pay the money for I and you will lose nothing by wait ' to this the other apparently make no reply and the constable pass on when he return to the same spot after have walk over he beat the two gentleman have go but later on it be near this very gate that the two key refer to at the inquest have be find another interesting fact add the man in the corner with one of those sarcastic smile of he which polly could not quite explain be the finding of the revolver upon the scene of the crime that revolver show to mr ashley 's valet be swear to by he as be the property of he master all these fact make of course a very remarkable so far quite unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence against mr john ashley no wonder therefore that the police thoroughly satisfy with mr fisher 's work and they own apply for a warrant against the young man and arrest he in he room in clarge street exactly a week after the committal of the crime as a matter of fact you know experience have invariably teach I that when a murderer seem particularly foolish and clumsy and proof against he seem particularly damn that be the time when the police should be most guard against pitfall now in this case if john ashley have indeed commit the murder in regent 's park in the manner suggest by the police he would have be a criminal in more sens than one for idiocy of that kind be to my mind worse than many crime the prosecution bring its witness up in triumphal array one after another there be the member of the harewood club -- who have see the prisoner 's excited condition after he heavy gambling loss to mr aaron cohen there be mr hatherell who in spite of he friendship for ashley be bind to admit that he have part from he at the corner of bond street at twenty minute to two and have not see he again till he return home at five be then come the evidence of arthur chipp john ashley 's valet it prove of a very sensational character he depose that on the night in question he master come home at about ten minute to two chipp have then not yet go to bed five minute later mr ashley go out again tell the valet not to sit up for he chipp could not say at what time either of the young gentleman have come home that short visit home -- presumably to fetch the revolver -- be think to be very important and mr john ashley 's friend feel that he case be practically hopeless the valet 's evidence and that of jame funnell the constable who have overhear the conversation near the park railing be certainly the two most damning proof against the accuse i assure you i be have a rare old time that day there be two face in court to watch which be the greatest treat i have have for many a day one of these be mr john ashley 's here be he photo -- short dark dapper a little ` racy ' in style but otherwise he look a son of a well-to-do farmer he be very quiet and placid in court and address a few word now and again to he solicitor he listen gravely and with a occasional shrug of the shoulder to the recital of the crime such as the police have reconstruct it before a excited and horrified audience mr john ashley drive to madness and frenzy by terrible financial difficulty have first of all go home in search of a weapon then waylay mr aaron cohen somewhere on that gentleman 's way home the young man have beg for delay mr cohen perhaps be obdurate but ashley follow he with he importunity almost to he door there see he creditor determine at last to cut short the painful interview he have seize the unfortunate man at a unguarded moment from behind and strangle he then fear that he dastardly work be not fully accomplish he have shoot twice at the already dead body miss it both time from sheer nervous excitement the murderer then must have empty he victim 's pocket and find the key of the garden think that it would be a safe way of evade capture by cut across the square under the tunnel and so through the more distant gate which face portland place the loss of the revolver be one of those unforeseen accident which a retributive providence place in the path of the miscreant deliver he by he own act of folly into the hand of human justice mr john ashley however do not appear the least bit impressed by the recital of he crime he have not engage the service of one of the most eminent lawyer expert at extract contradiction from witness by skilful cross-examination -- oh dear I no he have be contented with those of a dull prosy very second-rate limb of the law who as he call he witness be completely innocent of any desire to create a sensation he rise quietly from he seat and amidst breathless silence call the first of three witness on behalf of he client he call three -- but he could have produce twelve -- gentleman member of the ashton club in great portland street all of whom swear that at three o'clock on the morning of February 6th that be to say at the very moment when the cry of ` murder ' rouse the inhabitant of park square west and the crime be be commit mr john ashley be sit quietly in the club-room of the ashton play bridge with the three witness he have come in a few minute before three -- as the hall porter of the club testify -- and stay for about a hour and a half i need not tell you that this undoubted this fully prove _ alibi _ be a positive bombshell in the stronghold of the prosecution the most accomplished criminal could not possibly be in two place at once and though the ashton club transgress in many way against the gambling law of we very moral country yet its member belong to the best most unimpeachable class of society mr ashley have be see and speak to at the very moment of the crime by at least a dozen gentleman whose testimony be absolutely above suspicion mr john ashley 's conduct throughout this astonishing phase of the inquiry remain perfectly calm and correct it be no doubt the consciousness of be able to prove he innocence with such absolute conclusion that have steady he nerve throughout the proceedings he answer to the magistrate be clear and simple even on the ticklish subject of the revolver ' i leave the club sir ' he explain ` fully determine to speak with mr cohen alone in order to ask he for a delay in the settlement of my debt to he you will understand that i should not care to do this in the presence of other gentleman i go home for a minute or two -- not in order to fetch a revolver as the police assert for i always carry a revolver about with I in foggy weather -- but in order to see if a very important business letter have come for I in my absence ` then i go out again and meet mr aaron cohen not far from the harewood club i walk the greater part of the way with he and we conversation be of the most amicable character we part at the top of portland place near the gate of the square where the policeman see we mr cohen then have the intention of cut across the square as be a shorter way to he own house i think the square look dark and dangerous in the fog especially as mr cohen be carry a large sum of money ` we have a short discussion on the subject and finally i persuade he to take my revolver as i be go home only through very frequented street and moreover carry nothing that be worth steal after a little demur mr cohen accept the loan of my revolver and that be how it come to be find on the actual scene of the crime finally i part from mr cohen a very few minute after i have hear the church clock strike a quarter before three i be at the oxford street end of great portland street at five minute to three and it take at least ten minute to walk from where i be to the ashton club ' this explanation be all the more credible mind you because the question of the revolver have never be very satisfactorily explain by the prosecution a man who have effectually strangle he victim would not discharge two shot of he revolver for apparently no other purpose than that of rouse the attention of the nearest passer-by it be far more likely that it be mr cohen who shoot -- perhaps wildly into the air when suddenly attack from behind mr ashley 's explanation therefore be not only plausible it be the only possible one you will understand therefore how it be that after nearly half a hour 's examination the magistrate the police and the public be alike pleased to proclaim that the accuse leave the court without a stain upon he character chapter xxx friend yes interrupted polly eagerly since for once she acumen have be at least as sharp as he but suspicion of that horrible crime only shift its taint from one friend to another and of course i know -- but that be just it he quietly interrupt you do not know -- mr walter hatherell of course you mean so do every one else at once the friend weak and willing commit a crime on behalf of he cowardly yet more assertive friend who have tempt he to evil it be a good theory and be hold pretty generally i fancy even by the police i say ` even ' because they work really hard in order to build up a case against young hatherell but the great difficulty be that of time at the hour when the policeman have see the two man outside park square together walter hatherell be still sit in the harewood club which he never leave until twenty minute to two have he wish to waylay and rob aaron cohen he would not have wait surely till the time when presumably the latter would already have reach home moreover twenty minute be a incredibly short time in which to walk from hanover square to regent 's park without the chance of cut across the square to look for a man whose whereabouts you could not determine to within twenty yard or so to have a argument with he murder he and ransack he pocket and then there be the total absence of motive but -- say polly meditatively for she remember now that the regent 's park murder as it have be popularly call be one of those which have remain as impenetrable a mystery as any other crime have ever be in the annals of the police the man in the corner cock he funny birdlike head well on one side and look at she highly amuse evidently at she perplexity you do not see how that murder be commit he ask with a grin polly be bind to admit that she do not if you have happen to have be in mr john ashley 's predicament he persist you do not see how you could conveniently have do away with mr aaron cohen pocket he winnings and then lead the police of you country entirely by the nose by prove a indisputable _ alibi _ i could not arrange conveniently she retort to be in two different place half a mile apart at one and the same time no i quite admit that you could not do this unless you also have a friend -- a friend but you say -- i say that i admire mr john ashley for he be the head which plan the whole thing but he could not have accomplish the fascinating and terrible drama without the help of willing and able hand even then -- she protest point number one he begin excitedly fidget with he inevitable piece of string john ashley and he friend walter hatherell leave the club together and together decide on the plan of campaign hatherell return to the club and ashley go to fetch the revolver -- the revolver which play such a important part in the drama but not the part assign to it by the police now try to follow ashley closely as he dog aaron cohen 's footstep do you believe that he enter into conversation with he that he walk by he side that he ask for delay no he sneak behind he and catch he by the throat as the garroter use to do in the fog cohen be apoplectic and ashley be young and powerful moreover he mean to kill -- but the two man talk together outside the square gate protest polly one of whom be cohen and the other ashley pardon I he say jump up in he seat like a monkey on a stick there be not two man talk outside the square gate accord to the testimony of jame funnell the constable two man be lean arm in arm against the railing and _ one _ man be talk then you think that -- at the hour when jame funnell hear holy trinity clock striking half-past two aaron cohen be already dead look how simple the whole thing be he add eagerly and how easy after that -- easy but oh dear I how wonderfully how stupendously clever as soon as jame funnell have pass on john ashley have open the gate lift the body of aaron cohen in he arm and carry he across the square the square be desert of course but the way be easy enough and we must presume that ashley have be in it before anyway there be no fear of meet any one in the meantime hatherell have leave the club : as fast as he athletic leg can carry he he rush along oxford street and portland place it have be arrange between the two miscreant that the square gate should be leave on the latch close on ashley 's heel now hatherell too cut across the square and reach the further gate in good time to give he confederate a hand in dispose the body against the railing then without another instant 's delay ashley run back across the garden straight to the ashton club throw away the key of the dead man on the very spot where he have make it a point of be see and hear by a passer-by hatherell give he friend six or seven minute ' start then he begin the altercation which last two or three minute and finally rouse the neighborhood with cry of ` murder ' and report of pistol in order to establish that the crime be commit at the hour when its perpetrator have already make out a indisputable _ alibi _ i do not know what you think of it all of course add the funny creature as he fumble for he coat and he glove but i call the planning of that murder -- on the part of novice mind you -- one of the cleverest piece of strategy i have ever come across it be one of those case where there be no possibility whatever now of bring the crime home to its perpetrator or he abettor they have not leave a single proof behind they they foresee everything and each act he part with a coolness and courage which apply to a great and good cause would have make fine statesman of they both as it be i fear they be just a pair of young blackguard who have escape human justice and have only deserve the full and ungrudging admiration of yours very sincerely he have go polly want to call he back but he meager person be no longer visible through the glass door there be many thing she would have wish to ask of he -- what be he proof he fact he be theory after all and yet somehow she feel that he have solve once again one of the darkest mystery of great criminal london chapter xxxi the de genneville peerage the man in the corner rub he chin thoughtfully and look out upon the busy street below i suppose he say there be some truth in the say that providence watch over bankrupt kitten and lawyer i do not know there be such a say reply polly with guard dignity be not there perhaps i be misquote anyway there should be kitten it seem live and thrive through social and domestic upheaval which would annihilate a self-supporting tom-cat and to-day i read in the morning papers the account of a noble lord 's bankruptcy and in the society one that of he visit at the house of a cabinet minister where he be the most honor guest as for lawyer when providence have exhaust all other means of secure they welfare it bring forth the peerage case i believe as a matter of fact that this special dispensation of providence as you call it require more technical knowledge than any other legal complication that come before the law court she say and also a great deal more money in the client 's pocket than any other complication now take the brockelsby peerage case have you any idea how much money be spend over that soap bubble which only burst after many hundred if not thousand of pound go in lawyer ' and counsel ' fee i suppose a great deal of money be spend on both side she reply until that sudden awful issue -- which settle the dispute effectually he interrupt with a dry chuckle of course it be very doubtful if any reputable solicitor would have take up the case timothy beddingfield the birmingham lawyer be a gentleman who -- well -- have have some misfortune shall we say he be still on the roll mind you but i doubt if any case would have its chance improve by he conduct it against that there be just this to be say that some of these old peerage have such peculiar history and own such wonderful archive that a claim be always worth investigate -- you never know what may be the rights of it i believe that at first every one laugh over the pretension of the hon robert ingram de genneville to the joint title and part revenue of the old barony of genneville but obviously he _ might _ have get he case it certainly sound almost like a fairy-tale this claim base upon the suppose validity of a ancient document over 400 year old it be _ then _ that a mediaeval lord de genneville more endowed with muscle than common sense become during he turbulent existence much embarrassed and hopelessly puzzle through the presentation make to he by he lady of twin-born son he embarrassment chiefly arise from the fact that my lady 's attendant while minister to the comfort of the mother have in a moment of absent-mindedness so place the two infant in they cot that subsequently no one not even -- perhaps least of all -- the mother could tell which be the one who have be the first to make he appearance into this troublesome and puzzling world after many year of cogitation during which the lord de genneville approach nearer to the grave and he son to man 's estate he give up try to solve the riddle as to which of the twin should succeed to he title and revenue he appeal to he liege lord and king -- edward fourth of that name -- and with the latter 's August sanction he draw up a certain document wherein he enact that both he son should after he death share he title and goodly revenue and that the first son bear in wedlock of _ either _ father should subsequently be the sole heir in this document be also add that if in future time should any lord de genneville be similarly afflict with twin son who have equal rights to be consider the eldest bear the same rule should apply as to the succession subsequently a lord de genneville be create earl of brockelsby by one of the stuart king but for four hundred year after its enactment the extraordinary deed of succession remain a mere tradition the countess of brockelsby have seemingly no predilection for twin but in 1878 the mistress of brockelsby castle present she lord with twin-born son fortunately in modern time science be more wide-awake and attendant more careful the twin brother do not get mix up and one of they be style viscount tirlemont and be heir to the earldom whilst the other bear two hour later be that fascinating dashing young guardsman well know at hurlingham goodwood london and in he own county -- the hon robert ingram de genneville it certainly be a evil day for this brilliant young scion of the ancient race when he lend a ear to timothy beddingfield this man and he family before he have be solicitor to the earl of brockelsby for many generation but timothy owe to certain ` irregularity ' have forfeit the confidence of he client the late earl he be still in practice in birmingham however and of course know the ancient family tradition anent the twin succession whether he be prompt by revenge or merely self-advertisement no one know certain it be that he do advise the hon robert de genneville -- who apparently have more debt than he conveniently could pay and more extravagant taste than he could gratify on a younger son 's portion -- to lay a claim on he father 's death to the joint title and a moiety of the revenue of the ancient barony of genneville that claim be base upon the validity of the fifteenth-century document you may gather how extensive be the pretension of the hon robert from the fact that the greater part of edgbaston be now build upon land belong to the old barony anyway it be the last straw in a ocean of debt and difficulty and i have no doubt that beddingfield have not much trouble in persuade the hon robert to commence litigation at once the young earl of brockelsby 's attitude however remain one of absolute quietude in he nine point of the law he be in possession both of the title and of the document it be for the other side to force he to produce the one or to share the other it be at this stage of the proceedings that the hon robert be advise to marry in order to secure if possible the first male heir of the next generation since the young earl himself be still a bachelor a suitable _ fiancée _ be find for he by he friend in the person of miss mabel brandon the daughter of a rich birmingham manufacturer and the marriage be fix to take place at birmingham on Thursday September 15th 1907 on the 13th the hon robert ingram de genneville arrive at the castle hotel in new street for he wedding and on the 14th at eight o'clock in the morning he be discover lie on the floor of he bedroom -- murder the sensation which the awful and unexpected sequel to the do genneville peerage case cause in the mind of the friend of both litigant be quite unparalleled i do not think any crime of modern time create quite so much stir in all class of society birmingham be wild with excitement and the employés of the castle hotel have real difficulty in keep off the eager and inquisitive crowd who throng daily to the hall vainly hope to gather detail of news relate to the terrible tragedy at present there be but little to tell the shriek of the chambermaid who have go into the hon robert 's room with he shave water at eight o'clock have attract some of the waiter soon the manager and he secretary come up and immediately send for the police it seem at first sight as if the young man have be the victim of a homicidal maniac so brutal have be the way in which he have be assassinate the head and body be batter and bruise by some heavy stick or poker almost past human shape as if the murderer have wish to wreak some awful vengeance upon the body of he victim in fact it would be impossible to recount the gruesome aspect of that room and of the murder man 's body such as the police and the medical officer take note of that day it be suppose that the murder have be commit the evening before as the victim be dress in he evening clothes and all the light in the room have be leave fully turn on robbery also must have have a large share in the miscreant 's motive for the drawer and cupboard the portmanteau and dressing-bag have be ransack as if in search of valuable on the floor there lay a pocket-book tear in half and only contain a few letter address to the hon robert de genneville the earl of brockelsby next-of-kin to the decease be also telegraph for he drive over from brockelsby castle which be about seven mile from birmingham he be terribly affect by the awfulness of the tragedy and offer a liberal reward to stimulate the activity of the police in search of the miscreant the inquest be fix for the 17th three day later and the public be leave wonder where the solution lay of the terrible and gruesome murder at the castle hotel chapter xxxii a high-bred gentleman the central figure in the coroner 's court that day be undoubtedly the earl of brockelsby in deep black which contrast strongly with he florid complexion and fair hair sir marmaduke ingersoll he solicitor be with he and he have already perform the painful duty of identify the decease as he brother this have be a exceedingly painful duty owe to the terribly mutilate state of the body and face but the clothes and various trinket he wear include a signet ring have fortunately not tempt the brutal assassin and it be through they chiefly that lord brockelsby be able to swear to the identity of he brother the various employés at the hotel give evidence as to the discovery of the body and the medical officer give he opinion as to the immediate cause of death decease have evidently be strike at the back of the head with a poker or heavy stick the murderer then vent he blind fury upon the body by batter in the face and bruise it in a way that certainly suggest the work of a maniac then the earl of brockelsby be call and be request by the coroner to state when he have last see he brother alive ` the morning before he death ' reply he lordship ` he come up to birmingham by a early train and i drive up from brockelsby to see he i get to the hotel at eleven o'clock and stay with he for about a hour ' ` and that be the last you see of the decease ' ` that be the last i saw of he ' reply lord brockelsby he seem to hesitate for a moment or two as if in thought whether he should speak or not and then to suddenly make up he mind to speak for he add : ' i stay in town the whole of that day and only drive back to brockelsby late in the evening i have some business to transact and put up at the grand as i usually do and dine with some friend ' ` would you tell we at what time you return to brockelsby castle ' ' i think it must have be about eleven o'clock it be a seven-mile drive from here ' ' i believe ' say the coroner after a slight pause during which the attention of all the spectator be rivet upon the handsome figure of the young man as he stand in the witness-box the very personification of a high-bred gentleman ' i believe that i be right in state that there be a unfortunate legal dispute between you lordship and you brother ' ` that be so ' the coroner stroke he chin thoughtfully for a moment or two then he add : ` in the event of the decease 's claim to the joint title and revenue of de genneville be hold good in the court of law there would be a great importance would there not attach to he marriage which be to have take place on the 15th ' ` in that event there certainly would be ' ` be the jury to understand then that you and the deceased part on amicable term after you interview with he in the morning ' the earl of brockelsby hesitate again for a minute or two while the crowd and the jury hang breathless on he lip ` there be no enmity between we ' he reply at last ` from which we may gather that there may have be -- shall i say -- a slight disagreement at that interview ' ` my brother have unfortunately be mislead by the misrepresentation or perhaps the too optimistic view of he lawyer he have be drag into litigation on the strength of a old family document which he have never see which moreover be antiquated and owe to certain wording in it invalid i think that it would be kinder and more considerate if i be to let my brother judge of the document for himself i know that when he have see it he would be convince of the absolutely futile basis of he claim and that it would be a terrible disappointment to he that be the reason why i wish to see he myself about it rather than to do it through the more formal -- perhaps more correct -- medium of we respective lawyer i place the fact before he with on my part a perfectly amicable spirit ' the young earl of brockelsby have make this somewhat lengthy perfectly voluntary explanation of the state of affair in a calm quiet voice with much dignity and perfect simplicity but the coroner do not seem impressed by it for he ask very drily : ` do you part good friend ' ` on my side absolutely so ' ` but not on he ' insist the coroner ' i think he feel naturally annoyed that he have be so ill-advised by he solicitor ' ` and you make no attempt later on in the day to adjust any ill-feeling that may have exist between you and he ' ask the coroner mark with strange earnest emphasis every word he utter ` if you mean do i go and see my brother again that day -- no i do not ' ` and you lordship can give we no further information which might throw some light upon the mystery which surround the hon robert de genneville 's death ' still persist the coroner ' i be sorry to say i can not ' reply the earl of brockelsby with firm decision the coroner still look puzzle and thoughtful it seem at first as if he wish to press he point further every one feel that some deep import have lie behind he examination of the witness and all be on tenter-hook as to what the next evidence might bring forth the earl of brockelsby have wait a minute or two then at a sign from the coroner have leave the witness-box in order to have a talk with he solicitor at first he pay no attention to the deposition of the cashier and hall porter of the castle hotel but gradually it seem to strike he that curious statement be be make by these witness and a frown of anxious wonder settle between he brow whilst he young face lose some of its florid hue mr tremlett the cashier at the hotel have be hold the attention of the court he state that the hon robert ingram de genneville have arrive at the hotel at eight o'clock on the morning of the 13th he have the room which he usually occupy when he come to the ` castle ' namely no 21 and he go up to it immediately on he arrival order some breakfast to be bring up to he at eleven o'clock the earl of brockelsby call to see he brother and remain with he until about twelve in the afternoon deceased go out and return for he dinner at seven o'clock in company with a gentleman whom the cashier know well by sight mr timothy beddingfield the lawyer of paradise street the gentleman have they dinner downstairs and after that they go up to the hon mr de genneville 's room for coffee and cigar ' i could not say at what time mr beddingfield leave ' continue the cashier ` but i rather fancy i see he in the hall at about 915 pm he be wear a inverness cape over he dress clothes and a glengarry cap it be just at the hour when the visitor who have come down for the night from london be arrive thick and fast the hall be very full and there be a large party of american monopolise most of we _ personnel _ so i could not swear positively whether i do see mr beddingfield or not then though i be quite sure that it be mr timothy beddingfield who dine and spend the evening with the hon mr de genneville as i know he quite well by sight at ten o'clock i be off duty and the night porter remain alone in the hall ' mr tremlett 's evidence be corroborate in most respects by a waiter and by the hall porter they have both see the deceased come in at seven o'clock in company with a gentleman and they description of the latter coincide with that of the appearance of mr timothy beddingfield whom however they do not actually know at this point of the proceedings the foreman of the jury wish to know why mr timothy beddingfield 's evidence have not be obtain and be inform by the detective-inspector in charge of the case that that gentleman have seemingly leave birmingham but be expect home shortly the coroner suggest a adjournment pend mr beddingfield 's appearance but at the earnest request of the detective he consent to hear the evidence of peter tyrrell the night porter at the castle hotel who if you remember the case at all succeed in create the biggest sensation of any which have be make through this extraordinary and weirdly gruesome case ` it be the first time i have be on duty at the castle he say ` for i use to be night porter at bright 's in wolverhampton but just after i have come on duty at ten o'clock a gentleman come and ask if he could see the hon robert de genneville i say that i think he be in but would send up and see the gentleman say : it do not matter do not trouble i know he room twenty-one be not it and up he go before i could say another word ' ` do he give you any name ' ask the coroner ` no sir ' ` what be he like ' ' a young gentleman sir as far as i can remember in a inverness cape and glengarry cap but i could not see he face very well as he stand with he back to the light and the cap shaded he eye and he only speak to I for a minute ' ` look all round you ' say the coroner quietly ` be there any one in this court at all like the gentleman you speak of ' a awed hush fall over the many spectator there present as peter tyrrell the night porter of the castle hotel turn he head towards the body of the court and slowly scan the many face there present for a moment he seem to hesitate -- only for a moment though then as if vaguely conscious of the terrible importance he next word might have he shake he head gravely and say : ' i would not like to swear ' the coroner try to press he but with true british stolidity he repeat : ' i would not like to say ' ` well then what happen ' ask the coroner who have perforce to abandon he point ` the gentleman go upstairs sir and about a quarter of a hour later he come down again and i let he out he be in a great hurry then he throw I a half-crown and say : good night ' ` and though you see he again then you can not tell we if you would know he again ' once more the hall porter 's eye wander as if instinctively to a certain face in the court once more he hesitate for many seconds which seem like so many hour during which a man 's honor a man 's life hang perhaps in the balance then peter tyrrell repeat slowly : ' i would not swear ' but coroner and jury alike aye and every spectator in that crowded court have see that the man 's eye have rest during that one moment of hesitation upon the face of the earl of brockelsby chapter xxxiii the living and the dead the man in the corner blink across at polly with he funny mild blue eye no wonder you be puzzle he continue so be everybody in the court that day every one save myself i alone could see in my mind 's eye that gruesome murder such as it have be commit with all its detail and above all its motive and such as you will see it presently when i place it all clearly before you but before you see daylight in this strange case i must plunge you into further darkness in the same manner as the coroner and jury be plunge on the follow day the second day of that remarkable inquest it have to be adjourn since the appearance of mr timothy beddingfield have now become of vital importance the public have come to regard he absence from birmingham at this critical moment as decidedly remarkable to say the least of it and all those who do not know the lawyer by sight wish to see he in he inverness cape and glengarry cap such as he have appear before the several witness on the night of the awful murder when the coroner and jury be seat the first piece of information which the police place before they be the astounding statement that mr timothy beddingfield 's whereabouts have not be ascertain though it be confidently expect that he have not go far and could easily be trace there be a witness present who the police think might throw some light as to the lawyer 's probable destination for obviously he have leave birmingham directly after he interview with the decease this witness be mrs higgin who be mr beddingfield 's housekeeper she state that she master be in the constant habit -- especially latterly -- of go up to london on business he usually leave by a late evening train on those occasion and mostly be only absent thirty-six hour he keep a portmanteau always ready pack for the purpose for he often leave at a few moment ' notice mr higgin add that she master stay at the great western hotel in london for it be there that she be instruct to wire if anything urgent require he presence back in birmingham ` on the night of the 14th ' she continue ` at nine o'clock or thereabout a messenger come to the door with the master 's card and say that he be instruct to fetch mr beddingfield 's portmanteau and then to meet he at the station in time to catch the 935 pm up train i give he the portmanteau of course as he have bring the card and i have no idea there could be anything wrong but since then i have hear nothing of my master and i do not know when he will return ' question by the coroner she add that mr beddingfield have never stay away quite so long without have he letter forward to he there be a large pile wait for he now she have write to the great western hotel london ask what she should do about the letter but have receive no reply she do not know the messenger by sight who have call for the portmanteau once or twice before mr beddingfield have send for he thing in that manner when he have be dine out mr beddingfield certainly wear he inverness cape over he dress clothes when he go out at about six o'clock in the afternoon he also wear a glengarry cap the messenger have so far not yet be find and from this point -- namely the send for the portmanteau -- all trace of mr timothy beddingfield seem to have be lose whether he go up to london by that 935 train or not could not be definitely ascertain the police have question at least a dozen porter at the railway as well as ticket collector but no one have any special recollection of a gentleman in a inverness cape and glengarry cap a costume worn by more than one first-class passenger on a cold night in September there be the hitch you see it all lay in this mr timothy beddingfield the lawyer have undoubtedly make himself scarce he be last see in company with the deceased and wear a inverness cape and glengarry cap two or three witness see he leave the hotel at about 915 then the messenger call at the lawyer 's house for the portmanteau after which mr timothy beddingfield seem to vanish into thin air but -- and that be a great ` but ' -- the night porter at the ` castle ' seem to have see some one wear the momentous inverness and glengarry half a hour or so later on and go up to decease 's room where he stay about a quarter of a hour undoubtedly you will say as every one say to themselves that day after the night porter and mr higgin have be hear that there be a very ugly and very black finger which point unpleasantly at mr timothy beddingfield especially as that gentleman for some reason which still require a explanation be not there to put matter right for himself but there be just one little thing -- a mere trifle perhaps -- which neither the coroner nor the jury dare to overlook though strictly speak it be not evidence you will remember that when the night porter be ask if he could among the person present in court recognize the hon robert de genneville 's belated visitor every one have notice he hesitation and mark that the man 's eye have rest doubtingly upon the face and figure of the young earl of brockelsby now if that belated visitor have be mr timothy beddingfield -- tall lean dry as dust with a bird-like beak and clean-shaven chin -- no one could for a moment have mistake he face -- even if they only see it very casually and recollect it but very dimly -- with that of young lord brockelsby who be florid and rather short -- the only point in common between they be they saxon hair you see that it be a curious point do not you add the man in the corner who now have become so excited that he finger work like long thin tentacle round and round he bit of string it weigh very heavily in favor of timothy beddingfield add to which you must also remember that as far as he be concern the hon robert de genneville be to he the goose with the golden egg the ` de genneville peerage case ' have bring beddingfield 's name in great prominence with the death of the claimant all hope of prolong the litigation come to a end there be a total lack of motive as far as beddingfield be concern not so with the earl of brockelsby say polly and i have often maintain -- what he interrupt that the earl of brockelsby change clothes with beddingfield in order more conveniently to murder he own brother where and when could the exchange of costume have be effect consider that the inverness cape and glengarry cap be in the hall of the castle hotel at 915 and at that hour and until ten o'clock lord brockelsby be at the grand hotel finish dinner with some friend that be subsequently prove remember and also that he be back at brockelsby castle which be seven mile from birmingham at eleven o'clock sharp now the visit of the individual in the glengarry occur some time after 10 pm then there be the disappearance of beddingfield say the girl musingly that certainly point very strongly to he he be a man in good practice i believe and fairly well know and have never be hear of from that day to this conclude the old scarecrow with a chuckle no wonder you be puzzle the police be quite baffled and still be for a matter of that and yet see how simple it be only the police would not look further than these two man -- lord brockelsby with a strong motive and the night porter 's hesitation against he and beddingfield without a motive but with strong circumstantial evidence and he own disappearance as condemnatory sign if only they would look at the case as i do and think a little about the dead as well as about the living if they have remember that peerage case the hon robert 's debt he last straw which prove a futile claim only that very day the earl of brockelsby have by quietly show the original ancient document to he brother persuade he how futile be all he hope who know how many be the debt contract the promise make the money borrow and obtain on the strength of that claim which be mere romance ahead nothing but ruin enmity with he brother he marriage probably break off a waste life in fact be it small wonder that though ill-feeling against the earl of brockelsby may have be deep there be hatred bitter deadly hatred against the man who with false promise have lead he into so hopeless a quagmire probably the hon robert owe a great deal of money to beddingfield which the latter hope to recoup at usurious interest with threat of scandal and what not think of all that he add and then tell I if you believe that a stronger motive for the murder of such a enemy could well be find but what you suggest be impossible say polly aghast allow I he say it be more than possible -- it be very easy and simple the two man be alone together in the hon robert de genneville 's room after dinner you as represent the public and the police say that beddingfield go away and return half a hour later in order to kill he client i say that it be the lawyer who be murder at nine o'clock that evening and that robert de genneville the ruin man the hopeless bankrupt be the assassin then -- yes of course now you remember for i have put you on the track the face and the body be so battered and bruise that they be past recognition both man be of equal height the hair which alone could not be disfigure or obliterate be in both man similar in color then the murderer proceed to dress he victim in he own clothes with the utmost care he place he own ring on the finger of the dead man he own watch in the pocket a gruesome task but a important one and it be thoroughly well do then he himself put on the clothes of he victim with finally the inverness cape and glengarry and when the hall be full of visitor he slip out unperceived he send the messenger for beddingfield 's portmanteau and start off by the night express but then he visit at the castle hotel at ten o'clock -- she urge how dangerous dangerous yes but oh how clever you see he be the earl of brockelsby 's twin brother and twin brother be always somewhat alike he wish to appear dead murder by some one he care not whom but what he do care about be to throw cloud of dust in the eye of the police and he succeed with a vengeance perhaps -- who know -- he wish to assure himself that he have forget nothing in the _ mise en scène _ that the body batter and bruise past all semblance of any human shape save for its clothes really would appear to every one as that of the hon robert de genneville while the latter disappear for ever from the old world and start life again in the new then you must always reckon with the practically invariable rule that a murderer always revisit if only once the scene of he crime two year have elapse since the crime no trace of timothy beddingfield the lawyer have ever be find and i can assure you that it will never be for he plebeian body lie bury in the aristocratic family vault of the earl of brockelsby he be go before polly could say another word the face of timothy beddingfield of the earl of brockelsby of the hon robert de genneville seem to dance before she eye and to mock she for the hopeless bewilderment in which she find herself plunge because of they then all the face vanish or rather be merge in one long thin bird-like one with bone-rimmed spectacles on the top of its beak and a wide rude grin beneath it and still puzzle still doubtful the young girl too pay for she scanty luncheon and go she way chapter xxxiv the mysterious death in percy street miss polly burton have have many a argument with mr richard frobisher about that old man in the corner who seem far more interesting and deucedly more mysterious than any of the crime over which he philosophise dick think moreover that miss polly spend more of she leisure time now in that abc shop than she have do in he own company before and tell she so with that delightful air of sheepish sulkiness which the male creature invariably wear when he feel jealous and will not admit it polly like dick to be jealous but she like that old scarecrow in the abc shop very much too and though she make sundry vague promise from time to time to mr richard frobisher she nevertheless drift back instinctively day after day to the tea-shop in norfolk street strand and stay there sip coffee for as long as the man in the corner choose to talk on this particular afternoon she go to the abc shop with a fix purpose that of make he give she he view of mr owen 's mysterious death in percy street the fact have interested and puzzle she she have have countless argument with mr richard frobisher as to the three great possible solution of the puzzle -- accident suicide murder undoubtedly neither accident nor suicide he say dryly polly be not aware that she have speak what a uncanny habit that creature have of read she thought you incline to the idea then that mr owen be murder do you know by whom he laugh and draw forth the piece of string he always fidget with when unravel some mystery you would like to know who murder that old woman he ask at last i would like to hear you view on the subject polly reply i have no view he say dryly no one can know who murder the woman since no one ever see the person who do it no one can give the faintest description of the mysterious man who alone could have commit that clever deed and the police be play a game of blind man 's buff but you must have form some theory of you own she persist it annoy she that the funny creature be obstinate about this point and she try to nettle he vanity i suppose that as a matter of fact you original remark that ` there be no such thing as mystery ' do not apply universally there be a mystery -- that of the death in percy street and you like the police be unable to fathom it he pull up he eyebrow and look at she for a minute or two confess that that murder be one of the cleverest bit of work accomplish outside russian diplomacy he say with a nervous laugh i must say that be i the judge call upon to pronounce sentence of death on the man who conceive that murder i could not bring myself to do it i would politely request the gentleman to enter we foreign office -- we have need of such man the whole _ mise en scène _ be truly artistic worthy of its _ milieu _ -- the ruben studio in percy street tottenham court road have you ever notice they they be only studio by name and be merely a set of room in a corner house with the window slightly enlarged and the rent charge accordingly in consideration of that additional five inch of smoky daylight filter through dusty window on the ground floor there be the order office of some stain glass work with a workshop in the rear and on the first floor landing a small room allot to the caretaker with gas coal and fifteen shilling a week for which princely income she be depute to keep tidy and clean the general aspect of the house mr owen who be the caretaker there be a quiet respectable woman who eke out she scanty wages by sundry -- mostly very meager -- tip dole out to she by impecunious artist in exchange for promiscuous domestic service in and about the respective studio but if mr owen 's earnings be not large they be very regular and she have no fastidious taste she and she cockatoo live on she wages and all the tip add up and never spend year after year go to swell a very comfortable little account at interest in the birkbeck bank this little account have mount up to a very tidy sum and the thrifty widow -- or old maid -- no one ever know which she be -- be generally refer to by the young artist of the ruben studio as a ` lady of means ' but this be a digression no one sleep on the premise except mr owen and she cockatoo the rule be that one by one as the tenant leave they room in the evening they take they respective key to the caretaker 's room she would then in the early morning tidy and dust the studio and the office downstairs lay the fire and carry up coal the foreman of the glass work be the first to arrive in the morning he have a latch-key and let himself in after which it be the custom of the house that he should leave the street door open for the benefit of the other tenant and they visitor usually when he come at about nine o'clock he find mr owen busy about the house do she work and he have often a brief chat with she about the weather but on this particular morning of February 2nd he neither saw nor hear she however as the shop have be tidy and the fire lay he surmise that mr owen have finish she work earlier than usual and think no more about it one by one the tenant of the studio turn up and the day speed on without any one 's attention be draw noticeably to the fact that the caretaker have not appear upon the scene it have be a bitterly cold night and the day be even worse a cut north-easterly gale be blow there have be a great deal of snow during the night which lay quite thick on the ground and at five o'clock in the afternoon when the last glimmer of the pale winter daylight have disappear the confraternity of the brush put palette and easel aside and prepare to go home the first to leave be mr charles pitt he lock up he studio and as usual take he key into the caretaker 's room he have just open the door when a icy blast literally strike he in the face both the window be wide open and the snow and sleet be beat thickly into the room form already a white carpet upon the floor the room be in semi-obscurity and at first mr pitt see nothing but instinctively realize that something be wrong he light a match and see before he the spectacle of that awful and mysterious tragedy which have ever since puzzle both police and public on the floor already half cover by the drift snow lay the body of mr owen face downward in a nightgown with foot and ankle bare and these and she hand be of a deep purple color whilst in a corner of the room huddle up with the cold the body of the cockatoo lay stark and stiff chapter xxxv suicide or murder at first there be only talk of a terrible accident the result of some inexplicable carelessness which perhaps the evidence at the inquest would help to elucidate medical assistance come too late the unfortunate woman be indeed dead freeze to death inside she own room further examination show that she have receive a severe blow at the back of the head which must have stun she and cause she to fall helpless beside the open window temperature at five degree below zero have do the rest detective inspector howell discover close to the window a wrought-iron gas bracket the height of which correspond exactly with the bruise at the back of mr owen 's head hardly however have a couple of day elapse when public curiosity be whet by a few startling headline such as the halfpenny evening papers alone know how to concoct ` the mysterious death in percy street ' ` be it suicide or murder ' ` thrilling detail -- strange development ' ` sensational arrest ' what have happen be simply this : at the inquest a few certainly very curious fact connect with mr owen 's life have come to light and this have lead to the apprehension of a young man of very respectable parentage on a charge of be concern in the tragic death of the unfortunate caretaker to begin with it happen that she life which in a ordinary way should have be very monotonous and regular seem at any rate latterly to have be more than usually chequered and excited every witness who have know she in the past concur in the statement that since October last a great change have come over the worthy and honest woman i happen to have a photo of mr owen as she be before this great change occur in she quiet and uneventful life and which lead as far as the poor soul be concern to such disastrous result here she be to the life add the funny creature place the photo before polly -- as respectable as stodgy as uninteresting as it be well possible for a member of you charming sex to be not a face you will admit to lead any youngster to temptation or to induce he to commit a crime nevertheless one day all the tenant of the ruben studio be surprised and shocked to see mr owen quiet respectable mr owen sally forth at six o'clock in the afternoon attire in a extravagant bonnet and a cloak trim with imitation astrakhan which -- slightly open in front -- display a gold locket and chain of astonishing proportion many be the comment the hint the bit of sarcasm level at the worthy woman by the frivolous confraternity of the brush the plot thicken when from that day forth a complete change come over the worthy caretaker of the ruben studio while she appear day after day before the astonished gaze of the tenant and the scandalize look of the neighbor attire in new and extravagant dress she work be hopelessly neglect and she be always ` out ' when want there be of course much talk and comment in various part of the ruben studio on the subject of mr owen 's ` dissipation ' the tenant begin to put two and two together and after a very little while the general consensus of opinion become firmly establish that the honest caretaker 's demoralisation coincide week for week almost day for day with young greenhill 's establishment in no 8 studio every one have remark that he stay much later in the evening than any one else and yet no one presume that he stay for purpose of work suspicion soon rise to certainty when mr owen and arthur greenhill be see by one of the glass workman dine together at gambium 's restaurant in tottenham court road the workman who be have a cup of tea at the counter notice particularly that when the bill be pay the money come out of mr owen 's purse the dinner have be sumptuous -- veal cutlet a cut from the joint dessert coffee and liqueur finally the pair leave the restaurant apparently very gay young greenhill smoking a choice cigar irregularity such as these be bind sooner or later to come to the ear and eye of mr allman the landlord of the ruben studio and a month after the new year without further warning he give she a week 's notice to quit he house ` mr owen do not seem the least bit upset when i give she notice ' mr allman declare in he evidence at the inquest ` on the contrary she tell I that she have ample means and have only work latterly for the sake of something to do she add that she have plenty of friend who would look after she for she have a nice little pile to leave to any one who would know how to get the right side of she ' nevertheless in spite of this cheerful interview miss bedford the tenant of no 6 studio have state that when she take she key to the caretaker 's room at 630 that afternoon she find mr owen in tear the caretaker refuse to be comfort nor would she speak of she trouble to miss bedford twenty-four hour later she be find dead the coroner 's jury return a open verdict and detective-inspector jone be charge by the police to make some inquiry about young mr greenhill whose intimacy with the unfortunate woman have be universally comment upon the detective however push he investigation as far as the birkbeck bank there he discover that after she interview with mr allman mr owen have withdraw what money she have on deposit some # 800 the result of twenty-five year ' saving and thrift but the immediate result of detective-inspector jone 's labor be that mr arthur greenhill lithographer be bring before the magistrate at bow street on the charge of be concern in the death of mr owen caretaker of the ruben studio percy street now that magisterial inquiry be one of the few interesting one which i have the misfortune to miss continue the man in the corner with a nervous shake of the shoulder but you know as well as i do how the attitude of the young prisoner impress the magistrate and police so unfavourably that with every new witness bring forward he position become more and more unfortunate yet he be a good-looking rather coarsely build young fellow with one of those awful cockney accent which literally make one jump but he look painfully nervous stammer at every word speak and repeatedly give answer entirely at random he father act as lawyer for he a rough-looking elderly man who have the appearance of a common country attorney rather than of a london solicitor the police have build up a fairly strong case against the lithographer medical evidence reveal nothing new : mr owen have die from exposure the blow at the back of the head not be sufficiently serious to cause anything but temporary disablement when the medical officer have be call in death have intervene for some time it be quite impossible to say how long whether one hour or five or twelve the appearance and state of the room when the unfortunate woman be find by mr charle pitt be again go over in minute detail mr owen 's clothes which she have worn during the day be fold neatly on a chair the key of she cupboard be in the pocket of she dress the door have be slightly ajar but both the window be wide open one of they which have the sash-line broken have be fasten up most scientifically with a piece of rope mr owen have obviously undressed preparatory to go to bed and the magistrate very naturally soon make the remark how untenable the theory of a accident must be no one in they five sens would undress with a temperature at below zero and the window wide open after these preliminary statement the cashier of the birkbeck be call and he relate the caretaker 's visit at the bank ` it be then about one o'clock ' he state ` mr owen call and present a cheque to self for # 827 the amount of she balance she seem exceedingly happy and cheerful and talk about need plenty of cash as she be go abroad to join she nephew for whom she would in future keep house i warn she about be sufficiently careful with so large a sum and parting from it injudiciously as woman of she class be very apt to do she laughingly declare that not only be she careful of it in the present but mean to be so for the far-off future for she intend to go that very day to a lawyer 's office and to make a will ' the cashier 's evidence be certainly startling in the extreme since in the widow 's room no trace of any kind be find of any money against that two of the note hand over by the bank to mr owen on that day be cash by young greenhill on the very morning of she mysterious death one be hand in by he to the west end clothier company in payment for a suit of clothes and the other he change at the post office in oxford street after that all the evidence have of necessity to be go through again on the subject of young greenhill 's intimacy with mr owen he listen to it all with a air of the most painful nervousness he cheek be positively green he lip seem dry and parched for he repeatedly pass he tongue over they and when constable e 18 depose that at 2 be on the morning of February 2nd he have see the accuse and speak to he at the corner of percy street and tottenham court road young greenhill all but faint the contention of the police be that the caretaker have be murder and rob during that night before she go to bed that young greenhill have do the murder see that he be the only person know to have be intimate with the woman and that it be moreover prove unquestionably that he be in the immediate neighborhood of the ruben studio at a extraordinarily late hour of the night he own account of himself and of that same night could certainly not be call very satisfactory mr owen be a relative of he late mother 's he declare he himself be a lithographer by trade with a good deal of time and leisure on he hand he certainly have employ some of that time in take the old woman to various place of amusement he have on more than one occasion suggest that she should give up menial work and come and live with he but unfortunately she be a great deal impose upon by she nephew a man of the name of owen who exploit the good-natured woman in every possible way and who have on more than one occasion make severe attack upon she savings at the birkbeck bank severely cross-examine by the prosecute counsel about this suppose relative of mrs owen greenhill admit that he do not know he -- have in fact never see he he know that he name be owen and that be all he chief occupation consist in sponge on the kind-hearted old woman but he only go to see she in the evening when he presumably know that she would be alone and invariably after all the tenant of the ruben studio have leave for the day i do not know whether at this point it strike you at all as it do both magistrate and counsel that there be a direct contradiction in this statement and the one make by the cashier of the birkbeck on the subject of he last conversation with mr owen ' i be go abroad to join my nephew for whom i be go to keep house ' be what the unfortunate woman have say now greenhill in spite of he nervousness and at time contradictory answer strictly adhere to he point that there be a nephew in london who come frequently to see he aunt anyway the saying of the murder woman could not be take as evidence in law mr greenhill senior put the objection add : ` there may have be two nephew ' which the magistrate and the prosecution be bind to admit with regard to the night immediately precede mr owen 's death greenhill state that he have be with she to the theater have see she home and have have some supper with she in she room before he leave she at 2 be she have of she own accord make he a present of # 10 say : ' i be a sort of aunt to you arthur and if you do not have it bill be sure to get it ' she have seem rather worry in the early part of the evening but later on she cheer up ` do she speak at all about this nephew of hers or about she money affair ask the magistrate again the young man hesitate but say ` no she do not mention either owen or she money affair ' if i remember rightly add the man in the corner for recollect i be not present the case be here adjourn but the magistrate would not grant bail greenhill be remove look more dead than alive -- though every one remark that mr greenhill senior look determine and not the least worried in the course of he examination on behalf of he son of the medical officer and one or two other witness he have very ably try to confuse they on the subject of the hour at which mr owen be last know to be alive he make a very great point of the fact that the usual morning 's work be do throughout the house when the inmate arrive be it conceivable he argue that a woman would do that kind of work overnight especially as she be go to the theater and therefore would wish to dress in she smarter clothes it certainly be a very nice point level against the prosecution who promptly retort : just as conceivable as that a woman in those circumstance of life should have do she work undress beside a open window at nine o'clock in the morning with the snow beating into the room now it seem that mr greenhill senior could produce any amount of witness who could help to prove a conclusive _ alibi _ on behalf of he son if only some time subsequent to that fatal 2 be the murder woman have be see alive by some chance passer-by however he be a able man and a earnest one and i fancy the magistrate feel some sympathy for he strenuous endeavor on he son 's behalf he grant a week 's adjournment which seem to satisfy mr greenhill completely in the meanwhile the papers have talk of and almost exhaust the subject of the mystery in percy street there have be as you no doubt know from personal experience innumerable argument on the puzzling alternative : -- accident suicide murder a week go by and then the case against young greenhill be resume of course the court be crowd it need no great penetration to remark at once that the prisoner look more hopeful and he father quite elated again a great deal of minor evidence be take and then come the turn of the defense mr greenhill call mr hall confectioner of percy street opposite the ruben studio she depose that at 8 o'clock in the morning of February 2nd while she be tidy she shop window she see the caretaker of the studio opposite as usual on she knee she head and body wrap in a shawl clean she front step she husband also see mr owen and mr hall remark to she husband how thankful she be that she own shop have tile step which do not need scrub on so cold a morning mr hall confectioner of the same address corroborate this statement and mr greenhill with absolute triumph produce a third witness mr martin of percy street who from she window on the second floor have at 730 be see the caretaker shake mat outside she front door the description this witness give of mr owen 's get-up with the shawl round she head coincide point by point with that give by mr and mr hall after that mr greenhill 's task become a easy one he son be at home have he breakfast at 8 o'clock that morning -- not only himself but he servant would testify to that the weather have be so bitter that the whole of that day arthur have not stir from he own fireside mr owen be murder after 8 be on that day since she be see alive by three people at that hour therefore he son could not have murder mr owen the police must find the criminal elsewhere or else bow to the opinion originally express by the public that mr owen have meet with a terrible untoward accident or that perhaps she may have wilfully seek she own death in that extraordinary and tragic fashion before young greenhill be finally discharge one or two witness be again examine chief among these be the foreman of the glassworks he have turn up at the ruben studio at 9 o'clock and be in business all day he aver positively that he do not specially notice any suspicious-looking individual cross the hall that day ` but ' he remark with a smile ' i do not sit and watch every one who go up and downstairs i be too busy for that the street door be always leave open any one can walk in up or down who know the way ' that there be a mystery in connection with mr owen 's death -- of that the police have remain perfectly convinced whether young greenhill hold the key of that mystery or not they have never find out to this day i could enlighten they as to the cause of the young lithographer 's anxiety at the magisterial inquiry but i assure you i do not care to do the work of the police for they why should i greenhill will never suffer from unjust suspicion he and he father alone -- besides myself -- know in what a terribly tight corner he all but find himself the young man do not reach home till nearly _ five _ o'clock that morning he last train have go he have to walk lose he way and wander about hampstead for hour think what he position would have be if the worthy confectioner of percy street have not see mr owen ` wrap up in a shawl on she knee do the front step ' moreover mr greenhill senior be a solicitor who have a small office in john street bedford row the afternoon before she death mr owen have be to that office and have there make a will by which she leave all she savings to young arthur greenhill lithographer have that will be in other than paternal hand it would have be prove in the natural course of such thing and one other link would have be add to the chain which nearly drag arthur greenhill to the gallows -- ` the link of a very strong motive ' can you wonder that the young man turn livid until such time as it be prove beyond a doubt that the murder woman be alive hour after he have reach the safe shelter of he home i see you smile when i use the word ` murder ' continue the man in the corner grow quite excited now that he be approach the _ dénouement _ of he story i know that the public after the magistrate have discharge

nephew sneak into he aunt 's room find she standing in she nightgown he demand money with threat of violence terrify she stagger knock she head against the gas bracket and fall on the floor stun while the nephew seek for she key and take possession of the # 800 you will admit that the subsequent _ mise en scène _ -- be worthy of a genius no struggle not the usual hideous accessory round a crime

house do the work which will ensure that mr owen shall not be miss at any rate for some time he dust and tidy some few hour later he even slip on he aunt 's skirt and bodice wrap he head in a shawl and boldly allow those neighbor who be astir to see what they believe to be mr owen then he go back to she room resume he normal appearance and quietly leave the house he may have be see he

broken sash-line tie up most scientifically with a piece of string she remember the talk there have be at the time about this improvise sash-line that be after young greenhill have be discharge and the question of suicide have be vote a impossibility polly remember that in the illustrated papers photograph appear of this wonderfully knotted piece of string so contrived that the weight of the frame could but tighten the knot and thus keep the window open she remember that people deduce many thing from that improvise sash-line chief among these deduction be that the murderer be a sailor -- so wonderful so complicate so numerous be the knot which secure that window-frame but polly know better in she mind 's eye she see those finger render doubly nervous by the fearful cerebral excitement
