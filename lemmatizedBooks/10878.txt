produce by judith b glad and the online distribute proofread team the mule a treatise on the breed training and use to which he may be put by harvey riley superintendent of the government corral washington dc 1867 preface there be no more useful or willing animal than the mule and perhaps there be no other animal so much abused or so little care for popular opinion of he nature have not be favorable and he have have to plod and work through life against the prejudice of the ignorant still he have be the great friend of man in war and in peace serve he well and faithfully if he could tell man what he most need it would be kind treatment we all know how much can be do to improve the condition and advance the comfort of this animal and he be a true friend of humanity who do what he can for he benefit my object in write this book be to do what i could toward work out a much need reform in the breed care and treatment of these animal let I ask that what i have say in regard to the value of kind treatment be carefully read and follow i have have thirty year ' experience in the use of this animal and during that time have make he nature a study the result of that study be that humanity as well as economy will be best serve by kindness it have indeed seem to I that the government might make a great saving every year by employ only such teamster and wagon-master as have be thoroughly instruct in the treatment and management of animal and be in every way qualify to perform they duty properly indeed it would seem only reasonable not to trust a man with a valuable team of animal or perhaps a train until he have be thoroughly instruct in they use and have receive a certificate of capacity from the quartermaster 's department if this be do it would go far to establish a system that would check that great destruction of animal life which cost the government so heavy a sum every year hr washington dc _ April 12 1867 _ note i have in another part of this work speak of the mule as be free from splint perhaps i should have say that i have never see one that have it notwithstanding the number i have have to do with there be i know person who assert that they have see mule that have it i ought to mention here also by way of correction that there be another ailment the mule do not have in common with the horse and that be quarter-crack the same cause that keep they from have quarter-crack preserve they from splint -- the want of front action a great many person insist that a mule have no marrow in the bone of he leg this be a very singular error the bone of the mule 's leg have a cavity and be as well fill with marrow as the horse 's it also vary in just the same proportion as in the horse 's leg the foot of some mule however will crack and split but in most case it be the result of bad shoe it at time occur from a lack of moisture to the foot and be see among mule use in city where there be no facility for drive they into run water every day to soften the foot and keep they moist contents best method of break value of kind treatment how to harness injure by work too young what the mule can endure color and peculiar habit mexican mule and pack the

mule ancient history of the mule table of statistics 14 portrait of celebrated mule disease common to the mule and how they should be treat chapter i how mule should be treat in break i have long have it in contemplation to write something concern the mule in the hope that it might be of benefit to those who have to deal with he as well in as out of the army and make they better acquaint with he habit and usefulness the patient plod mule be indeed a animal that have serve we well in the army and do a great amount of good for humanity during the late war he be in truth a necessity to the army and the government and perform a most important part in supply we army in the field that he will perform a equally important part in the future movement of we army be equally clear and should not be lose sight of by the government it have seem to I somewhat strange then that so little should have be write concern he and so little pain take to improve he quality i have notice in the army that those who have most to do with he be the least acquaint with he habit and take the least pain to study he disposition or to ascertain by proper means how he could be make the most useful the government might have save hundred of thousand of dollar if when the war begin there have be a proper understanding of this animal among its employee probably no animal have be the subject of more cruel and brutal treatment than the mule and it be safe to say that no animal ever perform he part better not even the horse in break the mule most person be apt to get out of patience with he i have get out of patience with he myself but patience be the great essential in break and in the use of it you will find that you get along much better the mule be a unnatural animal and hence more timid of man than the horse and yet he be tractable and capable of be teach to understand what you want he to do and when he understand what you want and have gain you confidence you will if you treat he kindly have little trouble in make he perform he duty in commence to break the mule take hold of he gently and talk to he kindly do not spring at he as if he be a tiger you be in dread of do not yell at he do not jerk he do not strike he with a club as be too often do do not get excite at he jump and kick approach and handle he the same as you would a animal already break and through kindness you will in less than a week have you mule more tractable better broken and kinder than you would in a month have you use the whip mule with very few exception be bear kicker breed they as you will the moment they be able to stand up and you put you hand on they they will kick it be indeed they natural means of defense and they resort to it through the force of instinct in commence to break they then kick be the first thing to guard against and overcome the young mule kick because he be afraid of a man he have see those intrust with they care beat and abuse the older one and be very naturally fear the same treatment as soon as a man approach he most person intrust with the care of these young and green mule have not have experience enough with they to know that this defect of kick be soonest remedy by kind treatment careful study of the animal 's nature and long experience with the animal have teach I that in break the mule whipping and harsh treatment almost invariably make he a worse kicker they certainly make he more timid and afraid of you and just as long as you fight a young mule and keep he afraid of you just so long will you be in danger of he kick you you must convince he through kindness that you be not go to hurt or punish he and the sooner you do this the sooner you be out of danger from he foot it may at time become necessary to correct the mule before he be subdue but before do so he should be well bridle or halter-broken and also use to harness he should also be make to know what you be whipping he for in harness up a mule that will kick or strike with the forefoot get a rope or as we term it in the army a lariat throw or put the noose of this over he head take care at the same time that it be do so that the noose do not choke he then get the mule on the near side of a wagon put the end of the lariat through the space between the spoke of the fore wheel then pull the end through so that you can walk back with it to the hinder wheel -lrb- take care to keep it tight -rrb- then pass it through the same and pull the mule close to the wagon in this position you can bridle and harness he without fear of be cripple in put the rope through the above place it should be put through the wheel so as to bring it as high as the mule 's breast in front and flank in the rear in make they fast in this way they frequently kick until they get over the rope or lariat hence the necessity of keep it as high up as possible if you chance upon a mule so wild that you can not handle he in this way put a noose of the lariat in the mule 's mouth and let the eye or the part where you put the end of the lariat through be so as to form another noose set this directly at the root of the mule 's ear pull it tight on he take care to keep the noose in the same place but when you get it pull tight enough let some one hold the end of the lariat and my word for it you will bridle the mule without much further trouble in hitch the mule to a wagon if he be wild or vicious keep the lariat the same as i have describe until you get he hitch up then slack it gently as nearly all mule will buck or jump stiff-legged as soon as you ease up the lariat and be careful not to pull the rope too tight when first put on as by so do you might split the mule 's mouth let I say here that i have break thousand of four and six-mule team that not one of the animal have ever have a strap of harness on when i begin with they and i have drive six-mule team for year on the frontier but i have yet to see the first team of unbroken mule that could be drive with any degree of certainty i do not mean to say that they can not be get along the road but i regard it no drive worthy of the name when a driver can not get he team to any place where he may desire to go in a reasonable time -- and this he can not do with unbroken mule with green or unbroken mule you must chase or herd they along without the whip until you get they to know that you want they to pull in a wagon when you have get they in a wagon pull they head round in the direction you want they to go then convince they by you kindness that you be not go to abuse they and in twelve day ' careful handling you will be able to drive they any way you please in bridle the young mule it be necessary to have a bit that will not injure the animal 's mouth hundred of mule belong to the government be in a measure ruin by use a bridle bit that be not much thicker than the wire use by the telegraph i do not mean by this that the bridle bit use by the government in its blind bridle be not well adapt to the purpose if properly make and properly use it be nor do i think any board of officer could have get up or devise a better harness and wagon for army purpose than those make in conformity with the decision of the board of officer that recommend the harness and wagon now use the trouble with a great many of the bit be that they be not make up to the regulation and be too thin and this bit when the animal 's head be rein up too tight as army teamster be very likely to do be sure to work a sore mouth there be few thing in break the mule that should be so carefully guard against as this for as soon as the animal get a sore mouth he can not eat well and become fretful then he can not drink well and as he mouth keep splitting up on the side he soon get so that he can not keep water in it and every swallow he attempt to take the water will spirt out of the side just above the bit as soon as the mule find that he can not drink without this trouble he very naturally push he nose into the water above where he mouth be split and drink until the want of breath force he to stop although he have not have sufficient water the animal of course throw up its head and the stupid teamster as a general thing drive the mule away from the water with he thirst about half satisfied mule with they mouth split in this way be not fit to be use in the team and the sooner they be take out and cure the better for the army and the government i have frequently see government train detain several minute block the road and throw the train into disorder in order to give a mule with a split mouth time to drink in make up team for a train i invariably leave out all mule whose mouth be not in a sound state and this i do without regard to the kind or quality of the animal but the mule 's mouth can be save from the condition i have refer to if the bit be make in a proper manner the bit should be one inch and seven-eighths round and five inch in the draw or between the ring it should also have a sweep of one quarter of a inch to the five inch long i refer now to the bit for the blind bridle with a bit of this kind it be almost impossible to injure the mule 's mouth unless he be very young and it can not be do then if the animal be handle with proper care there be another matter in regard to harness the mule which i deem worthy of notice here government teamster as a general thing like to see a mule 's head rein tightly up i confess that with all my experience i have never see the benefit there be to be derive from this i always find that the mule work better when allow to carry he head and neck in a natural position when not rein up at all he will do more work out-pull and wear out the one that be at present nearly all the government mule-team be rein up and work with a single rein this be the old virginium way of drive mule it use to be say that any negro know enough to drive mule i fear the government have too long act on that idea i never hear but one reason give for rein the head of a mule-team up tight and that be that it make the animal look better the next thing require particular attention be the harness during the war it become customary to cut the drawing-chain or as some call they the trace-chain the object of this be to bring the mule close up to he work the theory be take from the string of horse use in draw railroad car through city horse that be use for haul car in this manner be generally feed morning noon and night and be able to get out of the way of a swingle-tree should it be let down so low as to work on the brake as it do too frequently in the army besides the coupling of the car or the part they attach the horse to be two-third the height of a common-sized animal which it will be see at a glance be enough to keep the swingle-tree off he heel now the tongue of a government wagon be a very different thing in its proper condition it be about on a average height with the mule 's hock and especially during the last two year of the war it be customary to pull the mule so close up to the swingle-tree that he hock would touch it the result of hitch in this manner be that the mule be continually try to keep out of the way of the swingle-tree and finding that he can not succeed he become discourage and as soon as he do this he will lag behind and as he get sore from this continual banging he will spread he hind leg and try to avoid the blow and in do this he forget he business and become irritable this excite the teamster and in ninety-nine case out of a hundred he will beat and punish the animal cruelly expect thereby to cure he of the trouble but instead of pacify the mule he will only make he worse which should under no circumstance be do the proper course to pursue and i say so from long experience be to stop the team at once and let all the trace out to a length that will allow the swingle-tree to swing half way between the hock and the heel of the hoof in other word give he room enough to step between the collar and swingle-tree so that the swingle-tree can not touch he leg when walk at he longest stride if the above rule be follow the animal will not be apt to touch the swingle-tree indeed it will not be apt to touch he unless he be lazy and in that case the sooner you get another mule the better i say this because one lazy mule will spoil a good team invariably a lazy mule will be keep up to he work with a whip you will say but in whipping a lazy animal you keep the other in such a state of excitement that they be certain to get poor and valueless there be another advantage in have the drawing-chain work at the length i have describe it be this : the officer that form the board that recommend the drawing-chain also recommend a number of large link on one end of the chain so that it could be make longer or shorter as desire if make in conformity with the recommendation of that board of officer it can be let out so as to fit the largest size mule and can be take up to fit the shortest when i say this i mean to include such animal as be receive accord to the standard of the quartermaster-general 's department chapter ii the disadvantage of work mule that be too young a great many of the mule purchase by the government during the war be entirely too young for use this be particularly so in the west where both contractor and inspector seem anxious only to get the greatest number they could on the hand of the government without respect to age or quality i have harness or rather try to harness mule during the war that be so young and small that you could not get collar small enough to fit they as to the harness they be almost bury in it a great many of these small mule be but two year old these animal be of no use to the government for a long time indeed the inspector might just as well have give he certificate for a lot of milk cow so far as they add to we force of transportation another source of trouble have be cause through a mistaken opinion as to what a young mule could do and how he ought to be feed employer and other who have young mule under they charge during the war have as a general thing surplus forage on hand when they be in a place where nine pound of grain could be procure and fourteen of hay the full allowance be purchase the surplus result from this attract notice and many wonder why it be that the government do not reduce the forage on the mule these person do not for a moment suspect or imagine that a three year old mule have so many loose tooth in he mouth as to be hardly able to crack a grain of corn or masticate he oats another point in that case be this : at three year old a mule be in a worse condition generally than he be at any other period in life at three he be more subject to distemper sore eye and inflammation of all part of the head and body he become quite weak from not be able to eat get loose and gaunt and be at that time more subject and more apt to take contagious disease than at any other change he may go through there be but one sure way to remedy this evil do not buy three year old mule to put to work that it require a five or six year old mule to perform six three year old mule be just about as fit to travel fifteen mile per day with a army wagon load with twenty-five hundred and they forage as a boy six year of age be fit to do a man 's work during the first twelve month of the war i have charge of one hundred and six mule-team and i notice in particular that not one solitary mule as high as six year old give out on the trip that i make with the team i also notice that on most occasion the three year old give out or become so leg-weary that they could scarce walk out of the way of the swingle-tree whereas those of four and upward would be bright and brisk and able to eat they forage when they come to camp the three year old mule would lie down and not eat a bite through sheer exhaustion i also notice that nearly all the three year old mule that go to utah in 1857 freeze to death that winter while those whose age vary from four and up to ten stand the winter and come out in the spring in good work condition in August 1855 i drive a six-mule team to fort riley in kansas territory from fort leavenworth on the missourus river load with twelve sack of grain it take we thirteen day to make the trip when we reach fort riley there be not fifty mule in the train of one hundred and fifty that would have sell at public sale for thirty dollar and a great many give out on account of be too young and the want of proper treatment in the fall of 1860 i drive a six-mule team load with thirty hundred weight twenty-five day ' ration for myself and another man and twelve day ' storage for the team be allow twelve pound to each mule per day i drive this team to fort laramie in nebraska territory and from there to fort leavenworth on the missourus river i make the drive there and back in thirty-eight day and lay over two and a half day out of that the distance travel be twelve hundred and thirty-six mile after a rest of two day i start with the same team and drive to fort scott in kansas territory in five day a distance of one hundred and twenty mile i go with harney 's command and for the most part of the time have no hay and be force to subsist we animal on dry prairie grass and have a poor supply of even that notwithstanding this i do not believe that any mule in the team lose as much as ten pound of flesh each of these mule let I say be upward of five year old in 1858 i take a train of mule to camp floyd in utah forty-eight mile south of salt lake city during the march there be day and night that i could not get a drop of water for the animal the young mule three and four year old give out from sheer exhaustion while the older one keep up and have to draw the wagon along now there be many purpose to which a young mule may be put with advantage but they be altogether unfit for army purpose and the sooner the government stop use they the better when they be purchase for army use they be almost sure to be put into a train and turn over to the tender mercy of some teamster who know nothing whatever about the character of the animal and here let I say that thousand of the best mule in the army during the war be ruin and make useless to the government on account of the incompetency and ignorance of the wagon-master and teamster who have to deal with they person who own private team and horse be generally particular to know the character of the person who take care of they and to ascertain that he know he business be he a good driver be he a good groom be he careful in feed and water these be the question that be ask and if he have not these quality he will not do but a teamster in the army have none of these question put to he no he be intrust with a valuable team and expect to take proper care of it when he have not the first qualification to do so if he be ask a question at all it be merely if he have ever drive a team before if he answer in the affirmative and there be any vacancy he be employ at once though he may not know how to lead a mule by the head properly this be not alone the case with teamster i have know wagon-master who really do not know how to straighten out a six-mule team or indeed put the harness on they properly and yet the wagon-master have almost complete power over the train it will be readily see from this how much valuable property may be destroy by place incompetent man in such place wagon-master it seem to I should not be allow under any circumstance to have or take charge of a train of animal of any kind until they be thoroughly competent to handle harness and drive a six-animal team there be another matter which need essential improvement i refer now to the man who be place as superintendent over we government corral and depot for animal many of these man know little of either the horse or the mule and be almost entirely ignorant of what be necessary for transportation a superintendent should have a thorough knowledge of the character and capacity of all kind of animal necessary for a good team he should know at sight the age and weight of animal should be able to tell the most suitable place for different animal in a team and where each would be of the most service he should know all part of he wagon and harness at a glance be able to take each portion apart and put they together again each in its proper shape and place and above all he should have practical experience with all kind of animal that be use in the army this be especially necessary during war chapter iii color character and peculiarity of mule after be in command of the upper corral i be order on the 7th of September 1864 to take charge of the eastern branch wagon park washington there be at that time in the park twenty-one six-mule train each train have one hundred and fifty mule and two horse attach there be time however when we have as many as forty-two train of six-mule team with thirty man attach to each train in a year from the above date we handle upward of seventy-four thousand mule each and every one pass under my inspection and through my hand in handle this large number of animal i aim to ascertain which be the best the hardest and the most durable color for a mule i do this because great importance have be attach by many to the color of these animal indeed some of we officer have make it a distinguish feature but color i be satisfied be no criterion to judge by there be a exception to this perhaps in the cream-colored mule in most case these cream-colored mule be apt to be soft and they also lack strength this be particularly so with those that take after the mare and have mane and tail of the same color those that take after the jack generally have black stripe round they leg black mane and tail and black stripe down they back and across they shoulder and be more hardy and better animal i have frequently see man in purchase a lot of mule select those of a certain color fancy that they be the hardiest and yet the animal would be widely different in they work quality you may take a black mule black mane black hair in he ear black at the flank between the hip or thigh and black under the belly and put he alongside of a similar size mule mark as i have describe above say light or what be call mealy-colored on each of the above-mentioned part put they in the same condition and flesh of similar age and soundness and in many case the mule with the light-colored part will wear the other out it be very different with the white mule he be generally soft and can stand but little hardship i refer particularly to those that have a white skin next to the white and cream we have the iron-grey mule this color generally indicate a hardy mule we have now twelve team of iron-gray mule in the park which have be do hard work every day since July 1865 it be now January 1866 only one of these mule have become unfit for service and that one be injure by be kick by he mate all we other team have have more or less animal make unfit for service and exchange in speaking of the color of mule it must not be infer that there be no mule that be all of a color that be not hardy and capable of endurance i have have some whose color do not vary from head to foot that be capable of great endurance but in most case if keep steadily at work from the time they be three year old until they be eight or ten they generally give out in some part and become a expense instead of profit various opinion be hold as to what the mule can be make to do under the saddle many person assert that in cross the plain he can be make to perform almost equal to the horse this be true on the prairie but there he work with every advantage over the horse in 1858 i ride a mule from cedar valley forty-eight mile north of salt lake city to fort leavenworth kansa a distance of nearly fourteen hundred mile start from cedar valley on the 22d of October i reach fort leavenworth on the 31st of December at the end of the journey the animal be completely wear down in this condition i put she into fleming 's livery stable in leavenworth city and be ask if she be perfectly gentle one would suppose that in such a condition she would naturally be so i assure the hostler that she be that i have ride she nearly a year and never know she to kick that same morning when the hostler go to feed she she suddenly become vicious and kick he very severely she be then about twelve year old i have since think that when a mule get perfectly gentle he be unfit for service proprietor of omnibus stage line and city railroad have in many case try to work mule as a matter of economy but as a general thing the experiment prove a failure and they give it up and return to horse the great reason for this failure be that the person place in charge of they know nothing of they disposition and lack that experience in handle they which be so necessary to success but it must be admit that as a general thing they be not well adapt for road or city purpose no matter how much you may understand drive and handle they the mule may be make to do good service on the prairie in supply we army in tow canal boat in haul car inside of coal mine -- these be he proper place where he can jog along and take he own time patiently work of this kind would however in nearly all case break down the spirit of the horse and render he useless in a very short time i have see it assert that there be mule that have be know to trot in harness in three minute in all my experience i have never see any thing of the kind and do not believe the mule ever exist that could do it it be a remarkably good road horse that will do this and i have never yet see a mule that could compare for speed with a good roadster i have drive mule single and double night and day from two to ten in a team and have handle they in every way that it be possible to handle they and have in my charge at this time two hundred of the best mule team in the world and there be not a span among they that could be force over the road in four minute it be true of the mule that he will stand more abuse more beat more strain and constant dog at he than any other animal use in a team but all the work you can get out of he over and above a ordinary day 's work you have to work as hard as he do to accomplish some curious fact have come under my knowledge as to what the mule can endure these fact also illustrate what can be do with the animal by person thoroughly acquaint with he character while on the plain i have know kiowa and camanche indian to break into we picket during the night and steal mule that have be pronounced completely break down by white man and these mule they have ride sixty and sixty-five mile of a single night how these indian manage to do this i never could tell i have repeatedly see mexican mount mule that we man have pronounced unfit for further service and ride they twenty and twenty-five mile without stop i do not mention this to show that a mexican can do more with the mule than a american he can not and yet there seem to be some sort of fellow-feeling between these mexican and the mule one seem to understand the other completely and in disposition there be very little difference and yet the mexican be so brutish in deal with animal that i never allow one of they to drive a government team for I indeed a low mexican do not seem disposed to work for a man who will not allow he full latitude in the abuse of animal _ packing mule _ -- the mexican be a better packer than the american he have have more experience and understand all its detail better than any other man some of we united state officer have try to improve on the experience of the greaser and have make what they call a improvement on the mexican pack-saddle but all the attempt at improvement have be utter failure the ranchero on the pacific side of the sierra nevada be also a good packer and he can beat the mexican lasso cattle but he be the only man in the united state who can the reason for this be that they go into that country when very young and improve on the mexican by have cattle mule and horse round they all the time and be continually catch they for the purpose of branding and mark there be in old as well as new mexico a class of mule that be know to we as spanish or mexican mule these mule be not large but for endurance they be very superior and in my opinion can not be excel i be not say too much when i assert that i have see nothing in the united state that could compare with they they can apparently stand any amount of starvation and abuse i have have three spanish mule in a train of twenty-five six-mule team and start from fort leavenworth kansa on colonel -lrb- since general -rrb- sumner 's expedition in 1857 have travel to walnut creek on the santa fe route a distance of three hundred mile in nine day and this in the month of August the usual effect of hard drive i notice show but very little on they i notice also along the march that with a halt of less than three hour feed on grass that be only tolerably thick they will fill up better and look in better condition for resume the march than one of we american mule that have rest five hour and have the same forage the breed of course have something to do with this but the animal be smaller more compact than we mule and of course it take less to fill he up it stand to reason that a mule with a body half as large as a hogshead can not satisfy he hunger in the time it would take a small one this be the secret of small mule outlast large one on the prairie it take the large one so long to find enough to eat when the grass be scanty that he have not time enough for rest and recuperation i often find they leave camp in the morning quite as hungry and discourage as they be when we halt the previous evening with the small mule it be different he get enough to eat quick and have time to rest and refresh himself the spanish or mexican mule however be better as a pack animal than for a team they be vicious hard to break and two-third of they kick in look over a book with the title of domestic animal i notice that the author mr rl allen have copy from the official report of the agricultural committee of south carolina and assert that a mule be fit for service sooner than a horse this be not true and to prove that it be not i will give what i consider to be ample proof in the first place a mule at three year old be just as much and even more of a colt than a horse be and he be as much out of condition on account of cut tooth distemper and other colt ailment as it be possible to be get a three year old mule tired and fatigued and in nine case out of ten he will get so discourage that it will be next to impossible to get he home or into camp a horse colt if able to travel at all will work he way home cheerfully but the young mule will sulk and in many instance will not move a inch while life last a honest horse will try to help himself and do all he can for you especially if you treat he kindly the mule colt will just as likely as not do all he can to make it inconvenient for you and he to show of how little service three year old mule be to the government i will give the number handle by I during part of 1864 and 1865 on the 1st of September 1864 i have charge of five thousand and eighty-two mule and during the same month i receive two thousand two hundred and ten and issue to the army of the potomac the jame and the shenandoah three thousand five hundred and seventy-one which leave we on hand on the 1st of October three thousand seven hundred and twenty-one during the month of October we receive only nine hundred and eighty and issue two thousand five hundred and thirty which leave we on hand on the 1st of November two thousand one hundred and seventy-one during November we receive two thousand one hundred and eighty-six and issue to the army one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven which leave we on hand on the 1st of December two thousand four hundred and thirty mule now mark the death during the month of September 1864 there die in the corral fifteen mule in October six die in November three and in December eight they be all two and three year old on the 1st of may 1865 we have on hand four thousand and twelve head and receive during the same month seven thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight we issue during the same month fifteen thousand five hundred and sixty-three leave we on hand on the 1st of June six thousand four hundred and eighty-seven during this month we receive seven thousand nine hundred and fifty-one and issue eleven thousand nine hundred and fifteen we mule during these month be send out to be herd and the total number of death during the time be twenty-four but two of they be over four year old now it occur to I that it would be a great saving to the government not to purchase any mule under four year old this statement of death at the corral be as nothing when compare with the number of death of young mule in the field it be in fact well establish that fully two-third of the death in the field be of young animal under three year of age this waste of animal life carry with it a expense it would be difficult to estimate but which a remedy might easily be find for now it be well know that when a mule have reach the age of four year you will have very little trouble with he so far as sickness and disease be concerned besides at the age of four he be able to work and work well and he also understand better what you want he to do the committee appoint to report on this subject say many mule have be lose by feed on cut straw and corn meal this be something entirely new to I and i be of opinion that more government mule die because they do not get enough of this straw and meal the same committee say also that in no instance have they know they to be inflict with disease other than inflammation of the intestine cause by exposure i only wish that the member of that committee could have have access to the affidavit in the quartermaster-general 's department -- they would then have satisfy themselves that thousand of government mule have die with almost every disease the horse be subject to and i do not see why they should not be liable to the same disease since they derive life and animation from the horse the mule that breed closest after the jack and be mark like he be the hardiest can stand fatigue the best and be less liable to those disease common to the horse while those which breed close after the mare and have no mark of the jack about they be liable to all of they in the beginning of this chapter i speak of the color of mule i will in close make a few more remark on that subject which may interest the reader we have now at work three dun-colored mule that be transfer to the army of the potomac in 1862 and that go through all the campaign of that army and be transfer back to we in June 1865 they have be steadily at work and yet be in good condition hardy and bright when they be turn in these mule have a black stripe across they shoulder down they back and be what be call dark-colored dun we also have the only full team that have go through all the campaign of the army of the potomac it be fit up at annapoli md in September 1861 under captain santelle aqm they be now in fine condition and equal to any thing we have in the corral the leader be very fine animal they be fourteen hand high one weigh eight hundred and the other eight hundred and forty-five pound one of the middle leader weigh nine hundred the other nine hundred and forty-seven pound and fourteen hand and a half high chapter iv disease mule be liable to -- what he can draw etc etc the committee also say that the mule be a more steady animal in he draft than the horse i think this the greatest mistake the committee have make you have only to observe the manner in which a dray or heavily-loaded wagon will toss a mule about and the way he will toss himself around on the road to be satisfy that the committee have form a erroneous opinion on that point in start with a load the mule in many case work with he foot as if they be set on a pivot and hence do not take so firm a hold of the ground as the horse do i have never yet see a mule in a dray or cart that could keep it from jolt he round in the first place he have not the power to steady a dray and in the second place they never can be teach to do it in fine they have not the formation to handle a dray or cart what then become of the idea that they be as steady in dray or team as the horse the committee also say that mule be not subject to such ailment as horse -- spavin glander ringbone and bot if i have the committee here i would show its member that every other mule in the quartermaster ' department over fifteen and a half hand high be either spavined ringboned or ill some way injure by the above-named disease the mule may not be so liable to spavin as the horse but he have ringbone just the same i can not for the life of I see how the committee could have fall into this error there be this however to be take into consideration : the mule be not of so sensitive a nature as the horse and will bear pain without show it in lameness the close observer however can easily detect it one reason why they do not show spavin and ringbone so much at the horse be because we blacksmith do not cut they heel as low as they do a horse 's and consequently that part of the foot be not make to work so hard if you believe a mule have a ringbone and yet be not lame just cut he heel down low and give he a few good pull in a muddy place and he will soon develop to you both lameness and ringbone cut he toe down and leave he heel high and he will not be apt to go lame with it the committee also say that a mr elliott of the patuxent furnace say they hardly ever have a mule die of disease this be a strange statement for the poorest team i ever see and the very worst breed stock be on the patuxent river through the southern part of maryland and at the market on washington city it be pitiable to see as you can on market day the shabby team drive by the farmer of eastern and southern maryland a more broken-hearted poverty-stricken and dejected-looking set of team can be see nowhere else the people of maryland have raise good horse it be high time they wake up to the necessity and even profit of raise a better kind of mule in regard to the draft power of mule in comparison with horse there be various opinion and yet it be one which ought to be easily settle i have test mule to the very utmost of they strength and it be very rare to find a pair that could draw thirty hundred weight a single year without be use up completely now it be well know that in the northern and western state you can find any number of pair of horse that will draw thirty-five and forty hundred weight anywhere and they will keep do it day after day and retain they condition there be one great difficulty the agricultural committee of south carolina have to contend with and it be this at the time it have the subject of the mule under consideration he be not use generally throughout the united state i can easily understand therefore that the committee obtain its knowledge from the very few person who have they and make the best report it could under the circumstance indeed i firmly believe the report be write with the intention of give correct information but it fail entirely in recommend any thing of this kind great care should be take not to lead the inexperienced astray and to give only such fact as be obtain from thorough knowledge and no man should be accept as authority in the care and treatment of animal unless he have have long experience with they and have make they a subject of study a few word more on break the mule do not fight or abuse he after you have harness he and he prove to be refractory keep you own temper slack you rein push he round backward and forward not roughly and if he will not go and do what you want tie he to a post and let he stand there a day or so without food or water take care also that he do not lie down and be careful to have a person to guard he so that he do not foul in the harness if he will not go after a day or two of this sort of treatment give he one or two more of it and my word for it he will come to he sens and do any thing you want from that time forward some person assert that the mule be a very cunning animal other assert that he be dull and stupid and can not be make to understand what you want he be i admit what may be call a tricky animal but for experiment sake just play one or two trick with he and he will show you by he action that he understand they well indeed he know a great deal more than he generally get credit for and few animal be more capable of appreciate proper treatment like many other species of animal there be scarcely two to be find of precisely the same temper and disposition if we except the single vice of kick which they will all do especially when well feed and rest and we can excuse even this vice in consideration of the fact that the mule be not a natural animal but only a invention of man some person be incline to think that when a mule be a kicker he have not be properly break i doubt if you can break a mule so that he will not kick a stranger at sight especially if he be under six year old the only way to keep a mule from kick you be to handle it a great deal when young and accustom it to the way and action of man you must through kindness convince it that you be not go to harm or abuse it and you can do that best by take hold of it in a gentle manner every time it appear to be frightened such treatment i have always find more effective than all the beating and abuse you can apply there be another fault the mule have to contend against it be the common belief among teamster and other that he have less confidence in man than the horse have and to improve this they almost invariably apply the whip the reason for this want of confidence be readily find in the fact that mule colt be never handle with that degree of kindness and care that horse colt be they be naturally more stubborn than the horse and most of those person who undertake to halter or harness they for the first time be even more stubborn in they disposition than the mule they commence to break the animal by beat he in the most unmerciful manner and that at once so excite the mule 's stubbornness that many of they in this condition would not move a inch if you be to cut they to piece and let I say here that nothing should be so much avoid in break this animal as the whip the young unbroken mule can not be make to understand what you be whipping he for it be a habit with mule driver in the army many of whom be man without feeling for a dumb animal to whip mule just to hear they whip crack and to let other hear with what dexterity they can do it it have a very bad effect on the animal and some means should be apply to stop it army teamster and stable-men seem to regard it as a virtue to be cruel to animal they soon cultivate vicious habit and a bad temper seem to grow up with they occupation it naturally follow then that in the treatment of they animal they do just what they ought not to do the government have be a very severe sufferer by this and i contend that during a war it be just as necessary to have experience and well trained teamster as it be to have harden and well trained soldier the mule be peculiar in he dislike many of they when first harness so dislike a blind bridle that they will not work in it when you find this let he stand for say a day in the blinders and then take they off and in forty-nine case out of fifty he will go at once it have be say that the mule never scare or run away this be not true he be not so apt to get frightened and run away as the horse be but any one who have have long experience with they in the army know that they will both get frightened and run away they do not however lose all they sens when they get frightened and run away as the horse do bring a mule back after he have run away and in most case he will not want to do it again a horse that have once run away however be never safe afterward indeed in all the ten of thousand of mule that i have handle i never yet find a habitual runaway they sluggish nature do not incline they to such trick if a team attempt to run away one or two of they will fall down before they have go far and this will stop the remainder attempt to put one up to the same speed you would a horse over a rough road and you will have perform wonder if he do not fall and break you bone the mule especially if large can not stand hard road and pavement he limb be too small for he body and they generally give out you will notice that all good judge of road and trot horse like to see a good strong bone in the leg this be actually necessary the mule you will notice be very deficient in leg and generally have poor muscle and many of they be what be call cat-hammed _ work condition of mule _ -- most person when they see a good fat slick mule be apt to exclaim : what a fine mule there be he take it for grant that because the animal be fat tall and heavy he must be a good work animal this however be no criterion to judge by a mule to be in good condition for work should never be any fatter than what be know as good work condition one of fourteen and a half hand high to be in good work condition should not weigh over nine hundred and fifty pound one of fifteen hand high should not weigh over one thousand pound if he do he leg will in a very short time give out and he will have to go to the hospital in work a mule with too much flesh it will produce curb spavin ringbone or crooked hock the muscle and tendon of they small leg be not capable of carry a heavy weight of body for any length of time he may not as i have say before show he blemish in lameness but it be only because he lack that fine feeling common to the horse i have singular as it may seem known mule that have be spavine curb and ringbon and yet have be work for year without exhibit lameness avoid spotted or dapple mule they be the very poorest animal you can get they can not stand hard work and once they get diseased and begin to lose strength there be no save they the mexican call they pinto or paint mule we call they calico arabian or chickasaw they have generally bad eye which get very sore during the heat and dust of summer when many of they go blind many of the snow-white mule be of the same description and about as useless mule with the white muzzle or as some term it white-nore white and with white ring round the eye be also of but little account as work mule they can stand no hardship of any kind government at least should never purchase they in purchase mule you must look well to the age form height eye size of bone and muscle and disposition for these be of more importance than he color get these right and you will have a good animal if any gentleman want to purchase a mule for the saddle let he get one breed closer after the mare than the jack they be more docile handle easier and be more tractable and will do what you want with less trouble than the other if possible also get mare mule they be much more safe and trusty under the saddle and less liable to get stubborn they be also better than a horse mule for team purpose in short if i be purchase mule for myself i would give at least fifteen dollar more for mare mule than i would for horse they be superior to the horse mule in every way one reason be that they possess all they natural faculty while you deprive the horse of he by alter the most disagreeable and unmanageable and i be go to say useless animal in the world be a stud mule they be no benefit to anybody and yet they be more troublesome than any other animal they rarely ever get fat and be always fret and it be next to impossible to keep they from break loose and get at mare besides they be exceedingly dangerous to have amongst horse they will frequently fly at the horse like a tiger and bite tear and kick he to piece i have know they to shut they eye become furious and dash over both man and beast to get at a mare it be curious also that a white mare seem to have the greatest attraction for they i have know a stud mule to take a fancy to a white mare and it seem impossible to keep he away from she mule of all kind however seem to have a peculiar fancy for white mare and horse and when this attachment be once form it be almost impossible to separate they if you want to drive a herd of five hundred mule any distance turn a white or gray mare in among they for two or three day and they will become so attach to she that you may turn they out and they will follow she anywhere just let a man lead the mare and with two man mount you can manage the whole herd almost as well as if they be in a team another way to lead mule be to put a bell on the mare 's neck the mule will listen for that bell like a lot of school child and will follow its tinkle with the same instinct another curious thing about the mule be this : you may hitch he up to-day for the first time and he may become sullen and refuse to go a step for you this may be very provoke and perhaps excite you temper but do not let it for ten chance to one if you take he out of the harness to-day and put he in again to-morrow that he will go right off and do any thing you want he it be best always to get a young mule well use to the harness before you try to work he in a team when you get he so that he be not afraid of the harness you may consider you mule two-third break i have see it assert that a team of mule be more easily handle than a team of horse it be impossible that this can be so for the reason that you never can make a mule as bridle-wise as a horse to further prove that this can not be so let any reinsman put as many mule together as there be horse in the band wagon of a show or circus and see what he can do with they there be not a driver living who can rein they with the same safety that he can a horse and for the very reason that whenever the mule find that he have the advantage of you he will keep it in spite of all you can do _ mule raise _ -- i never could understand why it be that almost every person that raise stock recommend big ugly gollip of mare for mule-breed the principle be certainly a wrong one as a little study of nature must show to produce a good well-proportioned mule you must have a good compact and serviceable mare it be just as necessary as in the cross of any other animal it certainly be more profitable to raise good animal than poor one and you can not raise good mule from bad mare no matter what the jack be you invariably see the bad mare in the flabby long-legged mule it have be hold by some of we officer that the mule be a better animal for government service because he require less care and feed than the horse and would go longer without water this again be a grave mistake the mule if properly take care of require nearly as much forage as the horse and should be groom and care for just the same i refer now to team animal such statement do a great deal of injury inasmuch as they encourage the man who have charge of animal to neglect and abuse they the teamster who hear he superior talk in this way will soon take advantage of it animal of all kind in a wild and natural state have a way of keep themselves clean if leave wild the mule would do it but when man deprive they of the privilege by tie they up and domesticate they he must assist they in the most natural way to keep themselves clean and this assistance the animal appreciate to its fullest extent _ how to handle a mule colt _ -- owner and raiser of mule should pay more attention to they habit when young and i would give they this advice : when the colt be six month old put a halter on he and let the strap hang loose let you strap be about four foot long so that it will drag on the ground the animal will soon accustom himself to this and when he have take up the end and lead he to the place where you have be accustom to feed he this will make he familiar with you and increase he confidence handle he ear at time but do not squeeze they for the ear be the most sensitive part of this animal as soon as he let you handle he ear familiarly put a loose bridle on he put it on and take it off frequently in this way you will secure the colt 's confidence and he will retain it until you need he for work speaking of the sensitiveness of the mule 's ear a scratch or the slightest injury to it will excite they stubbornness and make they afraid of you i have know a mule 's ear to be scratch by rough handling and for month afterward it be with the greatest difficulty you could bridle he nothing be more important than that you should bridle a young mule properly i have find from experience that the best way be this : stand on the near side of course take the top of the bridle in you right hand and the bit in you left pass you arm gently over he eye until that part of the arm bend he ear down then slip the bit into he mouth and at the same time let you hand be work slowly with the bearing still on he head and neck until you have arrange the head-stall it would be a saving of thousand of dollar to the government if in purchase mule it could get they all halter and bridle-broken stableman in the employ of the government will not take the trouble to halter and bridle-break they properly and i have see hundred of mule in the city of washington totally ruin by tie they up behind wagon while young and literally drag they through the street these mule have never perhaps have a halter on before i have see they while tie in this manner jump back throw themselves down and be drag on the ground until they be nearly dead and what be worse the teamster invariably seek to remedy this by beat they in most case the teamster would see they drag to death before he would give they a help hand if he know how to apply a proper remedy very likely he would not give himself the trouble to apply it i have never be able to find out how this pernicious habit of tie mule behind wagon originate but the sooner a order be issue put a stop to it the better for it be nothing less than a costly torture the mule more than any other animal want to see where he be go he can not do this at the tail of a army wagon though it be a excellent plan for he to get he head bruise or he brain knock out some person charge it as a habitual vice with the mule to pull back i have see horse contract that vice and continue it until they kill themselves but in all my experience with the mule i never see one in which it be a settled vice during the time i have charge of the receive and issue of horse to the army i have a great many horse injure seriously by this vice of pull back some of these horse become so badly injure in the spine that i have to send they to the hospital then under the charge of dr lh braley some be so badly injure that they die in fit other be cure even when the mule get he neck sore he will endure it like the ox and instead of pull back as the horse will he will come right up for the purpose of ease it they do not as some suppose do this because of they sore but because they be not sensitive like the horse _ packing mule _ -- in look over a copy of mason 's farrier or stud book by mr skinner i find it state that a mule be capable of pack six or eight hundred pound mr skinner have evidently never packed mule or he would not have make so erroneous a statement i have be in all we northern and western territory in old and new mexico where nearly all the business be do by pack animal mule and ass and i have also be among the tribe of indian border on the mexican state where they have to a great extent adopt the spanish method of packing and yet i never see a instance when a mule could be pack six or eight hundred pound indeed the people in these country would ridicule such a assertion and here i purpose to give the result of my own experience in packing together with that of several other who have long follow the business i also purpose to say something on what i consider the best mode of pack the weight suitable for each animal and the relative gain or loss that might result from this method of transportation as compare with transportation by wagon in the first place packing ought never to be resort to because it can not be do with profit where the road be good and wagon and animal be to be have in mountain over desert and plain of sand where forage be scant and water only to be have at long interval then the pack be a necessity and can be use with profit let it be understand also that in pack the spanish pack-mule as as well as saddle be the most suitable second : the spanish method of packing be above all other the most ancient the best and most economical with it the animal can carry a heavier burden with less injury to himself third : the weight to be pack under ever so favorable circumstance should never be over four hundred and fifty pound fourth : the american pack-saddle be a worthless thing and should never be use when any considerable amount of weight be require to be pack if i have previously entertain any doubt in regard to this american pack-saddle it be remove by what come under my observation three year ago while employ in the quartermaster ' depot at washington dc as superintendent of the general hospital stable we at one time receive three hundred mule on which the experiment of pack with this saddle have be try in the army of the potomac it be say this be one of general butterfield 's experiment these animal present no evidence of be pack more than once but such be the terrible condition of they back that the whole number require to be place at once under medical treatment officer of the army who know dr braley know how invariably successful he have be in the treatment of government animal and how carefully he treat they yet in spite of all he skill and with the best of shelter fifteen of these animal die from mortification of they wound and injury of the spine the remainder be a very long time in recover and when they do they back in many case be scar in such a manner as to render they unfit ever after for be use for a similar purpose the use of the american pack-saddle and lack of knowledge on the part of those in charge as to what mule be suitable for packing do this the experienced packer would have see at a glance that a large portion of these mule be utterly unfit for the business the experiment be a wretched failure but cost the government some thousand of dollar i ought to mention however that the class of mule on which this experiment be try be loose leggy animal such as i have heretofore describe as be almost unfit for any branch of government service but by all mean let the government abandon the american pack-saddle until some further improvement be make in it now as to the weight a mule can pack i have see the delaware indian with all they effect pack on mule go out on a buffalo hunt i have see the potawatamy the kickapoo the pawnee the cheyenne pi-ute sioux arapaho and indeed almost every tribe that use mule pack they to the very extent of they strength and never yet see the mule that could pack what mr skinner assert more than that i assert here that you can not find a mule that will pack even four hundred pound and keep he condition sixty day eight hundred pound mr skinner be a try weight for a horse to drag any distance what then must we think of it on the back of a mule the officer of we quartermaster ' department who have be out on the plain understand this matter perfectly any of these gentleman will tell you that there be not a pack train of fifty mule in existence that can pack on a average for forty day three hundred pound to the animal i will now give you the experience of some of the best mule packer in the country in order to show that what have be write in regard to the mule 's strength be calculate to mislead the reader in 1856 william anderson a man whom i know well pack from the city of del norte to chihuahua and durango in mexico a distance of five hundred mile or thereabout anderson and a man of the name of frank robert have charge of the pack train they have seventy-five mule and use to pack box of dry goods bale and even barrel they have two mexican driver and travel about fifteen mile a day at most though they take the very best of care of they animal now the very most it be possible for any mule in this train to get along with be two hundred and seventy-five pound more than this they do not have over twenty-five mule out of the whole number that could pack two hundred and fifty pound the average weight to the whole train be a little less than two hundred pound to make this fifteen mile a day they have to make two drive let the animal stop to feed whenever they have make seven or eight mile in 1858 this same anderson pack for the expedition send after the snake indian he train consist of some two hundred and fifty or three hundred mule they pack from cordelaine mission to wallum wallum in oregon the animal be of a very superior kind select for the purpose of pack out of a very large lot some of the very best of these mule be pack with three hundred pound but at the end of two week give out completely in 1859 this same anderson pack for a gentleman of the name of david reese living at the dalle in portland oregon he train consist of fifty mule in good average condition many of they weigh nine hundred and fifty pound and from thirteen to fourteen hand high he average packing be two hundred and fifty pound the distance be three hundred mile and it occupy forty day in go and return such be the severity of the labor that nearly two-third of the animal become poor and they back so sore as to be unfit for work this trip be make from the dalle in oregon to salmon fall on the columbium river anderson assert it as the result of he experience that in packing fifty mule a distance of three hundred mile with two hundred and fifty pound the animal will be so reduce at the end of the journey as to require at least four week to bring they into condition again this also conform with my own experience in 1857 there be start from fort laramie nebraska territory to go to fort bridger with salt a train of forty mule it be in the winter each mule be pack with one hundred and eighty pound as near as we could possibly estimate and the train be give in charge of a man of the name of donovan the weather and road be bad and the pack prove entirely too heavy donovan do all he could to get he train through but be force to leave more than two-third of it on the way at that season of the year when grass be poor and the weather bad one hundred and forty or one hundred and fifty pound be enough for any mule to pack there be also in 1857 regular pack train run from red bluff on the sacramento river in californium to yreka and curran river out of all the mule use in these train none be pack with over two hundred pound to sum up packing never should be resort to when there be any other means of transportation open it be beyond doubt the most expensive means of transportation even when the most experienced packer be employ if however it be necessary for the government to establish a system of pack it would be a great saving to import mexican accustom to the work to perform the labor and american to take charge of the train packing be a very laborious business and very few american either care about do it or have the patience necessary to it chapter v physical construction of the mule i now propose to say something on the mule 's limb and foot it will be observe that the mule have a jack 's leg from the knee down and in this part of the leg he be weak and with these he frequently have to carry a horse 's body it stand to reason then that if you feed he until he get two or three hundred pound of extra flesh on he as many person do he will break down for want of leg-strength indeed the mule be weakest where the horse be strongest he foot too be a singular formation differ very materially from those of the horse the mule 's foot grow very slow and the grain or pore of the hoof be much closer and harder than those of the horse it be not so liable however to break or crumble and yet they be not so well adapt for work on macadamize or stony road and the more flesh you put on he body after a reasonable weight the more you add to the means of he destruction observe for instance a farmer 's mule or a poor man 's mule work in the city these person with rare exception feed they mule very little grain and they be generally in low flesh and yet they last a very long time notwithstanding the rough treatment they get when you feed a mule you must adjust the proportion of he body to the strength of he limb and the kind of service he be require to perform experience have teach I that the less you feed a mule below what he will eat clean just that amount of value and life be keep out of he in relation to feed animal some person boast of have horse and mule that eat but little and be therefore easily keep now when i want to get a horse or a mule these small eater be the last one i would think of purchase in nine case out of ten you will find such animal out of condition when i find animal in the government 's possession that can not eat the amount necessary to sustain they and give they proper strength i invariably throw they out to be nurse until they will eat they ration animal to be keep in good condition and fit for proper service should eat they ten and twelve quart of grain per head per day with hay in proportion -- say twelve pound i wish here again to correct a popular error that the mule do not eat and require much less food than the horse my experience have be that a mule twelve hand high and weigh eight hundred pound will eat and indeed require just as much as a horse of similar dimension give they similar work keep then in a stable or camp they out during the winter month and the mule will eat more than the horse will or can a mule however will eat almost any thing rather than starve straw pine board the bark of tree grain sack piece of old leather do not come amiss with he when he be hungry there be many instance during the late war where a team of mule be find of a morning standing over the remains of what have the evening before be a government wagon when two or more have be keep tie to a wagon they have be know to eat each other 's tail off to the bone and yet the animal thus deprive of he caudal appendage do not evince much pain in the south many of the plantation be work with mule drive by negro the mule seem to understand and appreciate the negro and the negro have a sort of fellow-feel for the mule both be sluggish and stubborn and yet they get along well together the mule too be well suit to plantation labor and will outlast a horse at it the soil be also light and sandy and better suit to the mule 's foot a negro have not much sympathy for a work-horse and in a short time will ruin he with abuse whereas he will share he corn with the mule nor do the working of the soil on southern plantation overtax the power of the mule _ the value of harness properly _ -- in work any animal and more especially the mule it be both humane and economical to have he harness properly unless he be the animal can not perform the labor he be capable of with ease and comfort and you can not watch too closely to see that every thing work in its right place begin with the bridle and see that it do not chafe or cut he the army blind-bridle with the bit alteration attach be the very best bridle that can be use on either horse or mule be careful however that the crown-piece be not attach too tight be careful also that it do not draw the side of the animal 's mouth up into wrinkle for the bit work against these be sure to make the animal 's mouth sore the mule 's mouth be a very difficult part to heal and once it get sore he become unfit for work you bridle should be fit well to the mule 's head before you attempt to work he in it leave you bearing-line slack so as to allow the mule the privilege of learn to walk easy with harness on it be too frequently the case that the eye of mule that be work in the government 's service be injure by the blind be allow to work too close to the eye this be cause by the blind-stay be too tight or perhaps not split far enough up between the eye and ear this stay should always be split high enough up to allow the blind to stand at least one inch and a half from the eye another and even more essential part of the harness be the collar more mule be maim and even ruin altogether by improperly fitting collar than be generally believe by quartermaster it require more judgment to fit a collar properly on a mule than it do to fit any other part of the harness get you collar long enough to buckle the strap close up to the last hole then examine the bottom and see that there be room enough between the mule 's neck or wind-pipe to lay you open hand in easily this will leave a space between the collar and the mule 's neck of nearly two inch aside from the creased neck mule ' neck be nearly all alike in shape they indeed vary as little in neck as they do in foot and what i say on the collar will apply to they all the teamster have always the means in he own hand of remedy a bad fitting collar if the animal do not work easy in it if it pinch he somewhere let it remain in water over night put it on the animal wet the next morning and in a few minute it will take the exact formation of the animal 's neck see that it be properly fit above and below to the hame then the impression which the collar take in a natural form will be superior to the best mechanical skill of the best harness-maker there be another thing about collar which in my opinion be very important when you be pursue a journey with team of mule where hay and grain be scarce the animal will naturally become poor and they neck get thin and small if once the collar become too large and you have no way of exchange it for a smaller one of course you must do the next best thing you can now first take the collar off the animal lay it on a level and cut about one inch out of the center when you have do this try it on the animal again and if it still continue too large take a little more from each side of the center until you get it right in this way you can effect the remedy you need in perform a long journey the animal will if drive hard soon show you where the collar ought to be cut they generally get sore on the outer part of the shoulder and this on account of the muscle waste away teamster on the plain and in the western territory cut all the collar when start on a trip it take less time afterward to fit they to the team and to harness and unharness when you find out where the collar have injure the shoulder cut it and take out enough of the stuff to prevent the leather from touch the sore in this way the animal will soon get sound-shouldered again let the part of the leather you cut hang loose so that when you take the stuff out you may put it back and prevent any more than be actually necessary from come out see that you hame fit well for they be a matter of great importance in a mule 's draw unless you hame fit you collar well you be sure to have trouble with you harness and you mule will work badly some person think because a mule can be accustom to work with almost any thing for a harness that money be save in let he do it this be a great mistake you serve the best economy when you harness he well and make he work comfortable indeed a mule can do more work with a bad-fitting collar and harness than a man can walk with a bad-fitting boot try you hame on and draw they tight enough at the top of the mule 's neck so that they will not work or roll round they should be tight enough to fit well without pinch the neck or shoulder and in fine fit as neatly as a man 's shirt-collar do not get the bulge part of you collar down too low if you do you interfere with the machinery that propel the mule 's fore leg again if you raise it too high you at once interfere with he wind there be a exact place for the bulge of the collar and it be on the point of the mule 's shoulder some person use a pad make of sheepskin on the toe of the collar take it off for it do no good and get a piece of thick leather free from wrinkle ten or twelve inch long and seven wide slit it crosswise a inch or so from each end leave about a inch in the center fit this in in place of the pad of sheepskin and you will have a cheaper more durable and cooler neck-gear for the animal you can not keep a mule 's neck in good condition with heating and quilted pad the same be true of padded saddle i have perhaps ride as much as any other man in the service of my age and yet i never could keep a horse 's back in good condition with a padded saddle when i ride over twenty-five or thirty mile a day there be another evil which ought to be remedy i refer now to the throat-latch hundred of mule be in a measure ruin by allow the throat-latch to be work too tight a tight throat-latch invariably make he head sore besides it interfere with a part which if it be not for you would not have the mule -- he wind i have frequently know mule ' head so injure by the throat-latch that they would not allow you to bridle they or indeed touch they head and to bridle a mule with a sore head require a little more patience than nature generally supply man with let a mule 's ear alone it be very common with teamster and other when they want to harness mule to catch they by the ear put twitch on they ear even blacksmith who certainly ought to know better be in the habit of put tong and twitch in they ear when they shoe they now against all these barbarous and inhuman practice i here in the name of humanity enter my protest the animal become almost worthless by the injury cause by such practice there be extreme case in which the twitch may be resort to but it should in all case be apply to the nose and only then when all milder means have fail but there be another and much better method of handle and overcome the vice of refractory mule i refer to the lariat throw the noose over the head of the unruly mule then draw he carefully up to a wagon as if for the purpose of bridle he in case he be extremely hard to bridle or vicious throw a additional lariat or rope over he head fix it precisely as represent in the drawing by this method you can hold any mule but even this method have better be avoid unless where it be absolutely necessary it be now August 1866 we be work five hundred and fifty-eight animal from six o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night and out of this number we have not get ten sore or galled animal the reason be because we do not use a single padded saddle or collar also that the part of the harness that the heaviest strain come on be keep as smooth and pliable as it be possible for it to be look well to you drawing-chain too and see that they be keep of a even length if you collar get gummy or dirty do not scrape it with a knife wash it and preserve the smooth surface you breeching or wheel harness be also another very important part see that it do not cut and chafe the animal so as to wear the hair off or injure the skin if you get this too tight it be impossible for the animal to stretch out and walk free besides obstruct the animal 's gait however the strap will hold the collar and hame so tight to he shoulder as to make he sore on the top of he neck these strap should always be slack enough to allow the mule perfect freedom when at he best walk and now i have a few word to say on government wagon government wagon as now make can be use for other purpose besides the army the large-sized government wagon be it have be prove too heavy for four horse the smaller size one be nearer right but whenever you take a ordinary load on it -lrb- the smaller one -rrb- and have a rough country to move through it will give out it be too heavy for two horse and a light load and yet not heavy enough to carry twenty-five hundred or three thousand pound a four-horse load when the road be in any way bad they do tolerably well about city establish post and indeed anywhere where the road be good and they be not subject to much strain improvement on the government wagon have be attempt but the result have be failure the more simple you can get such wagon the better and this be why the original yet stand as the best there be however great difference in the material use and some maker make better wagon than other the six and eight-mule wagon the largest size use for road and field purpose be in my humble opinion the very best adapt to the use of we american army during the rebellion there be a great many wagon use that be not of the army pattern one of these i remember be call the wheeling wagon and use to a great extent for light work and do well on this account many person recommend they i could not and for this reason : they be too complicated and they be much too light to carry the ordinary load of a six-mule team at the end of the war it be show that the army pattern wagon have be work more have be repair less and be in better condition than any other wagon use i refer now to those make in philadelphium by wilson & child or wilson child & co they be know in the army as the wilson wagon the very best place to test the durability of a wagon be on the plain run it there one summer when there be but little wet weather where there be all kind of road to travel on and load to carry and if it stand that it will stand any thing the wagon-brake instead of the lock-chain be a great and very valuable improvement make during the war have a brake on the wagon save the time and trouble of stop at the top of every hill to lock the wheel and again at the bottom to unlock they officer of the army know how much trouble this use to cause how it use to block up the road and delay the movement of troops impatient to get ahead the lock-chain ground out the wagon tire in one spot the brake save that and it also save the animal 's neck from that bruise and chafe incident to the dead strain that be require when drag the lock wheel there be another difficulty that have be overcome by the wagon-brake in stop to lock wheel on the top of a hill you train get into disorder in most case when train be move on the road there be a space of ten or fifteen foot between the wagon each team then will naturally close up that space as it come to the place for halt to lock now about the time the first teamster get he wheel lock the one in the rear of he be dismount for the same purpose this be repeat along the train it be not difficult to see how the space must increase and irregularity follow the more wagon you have to lock with the drag-chain the further you get the team apart when you have a large body of wagon move together it naturally follow that with such a halt as this the team in the rear must make twenty-five halt or stop and start for everyone that the head team make when the teamster drive the second team get ready to lock the first or head team start up this excite the mule of the second to do the same and so all along the train this irritate the teamster and he be compel to run up and catch the wheel-mules by the head to make they stop so that he can lock he wheel in nine case out of ten he will waste time in punish he animal for what they do not understand he never think for a moment that the mule be accustom to start up when the wagon ahead of he move and suppose he be do he duty in many case when he have get he wheel lock he have so excited he mule that they would run down the hill cripple some of the man break the wagon cause a smash-up in the train and perhaps destroy the very ration and clothes on which some poor soldier 's life depend we all know what delay and disaster have result from the road be block up in this manner the brake thanks to the inventor offer a remedy for all this it also save the neck and shoulder of every animal in the train it save the foot of the wheeler it save the harness it save the lead and swing mule from be stop so quick that they cut themselves and it save the wheel at least twenty per cent those who have have wagon throw over precipice or labor and struggle in mud and water two and three hour at a time can easily understand how time and trouble could have be save if the wagon could have be lock in any way after it start over those place the best brake by all odds be that which fasten with a lever chain to the brake-bar i do not like those which attach with a rope and for the reason that the lazy teamster can sit on the saddle-mule and lock and unlock while with the chain and lever he must get off in this way he relieve the saddle-mule 's back we all know that in ride mule down steep or long hill you do much to stiffen they up and wear they out chapter vi something more about breed mule before i close this work i desire to say something more about breed mule it have long be a popular error that to get a good mule colt you must breed from large mare the average size compact mare be by all odds the superior animal to breed mule from experience have satisfy I that very large mule be about as useless for army service as very large man be for trooper you can get no great amount of service out of either one be good at destroy ration the other at lower haystack and corn-bin of all the number we have in the army i never see six of these large overgrown mule that be of much service indeed i have yet to see the value in any animal that run or rush to a overgrowth the same be true with man beast or vegetable i will get the average size of either of they and you will acknowledge the superiority the only advantage these large mare may give to the mule be in the size of the foot and bone that they may impart the heavier you can get the bone and foot the better and yet you can rarely get even this and for the reason that i have before give that the mare in nineteen case out of twenty breed close after the jack more especially in the foot and leg it make little difference how you cross mare and jack the result be almost certain to be a horse 's body a jack 's leg and foot a jack 's ear and in most case a jack 's mark nature have direct this cross for the best since the closer the mare breed after the jack the better the mule the highest marked mule and the deepest of the different color i have invariably find to be the best what be it let we inquire that make the mexican mule hardy trim robust well-marked after the jack and so serviceable it be nothing more nor less than breed from sound serviceable compact and spirited mexican or mustang mare you must in fact use the same judgment in cross these animal as you would if you want to produce a good race or trot horse we be tell in mason and skinner 's stud book that in breed mule the mare should be large barrel small limb with a moderate-sized head and a good forehead this it seem to I will strike we officer as a very novel recommendation the mule 's limb and foot be the identical part you want as large as possible as everyone that have have much to do with the animal know you rarely find a mule that have leg as large as a horse but the mule from have a horse 's body will fatten and fill up and become just as heavy as the body of a average-sized horse have then to carry this extra amount of fat and flesh on the slender leg and foot of a jackass you can easily see what the result must be no you will be perfectly safe in get you mule as large-legged as you can and by all mean let the mare you breed from have a good sound healthy block of a foot then the colt will stand some chance of inherit a portion of it it be natural that the larger you get he foot the steadier he will travel some person will tell you that these small foot be natural and be best adapt to the animal but they forget that the mule be not a natural animal only a invention of man let you mare and jack be each of the average size the jack well marked and no 1 of he kind and i will take the product and wear out any other style of breed indeed you have only to appeal to you better judgment to convince you as to what would result from put a jack seven or eight hand high to a mare of sixteen or more i have witness some curious result in mule breeding and which it may be well enough to mention here i have see frequent instance where one of the very best jack in the country have be put to mare of good quality and spirit put they to such contemptible animal seem to degrade they to destroy they natural will and temper the result be a sort of bastard mule a small-legged small-footed cowardly animal inherit all the vice of the mule and none of the horse 's virtue -- the very meanest of he kind chapter vii ancient history of the mule the mule seem to have be use by the ancient in a great variety of way but what should have prompt he production must for ever remain a mystery that they early discover he great usefulness in make long journey climb mountain and cross desert of burning and when subsistence and water be scarce and horse would have perish be well establish that he would soon recover from the severe effect of these long and try journey must also have be of great value in they eye but however much they value he for he usefulness they seem not to have have the slightest veneration for he as they have for some other animal i be lead to believe then that it be he great usefulness in cross the sandy desert that lead to he production it be a proof also that where the ass be at hand there also be the horse or the mule could not have be produce any people with sufficient knowledge to produce the mule would also have have sufficient knowledge to discover the difference between he and the horse and would have give the preference to the horse in all service except that i have just describe and yet in the early history of the world we find man of rank and even ruler use they on state and similar occasion and this when it might have be suppose that the horse be the nobler animal would have make more display the scripture tell we that absalom when he lead the rebel host against he father david ride on a mule that he ride under a oak and hang himself by the hair of he head then again we hear of the mule at the inauguration of king solomon it be but reasonable to suppose that the horse would have be use on that great occasion have he be present on the other hand it be not reasonable to suppose that the ass or any thing pertain to he be hold in high esteem by a nation that believe they be command by god through they prophet mose not to work the ox and the ass together it must be infer from this that the ass be not hold in very high esteem and that the prohibition be for the purpose of not degrade the ox he be of that family of which the perfect male be use for sacrifice the ass of course be never allow to appear on the sacred altar and yet he who come to save we fall race and open the gate of heaven and fulfil the word of the prophet ride a female of this apparently degrade race of animal when he make he triumphal march into the city of the temple of the living god list of mule receive die and shoot at the depot of washington dc from 1st February 1863 to 31st July 1866 1863 1864 1865 month

some of we mule a number of these animal perform extraordinary service in connection with the army of the potomac and the western army one of they a remarkable animal make the great circuit of sherman 's campaign and have a historical interest i propose to give you these illustration accord to they number no1 then be a very remarkable six-mule team it be fit out at berryville maryland early in the spring of 1861 under the direction of captain sawtelle a q m they be all small compact mule and i have they photograph in order to show they together the leader and swing or as some call they the middle leader have be work steadily together in the same team since December 31 1861 they have also be drive by the same driver a color man of the name of edward wesley william he be with captain sawtelle until the 1st of march 1862 be then transfer with he team to the city of washington and place under a wagon-master of the name of horn who belong to harrisburg pa wesley take good care of he team and be keep at constant work with it in washington until may 14 1862 he be then transfer with he team to a train that be order to join general mcclellan at fort monroe he then follow the fortune of the army of the potomac up the peninsula be at the siege of yorktown the battle of williamsburg and in the swamp of the chickahominy he be also in the seven day ' battle and bring up at harrison 's landing with the army of the potomac he then drive he team back to fort monroe where they be ship with the animal of the army of the potomac for washington he be set to work as soon as he reach a landing and participate in haul ammunition at the second battle of bull run he then follow the army to antietam and from that battle-field to fredericksburg where he haul ammunition during the terrible disaster under general burnside the team then belong to a train of which john dorny be wagon-master when general hooker take command of the army this team follow he through the chancellorville and chantilly fight it also follow the army of the potomac until general grant take command when the train it belong to be send to city point this bring we up to 1864 it be with the army in front of petersburg and during that winter the saddle mule be kill by the enemy 's shot while the team be go for a load of wood in short they be work every day until richmond be take in June 1865 they be transfer back to the city of washington it be now August 1866 and they be still work in the train and make one of the very best team we have i refer now to the leader and swing mule as they be the only four that be together and that follow the army of the potomac through all its campaign there be not a mule of the four that be over fourteen and a half hand high and not one that weigh over nine hundred pound this team i ought to add here have frequently be without a bite of hay or grain for four or five day and nothing to eat but what they could pick up along the road and there be instance when they have be twenty-four hour without a sup of water the experienced eye will see that they have round compact body and stand well on they foot no 2 be the leader of the team and for light work on the prairie packing or any similar work be a model mule indeed she can not be surpass she bone and muscle be full and she be not incline to run to flesh no 3 be the off-leader of the same team she be a good eater tough hardy and a good worker -- in every way a first-class mule i would advise person purchase mule to notice she form she be a little spring in the knee but this have in no way interfere with she working this be occasion by allow the heel on she fore-foot to grow out too much during and for some time after the second battle of bull run the train to which she belong be keep at very hard work the shoe that be on she at that time to use the driver 's own language be put on to stay indeed he inform I that they be on so long that he conclude they have grow to the foot and in this case as in many other for want of a little knowledge of the peculiarity of a mule 's foot and the injury that result from over-growth the animal have to suffer and be permanently injure no 4 be the off-swing or middle-leader mule she be perfectly sound of good height a good eater and a great worker she be also well adapt for packing and a tolerably good rider she ear and eye be of the very finest kind and she whole head indicate intelligence she front part be perfection itself she be also remarkably kind illustration 1 illustration 2 illustration 3 illustration 4 illustration 5 illustration 6 illustration 7 illustration 8 illustration 9 illustration 10 illustration 11 illustration 12 illustration 13 illustration 14 no 5 be the near swing mule or middle leader she be what be call a mouse-color and be the fattest mule in the team she undergo the entire campaign of the army of the potomac and be to-day without a blemish and capable of do as much work as any mule in the pack she power of endurance as well as she ability to withstand starvation and abuse be beyond description i have have mule of she build with I in train in the western territory that endure hardship and starvation to a extent almost incredible and yet they be remarkably kind when well treat and would follow I like dog and indeed try to show I how much they could endure without flinch no 6 be a off-wheel mule of ordinary quality i have to take the spotted mule from the wheel of this team as they be not equal to the work require of they and get very sore in front no 7 be a spotted or as the mexican call they a calico mule he and he mate be send to the army of the potomac about the time general grant take command of it they be work as wheel mule in the team until 1866 when this one like nearly all spot animal show he weak part by let up in he fore-foot which become contract to such a extent that the surgeon have to cut they nearly off we be compel to let he go barefoot until they grow out this be one of the spotted mule i have refer to before you never can rely on they no 8 be the mate of no 7 he bead ear and front shoulder indicate he to be of canadian stock he neck and front shoulder as you will see be faultless but on look closely at he eye you will find they to be sore and run water continually i have notice that nearly all animal in the army that be mark in this way have weak and inflamed eye a farmer should never purchase they no 9 be a swing mule that have undergo a great deal of hardship she be tolerably well form but incline to kick she be also hard to keep in good condition and unless great care be take with she she would give out in the hind foot where she now show considerable fullness when a mule 's neck lack the ordinary thickness there must be some direct cause for it and you should set about find out what it be lack of food be sometimes the cause but in my opinion crease neck very frequently so affect the passage to and from the head that the organ that should work in deposit flesh fat or muscle become deranged and the neck become weak and in a disorder state purchaser would do well to discard these creased-neck mule no 10 be a animal of a entirely different character from no 9 she be remarkably gentle and tractable of good form and great endurance and will work in any way she be fifteen hand and one inch high weigh ten hundred and fifty pound and be seven year old this celebrated animal go through all of general sherman 's campaign and be as sound and active to-day as a four-year old no 11 be one of those peculiar animal i have describe elsewhere he be all bone and belly he leg be long and of little use as leg he be five year old sixteen and a half hand high and weigh thirteen hundred and ninety pound one of he hind leg show a thorough pin he hock be all out of shape and he leg be stick into he hoof on nearly the same principle that you stick a post into the ground the reason why he pastern-joint show so straight be that the heel on the hind foot have be badly trim when shave they too have be permit to grow too long and thus he be throw into the position you now see he this mule belong to a class that be raise to a considerable extent and prize very highly in pennsylvanium in the army they be of very little use except to devour forage no 12 be what may be call a pack mule of the first class he be seven year old fifteen and a half hand high and weigh eleven hundred and fifty-six pound this animal have endure almost incredible hardship he be make for it as you will readily see he be what be call a portly mule but be not incline to run to belly unless over-fed and not work he have a remarkably kind disposition be healthy and a good feeder this animal have but one evil to contend with he off hind foot have grow too long and plainly show how much too far back it throw the pastern-joint this be in a measure the effect of bad shoe it be very rare to find a blacksmith who discover this fact until it be too late now there be nothing more easy than to ruin a mule by let he toe grow too long doctor lh braley chief veterinary surgeon of the army be now develop a plan for shoe mule which i consider the very best that have be suggest he treatment of the foot when well and how to keep it so and how to treat the foot by shoe when it become injured be the best that can be adopt no 13 be a mule that have be work in a two-mule train which have be in my charge for about a year she be previously work in a six-mule train as the off-wheel mule she be five year old rise size fifteen hand and three inch high and weigh fourteen hundred and twenty-two pound she be receive into the government service at wheeling virginium and when ship or transfer to this depot with four hundred other be but two year old rise three she be work at least a year or more too young and to this cause i attribute certain injury which i shall speak of hereafter this mule with two hundred other be transfer to the army of the potomac and go through its campaign from 1864 up to the fall of richmond she be a excellent worker and she neck head and fore shoulder be as fine as can be indeed they be a perfect development of the horse but she hip or flank joint be very deficient owe to she be work too young the muscle of the hind leg have give way and they have become crooked this be do frequently by the animal be place as a wheeler when too young and hold back under a heavy load if you want to see how quick you can ruin young mule place they in the wheel no 14 be the off-wheel mule of a six-mule team i have this mule photograph for the purpose of show the effect of hitch animal so short to the team that the swingle-tree will strike or rest on they hock i refer to this great evil in another place this mule be but six year old sixteen hand high and weigh nearly sixteen hundred pound aside from the hock she be the best make and the best look mule in the park and be also a remarkably good worker you will notice however that the cap of she hock be so swollen and calloused by the action of the swingle-tree as to make they permanently disfigure the position i have place this mule in as relate to the wagon wheel be the proper position to put all wild green contrary or stubborn mule in when they be hard to bridle this be the severest use to which a lariat can be put on mule or horse the person use it however should be careful to see that it set well back to the shoulder of the animal i refer now to the part of the loop that be around the neck the end of the lariat should always be hold by a man and not make fast to any part of the wagon so that if the animal fall or throw himself you can slack up the lariat and save he from injury three application of the buck will conquer they so thoroughly that you will have little trouble afterwards be careful to keep the lariat in front as high as the mule 's breast and see also that they be pull up close to the front wheel before pull it through the hind wheel disease common to the mule and how they should be treat the mule do not differ materially from the horse in the disease he be afflict with he however suffer less from they owe to lack of sensibility it may be useful here to make a few remark on the various disease he be subject to and to recommend a course of treatment which i have practice and see practiced and which i believe be the best that can be apply distemper in colt this disease be peculiar to young mule its symptom develop with soreness and swell of the gland of the throat a cough difficulty of swallow discharging at the nostril and general prostration if not properly treat it be surely fatal treatment : -- give light bran mash plenty of common salt and keep the animal in a warm and dry stable you need not clothe for the mule unlike the horse be not use to clothing if the swell under the throat show a disposition to ulcerate which it generally do do nothing to prevent it encourage the ulcer and let it come to a head gradually for this be the easiest and most natural way that the trouble which at first seem to pervade the whole system can be get rid of when the ulcer appear soft enough to lance do so and be careful to avoid the gland and vein lance through the skin in the soft spot which appear almost ready to break if the throat be at any time so swollen as to render swallow difficult give water frequently about milk warm with nourishing feed of oats corn or rye meal -- the last be the best if this treatment which be very simple be carefully carry out few animal will fail to recover catarrh or cold this disease seldom attack the mule we have have many thousand of they in camp and out of the whole number i do not recollect of a case where it either destroy or disable a single animal in fact it be a question with I whether mule will take cold when keep as the government keep they -- camp out or stand in shed where the temperature be the same as outdoors glander this be one of the most destructive of disease with which the horse family be afflict and one that have set the best veterinary skill of the world at defiance a remedy for it have yet to be discover i have deem it proper here however to carefully describe its symptom and to recommend that all animal show symptom of it be keep by themselves until they case be definitely ascertain when you have ascertain to a certainty that they be afflict with the disease destroy they as quick as possible see too that the place where they have be keep be thoroughly cleanse and sprinkle with lime for the disease be contagious and the slightest particle of virus will spread it anew farcy be but one stage of this terrible disease but be not necessarily fatal while in this stage it should however be treat with great care and caution farcy can also be convey to other by inoculation any one who have have the field for observation the author have for the last four year would become convinced that the recommendation i be about to make describe the only course to be take with this contagious disease the number of its victim under my observation be count by thousand all that can be do be to prevent if possible the disease take place and to destroy when ascertain to a certainty that the animal have contract it i would say here however that this subject will soon be thoroughly handle in a work soon to be publish by doctor braley head veterinary surgeon of the army he will undoubtedly throw some light on the subject that have not yet appear in print symptom first : -- when it appear in a natural form without the agency of contagion or inoculation dryness of the skin entire omission of insensible perspiration star of the coat sometimes slight discoloring can be observe about the forehead and lower part of the ear drowsiness want of lustre in the eye slight swell on the inside of the hind leg extend up to the bu-boa this condition of thing may continue for several day and will be follow by enlargement between the leg the inflammation incident to this may entirely subside or it may continue to enlarge and break out in ulcer on the _ lactile _ of the lymphatic which accompany the large vein in the last case it have appear in the form of farcy this be the case the countenance assume a more cheerful look and the animal otherwise show sign of relief from the discharge of poisonous matter if it remain in this state death be not generally the result if the system be tone up it will sometimes heal and the animal will seem to be in a recover state of health yet from watch the symptom and general health of the animal afterwards you will be convince that the disease be only check not eradicate act in the system it only wait a favorable opportunity to act as a secondary agent in cold general debility or exposure when it will make its appearance and produce death but in the first case as show by the swell in the hind leg if the swell disappear and general debility of the system continue if the eye grow more drowsy and discharge from the lower corner and if this be follow by discharge from the nostril slight swell and harden of the sub-maxillary gland which be between the under jaw then it be clearly develop glander all the gland in the body have now become involve or poison and death must follow in the course of ten or fifteen day as the constitution of the animal may not be in a condition to combat the disease if this disease be annoy by inoculation from the _ farcy head _ of farcied animal into suppurate sore on other animal it will be very slow in its progress especially if it attack the other in a region remote from the lymphatic if in a saddle-gall it will make sore very difficult to heal if there be any such thing as check the disease in its progress it be in these three case i have observe that when it have be take in a sore mouth it have follow down the cheek to the sub-maxillary gland and end in a clear case of glander or farcy there be another form in which this disease can be take and which be of all other the most treacherous and dangerous yet never produce death without the agency of other disease -- always carry with it the germ of infection and ready to convey it to debilitated subject and cause they death the animal will still live himself and show no sign of disease further than i be about to describe in the position it be that which be take in at the nostril and attack the sub-maxillary gland which become enlarged and will remain so when these become overloaded there will be a discharge at the nose that be throw off it may be some time before any further discharge will be see from the same source in some case when the discharge be constant this can be easily distinguish from gleet or ozena from the healthy and natural appearance of the membrane of the nose which at first be pale then become fiery red or purple in gleet the discharge from the nostril as in ozena be of a very light color in glander they be first of a deep yellow then of a dirty gray -- almost slate color mule affect with glander of this kind although it may seem hard from they otherwise healthy appearance should be destroy they indeed carry with they the germ of infection and death without any visible mark in they appearance to warn those who have the care of animal against they danger teethe as mule seldom change hand to any great extent until two or three year old it be not deem necessary here to say any thing of they age until they have reach two year so as to give the inexperienced a wider scope the mule 's mouth undergo exactly the same change as the horse 's between the age of two and three these change begin to take place in the mule 's mouth the front incisor tooth two above and two below be replace by the horse for permanent tooth these tooth be larger than the other have two groove in the outer converse surface and the mark be long narrow deep and black not have attain they full growth they be somewhat lower than the other the mark in the two next nipper be nearly wear out and be also wear away in the corner nipper a mule at three year old ought to have the central permanent nipper grow the other two pair unite six grinder in each jaw above and below the first and fifth level with the other and the sixth protruding as the permanent nipper wear and continue to grow a narrow portion of the cone-shaped tooth be expose to the attrition and they look as if they have be compress this be not so however the mark of some gradually disappear as the pit be worn away at the age of three and a half or four year the next pair of nipper will be change and the mouth at that time can not be mistake the central nipper will have nearly attain they full growth and a vacuity will be leave where the second stand or they will begin to peep above the gum and the corner one will be diminish in breadth and wear down the mark become small and faint at this period also the second pair of grinder will be shed at four year the central nipper will be fully develop the sharp edge somewhat worn off and the mark shorter wider and fainter the next pair will be up but they will be small with the mark deep and extend quite across they corner nipper will be larger than the inside one yet smaller than they be and flat and nearly wear out the sixth grinder will have rise to a level with the other and the tush will begin to appear in the male animal the female seldom have they although the germ be always present in the jaw at four year and a half or between that and five the last important change take place in the mouth of the mule the corner nipper be shed and the permanent one begin to appear when the central nipper be considerably worn and the next pair be show mark of wear the tush will have protrude and will generally be a full half inch in height externally it have a rounded prominence with a groove on either side and be evidently hollow within at six year old the mark on the central nipper be wear out there will however still be a difference of color in the center of the tooth the cement fill up the hole make by the dip in of the enamel will present a browner hue than the other part of the tooth it will be surround by a edge of enamel and there will remain a little depression in the center and also a depression around the case of the enamel but the deep hole in the center of the enamel with the blacken surface it present and the elevated edge of the enamel will have disappear the mule may now be say to have a perfect mouth all the tooth be produce and fully grow what i have say above must not be take as a positive guide in all case for mule ' mouth be frequently tear twisted smash and knock into all kind of shape by cruel treatment and the inexperience to use no harsher term of those who have charge of they indeed i have know case of cruelty so severe that it be impossible to tell the age of the animal from he tooth at seven year old the mark in the way in which i have describe it be wear out in the four central nipper and be also fast wear away in the corner tooth i refer now to a natural mouth that have not be subject to injury at eight year old the mark be go from all the bottom nipper and may be say to be quite out of the mouth there be nothing remain in the bottom nipper by which the age of the mule can be positively ascertain the tush be a poor guide at any time in the life of the animal to ascertain he age by they more than any other of the tooth be most expose to the injury i have refer to from this time forward the change that take place in the tooth may be of some assistance in form a opinion but there be no mark in the tooth by which a year more or less can be positively ascertain you can ascertain almost as much from the general appearance of the animal as from a examination of the mouth the mule if he be long-lived have the same effect in change he general appearance from youth to old age as be show on the rest of the animal creation disease of the tooth there be few if any disease to which the mule 's tooth be subject after the permanent tooth be develop but during the time of they change i have be lead to believe that he suffer more inconvenience or at least as much as any other animal -- not so much on account of the suffering that nature inflict upon he as through the inexperience and cruelty of those who be generally intrust with he care i will here speak first of lampass the animal 's mouth be make sore and sensitive by teethe and this irritation and soreness be increase by the use of improper bit as if this be not enough resort be have to that barbarous and inhuman practice of burn out lampass this i do and always have protest against if the gum be swollen from the cutting of tooth which be about all the cause for they inflamed and enlarged appearance a light stroke of a lancet or sharp knife over the gum at a point where the tooth be force they way through and a little regard to the animal 's diet will be all that be necessary it must not be forget that at this time the animal 's mouth be too sore and sensitive to masticate hard food such as corn with the development of the tooth however the lampass will generally disappear the eye mule be remarkable for have good eye occasionally they become inflamed and sore in such case the application of cold water and the remove of the cause whether it be from chafe of the blinders force the blood to the head through the influence of badly fitting collar or any other cause know be all i can recommend in they case the tongue mule suffer much from injury to the tongue cause by the bad treatment of those who have charge of they and also from sore month produce in the same manner the best thing for this be a light decoction of white-oak bark apply with a sponge to the sore part charcoal mix in water and apply in the same manner be good any quantity of this can be use as it be not dangerous if possible give the animal nourishing gruel or bran mash and above all keep the bit out of the mouth until it be perfectly heal poll-evil this be a disease the mule more than all other animal be subject to this be more particularly so with those bring into the service of the government unbroken it will be very easily see that the necessary course of training halter-breaking & c will expose they to many of the cause of this disease aside from this the inhuman treatment of teamster and other who have charge of they frequently produce it in its worst form it begin with a ulcer or sore at the junction where the head and neck join and from its position more than any other cause be very difficult to heal the first thing to be do when the swell appear be to use hot fomentation if these be not at hand use cold water frequently keep the bridle and halter from the part in case inflammation can not be abate and ulceration take place the only means to effect a cure with safety and certainty be by the use of the seton this should be apply only by a hand well skilled in the use of it the person should also well understand the anatomy of the part as injury commit with the seton-needle in those part be often more serious and more difficult of cure than the disease cause by the first injury fistula this be a disease the mule be more subject to than any other animal in government use and this on account of he be use as a beast of burden by almost all nation and class of people and because he be the worst care for fistula be the result of a bruise some animal have be know to produce it by roll on stone and other hard substance it generally make its appearance first in the way of a rise or swell where the saddle have be allow to press too hard on the withers and especially when the animal have high and lean one as the animal become reduce in flesh the withers as a matter of course be more expose and appear higher on account of the muscle waste from each side of the back-bone this under the saddle can be remedy to a great extent by add a additional fold to the saddle blanket or in make the pad of the saddle high enough to keep it from the withers in pack with the pack-saddle this be more difficult as the weight be generally a dead heavy substance and as the animal step low or high the pack do the same much however might be do by care in packing to prevent injury to the withers and bruise of the back-bone when the withers begin to swell and inflammation set in or a tumor begin to form the whole may be drive away and the fistula scatter or avoid by frequent or almost constant application of cold water -- the same as be recommend in poll-evil but if in despite of this the swell should continue or become larger warm fomentation poultice and stimulate embrocation should be apply in order to bring the protuberance to its full formation as soon as possible when full a seton should be pass by a skillful hand from the top to the bottom of the tumor so that all the pus may have free access of escape the incision should be keep free until all the matter have escape and the wound show sign of healing the after treatment must be similar to that recommend in the case of poll-evil the above treatment if properly administer will in nearly all case of _ fistula _ effect a cure collar-gall sore neck saddle-gall and stilfast be a species of injury and sore which be in many case very difficult of cure especially saddle-gall on mule that have to be ridden every day one of the best remedy for saddle gall be to heighten the saddle up as much as possible and bathe the back with cold water as often as a opportunity afford in many case this will drive the fever away and scatter the trouble that be about to take place this however do not always scatter for the trouble will often continue a root form in the center of what we call the saddle-gall the edge of this will be clear and the stilfast hold only by the root i have have many case of this kind occur with the mule both on he back and neck mostly cause on the latter part by the collar be too loose and i have find but one way to effectually cure they some person advise cut which i think be too tedious and painful to the animal my advice be to take a pair of pincers or forceps of any kind and pull it out this do bathe frequently with cold water and keep the collar or saddle as much free of the sore as possible this will do more towards relieve the animal and healing the injury than all the medicine you can give a little soothing oil or grease free from salt may be rub lightly on the part as they begin to heal this be a very simple but effective remedy thrush this be another trouble with which the mule be afflict cut away the part of the frog that seem to be destroy clean the part well with castile-soap and apply muriatic acid if you have not this at hand a little tar mix with salt and place on oakum or tow and apply will do nearly as well apply this every day keep the part well dress and the foot accord to direction in shoeing and the trouble will soon disappear chest founder mule be not subject to this disease some person assert that they be but it be a mistake these person mistake for founder in the chest what be nothing more than a case of contraction of the foot i have repeatedly see veterinary surgeon connect with the army on be ask what be the trouble with a mule look wise and declare the complaint chest founder swell of the shoulder & c i be incline to put some faith in the wisdom of these gentleman until doctor braley chief veterinary surgeon of the department of washington produce the most convincing proof that it be almost a impossibility for these animal to become injure in the shoulder when mule become sore in front look well to they foot and in nine case out of ten you will find the cause of the trouble there in very many case a good practical shoer can remove the trouble by proper pare and shoe bleed it be always a subject of inquiry with I who originate the system of bleeding and why it be that all kind of doctor and physician persist in take the stream of life itself from the system in order to preserve life in the case of general washington which i copy from the _ independent chronicle _ of boston January 6 1800 the editor use jame craik physician and elisha c dick physician as authority state that a bleeder be procure in the neighborhood who take from the general 's arm from twelve to fourteen ounce of blood in the morning and in the afternoon of the same day be bleed copiously twice more than that it be agree upon by these same enlighten doctor to try the result of another blood-letting by which thirty two ounce more be draw and wonderful as it may seem to the intelligent mind at this day they state that all this be do without the slightest alleviation of the disease the world have become more wise now and experience have show how ridiculous this system of bleeding be what be true in regard to the human system be also true in regard to the animal there be some extreme case in which i have no doubt moderate bleed might render relief but these case be so few that it should only be suffer to be do by a experienced careful and skillful person my advice be avoid it in all case where you can colic the mule be quite subject to this complaint it be what be commonly know as belly-ache over dose of cold water will produce it there be nothing however so likely to produce it in the mule as change of grain musty corn will also produce it and should never be give to animal i recollect in 1856 when i be in new mexico at fort union we have several mule die from eat what be term spanish or mexican corn a small blue and purplish grain it be exceedingly hard and flinty and in fact more like buckshot than grain we feed about four quart of this to the mule at the first feed the result be they swell up begin to pant look round at they side sweat above the eye and at the flank then they commence to roll spring up suddenly lie down again roll and try to lie on they back then they would spring up and after stand a few seconds fall down and groan and pant at length they would resign themselves to what they apparently know to be they fate and die and yet singular as it may seem the animal could be accustom to this grain by judicious feeding at first we do not know at that time what to give the animal to relieve or cure he and the government lose hundred of valuable animal through we want of knowledge whenever these violent case appear get some common soap make a strong suds and drench the mule with it i have find in every case where i use it that the mule get well it be the alkali in the soap that neutralize the gas there be another good receipt and it be generally to be find in camp take two ounce of saleratus put it into a pint of water shake well and then drench with the same above all thing keep whisky and other stimulant away as they only serve to aggravate the disease physicking this be another of those imaginary cure resort to by person have charge of mule very many of these person honestly believe that it be necessary to clean the animal out every spring with large dose of poisonous and other truck this they say ought to be give to loosen the hide soften the hair & c in my opinion it do very little good if he dung get dry and he hair hard and crispy give he bran mash mixed with he grain and a teaspoonful of salt at each feed if there be grass let he graze a few hour every day this will do more towards soften he coat and loosen he bowels than any thing else when real disease make its appearance it be time to use medicine but they should be apply by some one who thoroughly understand they stringhalt this sometimes occur in the mule it be a sudden nervous quick jerk of either or both of the hind leg in the mule it frequently show but little after be work a hour or so it be what i regard as unsoundness and a mule badly affect with it be generally of but little use it be often the result of strain cause by back pull and twist and heavy fall you can detect it in its slightest form by turn the animal short around to the right or to the left turn he in the track he stand in as near as possible and then back he if he have it one of these three way will develop its symptom there be a great many opinion as to the soundness or unsoundness of a animal afflict with this complaint if i have now a good animal afflict with it the pain cause to my feeling by look at it would be a serious drawback cramp i have now under my charge several mule that be subject to this complaint it do not really injure they for service but it be very disagreeable to those have they in charge it frequently require from half a hour to two hour to get they rub so as the blood get to its proper circulation and to get they to walk without drag they leg in case where they be attack violently they will appear to lose all use of they leg i have know case when a sudden stroke with a light piece of board so as to cause a surprise would drive it away in other case sudden application of the whip would have the same effect spavin it be generally believe that the mule do not inherit this disease but this be not altogether true small compact mule breed after the jack be indeed not subject to it on the contrary large mule breed from large coarse mare be very frequently afflict with it the author have under he charge at the present time quite a number of those kind of mule in which this disease be visible at time when work hard they be sore and lame the only thing to be recommend in this case be careful treatment and as much rest at interval as it be possible to give they hand rubbing and application of stimulant liniment or tincture of arnica be about all that can be do the old method of firing and blister only put the animal to torture and the owner to expense a cure can never be effect through it and therefore should never be try ringbone these appear on the same kind of large bony mule as refer to in case of spavin and be incurable they can however be relieve by the same process as recommend in spavin relief can also be afford by let the heel of the affected foot grow down to considerable length or shoe with a high-heeled shoe and thus take the weight or strain off the injured part the only way to make the best use or a animal afflict with this disease be to abandon experiment to effect a cure as they will only be attend with expense and disappointment mange mule be subject to this disease when keep in large number as in the army this be peculiarly a cuticle disease like the itch in the human system and yield to the same course of treatment a mixture of sulphur and hog 's lard one pint of the latter to two of the former rub the animal all over then cover with a blanket after stand two day wash he clean with soft-soap and water after this process have be go through keep the animal blanket for a few day as he will be liable to take cold feed with bran mash plenty of common salt and water this will relieve the bowels all that be necessary and can scarcely fail of effect a cure another method but not so certain in its effect be to make a decoction of tobacco say about one pound of the stem to two gallon of water boil until the strength be extract from the weed and when cool enough bathe the mule well with it from head to foot let he dry off and do not curry he for a day or two then curry he well and if the itch appear again repeat the bathing two or three time and it will produce a cure the same treatment will apply in case of louse which frequently occur where mule be keep in large number mercury should never be use in any form internally or externally on a animal so much expose as the mule grease-heel clean the part well with castile-soap and warm water as soon as you have discover the disease stop wet the leg as that only aggravate it and use ointment make from the follow substance : powdered charcoal two ounce lard or tallow four ounce sulphur two ounce mix they well together then rub the ointment in well with you hand on the affected part if the above be not at hand get gunpowder some lard or tallow in equal part and apply in the same manner if the animal be poor and he system need tone up give he plenty of nourishing food with bran mash mixed plentifully with the grain add a teaspoonful of salt two or three time a day as it will aid in keep the bowels open if the stable bottom or floor or yard be filthy see that they be properly clean as filthiness be one of the cause of this disease the same treatment will apply to scratch as they be the same disease in a different form to avoid scratch and grease-heel during the winter or indeed at any other season the hair on the mule 's heel should never be cut nor should the mud in winter season be wash off but allow to dry on the animal 's leg and then rub off with hay or straw this wash and cut the hair off the leg leave they without any protection and be in many case the cause of grease-heel and scratch shoe shoe and the foot the foot its disease and how to shoe it properly be a subject much discuss among horseman nearly every farrier and blacksmith have a way of he own for cure diseased foot and shoe no matter how absurd it may be he will insist that it have merit superior to all other and it would be next to impossible to convince he of he error skillful veterinarian now understand perfectly all the disease peculiar to the foot and the means of effect a cure they understand also what sort of shoe be need for the foot of different animal latterly number of shoe have be invent and patent all profess to be exactly what be want to relieve and cure diseased foot of all kind one man have a shoe he call _ concave _ and say it will cure contraction corn thrush quarter-crack toe-crack & c & c but when you come to examine it closely you will find it nothing more than a nicely dress piece of iron make almost in the shape of a half moon after a fair trial however it will be find of no more virtue in cure disease or relieve the animal than the ordinary shoe use by a country smithy another inventive genius spring up and assert that he have discover a shoe that will cure all sort of diseased foot and bring at least a bushel basket full of letter from person he declare to be interested in the horse confirm what he have say of the virtue of he shoe but a short trial of this wonderful shoe only go to show how little these person understand the whole subject and how easy a matter it be to procure letter recommend what they have invent another have a specific method for shoe which be to cut away the toe right in the center of the foot cut away the bar on the inside of the foot cut and clean away all around on the inside of the hoof then to let the animal stand on a board floor so that he foot would be in the position a saucer would represent with one piece break out at the front and two at the back this i consider the most inhuman method in the art of shoe turn this saucer upside down and see how little pressure it would bear and you will have some idea of the cruelty of apply this specific method sometimes bar-shoes and other contrivance be use to keep the inside of the foot from come down but why do this why not get at once a shoe adapt to the spreading of the foot tyrell 's shoe for this purpose be the best i have yet see we have use it in the government service for two year and experience have teach I that it have advantage that ought not to be overlook but even this shoe may be use to disadvantage by ignorant hand indeed in the hand of a blacksmith who prefer he own way some kind of foot may be just as badly injure by it as other be benefit the united state army afford the largest field for gain practical knowledge concern the disease especially of the foot with which horse and mule be afflict during the late war when so little care be give to animal in the field when they be injure in every conceivable manner and by all sort of accident the veterinary find a field for study such as have never be open before experience have teach I that common sense be one of the most essential thing in the treatment of a horse 's foot you must remember that horse ' foot differ as well as man 's and require different treatment especially in shoe you must shoe the foot accord to its peculiarity and demand not accord to any specific system of shoe give the ground surface a level bearing let the frog come to the ground and the weight of the mule rest on the frog as much as any other part of the foot if it project beyond the shoe so much the better that be what it be make for and to catch the weight on a elastic principle never under any circumstance cut it away put two nail in the shoe on each side and both forward of the quarter and one in the toe directly in front of the foot let those on the side be a inch apart then you will be sure not to cut and tear the foot let the nail and nail-hole be small for they will then aid in save the foot it will still further aid in save it by let the nail run well up into the hoof for that keep the shoe steadier on the foot the hoof be just as thick to within a inch of the top and be generally sounder and of a better substance than it be at the bottom keep the first reason for shoe apparent in you mind always -- that you only shoe you mule because he foot will not stand the road without it and whenever you can shoe he with a shoe exactly the shape of he foot some blacksmith will insist on a shoe and then cut and shape the foot to it the first or central surface of the hoof make hard by the animal 's own peculiar way of travel indicate the manner in which he should be shoe all the art in the world can not improve this for it be the model prepare by nature let the shoe be as light as possible and without calk if it can be afford as the mule always travel unsteady on they the goodenough shoe be far superior to the old calked shoe and will answer every purpose where holding be necessary it be also good in mountainous country and there be no danger of the animal calking himself with it i have carefully observe the different effect of shoe while with troops on the march i accompany the seventh infantry in 1858 in its march to cedar valley in utah a distance of fourteen hundred mile and notice that scarcely a man who wear regulation shoe have a blister on he foot while the civilian who do not be continually fall out and drop to the rear from the effect of narrow and improper shoe and boot the same be the case with the animal the foot must have something flat and broad to bear on the first care of those have charge of mule should be to see that they foot be keep in as near a natural state as possible then if all the law of nature be observe and strictly obey the animal 's foot will last as long and be as sound in he domestic state as he would be in a state of nature the most ordinary observer will soon find that the outer portion or cover of the mule 's foot possess very little animal life and have no sensibility like the hair or cover of the body indeed the foot of the horse and mule be a dense block of horn and must therefore be influence and govern by certain chemical law which control the element that come in contact with it hence it be that the foot of these animal be make to bear on the hard ground and to be wet naturally every time the horse drink drought and heat will contract and make hard and brittle the substance of which the foot be compose while on the other hand cooling and moisture will expand it and render it pliable and soft nature have provide everything necessary to preserve and protect this foot while the animal be in a natural state but when bring into domestic use it require the good sense of man whose servant he be to artificially employ those means which nature have provide to keep it perfectly healthy when then the foot be in a healthy state wet it at least twice a day and do not be content with merely throw cold water on the outside for the foot take in very little if any moisture through the wall in short it absorb moisture most through the frog and sole particularly in the region where the sole join the wall this if cover by a tight shoe close the medium and prevent the proper supply horse that be shod should be allow to stand in moist place as much as possible use clay or loam floor especially if the horse have to stand much of he time stone or brick be the next best as the foot of the animal will absorb moisture from either of these dry pine plank be the very worst because they attract moisture from the horse 's foot where animal have to stand idle much of the time keep they foot well stuff with cow manure at night that be the best and cheapest preservative of the foot that you can use advice to blacksmith let I enjoin you for humanity 's sake that when you first undertake to shoe a young animal you will not forget the value of kind treatment keep its head turn away from the glaring fire the clinking anvil & c & c let the man whom he have be accustom to the groom or owner stand at he head and talk to he kindly when you approach he for the first time let it be without those implement you be to use in he shoe speak to he gently then take up he foot if he refuse to let you do this let the person have he in charge do it a young animal will allow this with a person he be accustom to when he will repel a stranger by treat he kindly you can make he understand what be want by abuse he you will only frighten he into obstinacy when you have get the animal under perfect subjection examine the foot carefully and you will find the heel at the back part of the frog entirely free from that member which be soft and spongy when the foot be down rest on the ground grasp the heel in you strong hand press they inwards towards the frog and you will immediately find that they will yield you will then see that what yield so easily to the mere pressure of the hand will expand and spread out when the weight of the body be throw on it this should give you a idea of what you have to do in shoe that foot and you practical knowledge should stand you well in a argument with any of those learn professor who declare the foot of the mule do not expand or contract in truth it be one of its necessary condition after be a long time badly shoe nearly or all of this necessary principle of the foot will be lose you should therefore study to preserve it and here let I give you what little aid experience have enable I to do you will observe the ground surface of the foot no matter how high the arch may be to be at least half a inch wide and sometimes more than a inch with the heel spread out at the outside quarter do not cut away this important brace it be as necessary to the heel of the animal to guard he against lateral motion on which the whole of the above structure depend as the toe be to the human be curve the outside of the shoe nearly to fit the foot and you will find the inside heel a little straighter especially if the animal be narrow-breasted and the foot stand close together nature have provide this safeguard to prevent its striking the opposite leg after the shoe be prepare to fit the foot as i have before describe rasp the bottom level -- it will be find nearly so do not put a knife to the sole or the frog the sole of the foot remember be its life and the frog its defender in punch the shoe two nail-hole on a side on a foot like this be sufficient to hold on a shoe three may be use if set in they proper place without injury to the foot practice will teach you that any more nailing than this be unnecessary i have use two nail on a side on a animal with not the best of a foot and very high action and he have wear they entirely out without throw either of they off previous to punch the shoe observe the grain of the foot it will be see that the fiber of the hoof run from the top of the foot or coronary border towards the toe in most foot at a angle of about forty-five degree it will be plain then that if the nail be drive with the grain of the horn they will drive much easier and hold better and be less liable to cut and crack the fiber another benefit can be derive from this process of nail when the foot come to the ground the nail act as a brace to keep the foot from slip forward off the shoe this render that very ingenious foot destroyer the toe-clip unnecessary then in punch the shoe hold the top of the pritchell toward the heel of the shoe so as to get the hole in the shoe on a angle with the grain of the hoof punch the hole large enough so that the nail will not bind in the shoe nor require unnecessary hammering or bruise of the foot to get they up to they proper place prepare the nail well point they thin and narrow and as i have say before use as small a nail as possible when you proceed to nail on the shoe take a slight hold at the bottom so as to be sure that the nail start in the wall of the foot instead of the sole let it come out as high up as possible you need not be afraid of prick with nail set in this way as the wall of the foot be as thick until you get within half a inch of the top as it be where you set the nail nail drive in this way injure the foot less hold on longer and be stronger than when drive in any other way if you have any doubt of this test it in this manner : when you take off a old shoe to set a new one and cut the clinch -lrb- which should be do in all case -rrb- you will find the old nail and the clinch not start up and in draw the nail out you will also find the foot not slip or crack and that the horn bind the nail until it be entirely draw out indeed i have know the hole to almost close as the nail leave it set the two front nail well towards the toe so as not to be more than two inch apart when measure across the bottom of the foot let the next two divide the distance from that to the heel so as to leave from two to two and a half inch free of nail as the form of the foot may allow lastly before nail on the shoe and while it be cold on the anvil strike the surface that come next to the foot on the outside a few blow with the hammer right across the heel and see also that the outside of the heel be a shade lowest so that the animal in throw he weight upon they will spread out and not pinch in he foot end of the project gutenberg ebook of the mule by harvey riley
