produce by kevin handy dave maddock and pg distribute proofreader english literature its history and its significance for the life of the english-speaking world a text-book for school by william j long phd -lrb- heidelberg -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* to my friend c h t in gratitude for he continued help in the preparation of this book \* \* \* \* \* preface this book which present the whole splendid history of english literature from anglo-saxon time to the close of the victorian era have three specific aim the first be to create or to encourage in every student the desire to read the best book and to know literature itself rather than what have be write about literature the second be to interpret literature both personally and historically that be to show how a great book generally reflect not only the author 's life and thought but also the spirit of the age and the ideal of the nation 's history the third aim be to show by a study of each successive period how we literature have steadily develop from its first simple song and story to its present complexity in prose and poetry to carry out these aim we have introduce the follow feature : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a brief accurate summary of historical event and social condition in each period and a consideration of the ideal which stir the whole nation as in the day of elizabeth before they find expression in literature -lrb- 2 -rrb- a study of the various literary epoch in turn show what each gain from the epoch precede and how each aid in the development of a national literature -lrb- 3 -rrb- a readable biography of every important writer show how he live and work how he meet success or failure how he influence he age and how he age influence he -lrb- 4 -rrb- a study and analysis of every author 's best work and of many of the book require for college-entrance examination -lrb- 5 -rrb- selection enough -- especially from earlier writer and from writer not likely to be find in the home or school library -- to indicate the spirit of each author 's work and direction as to the best work to read and where such work may be find in inexpensive edition -lrb- 6 -rrb- a frank untechnical discussion of each great writer 's work as a whole and a critical estimate of he relative place and influence in we literature -lrb- 7 -rrb- a series of help to student and teacher at the end of each chapter include summary selection for read bibliography a list of suggestive question and a chronological table of important event in the history and literature of each period -lrb- 8 -rrb- throughout this book we have remember roger ascham 's suggestion make over three century ago and still pertinent that ` tis a poor way to make a child love study by begin with the thing which he naturally dislike we have lay emphasis upon the delight of literature we have treat book not as mere instrument of research -- which be the danger in most of we study -- but rather as instrument of enjoyment and of inspiration and by make we study as attractive as possible we have seek to encourage the student to read widely for himself to choose the best book and to form he own judgment about what we first anglo-saxon writer call the thing worthy to be remember to those who may use this book in they home or in they class room the writer venture to offer one or two friendly suggestion out of he own experience as a teacher of young people first the amount of space here give to different period and author be not a index of the relative amount of time to be spend upon the different subject thus to tell the story of spenser 's life and ideal require as much space as to tell the story of tennyson but the average class will spend its time more pleasantly and profitably with the latter poet than with the former second many author who be and ought to be include in this history need not be study in the class room a text-book be not a catechism but a storehouse in which one find what he want and some good thing beside few class will find time to study blake or newman for instance but in nearly every class there will be find one or two student who be attract by the mysticism of blake or by the profound spirituality of newman such student should be encourage to follow they own spirit and to share with they classmate the joy of they discovery and they should find in they text-book the material for they own study and read a third suggestion relate to the method of teaching literature and here it might be well to consider the word of a great poet -- that if you would know where the ripest cherry be ask the boy and the blackbird it be surprising how much a young person will get out of the _ merchant of venice _ and somehow arrive at shakespeare 's opinion of shylock and portium if we do not bother he too much with note and critical direction as to what he ought to seek and find turn a child and a donkey loose in the same field and the child head straight for the beautiful spot where brook be run and bird singing while the donkey turn as naturally to weed and thistle in we study of literature we have perhaps too much sympathy with the latter and we even insist that the child come back from he own quest of the ideal to join we in we critical companionship in read many text-book of late and in visit many class room the writer have receive the impression that we lay too much stress on second-hand criticism pass down from book to book and we set we pupil to search for figure of speech and element of style as if the great book of the world be subject to chemical analysis this seem to be a mistake for two reason : first the average young person have no natural interest in such matter and second he be unable to appreciate they he feel unconsciously with chaucer : and as for I though that my wit be lytë on bookës for to rede i I delytë indeed many mature person -lrb- include the writer of this history -rrb- be often unable to explain at first the charm or the style of a author who please they and the more profound the impression make by a book the more difficult it be to give expression to we thought and feeling to read and enjoy good book be with we as with chaucer the main thing to analyze the author 's style or explain we own enjoyment seem of secondary and small importance however that may be we state frankly we own conviction that the detailed study and analysis of a few standard work -- which be the only literary pabulum give to many young people in we school -- bear the same relation to true literature that theology bear to religion or psychology to friendship one be a more or less unwelcome mental discipline the other be the joy of life the writer venture to suggest therefore that since literature be we subject we begin and end with good book and that we stand aside while the great writer speak they own message to we pupil in study each successive period let the student begin by read the best that the age produce let he feel in he own way the power and mystery of _ beowulf _ the broad charity of shakespeare the sublimity of milton the romantic enthusiasm of scott and then when he own taste be pleased and satisfied a new one will arise -- to know something about the author the time in which he live and finally of criticism which in its simplicity be the discovery that the man and woman of other age be very much like ourselves loving as we love bear the same burden and follow the same ideal : lo with the ancient root of man 's nature twine the eternal passion of song ever love fan it ever life feed it time can not age it death can not slay to answer the question which arise naturally between teacher and pupil concern the book that they read be one object of this volume it aim not simply to instruct but also to inspire to trace the historical development of english literature and at the same time to allure its reader to the best book and the best writer and from begin to end it be write upon the assumption that the first virtue of such a work be to be accurate and the second to be interesting the author acknowledge with gratitude and appreciation he indebtedness to professor william lyon phelp for the use of he literary map of england and to the keen critic teacher of literature and history who have read the proof of this book and have improve it by they good suggestion william j long stamford

and lat thy gost thee lede chaucer 's _ truth _ on on you noblest english follow you spirit shakespeare 's _ henry v _ the shell and the book a child and a man be one day walk on the seashore when the child find a little shell and hold it to he ear suddenly he hear sound -- strange low melodious sound as if the shell be remember and repeat to itself the murmur of its ocean home the child 's face fill with wonder as he listen here in the little shell apparently be a voice from another world and he listen with delight to its mystery and music then come the man explain that the child hear nothing strange that the pearly curve of the shell simply catch a multitude of sound too faint for human ear and fill the glimmer hollow with the murmur of innumerable echo it be not a new world but only the unnoticed harmony of the old that have arouse the child 's wonder some such experience as this await we when we begin the study of literature which have always two aspect one of simple enjoyment and appreciation the other of analysis and exact description let a little song appeal to the ear or a noble book to the heart and for the moment at least we discover a new world a world so different from we own that it seem a place of dream and magic to enter and enjoy this new world to love good book for they own sake be the chief thing to analyze and explain they be a less joyous but still a important matter behind every book be a man behind the man be the race and behind the race be the natural and social environment whose influence be unconsciously reflect these also we must know if the book be to speak its whole message in a word we have now reach a point where we wish to understand as well as to enjoy literature and the first step since exact definition be impossible be to determine some of its essential quality quality of literature the first significant thing be the essentially artistic quality of all literature all art be the expression of life in form of truth and beauty or rather it be the reflection of some truth and beauty which be in the world but which remain unnoticed until bring to we attention by some sensitive human soul just as the delicate curve of the shell reflect sound and harmony too faint to be otherwise notice a hundred man may pass a hayfield and see only the sweaty toil and the windrow of dry grass but here be one who pause by a roumanian meadow where girl be make hay and singing as they work he look deeper see truth and beauty where we see only dead grass and he reflect what he see in a little poem in which the hay tell its own story : yesterday 's flower be i and i have drunk my last sweet draught of dew young maiden come and sing I to my death the moon look down and see I in my shroud the shroud of my last dew yesterday 's flower that be yet in I must need make way for all to-morrow 's flower the maiden too that sing I to my death must even so make way for all the maid that be to come and as my soul so too they soul will be laden with fragrance of the day go by the maiden that to-morrow come this way will not remember that i once do bloom for they will only see the new-born flower yet will my perfume-laden soul bring back as a sweet memory to woman 's heart they day of maidenhood and then they will be sorry that they come to sing I to my death and all the butterfly will mourn for I i bear away with I the sunshine 's dear remembrance and the low soft murmur of the spring my breath be sweet as child 's prattle be i drink in all the whole earth 's fruitfulness to make of it the fragrance of my soul that shall outlive my death -lrb- 1 -rrb- one who read only that first exquisite line yesterday 's flower be i can never again see hay without recall the beauty that be hide from he eye until the poet find it in the same pleasing surprising way all artistic work must be a kind of revelation thus architecture be probably the oldest of the art yet we still have many builder but few architect that be man whose work in wood or stone suggest some hidden truth and beauty to the human sens so in literature which be the art that express life in word that appeal to we own sense of the beautiful we have many writer but few artist in the broadest sense perhaps literature mean simply the write record of the race include all its history and science as well as its poem and novel in the narrower sense literature be the artistic record of life and most of we writing be exclude from it just as the mass of we building mere shelter from storm and from cold be exclude from architecture a history or a work of science may be and sometimes be literature but only as we forget the subject-matter and the presentation of fact in the simple beauty of its expression the second quality of literature be its suggestiveness its appeal to we emotion and imagination rather than to we intellect it be not so much what it say as what it awaken in we that constitute its charm when milton make satan say myself be hell he do not state any fact but rather open up in these three tremendous word a whole world of speculation and imagination when faustus in the presence of helen ask be this the face that launch a thousand ship he do not state a fact or expect a answer he open a door through which we imagination enter a new world a world of music love beauty heroism -- the whole splendid world of greek literature such magic be in word when shakespeare describe the young biron as speak in such apt and gracious word that aged ear play truant at he tale he have unconsciously give not only a excellent description of himself but the measure of all literature which make we play truant with the present world and run away to live awhile in the pleasant realm of fancy the province of all art be not to instruct but to delight and only as literature delight we cause each reader to build in he own soul that lordly pleasure house of which tennyson dream in he palace of art be it worthy of its name the third characteristic of literature arise directly from the other two be its permanence the world do not live by bread alone notwithstanding its hurry and bustle and apparent absorption in material thing it do not willingly let any beautiful thing perish this be even more true of its song than of its painting and sculpture though permanence be a quality we should hardly expect in the present deluge of book and magazine pour day and night from we press in the name of literature but this problem of too many book be not modern as we suppose it have be a problem ever since caxton bring the first printing press from flander four hundred year ago and in the shadow of westminster abbey open he little shop and advertise he wares as good and chepe even earlier a thousand year before caxton and he printing press the busy scholar of the great library of alexandrium find that the number of parchment be much too great for they to handle and now when we print more in a week than all the alexandrian scholar could copy in a century it would seem impossible that any production could be permanent that any song or story could live to give delight in future age but literature be like a river in flood which gradually purify itself in two way -- the mud settle to the bottom and the scum rise to the top when we examine the writings that by common consent constitute we literature the clear stream purify of its dross we find at least two more quality which we call the test of literature and which determine its permanence test of literature the first of these be universality that be the appeal to the widest human interest and the simplest human emotion though we speak of national and race literature like the greek or teutonic and though each have certain superficial mark arise out of the peculiarity of its own people it be nevertheless true that good literature know no nationality nor any bound save those of humanity it be occupy chiefly with elementary passion and emotion -- love and hate joy and sorrow fear and faith -- which be a essential part of we human nature and the more it reflect these emotion the more surely do it awaken a response in man of every race every father must respond to the parable of the prodigal son wherever man be heroic they will acknowledge the mastery of homer wherever a man think on the strange phenomenon of evil in the world he will find he own thought in the book of job in whatever place man love they child they heart must be stir by the tragic sorrow of _ oedipus _ and _ king lear _ all these be but shine example of the law that only as a book or a little song appeal to universal human interest do it become permanent the second test be a purely personal one and may be express in the indefinite word style it be only in a mechanical sense that style be the adequate expression of thought or the peculiar manner of express thought or any other of the definition that be find in the rhetoric in a deeper sense style be the man that be the unconscious expression of the writer 's own personality it be the very soul of one man reflect as in a glass the thought and feeling of humanity as no glass be colorless but tinge more or less deeply the reflection from its surface so no author can interpret human life without unconsciously give to it the native hue of he own soul it be this intensely personal element that constitute style every permanent book have more or less of these two element the objective and the subjective the universal and the personal the deep thought and feeling of the race reflect and color by the writer 's own life and experience the object in study literature aside from the pleasure of reading of enter into a new world and have we imagination quicken the study of literature have one definite object and that be to know man now man be ever a dual creature he have a outward and a inner nature he be not only a doer of deed but a dreamer of dream and to know he the man of any age we must search deeper than he history history record he deed he outward act largely but every great act spring from a ideal and to understand this we must read he literature where we find he ideal record when we read a history of the anglo-saxon for instance we learn that they be sea rover pirate explorer great eater and drinker and we know something of they hovel and habit and the land which they harry and plunder all that be interesting but it do not tell we what most we want to know about these old ancestor of ours -- not only what they do but what they think and feel how they look on life and death what they love what they fear and what they reverence in god and man then we turn from history to the literature which they themselves produce and instantly we become acquaint these hardy people be not simply fighter and freebooter they be man like ourselves they emotion awaken instant response in the soul of they descendant at the word of they gleeman we thrill again to they wild love of freedom and the open sea we grow tender at they love of home and patriotic at they deathless loyalty to they chief whom they choose for themselves and hoist on they shield in symbol of he leadership once more we grow respectful in the presence of pure womanhood or melancholy before the sorrow and problem of life or humbly confident look up to the god whom they dare to call the allfather all these and many more intensely real emotion pass through we soul as we read the few shine fragment of verse that the jealous age have leave we it be so with any age or people to understand they we must read not simply they history which record they deed but they literature which record the dream that make they deed possible so aristotle be profoundly right when he say that poetry be more serious and philosophical than history and goethe when he explain literature as the humanization of the whole world importance of literature it be a curious and prevalent opinion that literature like all art be a mere play of imagination please enough like a new novel but without any serious or practical importance nothing could be farther from the truth literature preserve the ideal of a people and ideal -- love faith duty friendship freedom reverence -- be the part of human life most worthy of preservation the greek be a marvelous people yet of all they mighty work we cherish only a few ideal -- ideal of beauty in perishable stone and ideal of truth in imperishable prose and poetry it be simply the ideal of the greek and hebrew and roman preserve in they literature which make they what they be and which determine they value to future generation we democracy the boast of all english-speaking nation be a dream not the doubtful and sometimes disheartening spectacle present in we legislative hall but the lovely and immortal ideal of a free and equal manhood preserve as a most precious heritage in every great literature from the greek to the anglo-saxon all we art we science even we invention be found squarely upon ideal for under every invention be still the dream of _ beowulf _ that man may overcome the force of nature and the foundation of all we science and discovery be the immortal dream that man shall be as god know good and evil in a word we whole civilization we freedom we progress we home we religion rest solidly upon ideal for they foundation nothing but a ideal ever endure upon earth it be therefore impossible to overestimate the practical importance of literature which preserve these ideal from father to son while man city government civilization vanish from the face of the earth it be only when we remember this that we appreciate the action of the devout mussulman who pick up and carefully preserve every scrap of paper on which word be write because the scrap may perchance contain the name of allah and the ideal be too enormously important to be neglect or lose summary of the subject we be now ready if not to define at least to understand a little more clearly the object of we present study literature be the expression of life in word of truth and beauty it be the write record of man 's spirit of he thought emotion aspiration it be the history and the only history of the human soul it be characterize by its artistic its suggestive its permanent quality its two test be its universal interest and its personal style its object aside from the delight it give we be to know man that be the soul of man rather than he action and since it preserve to the race the ideal upon which all we civilization be found it be one of the most important and delightful subject that can occupy the human mind bibliography -lrb- note each chapter in this book include a special bibliography of

be the story of beowulf the earliest and the greatest epic or heroic poem in we literature it begin with a prologue which be not a essential part of the story but which we review gladly for the sake of the splendid poetical conception that produce scyld king of the spear dane -lrb- 2 -rrb- at a time when the spear dane be without a king a ship come sailing into they harbor it be fill with treasure and weapon of war and in the midst of these warlike thing be a baby sleep no man sail the ship it come of itself bring the child whose name be scyld now scyld grow and become a mighty warrior and lead the spear dane for many year and be they king when he son beowulf -lrb- 3 -rrb- have become strong and wise enough to rule then wyrd -lrb- fate -rrb- who speak but once to any man come and stand at hand and it be time for scyld to go this be how they bury he : then scyld depart at word of wyrd speak the hero to go to the home of the god sadly they bear he to brink of the ocean comrade still heed he word of command there ride in the harbor the prince 's ship ready with prow curving proudly and shine sail set shipward they bear he they hero beloved the mighty they lay at the foot of the mast treasure be there from far and near gather byrny of battle armor and sword never a keel sail out of a harbor so splendidly trick with the trappings of war they heap on he bosom a hoard of bright jewel to fare with he forth on the flood 's great breast no less gift they give than the unknown provide when alone as a child he come in from the mere high o'er he head wave a bright golden standard -- now let the wave bear they wealth to the holm sad-souled they give back its gift to the ocean mournful they mood as he sail out to sea -lrb- 4 -rrb- and no man say the poet neither counselor nor hero can tell who receive that lade one of scyld 's descendant be hrothgar king of the dane and with he the story of we beowulf begin hrothgar in he old age have build near the sea a mead hall call heorot the most splendid hall in the whole world where the king and he thane gather nightly to feast and to listen to the song of he gleeman one night as they be all sleep a frightful monster grendel break into the hall kill thirty of the sleep warrior and carry off they body to devour they in he lair under the sea the appalling visit be speedily repeat and fear and death reign in the great hall the warrior fight at first but flee when they discover that no weapon could harm the monster heorot be leave desert and silent for twelve winter grendel 's horrible raid continue and joy be change to mourning among the spear dane at last the rumor of grendel cross over the sea to the land of the geat where a young hero dwelt in the house of he uncle king hygelac beowulf be he name a man of immense strength and courage and a mighty swimmer who have develop he power fight the nicker whale walrus and seal in the icebound northern ocean when he hear the story beowulf be stir to go and fight the monster and free the dane who be he father 's friend with fourteen companion he cross the sea there be a excellent bit of ocean poetry here -lrb- ll 210-224 -rrb- and we get a vivid idea of the hospitality of a brave people by follow the poet 's description of beowulf 's meeting with king hrothgar and queen wealhtheow and of the joy and feasting and story-telling in heorot the picture of wealhtheow pass the mead cup to the warrior with she own hand be a noble one and plainly indicate the reverence pay by these strong man to they wife and mother night come on the fear of grendel be again upon the dane and all withdraw after the king have warn beowulf of the frightful danger of sleep in the hall but beowulf lie down with he warrior say proudly that since weapon will not avail against the monster he will grapple with he bare handed and trust to a warrior 's strength forth from the fen from the misty moorland grendel come glide -- god 's wrath -lrb- 5 -rrb- he bear -- come under cloud until he see clearly glitter with gold plate the mead hall of man down fall the door though fasten with fire band open it spring at the stroke of he paw swollen with rage burst in the bale-bringer flame in he eye a fierce light likest fire -lrb- 6 -rrb- at the sight of man again sleep in the hall grendel laugh in he heart thinking of he feast he seize the nearest sleeper crush he bone case with a bite tear he limb from limb and swallow he then he creep to the couch of beowulf and stretch out a claw only to find it clutch in a grip of steel a sudden terror strike the monster 's heart he roar struggle try to jerk he arm free but beowulf leap to he foot and grapple he enemy bare handed to and fro they surge table be overturn golden bench rip from they fastening the whole building quake and only its iron band keep it from fall to piece beowulf 's companion be on they foot now hacking vainly at the monster with sword and battle-axis add they shout to the crash of furniture and the howling war song of grendel outside in the town the dane stand shiver at the uproar slowly the monster struggle to the door drag beowulf whose finger crack with the strain but who never relax he first grip suddenly a wide wound open in the monster 's side the sinew snap the whole arm be wrench off at the shoulder and grendel escape shriek across the moor and plunge into the sea to die beowulf first exult in he night 's work then he hang the huge arm with its terrible claw from a cross-beam over the king 's seat as one would hang up a bear 's skin after a hunt at daylight come the dane and all day long in the interval of singing story-telling speech make and gift give they return to wonder at the mighty grip of grendel and to rejoice in beowulf 's victory when night fall a great feast be spread in heorot and the danes sleep once more in the great hall at midnight come another monster a horrible half-human creature -lrb- 7 -rrb- mother of grendel rage to avenge she offspring she thunder at the door the dane leap up and grasp they weapon but the monster enter seize aeschere who be friend and adviser of the king and rush away with he over the fen the old scene of sorrow be review in the morning but beowulf say simply : sorrow not wise man it be better for each that he friend he avenge than that he mourn much each of we shall the end await of worldly life : let he who may gain honor ere death that be for a warrior when he be dead afterwards best arise kingdom 's guardian let we quickly go to view the track of grendel 's kinsman i promise it thee : he will not escape nor in earth 's bosom nor in mountain-wood nor in ocean 's depths go where he will -lrb- 8 -rrb- then he gird himself for the new fight and follow the track of the second enemy across the fen here be hrothgar 's description of the place where live the monster spirit of elsewhere as he call they : they inhabit the dim land that give shelter to the wolf the windy headland perilous fen path where under mountain mist the stream flow down and flood the ground not far hence but a mile the mere stand over which hang death-chill grove a wood fast-rooted overshade the flood there every night a ghastly miracle be see fire in the water no man know not the most wise the bottom of that mere the firm-horned heath-stalker the hart when press wearied by hound and hunt from afar will rather die of thirst upon its bank than bend he head to it it be unholy dark to the cloud its yeasty wave mount up when wind stir hateful tempest till the air grow dreary and the heaven pour down tear -lrb- 9 -rrb- beowulf plunge into the horrible place while he companion wait for he oh the shore for a long time he sink through the flood then as he reach bottom grendel 's mother rush out upon he and drag he into a cave where sea monster swarm at he from behind and gnash he armor with they tusk the edge of he sword be turn with the mighty blow he deal the _ merewif _ but it harm not the monster cast the weapon aside he grip she and try to hurl she down while she claw and tooth clash upon he corslet but can not penetrate the steel ring she throw she bulk upon he crush he down draw a short sword and plunge it at he but again he splendid byrnie save he he be wearied now and oppressed suddenly as he eye sweep the cave he catch sight of a magic sword make by the giant long ago too heavy for warrior to wield struggle up he seize the weapon whirl it and bring down a crash blow upon the monster 's neck it smash through the ring bone the _ merewif _ fall and the fight be win the cave be full of treasure but beowulf heed they not for near he lie grendel dead from the wound receive the previous night again beowulf swing the great sword and strike off he enemy 's head and lo as the venomous blood touch the sword blade the steel melt like ice before the fire and only the hilt be leave in beowulf 's hand take the hilt and the head the hero enter the ocean and mount up to the shore only he own faithful band be wait there for the dane see the ocean bubble with fresh blood think it be all over with the hero and have go home and there they be mourn in heorot when beowulf return with the monstrous head of grendel carry on a spear shaft by four of he stoutest follower in the last part of the poem there be another great fight beowulf be now a old man he have reign for fifty year beloved by all he people he have overcome every enemy but one a fire dragon keep watch over a enormous treasure hide among the mountain one day a wanderer stumble upon the enchanted cave and enter take a jeweled cup while the firedrake sleep heavily that same night the dragon in a frightful rage belch forth fire and smoke rush down upon the nearest village leave a trail of death and terror behind he again beowulf go forth to champion he people as he approach the dragon 's cave he have a presentiment that death lurk within : sit on the headland there the warrior king farewell he say to hearth-companions true the gold-friend of the geat he mind be sad death-ready restless and wyrd be draw nigh who now must meet and touch the aged man to seek the treasure that he soul have save and separate he body from he life -lrb- 10 -rrb- there be a flash of illumination like that which come to a die man in which he mind run back over he long life and see something of profound meaning in the elemental sorrow move side by side with magnificent courage then follow the fight with the firedrake in which beowulf wrap in fire and smoke be help by the heroism of wiglaf one of he companion the dragon be slay but the fire have enter beowulf 's lung and he know that wyrd be at hand this be he thought while wiglaf remove he battered armor : one deep regret i have : that to a son i may not give the armor i have worn to bear it after I for fifty year i rule these people well and not a king of those who dwell around I dare oppress or meet I with he host at home i wait for the time that wyrd control mine own i keep nor quarrel seek nor ever falsely swear now wound sore i wait for joy to come -lrb- 11 -rrb- he send wiglaf into the firedrake 's cave who find it fill with rare treasure and most wonderful of all a golden banner from which light proceeds and illumine all the darkness but wiglaf care little for the treasure he mind be full of he die chief he fill he hand with costly ornament and hurry to throw they at he hero 's foot the old man look with sorrow at the gold thanks the lord of all that by death he have gain more riches for he people and tell he faithful thane how he body shall be burn on the whale ness or headland : my life be well pay for this hoard and now care for the people 's need i may no more be with they bid the warrior raise a barrow after the burning on the ness by the sea on hronesness which shall rise high and be for a remembrance to my people seafarer who from afar over the mist of water drive foamy keel may call it beowulf 's mount hereafter then the hero from he neck put off a golden collar to he thane to the young warrior give it with he helm armlet and corslet bid he use they well thou art the last waegmunding of we race for fate have sweep my kinsman all away earl in they strength be to they maker go and i must follow they -lrb- 12 -rrb- beowulf be still live when wiglaf send a messenger hurriedly to he people when they come they find he dead and the huge dragon dead on the sand beside he then the goth 's people rear a mighty pile with shield and armor hang as he have ask and in the midst the warrior lay they lord lament then the warrior on the mount kindle a mighty bale fire the smoke rise black from the swedish pine the sound of flame mingle with sound of weep while smoke spread over heaven then upon the hill the people of the weder work a mound high broad and to be see far out at sea in ten day they have build and wall it in as the wise thought most worthy place in it ring jewel other treasure from the hoard they leave the riches golden joy of earl in dust for earth to hold where yet it lie useless as ever then about the mound the warrior ride and raise a mournful song for they dead king exalt he brave deed hold it fit man honor they liege lord praise he and love he when he soul be flee thus the -lrb- geat 's -rrb- people sharer of he hearth mourn they chief 's fall praise he of king of man the mildest and the kindest and to all he people gentlest yearning for they praise -lrb- 13 -rrb- one be tempt to linger over the detail of the magnificent ending : the unselfish heroism of beowulf the great prototype of king alfr the generous grief of he people ignore gold and jewel in the thought of the greater treasure they have lose the memorial mound on the low cliff which would cause every return mariner to steer a straight course to harbor in the remembrance of he dead hero and the pure poetry which mark every noble line but the epic be great enough and simple enough to speak for itself search the literature of the world and you will find no other such picture of a brave man 's death concern the history of _ beowulf _ a whole library have be write and scholar still differ too radically for we to express a positive judgment this much however be clear -- that there exist at the time the poem be compose various northern legend of beowa a half-divine hero and the monster grendel the latter have be interpret in various way -- sometimes as a bear and again as the malaria of the marsh land for those interested in symbol the simplest interpretation of these myth be to regard beowulf 's successive fight with the three dragon as the overcome first of the overwhelming danger of the sea which be beat back by the dyke second the conquering of the sea itself when man learn to sail upon it and third the conflict with the hostile force of nature which be overcome at last by man 's indomitable will and perseverance all this be purely mythical but there be historical incident to reckon with about the year 520 a certain northern chief call by the chronicler chochilaicus -lrb- who be generally identify with the hygelac of the epic -rrb- lead a huge plunder expedition up the rhine after a succession of battle he be overcome by the frank but -- and now we enter a legendary region once more -- not until a gigantic nephew of hygelac have perform heroic feat of valor and have save the remnant of the host by a marvelous feat of swim the majority of scholar now hold that these historical event and personage be celebrate in the epic but some still assert that the event which give a foundation for _ beowulf _ occur wholly on english soil where the poem itself be undoubtedly write the rhythm of _ beowulf _ and indeed of all we earliest poetry depend upon accent and alliteration that be the beginning of two or more word in the same line with the same sound or letter the line be make up of two short half separate by a pause no rime be use but a musical effect be produce by give each half line two strongly accented syllable each full line therefore have four accent three of which -lrb- ie two in the first half and one in the second -rrb- usually begin with the same sound or letter the musical effect be heighten by the harp with which the gleeman accompany he singing the poetical form will be see clearly in the follow selection from the wonderfully realistic description of the fen haunt by grendel it will need only one or two reading aloud to show that many of these strange-looking word be practically the same as those we still use though many of the vowel sound be pronounced differently by we ancestor hie dygel lond warigeath wulf-hleothu windige næssas frecne fen-gelad thær fyrgen-stream under næssa genipu nither gewiteth

path where mountain stream under ness ' mist nether -lrb- downward -rrb- wander a flood under earth it be not far hence by mile measure that the mere stand over which hang rimy grove widsith the poem widsith the wide goer or wanderer be in part at least probably the oldest in we language the author and the date of its composition be unknown but the personal account of the minstrel 's life belong to the time before the saxon first come to england -lrb- 14 -rrb- it express the wander life of the gleeman who go forth into the world to abide here or there accord as he be reward for he singing from the numerous reference to ring and reward and from the praise give to generous giver it would seem that literature as a pay profession begin very early in we history and also that the pay be barely sufficient to hold soul and body together of all we modern poet goldsmith wander over europe pay for he lodge with he song be most suggestive of this first recorded singer of we race he last line read : thus wander they who shape song for man pass over many land and tell they need and speak they thanks and ever south or north meet someone skilled in song and free in gift who would be raise among he friend to fame and do brave deed till light and life be go he who have thus work himself praise shall have a settle glory underneath the star -lrb- 15 -rrb- deor 's lament in deor we have another picture of the saxon scop or minstrel not in glad wander but in manly sorrow it seem that the scop 's living depend entirely upon he power to please he chief and that at any time he might be supplant by a better poet deor have this experience and comfort himself in a grim way by recall various example of man who have suffer more than himself the poem be arrange in strophe each one tell of some afflict hero and end with the same refrain : _ he sorrow pass away so will mine _ deor be much more poetic than widsith and be the one perfect lyric -lrb- 16 -rrb- of the anglo-saxon period

distinct part the first show the hardship of ocean life but stronger than hardship be the subtle call of the sea the second part be a allegory in which the trouble of the seaman be symbol of the trouble of this life and the call of the ocean be the call in the soul to be up and away to its true home with god whether the last be add by some monk who see the allegorical possibility of the first part or whether some sea-loving christian scop write both be uncertain follow be a few select line to show the spirit of the poem : the hail fly in shower about I and there i hear only the roar of the sea ice-cold wave and the song of the swan for pastime the gannet ' cry serve I the kittiwake ' chatter for laughter of man and for mead drink the call of the sea mew when storm on the rocky cliff beat then the tern icy-feathered make answer full oft the sea eagle forebodingly scream the eagle with pinion wave-wet the shadow of night become darker it snow from the north the world be enchain by the frost hail fall upon earth ' t be the coldest of grain yet the thought of my heart now be throb to test the high stream the salt wave in tumultuous play desire in my heart ever urge my spirit to wander to seek out the home of the stranger in land afar off there be no one that dwell upon earth so exalted in mind but that he have always a longing a sea-faring passion for what the lord god shall bestow be it honor or death no heart for the harp have he nor for acceptance of treasure no pleasure have he in a wife no delight in the world nor in aught save the roll of the billow but always a longing a yearning uneasiness hasten he on to the sea the woodland be capture by blossom the hamlet grow fair broad meadow be beautiful earth again burst into life and all stir the heart of the wanderer eager to journey so he meditate go afar on the pathway of tide the cuckoo moreover give warning with sorrowful note summer 's harbinger sing and forebode to the heart bitter sorrow now my spirit uneasily turn in the heart 's narrow chamber now wander forth over the tide o'er the home of the whale to the end of the earth -- and come back to I eager and greedy the lone wanderer scream and resistlessly drive my soul onward over the whale-path over the tract of the sea -lrb- 18 -rrb- the fight at finnsburgh and waldere two other of we oldest poem well deserve mention the fight at finnsburgh be a fragment of fifty line discover on the inside of a piece of parchment draw over the wooden cover of a book of homily it be a magnificent war song describe with homeric power the defense of a hall by hnæf -lrb- 19 -rrb- with sixty warrior against the attack of finn and he army at midnight when hnæf and he man be sleep they be surround by a army rush in with fire and sword hnæf spring to he foot at the first alarm and waken he warrior with a call to action that ring like a bugle blast : this no eastward dawn be nor be here a dragon fly nor of this high hall be the horn a burning but they rush upon we here -- now the raven sing growl be the gray wolf grim the war-wood rattle shield to shaft be answer -lrb- 20 -rrb- the fight last five day but the fragment end before we learn the outcome : the same fight be celebrate by hrothgar 's gleeman at the feast in heorot after the slaying of grendel waldere be a fragment of two leaf from which we get only a glimpse of the story of waldere -lrb- walter of aquitaine -rrb- and he betrothed bride hildgund who be hostage at the court of attilum they escape with a great treasure and in cross the mountain be attack by gunther and he warrior among whom be walter 's former comrade hagen walter fight they all and escape the same story be write in latin in the tenth century and be also part of the old german _ nibelungenly _ though the saga do not originate with the anglo-saxon they version of it be the oldest that have come down to we the chief significance of these waldere fragment lie in the evidence they afford that we ancestor be familiar with the legend and poetry of other germanic people ii anglo-saxon life we have now read some of we earliest record and have be surprised perhaps that man who be generally describe in the history as savage fighter and freebooter could produce such excellent poetry it be the object of the study of all literature to make we better acquaint with man -- not simply with they deed which be the function of history but with the dream and ideal which underlie all they action so a reading of this early anglo-saxon poetry not only make we acquaint but also lead to a profound respect for the man who be we ancestor before we study more of they literature it be well to glance briefly at they life and language the name originally the name anglo-saxon denote two of the three germanic tribe -- jute angle and saxon -- who in the middle of the fifth century leave they home on the shore of the north sea and the baltic to conquer and colonize distant britain angeln be the home of one tribe and the name still cling to the spot whence some of we forefather sail on they momentous voyage the old saxon word _ angul _ or _ ongul _ mean a hook and the english verb _ angle _ be use invariably by walton and older writer in the sense of fishing we may still think therefore of the first angle as hook-men possibly because of they fishing more probably because the shore where they live at the foot of the peninsula of jutland be bent in the shape of a fishhook the name saxon from _ seax sax _ a short sword mean the sword-man and from the name we may judge something of the temper of the hardy fighter who precede the angle into britain the angle be the most numerous of the conquer tribe and from they the new home be call anglalond by gradual change this become first englelond and then england more than five hundred year after the landing of these tribe and while they call themselves englishmen we find the latin writer of the middle age speak of the inhabitant of britain as _ anglisaxone _ -- that be saxon of england -- to distinguish they from the saxon of the continent in the latin charter of king alfr the same name appear but it be never see or hear in he native speech there he always speak of he beloved englelond and of he brave englisc people in the sixteenth century when the old name of englishman cling to the new people result from the union of saxon and norman the name anglo-saxon be first use in the national sense by the scholar camden -lrb- 21 -rrb- in he _ history of britain _ and since then it have be in general use among english writer in recent year the name have gain a wider significance until it be now use to denote a spirit rather than a nation the brave vigorous enlarge spirit that characterize the english-speaking race everywhere and that have already put a broad belt of english law and english liberty around the whole world the life if the literature of a people spring directly out of its life then the stern barbarous life of we saxon forefather would seem at first glance to promise little of good literature outwardly they life be a constant hardship a perpetual struggle against savage nature and savage man behind they be gloomy forest inhabit by wild beast and still wilder man and people in they imagination with dragon and evil shape in front of they thunder at the very dike for entrance be the treacherous north sea with its fog and storm and ice but with that indefinable call of the deep that all man hear who live long beneath its influence here they live a big blond powerful race and hunt and fight and sail and drink and feast when they labor be do almost the first thing we notice about these big fearless childish man be that they love the sea and because they love it they hear and answer its call : no delight have he in the world nor in aught save the roll of the billow but always a longing a yearning uneasiness hasten he on to the sea -lrb- 22 -rrb- as might be expect this love of the ocean find expression in all they poetry in _ beowulf _ alone there be fifteen name for the sea from the _ holm _ that be the horizon sea the upmound to the _ brim _ which be the ocean fling its welter of sand and creamy foam upon the beach at you foot and the figure use to describe or glorify it -- the swan road the whale path the heaving battle plain -- be almost as numerous in all they poetry there be a magnificent sense of lordship over the wild sea even in its hour of tempest and fury : often it befall we on the ocean 's highway in the boat we boatman when the storm be roar leap the billow over on we stallion of the foam -lrb- 23 -rrb- the inner life a man 's life be more than he work he dream be ever greater than he achievement and literature reflect not so much man 's deed as the spirit which animate he not the poor thing that he do but rather the splendid thing that he ever hope to do in no place be this more evident than in the age we be now study those early sea king be a marvelous mixture of savagery and sentiment of rough living and of deep feeling of splendid courage and the deep melancholy of man who know they limitation and have face the unanswered problem of death they be not simply fearless freebooter who harry every coast in they war galley if that be all they would have no more history or literature than the barbary pirate of whom the same thing could be say these strong father of ours be man of profound emotion in all they fight the love of a untarnished glory be uppermost and under the warrior 's savage exterior be hide a great love of home and homely virtue and a reverence for the one woman to whom he would presently return in triumph so when the wolf hunt be over or the desperate fight be win these mighty man would gather in the banquet hall and lay they weapon aside where the open fire would flash upon they and there listen to the song of scop and gleeman -- man who could put into adequate word the emotion and aspiration that all man feel but that only a few can ever express : music and song where the hero sit -- the glee-wood ring a song uprose when hrothgar 's scop give the hall good cheer -lrb- 24 -rrb- it be this great and hidden life of the anglo-saxon that find expression in all they literature briefly it be sum up in five great principle -- they love of personal freedom they responsiveness to nature they religion they reverence for womanhood and they struggle for glory as a ruling motive in every noble life in read anglo-saxon poetry it be well to remember these five principle for they be like the little spring at the head of a great river -- clear pure spring of poetry and out of they the best of we literature have always flow thus when we read blast of the tempest -- it aid we oar roll of thunder -- it hurt we not rush of the hurricane -- bend its neck to speed we whither we will be bent we realize that these sea rover have the spirit of kinship with the mighty life of nature and kinship with nature invariably express itself in poetry again when we read now have the man o'ercome he trouble no pleasure do he lack nor steed nor jewel nor the joy of mead nor any treasure that the earth can give o royal woman if he have but thee -lrb- 25 -rrb- we know we be deal with a essentially noble man not a savage we be face to face with that profound reverence for womanhood which inspire the greater part of all good poetry and we begin to honor as well as understand we ancestor so in the matter of glory or honor it be apparently not the love of fight but rather the love of honor result from fight well which animated we forefather in every campaign he be a man deserving of remembrance be the highest thing that could be say of a dead warrior and he be a man deserving of praise be the highest tribute to the live the whole secret of beowulf 's mighty life be sum up in the last line ever yearning for he people 's praise so every tribe have its scop or poet more important than any warrior who put the deed of its hero into the expressive word that constitute literature and every banquet hall have its gleeman who sing the scop 's poetry in order that the deed and the man might be remembered oriental people build monument to perpetuate the memory of they dead but we ancestor make poem which should live and stir man 's soul long after monument of brick and stone have crumble away it be to this intense love of glory and the desire to be remember that we be indebted for anglo-saxon literature we first speech we first record speech begin with the song of widsith and deor which the anglo-saxon may have bring with they when they first conquer britain at first glance these song in they native dress look strange as a foreign tongue but when we examine they carefully we find many word that have be familiar since childhood we have see this in _ beowulf _ but in prose the resemblance of this old speech to we own be even more striking here for instance be a fragment of the simple story of the conquest of britain by we anglo-saxon ancestor : she hengest and æsc he sunu gefuhton with brytta on thaere stowe the be gecweden creccanford and thær ofslogon feower thusenda wera and tha brytta tha forleton cent-lond and mid myclum ege flugon to lundenbyrig -lrb- at this time hengest and aesc he son fight against the briton at the place which be call crayford and there slew four thousand man and then the briton forsake kentland and with much fear flee to london town -rrb- -lrb- 26 -rrb- the reader who utter these word aloud a few time will speedily recognize he own tongue not simply in the word but also in the whole structure of the sentence from such record we see that we speech be teutonic in its origin and when we examine any teutonic language we learn that it be only a branch of the great aryan or indo-european family of language in life and language therefore we be related first to the teutonic race and through they to all the nation of this indo-european family which start with enormous vigor from they original home -lrb- probably in central europe -rrb- -lrb- 27 -rrb- spread southward and westward drive out the native tribe and slowly develop the mighty civilization of indium persium greece rome and the wilder but more vigorous life of the celt and teuton in all these language -- sanskrit iranian greek latin celtic teutonic -- we recognize the same root word for father and mother for god and man for the common need and the common relation of life and since word be window through which we see the soul of this old people we find certain ideal of love home faith heroism liberty which seem to have be the very life of we forefather and which be inherit by they from they old heroic and conquer ancestor it be on the border of the north sea that we father halt for unnumbered century on they westward journey and slowly develop the national life and language which we now call anglo - saxon it be this old vigorous anglo-saxon language which form the basis of we modern english if we read a paragraph from any good english book and then analyze it as we would a flower to see what it contain we find two distinct class of word the first class contain simple word express the common thing of life make up the strong framework of we language these word be like the stem and bare branch of a mighty oak and if we look they up in the dictionary we find that almost invariably they come to we from we anglo-saxon ancestor the second and larger class of word be make up of those that give grace variety ornament to we speech they be like the leaf and blossom of the same tree and when we examine they history we find that they come to we from the celt roman norman and other people with whom we have be in contact in the long year of we development the most prominent characteristic of we present language therefore be its dual character its best quality -- strength simplicity directness -- come from anglo-saxon source its enormous add wealth of expression its comprehensiveness its plastic adaptability to new condition and idea be largely the result of addition from other language and especially of its gradual absorption of the french language after the norman conquest it be this dual character this combination of native and foreign of innate and exotic element which account for the wealth of we english language and literature to see it in concrete form we should read in succession _ beowulf _ and _ paradise lose _ the two great epic which show the root and the flower of we literary development iii christian writer of the anglo-saxon period the literature of this period fall naturally into two division -- pagan and christian the former represent the poetry which the anglo-saxon probably bring with they in the form of oral saga -- the crude material out of which literature be slowly develop on english soil the latter represent the writings develop under teaching of the monk after the old pagan religion have vanish but while it still retain its hold on the life and language of the people in read we earliest poetry it be well to remember that all of it be copy by the monk and seem to have be more or less altered to give it a religious color the come of christianity mean not simply a new life and leader for england it mean also the wealth of a new language the scop be now replace by the literary monk and that monk though he live among common people and speak with the english tongue have behind he all the culture and literary resource of the latin language the effect be see instantly in we early prose and poetry northumbrian literature in general two great school of christian influence come into england and speedily put a end to the frightful war that have wage continually among the various petty kingdom of the anglo-saxon the first of these under the leadership of augustine come from rome it spread in the south and center of england especially in the kingdom of essex it found school and partially educate the rough people but it produce no lasting literature the other under the leadership of the saintly aidan come from ireland which country have be for century a center of religion and education for all western europe the monk of this school labor chiefly in northumbrium and to they influence we owe all that be best in anglo-saxon literature it be call the northumbrian school its center be the monastery and abbey such as jarrow and whitby and its three greatest name be bede cædmon and cynewulf bede -lrb- 673-735 -rrb- the venerable bede as he be generally call we first great scholar and the father of we english learning write almost exclusively in latin he last work the translation of the gospel of john into anglo-saxon have be unfortunately lose much to we regret therefore he book and the story of he gentle heroic life must be exclude from this history of we literature he work over forty in number cover the whole field of human knowledge in he day and be so admirably write that they be widely copy as text-book or rather manuscript in nearly all the monastery school of europe the work most important to we be the _ ecclesiastical history of the english people _ it be a fascinating history to read even now with its curious combination of accurate scholarship and immense credulity in all strictly historical matter bede be a model every known authority on the subject from pliny to gilda be carefully consider every learn pilgrim to rome be commission by bede to ransack the archive and to make copy of papal decree and royal letter and to these be add the testimony of abbot who could speak from personal knowledge of event or repeat the tradition of they several monastery side by side with this historical exactness be marvelous story of saint and missionary it be a age of credulity and miracle be in man 's mind continually the man of whom he write live life more wonderful than any romance and they courage and gentleness make a tremendous impression on the rough warlike people to whom they come with open hand and heart it be the natural way of all primitive people to magnify the work of they hero and so deed of heroism and kindness which be part of the daily life of the irish missionary be soon transform into the miracle of the saint bede believe these thing as all other man do and record they with charming simplicity just as he receive they from bishop or abbot notwithstanding its error we owe to this work nearly all we knowledge of the eight century of we history follow the landing of cæsar in britain cædmon -lrb- seventh century -rrb- now must we hymn the master of heaven the might of the maker the deed of the father the thought of he heart he lord everlasting establish of old the source of all wonder : creator all-holy he hang the bright heaven a roof high uprear o'er the child of man the king of mankind then create for mortal the world in its beauty the earth spread beneath they he lord everlasting omnipotent god -lrb- 28 -rrb- if _ beowulf _ and the fragment of we earliest poetry be bring into england then the hymn give above be the first verse of all native english song that have come down to we and cædmon be the first poet to whom we can give a definite name and date the word be write about 665 ad and be find copy at the end of a manuscript of bede 's _ ecclesiastical history _ life of cædmon what little we know of cædmon the anglo-saxon milton as he be properly call be take from bede 's account -lrb- 29 -rrb- of the abbess hilda and of she monastery at whitby here be a free and condensed translation of bede 's story : there be in the monastery of the abbess hilda a brother distinguish by the grace of god for that he could make poem treat of goodness and religion whatever be translate to he -lrb- for he could not read -rrb- of sacred scripture he shortly reproduce in poetic form of great sweetness and beauty none of all the english poet could equal he for he learn not the art of song from man nor sing by the art of man rather do he receive all he poetry as a free gift from god and for this reason he do never compose poetry of a vain or worldly kind until of mature age he live as a layman and have never learn any poetry indeed so ignorant of singing be he that sometimes at a feast where it be the custom that for the pleasure of all each guest should sing in turn he would rise from the table when he see the harp come to he and go home ashamed now it happen once that he do this thing at a certain festivity and go out to the stall to care for the horse this duty be assign to he for that night as he sleep at the usual time one stand by he say : cædmon sing I something i can not sing he answer and that be why i come hither from the feast but he who speak unto he say again cædmon sing to I and he say what shall i sing and he say sing the beginning of create thing thereupon cædmon begin to sing verse that he have never hear before of this import : now should we praise the power and wisdom of the creator the work of the father this be the sense but not the form of the hymn that he sing while sleep when he awaken cædmon remember the word of the hymn and add to they many more in the morning he go to the steward of the monastery land and show he the gift he have receive in sleep the steward bring he to hilda who make he repeat to the monk the hymn he have compose and all agree that the grace of god be upon cædmon to test he they expound to he a bit of scripture from the latin and bid he if he could to turn it into poetry he go away humbly and return in the morning with a excellent poem thereupon hilda receive he and he family into the monastery make he one of the brethren and command that the whole course of bible history be expound to he he in turn reflect upon what he have hear transform it into most delightful poetry and by echo it back to the monk in more melodious sound make he teacher he listener in all this he aim be to turn man from wickedness and to help they to the love and practice of well do -lrb- then follow a brief record of cædmon 's life and a exquisite picture of he death amidst the brethren -rrb- and so it come to pass -lrb- say the simple record -rrb- that as he serve god while live in purity of mind and serenity of spirit so by a peaceful death he leave the world and go to look upon he face cædmon 's work the greatest work attribute to cædmon be the so-called _ paraphrase _ it be the story of genesis exodus and a part of daniel tell in glowing poetic language with a power of insight and imagination which often raise it from paraphrase into the realm of true poetry though we have bede 's assurance that cædmon transform the whole course of bible history into most delightful poetry no work know certainly to have be compose by he have come down to we in the seventeenth century this anglo-saxon _ paraphrase _ be discover and attribute to cædmon and he name be still associate with it though it be now almost certain that the _ paraphrase _ be the work of more than one writer aside from the doubtful question of authorship even a casual reading of the poem bring we into the presence of a poet rude indeed but with a genius strongly suggestive at time of the matchless milton the book open with a hymn of praise and then tell of the fall of satan and he rebel angel from heaven which be familiar to we in milton 's _ paradise lose _ then follow the creation of the world and the _ paraphrase _ begin to thrill with the old anglo-saxon love of nature here first the eternal father guard of all of heaven and earth raisèd up the firmament the almighty lord set firm by he strong power this roomy land grass green not yet the plain ocean far spread hide the wan way in gloom then be the spirit gloriously bright of heaven 's keeper bear over the deep swiftly the life-giver the angel 's lord over the ample ground bid come forth light quickly the high king 's bidding be obey over the waste there shine light 's holy ray then part he lord of triumphant might shadow from shine darkness from the light light by the word of god be first name day -lrb- 30 -rrb- after recount the story of paradise the fall and the deluge the _ paraphrase _ be continue in the exodus of which the poet make a noble epic rush on with the sweep of a saxon army to battle a single selection be give here to show how the poet adapt the story to he hearer : then they see forth and forward fare pharaoh 's war array glide on a grove of spear -- glitter the host flutter there the banner there the folk the march tread onward surge the war stride the spear along blicker the broad shield blow aloud the trumpet wheeling round in gyre yell the fowl of war of the battle greedy hoarsely bark the raven dew upon he feather o'er the fall corpse -- swart that chooser of the slay sing aloud the wolf at eve they horrid song hope for the carrion -lrb- 31 -rrb- besides the _ paraphrase _ we have a few fragment of the same general character which be attribute to the school of cædmon the longest of these be _ judith _ in which the story of a apocryphal book of the old testament be do into vigorous poetry holoferne be represent as a savage and cruel vike revel in he mead hall and when the heroic judith cut off he head with he own sword and throw it down before the warrior of she people rouse they to battle and victory we reach perhaps the most dramatic and brilliant point of anglo-saxon literature cynewulf -lrb- eighth century -rrb- of cynewulf greatest of the anglo-saxon poet except only the unknown author of _ beowulf _ we know very little indeed it be not till 1840 more than a thousand year after he death that even he name become known though he be the only one of we early poet who sign he work the name be never plainly write but weave into the verse in the form of secret rune -lrb- 32 -rrb- suggest a modern charade but more difficult of interpretation until one have find the key to the poet 's signature work of cynewulf the only signed poem of cynewulf be _ the christ juliana the fate of the apostle _ and _ elene _ unsigned poem attribute to he or he school be _ andrea _ the _ phoenix _ the _ dream of the rood _ the _ descent into hell _ _ guthlac _ the _ wanderer _ and some of the riddle the last be simply literary conundrum in which some well-known object like the bow or drinking horn be describe in poetic language and the hearer must guess the name some of they like the swan -lrb- 33 -rrb- and the storm spirit be unusually beautiful of all these work the most characteristic be undoubtedly _ the christ _ a didactic poem in three part : the first celebrate the nativity the second the ascension and the third doomsday tell the torment of the wicked and the unending joy of the redeem cynewulf take he subject-matter partly from the church liturgy but more largely from the homily of gregory the great the whole be well weave together and contain some hymn of great beauty and many passage of intense dramatic force throughout the poem a deep love for christ and a reverence for the virgin mary be manifest more than any other poem in any language _ the christ _ reflect the spirit of early latin christianity here be a fragment compare life to a sea voyage -- a comparison which occur sooner or later to every thoughtful person and which find perfect expression in tennyson 's cross the bar now ` tis most like as if we fare in ship on the ocean flood over the water cold drive we vessel through the spacious sea with horse of the deep a perilous way be this of boundless wave and there be stormy sea on which we toss here in this -lrb- reel -rrb- world o'er the deep path ours be a sorry plight until at last we sail unto the land over the troubled main help come to we that bring we to the haven of salvation god 's spirit-son and grant grace to we that we might know e ` en from the vessel 's deck where we must bind with anchorage secure we ocean steed old stallion of the wave in the two epic poem of _ andrea _ and _ elene _ cynewulf -lrb- if he be the author -rrb- reach the very summit of he poetical art _ andrea _ a unsigned poem record the story of st andrew who cross the sea to rescue he comrade st matthew from the cannibal a young ship-master who sail the boat turn out to be christ in disguise matthew be set free and the savage be convert by a miracle -lrb- 34 -rrb- it be a spirited poem full of rush and incident and the description of the sea be the best in anglo-saxon poetry _ elene _ have for its subject-matter the finding of the true cross it tell of constantine 's vision of the rood on the eve of battle after he victory under the new emblem he send he mother helena -lrb- elene -rrb- to jerusalem in search of the original cross and the nail the poem which be of very uneven quality might properly be put at the end of cynewulf 's work he add to the poem a personal note sign he name in rune and if we accept the wonderful vision of the rood as cynewulf 's work we learn how he find the cross at last in he own heart there be a suggestion here of the future sir launfal and the search for the holy grail decline of northumbrian literature the same northern energy which have build up learning and literature so rapidly in northumbrium be instrumental in pull it down again toward the end of the century in which cynewulf live the danes sweep down on the english coast and overwhelmed northumbrium monastery and school be destroy scholar and teacher alike be put to the sword and library that have be gather leaf by leaf with the toil of century be scatter to the four wind so all true northumbrian literature perish with the exception of a few fragment and that which we now possess -lrb- 35 -rrb- be largely a translation in the dialect of the west saxon this translation be make by alfred 's scholar after he have drive back the dane in a effort to preserve the ideal and the civilization that have be so hardly win with the conquest of northumbrium end the poetic period of anglo-saxon literature with alfr the great of wessex we prose literature make a begin alfr -lrb- 848-901 -rrb- every craft and every power soon grow old and be pass over and forget if it be without wisdom this be now to be say that whilst i live i wish to live nobly and after life to leave to the man who come after I a memory of good work -lrb- 36 -rrb- so write the great alfred look back over he heroic life that he live nobly none can doubt who read the history of the greatest of anglo-saxon king and he good work include among other the education of half a country the salvage of a noble native literature and the creation of the first english prose life and time of alfr for the history of alfred 's time and detail of the terrific struggle with the northman the reader must be refer to the history the struggle end with the treaty of wedmore in 878 with the establishment of alfr not only as king of wessex but as overlord of the whole northern country then the hero lay down he sword and set himself as a little child to learn to read and write latin so that he might lead he people in peace as he have lead they in war it be then that alfred begin to be the heroic figure in literature that he have formerly be in the war against the northman with the same patience and heroism that have mark the long struggle for freedom alfred set himself to the task of educate he people first he give they law begin with the ten commandment and end with the golden rule and then establish court where law could be faithfully administer safe from the danes by land he create a navy almost the first of the english fleet to drive they from the coast then with peace and justice establish within he border he send to europe for scholar and teacher and set they over school that he establish hitherto all education have be in latin now he set himself the task first of teaching every free-born englishman to read and write he own language and second of translate into english the best book for they instruction every poor scholar be honor at he court and be speedily set to work at teaching or translate every wanderer bring a book or a leaf of manuscript from the pillage monastery of northumbrium be sure of he reward in this way the few fragment of native northumbrian literature which we have be study be save to the world alfr and he scholar treasured the rare fragment and copy they in the west-saxon dialect with the exception of cædmon 's hymn we have hardly a single leaf from the great literature of northumbrium in the dialect in which it be first write work of alfred aside from he educational work alfr be know chiefly as a translator after fight he country 's battle and at a time when most man be content with military honor he begin to learn latin that he might translate the work that would be most helpful to he people he important translation be four in number : orosius 's _ universal history and geography _ the lead work in general history for several century bede 's _ history _ -lrb- 37 -rrb- the first great historical work write on english soil pope gregory 's _ shepherd ' book _ intend especially for the clergy and boethius 's _ consolation of philosophy _ the favorite philosophical work of the middle age more important than any translation be the _ english _ or _ saxon chronicle _ this be probably at first a dry record especially of important birth and death in the west-saxon kingdom alfr enlarged this scant record begin the story with cæsar 's conquest when it touch he own reign the dry chronicle become a interesting and connected story the oldest history belong to any modern nation in its own language the record of alfred 's reign probably by himself be a splendid bit of write and show clearly he claim to a place in literature as well as in history the _ chronicle _ be continue after alfred 's death and be the best monument of early english prose that be leave to we here and there stir song be include in the narrative like the battle of brunanburh and the battle of maldon -lrb- 38 -rrb- the last enter 991 seventy-five year before the norman conquest be the swan song of anglo-saxon poetry the _ chronicle _ be continue for a century after the norman conquest and be extremely valuable not only as a record of event but as a literary monument show the development of we language close of the anglo-saxon period after alfred 's death there be little to record except the loss of the two supreme object of he heroic struggle namely a national life and a national literature it be at once the strength and the weakness of the saxon that he live apart as a free man and never join effort willingly with any large body of he fellow the tribe be he largest idea of nationality and with all we admiration we must confess as we first meet he that he have not enough sense of unity to make a great nation nor enough culture to produce a great literature a few noble political ideal repeat in a score of petty kingdom and a few literary ideal copy but never increase -- that be the summary of he literary history for a full century after alfred literature be practically at a standstill have produce the best of which it be capable and england wait for the national impulse and for the culture necessary for a new and greater art both of these come speedily by way of the sea in the norman conquest summary of anglo-saxon period we literature begin with song and story of a time when we teutonic ancestor be live on the border of the north sea three tribe of these ancestor the jute angle and saxon conquer britain in the latter half of the fifth century and lay the foundation of the english nation the first landing be probably by a tribe of jute under chief call by the chronicle hengist and horsa the date be doubtful but the year 449 be accept by most historian these old ancestor be hardy warrior and sea rover yet be capable of profound and noble emotion they poetry reflect this double nature its subject be chiefly the sea and the plunge boat battle adventure brave deed the glory of warrior and the love of home accent alliteration and a abrupt break in the middle of each line give they poetry a kind of martial rhythm in general the poetry be earnest and somber and pervade by fatalism and religious feeling a careful reading of the few remain fragment of anglo-saxon literature reveal five striking characteristic : the love of freedom responsiveness to nature especially in she sterner mood strong religious conviction and a belief in wyrd or fate reverence for womanhood and a devotion to glory as the ruling motive in every warrior 's life in we study we have note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the great epic or heroic poem _ beowulf _ and a few fragment

of northman tell its own story the man who bear the name come originally from scandinavium -- band of big blond fearless man cruise after plunder and adventure in they vike ship and bring terror wherever they appear it be these same child of woden who under the dane ' raven flag have blot out northumbrian civilization in the ninth century later the same race of man come plunder along the french coast and conquer the whole northern country but here the result be altogether different instead of blot out a superior civilization as the dane have do they promptly abandon they own they name of normandy still cling to the new home but all else that be norse disappear as the conqueror intermarry with the native frank and accept french ideal and speak the french language so rapidly do they adopt and improve the roman civilization of the native that from a rude tribe of heathen viking they have develop within a single century into the most polished and intellectual people in all europe the union of norse and french -lrb- ie roman-gallic -rrb- blood have here produce a race have the best quality of both -- the will power and energy of the one the eager curiosity and vivid imagination of the other when these norman-french people appear in anglo-saxon england they bring with they three noteworthy thing : a lively celtic disposition a vigorous and progressive latin civilization and a romance language -lrb- 42 -rrb- we be to think of the conqueror therefore as they think and speak of themselves in the domesday book and all they contemporary literature not as norman but as _ francus _ that be frenchmen the conquest at the battle of hasting -lrb- 1066 -rrb- the power of harold last of the saxon king be break and william duke of normandy become master of england of the completion of that stupendous conquest which begin at hasting and which change the civilization of a whole nation this be not the place to speak we simply point out three great result of the conquest which have a direct bearing on we literature first notwithstanding cæsar 's legion and augustine 's monk the norman be the first to bring the culture and the practical ideal of roman civilization home to the english people and this at a critical time when england have produce she best and she own literature and civilization have already begin to decay second they force upon england the national idea that be a strong centralized government to replace the loose authority of a saxon chief over he tribesman and the world 's history show that without a great nationality a great literature be impossible third they bring to england the wealth of a new language and literature and we english gradually absorb both for three century after hasting french be the language of the upper class of court and school and literature yet so tenaciously do the common people cling to they own strong speech that in the end english absorb almost the whole body of french word and become the language of the land it be the welding of saxon and french into one speech that produce the wealth of we modern english naturally such momentous change in a nation be not bring about suddenly at first norman and saxon live apart in the relation of master and servant with more or less contempt on one side and hatred on the other but in a astonishingly short time these two race be draw powerfully together like two man of different disposition who be often lead into a steadfast friendship by the attraction of opposite quality each supply what the other lack the _ anglo-saxon chronicle _ which be continue for a century after hasting find much to praise in the conqueror on the other hand the norman even before the conquest have no great love for the french nation after conquer england they begin to regard it as home and speedily develop a new sense of nationality geoffrey 's popular _ history _ -lrb- 43 -rrb- write less than a century after the conquest make conqueror and conquer alike proud of they country by its story of hero who curiously enough be neither norman nor saxon but creation of the native celt thus do literature whether in a battle song or a history often play the chief role in the development of nationality -lrb- 44 -rrb- once the mutual distrust be overcome the two race gradually unite and out of this union of saxon and norman come the new english life and literature literary ideal of the norman the change in the life of the conqueror from norseman to norman from viking to frenchman be show most clearly in the literature which they bring with they to england the old norse strength and grandeur the magnificent saga tell of the tragic struggle of man and god which still stir we profoundly -- these have all disappear in they place be a bright varied talkative literature which run to endless verse and which make a wonderful romance out of every subject it touch the theme may be religion or love or chivalry or history the deed of alexander or the misdeed of a monk but the author 's purpose never vary he must tell a romantic story and amuse he audience and the more wonder and impossibility he relate the more surely be he believe we be remind in reading of the native gaul who would stop every traveler and compel he to tell a story ere he pass on there be more of the gaul than of the norseman in the conqueror and far more of fancy than of thought or feeling in they literature if you would see this in concrete form read the _ chanson de roland _ the french national epic -lrb- which the norman first put into literary form -rrb- in contrast with _ beowulf _ which voice the saxon 's thought and feeling before the profound mystery of human life it be not we purpose to discuss the evident merit or the serious defect of norman-french literature but only to point out two fact which impress the student namely that anglo-saxon literature be at one time enormously superior to the french and that the latter with its evident inferiority absolutely replace the former the fact be too often ignore say professor schofield -lrb- 45 -rrb- that before 1066 the anglo-saxon have a body of native literature distinctly superior to any which the norman or french could boast at that time they prose especially be unparalleled for extent and power in any european vernacular why then do this superior literature disappear and for nearly three century french remain supreme so much so that writer on english soil even when they do not use the french language still slavishly copy the french model to understand this curious phenomenon it be necessary only to remember the relative condition of the two race who live side by side in england on the one hand the anglo-saxons be a conquered people and without liberty a great literature be impossible the inroad of the dane and they own tribal war have already destroy much of they writings and in they new condition of servitude they could hardly preserve what remain the conquer norman on the other hand represent the civilization of france which country during the early middle age be the literary and educational center of all europe they come to england at a time when the idea of nationality be dead when culture have almost vanish when englishman live apart in narrow isolation and they bring with they law culture the prestige of success and above all the strong impulse to share in the great world 's work and to join in the move current of the world 's history small wonder then that the young anglo-saxon feel the quicken of this new life and turn naturally to the culture and progressive norman as they literary model ii literature of the norman period in the advocate ' library at edinburgh there be a beautifully illuminate manuscript write about 1330 which give we a excellent picture of the literature of the norman period in examine it we be to remember that literature be in the hand of the clergy and noble that the common people could not read and have only a few song and ballad for they literary portion we be to remember also that parchment be scarce and very expensive and that a single manuscript often contain all the reading matter of a castle or a village hence this old manuscript be as suggestive as a modern library it contain over forty distinct work the great bulk of they be romance there be metrical or verse romance of french and celtic and english hero like roland arthur and tristram and bevi of hampton there be story of alexander the greek romance of flore and blanchefleur and a collection of oriental tale call the seven wise master there be legend of the virgin and the saint a paraphrase of scripture a treatise on the seven deadly sin some bible history a dispute among bird concern woman a love song or two a vision of purgatory a vulgar story with a gallic flavor a chronicle of english king and norman baron and a political satire there be a few other work similarly incongruous crowd together in this typical manuscript which now give mute testimony to the literary taste of the time obviously it be impossible to classify such a variety we note simply that it be mediæval in spirit and french in style and expression and that sum up the age all the scholarly work of the period like william of malmesbury 's _ history _ and anselm 's -lrb- 46 -rrb- _ cur deus homo _ and roger bacon 's _ opus majus _ the beginning of modern experimental science be write in latin while nearly all other work be write in french or else be english copy or translation of french original except for the advanced student therefore they hardly belong to the story of english literature we shall note here only one or two marked literary type like the riming chronicle -lrb- or verse history -rrb- and the metrical romance and a few writer whose work have especial significance geoffrey of monmouth -lrb- d 1154 -rrb- geoffrey 's _ historium regum britanniae _ be noteworthy not as literature but rather as a source book from which many later writer draw they literary material among the native celtic tribe a immense number of legend many of they of exquisite beauty have be preserve through four successive conquest of britain geoffrey a welsh monk collect some of these legend and aid chiefly by he imagination write a complete history of the briton he alleged authority be a ancient manuscript in the native welsh tongue contain the life and deed of all they king from brutus the alleged founder of britain down to the come of julius cæsar -lrb- 47 -rrb- from this geoffrey write he history down to the death of cadwalader in 689 the history be a curious medley of pagan and christian legend of chronicle comment and pure invention -- all record in minute detail and with a gravity which make it clear that geoffrey have no conscience or else be a great joker as history the whole thing be rubbish but it be extraordinarily successful at the time and make all who hear it whether norman or saxon proud of they own country it be interesting to we because it give a new direction to the literature of england by show the wealth of poetry and romance that lay in its own tradition of arthur and he knight shakespeare 's _ king lear _ malory 's _ morte d'arthur _ and tennyson 's _ idyll of the king _ be found on the work of this monk who have the genius to put unwritten celtic tradition in the enduring form of latin prose work of the french writer the french literature of the norman period be interesting chiefly because of the avidity with which foreign writer seize upon the native legend and make they popular in england until geoffrey 's preposterous chronicle appear these legend have not be use to any extent as literary material indeed they be scarcely know in england though familiar to french and italian minstrel legend of arthur and he court be probably first take to brittany by welsh emigrant in the fifth and sixth century they become immensely popular wherever they be tell and they be slowly carry by minstrel and story-teller all over europe that they have never receive literary form or recognition be due to a peculiarity of mediæval literature which require that every tale should have some ancient authority behind it geoffrey meet this demand by create a historical manuscript of welsh history that be enough for the age with geoffrey and he alleged manuscript to rest upon the norman - french writer be free to use the fascinating story which have been-for century in the possession of they wander minstrel geoffrey 's latin history be put into french verse by gaimar _ -lrb- c _ 1150 -rrb- and by wace -lrb- _ c _ 1155 -rrb- and from these french version the work be first translate into english from about 1200 onward arthur and guinevere and the matchless band of celtic hero that we meet later -lrb- 1470 -rrb- in malory 's _ morte d' arthur _ become the permanent possession of we literature layamon 's brut -lrb- _ c _ 1200 -rrb- this be the most important of the english riming chronicle that be history related in the form of doggerel verse probably because poetry be more easily memorize than prose we give here a free rendering of select line at the beginning of the poem which tell we all we know of layamon the first who ever write as a englishman for englishman include in the term all who love england and call it home no matter where they ancestor be bear now there be a priest in the land name layamon he be son of leovenath -- may god be gracious unto he he dwell at ernley at a noble church on severn 's bank he read many book and it come to he mind to tell the noble deed of the english then he begin to journey far and wide over the land to procure noble book for authority he take the english book that saint bede make another in latin that saint albin make -lrb- 48 -rrb- and a third book that a french clerk make name wace -lrb- 49 -rrb- layamon lay these work before he and turn the leaf lovingly he behold they pen he take and write on book-skin and make the three book into one the poem begin with the destruction of troy and the flight of æneas the duke into italy brutus a great-grandson of æneas gather he people and set out to find a new land in the west then follow the founding of the briton kingdom and the last third of the poem which be over thirty thousand line in length be take up with the history of arthur and he knight if the _ brut _ have no merit of its own it would still interest we for it mark the first appearance of the arthurian legend in we own tongue a single selection be give here from arthur 's die speech familiar to we in tennyson 's _ morte d'arthur _ the reader will notice here two thing : first that though the poem be almost pure anglo-saxon -lrb- 50 -rrb- we first speech have already drop many inflection and be more easily read than _ beowulf _ second that french influence be already at work in layamon 's rime and assonance that be the harmony result from use the same vowel sound in several successive line : and ich wulle varen to avalun : and i will fare to avalun to vairest alre maidene to fairest of all maiden to argante there quene to argante the queen alven swithe sceone a elf very beautiful and heo seal

anan and they take arthur anon and a eovste hine vereden and bear he hurriedly and softe hine adun leiden and softly lay he down and forth gunnen lithen and forth gan glide metrical romance love chivalry and religion all pervade by the spirit of romance -- these be the three great literary ideal which find expression in the metrical romance read these romance now with they knight and fair lady they perilous adventure and tender love-making they minstrelsy and tournament and gorgeous cavalcade -- as if humanity be on parade and life itself be one tumultuous holiday in the open air -- and you have a epitome of the whole childish credulous soul of the middle age the norman first bring this type of romance into england and so popular do it become so thoroughly do it express the romantic spirit of the time that it speedily overshadow all other form of literary expression though the metrical romance vary much in form and subject-matter the general type remain the same -- a long rambling poem or series of poem treat of love or knightly adventure or both its hero be a knight its character be fair lady in distress warrior in armor giant dragon enchanter and various enemy of church and state and its emphasis be almost invariably on love religion and duty as define by chivalry in the french original of these romance the line be a definite length the meter exact and rime and assonance be both use to give melody in england this metrical system come in contact with the uneven line the strong accent and alliteration of the native song and it be due to the gradual union of the two system french and saxon that we english become capable of the melody and amazing variety of verse form which first find expression in chaucer 's poetry in the enormous number of these verse romance we note three main division accord to subject into the romance -lrb- or the so-called matter -rrb- of france rome and britain -lrb- 51 -rrb- the matter of france deal largely with the exploit of charlemagne and he peer and the chief of these carlovingian cycle be the _ chanson de roland _ the national epic which celebrate the heroism of roland in he last fight against the saracen at ronceval originally these romance be call _ chanson de geste _ and the name be significant as indicate that the poem be originally short song -lrb- 52 -rrb- celebrate the deed _ -lrb- gesta -rrb- _ of well-known hero later the various song concern one hero be gather together and the _ geste _ become a epic like the _ chanson de roland _ or a kind of continued ballad story hardly deserving the name of epic like the _ geste of robin hood _ -lrb- 53 -rrb- the matter of rome consist largely of tale from greek and roman source and the two great cycle of these romance deal with the deed of alexander a favorite hero and the siege of troy with which the briton think they have some historic connection to these be add a large number of tale from oriental source and in the exuberant imagination of the latter we see the influence which the saracen -- those nimble wit who give we we first modern science and who still revel in the _ arabian night _ -- have begin to exercise on the literature of europe to the english reader at least the most interesting of the romance be those which deal with the exploit of arthur and he knight of the round table -- the richest storehouse of romance which we literature have ever find there be many cycle of arthurian romance chief of which be those of gawain launcelot merlin the quest of the holy grail and the death of arthur in precede section we have see how these fascinating romance be use by geoffrey and the french writer and how through the french they find they way into english appear first in we speech in layamon 's _ brut _ the point to remember be that while the legend be celtic in origin they literary form be due to french poet who originate the metrical romance all we early english romance be either copy or translation of the french and this be true not only of the matter of france and rome but of celtic hero like arthur and english hero like guy of warwick and robin hood the most interesting of all arthurian romance be those of the gawain cycle -lrb- 54 -rrb- and of these the story of _ sir gawain and the green knight _ be best worth read for many reason first though the material be take from french source -lrb- 55 -rrb- the english workmanship be the finest of we early romance second the unknown author of this romance probably write also the pearl and be the greatest english poet of the norman period third the poem itself with its dramatic interest its vivid description and its moral purity be one of the most delightful old romance in any language in form _ sir gawain _ be a interesting combination of french and saxon element it be write in a elaborate stanza combine meter and alliteration at the end of each stanza be a rimed refrain call by the french a tail rime we give here a brief outline of the story but if the reader desire the poem itself he be advise to begin with a modern version as the original be in the west midland dialect and be exceedingly difficult to follow on new year 's day while arthur and he knight be keep the yuletide feast at camelot a gigantic knight in green enter the banquet hall on horseback and challenge the bravest knight present to a exchange of blow that be he will expose he neck to a blow of he own big battle-ax if any knight will agree to abide a blow in return after some natural consternation and a fine speech by arthur gawain accept the challenge take the battle-ax and with one blow send the giant 's head roll through the hall the green knight who be evidently a terrible magician pick up he head and mount he horse he hold out he head and the ghastly lip speak warn gawain to be faithful to he promise and to seek through the world till he find the green chapel there on next new year 's day the green knight will meet he and return the blow the second canto of the poem describe gawain 's long journey through the wilderness on he steed gringolet and he adventure with storm and cold with wild beast and monster as he seek in vain for the green chapel on christmas eve in the midst of a vast forest he offer a prayer to mary mildest mother so dear and be reward by sight of a great castle he enter and be royally entertain by the host a aged hero and by he wife who be the most beautiful woman the knight ever behold gawain learn that he be at last near the green chapel and settle down for a little comfort after he long quest the next canto show the life in the castle and describe a curious compact between the host who go hunting daily and the knight who remain in the castle to entertain the young wife the compact be that at night each man shall give the other whatever good thing he obtain during the day while the host be hunting the young woman try in vain to induce gawain to make love to she and end by give he a kiss when the host return and give he guest the game he have kill gawain return the kiss on the third day she temptation have twice fail the lady offer gawain a ring which he refuse but when she offer a magic green girdle that will preserve the wearer from death gawain who remember the giant 's ax so soon to fall on he neck accept the girdle as a jewel for the jeopardy and promise the lady to keep the gift secret here then be two conflicting compact when the host return and offer he game gawain return the kiss but say nothing of the green girdle the last canto bring we knight to the green chapel after he be repeatedly warn to turn back in the face of certain death the chapel be a terrible place in the midst of desolation and as gawain approach he hear a terrifying sound the grate of steel on stone where the giant be sharpen a new battle-ax the green knight appear and gawain true to he compact offer he neck for the blow twice the ax swing harmlessly the third time it fall on he shoulder and wound he whereupon gawain jump for he armor draw he sword and warn the giant that the compact call for only one blow and that if another be offer he will defend himself then the green knight explain thing he be lord of the castle where gawain have be entertain for day past the first two swing of the ax be harmless because gawain have be true to he compact and twice return the kiss the last blow have wound he because he conceal the gift of the green girdle which belong to the green knight and be weave by he wife moreover the whole thing have be arrange by morgain the fay-woman -lrb- a enemy of queen guinevere who appear often in the arthurian romance -rrb- full of shame gawain throw back the gift and be ready to atone for he deception but the green knight think he have already atone and present the green girdle as a free gift gawain return to arthur 's court tell the whole story frankly and ever after that the knight of the round table wear a green girdle in he honor -lrb- 56 -rrb- the pearl in the same manuscript with sir gawain be find three other remarkable poem write about 1350 and know to we in order as the pearl cleanness and patience the first be the most beautiful and receive its name from the translator and editor richard morri in 1864 patience be a paraphrase of the book of jonah cleanness moralize on the basis of bible story but the pearl be a intensely human and realistic picture of a father 's grief for he little daughter margaret my precious perle wythouten spot it be the saddest of all we early poem on the grave of he little one cover over with flower the father pour out he love and grief till in the summer stillness he fall asleep while we hear in the sunshine the drowsy hum of insect and the faraway sound of the reaper ' sickle he dream there and the dream grow into a vision beautiful he body lie still upon the grave while he spirit go to a land exquisite beyond all word where he come suddenly upon a stream that he can not cross as he wander along the bank seek in vain for a ford a marvel rise before he eye a crystal cliff and seat beneath it a little maiden who raise a happy shine face -- the face of he little margaret more then I lyste my drede aro i stod full stylle and dorste not calle wyth yghen open and mouth ful clo i stod as hende as hawk in halle he dare not speak for fear of break the spell but sweet as a lily she come down the crystal stream 's bank to meet and speak with he and tell he of the happy life of heaven and how to live to be worthy of it in he joy he listen forget all he grief then the heart of the man cry out for its own and he struggle to cross the stream to join she in the struggle the dream vanish he waken to find he eye wet and he head on the little mound that mark the spot where he heart be bury from the ideal of these three poem and from peculiarity of style and meter it be probable that they author write also _ sir gawain and the green knight _ if so the unknown author be the one genius of the age whose poetry of itself have power to interest we and who stand between cynewulf and chaucer as a worthy follower of the one and forerunner of the other miscellaneous literature of the norman period it be well-nigh impossible to classify the remain literature of this period and very little of it be now read except by advanced student those interested in the development of transition english will find in _ the ancren riwle _ ie rule of the anchoress -lrb- _ c _ 1225 -rrb- the most beautiful bit of old english prose ever write it be a book of excellent religious advice and comfort write for three lady who wish to live a religious life without however become nun or enter any religious order the author be bishop poore of salisbury accord to morton who first edit this old classic in 1853 orm 's _ ormulum _ write soon after the _ brut _ be a paraphrase of the gospel lesson for the year somewhat after the manner of cædmon 's _ paraphrase _ but without any of cædmon 's poetic fire and originality _ cursor mundus _ -lrb- _ c _ 1320 -rrb- be a very long poem which make a kind of metrical romance out of bible history and show the whole dealing of god with man from creation to domesday it be interesting as show a parallel to the cycle of miracle play which attempt to cover the same vast ground they be form in this age but we will study they later when we try to understand the rise of the drama in england besides these greater work a enormous number of fable and satire appear in this age copy or translate from the french like the metrical romance the most famous of these be the owl and the nightingale -- a long debate between the two bird one represent the gay side of life the other the sterner side of law and moral -- and land of cockaygne ie luxury land a keen satire on monk and monastic religion -lrb- 57 -rrb- while most of the literature of the time be a copy of the french and be intend only for the upper class here and there be singer who make ballad for the common people and these next to the metrical romance be the most interesting and significant of all the work of the norman period on account of its obscure origin and its oral transmission the ballad be always the most difficult of literary subject -lrb- 58 -rrb- we make here only three suggestion which may well be bear in mind : that ballad be produce continually in england from anglo-saxon time until the seventeenth century that for century they be the only really popular literature and that in the ballad alone one be able to understand the common people read for instance the ballad of the merrie greenwood man which gradually collect into the _ geste of robin hood _ and you will understand better perhaps than from read many history what the common people of england feel and think while they lord and master be busy with impossible metrical romance in these song speak the heart of the english folk there be lawlessness indeed but this seem justified by the oppression of the time and by the barbarous severity of the game law a intense hatred of sham and injustice lurk in every song but the hatred be save from bitterness by the humor with which captive especially rich churchman be solemnly lecture by the bandit while they squirm at sight of devilish torture prepare before they eye in order to make they give up they golden purse and the scene generally end in a bit of wild horse-play there be fight enough and ambush and sudden death lurk at every turn of the lonely road but there be also a rough honest chivalry for woman and a generous sharing of plunder with the poor and needy all literature be but a dream express and robin hood be the dream of a ignorant and oppressed but essentially noble people struggle and determine to be free far more poetical than the ballad and more interesting even than the romance be the little lyric of the period -- those tear and smile of long ago that crystallize into poem to tell we that the heart of man be alike in all age of these the best know be the luve ron -lrb- love rune or letter -rrb- of thomas de hale _ -lrb- c _ 1250 -rrb- springtime _ -lrb- c _ 1300 -rrb- begin lenten -lrb- spring -rrb- y come with luve to toune and the melodious love song alysoun write at the end of the thirteenth century by some unknown poet who herald the come of chaucer : bytuene mersh and averil when spray biginneth to springe the lutel foul -lrb- 59 -rrb- have hire wyl on hyre lud -lrb- 60 -rrb- to synge ich libbe -lrb- 61 -rrb- in love longinge for semlokest -lrb- 62 -rrb- of all thinge she may I

-rrb- and lyht -lrb- 68 -rrb- on alysoun summary of the norman period the norman be originally a hardy race of sea rover inhabit scandinavium in the tenth century they conquer a part of northern france which be still call normandy and rapidly adopt french civilization and the french language they conquest of anglo-saxon england under william duke of normandy begin with the battle of hasting in 1066 the literature which they bring to england be remarkable for its bright romantic tale of love and adventure in marked contrast with the strength and somberness of anglo-saxon poetry during the three century follow hasting norman and saxon gradually unite the anglo-saxon speech simplify itself by drop most of its teutonic inflection absorb eventually a large part of the french vocabulary and become we english language english literature be also a combination of french and saxon element the three chief effect of the conquest be _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ the bringing of roman civilization to england _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ the growth of nationality ie a strong centralized government instead of the loose union of saxon tribe _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ the new language and literature which be proclaim in chaucer at first the new literature be remarkably varied but of small intrinsic worth and very little of it be now read in we study we have note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- geoffrey 's history which be valuable

growth of the english national spirit follow the victory of edward and the black prince on french soil during the hundred year ' war in the rush of this great national movement separate england from the political tie of france and to a less degree from ecclesiastical bondage to rome the mutual distrust and jealousy which have divide noble and common be momentarily sweep aside by a wave of patriotic enthusiasm the french language lose its official prestige and english become the speech not only of the common people but of court and parliament as well the second movement be social it fall largely within the reign of edward 's successor richard ii and mark the grow discontent with the contrast between luxury and poverty between the idle wealthy class and the overtax peasant sometimes this movement be quiet and strong as when wyclif arouse the conscience of england again it have the portentous rumble of a approach tempest as when john ball harangue a multitude of discontented peasant on black heath common use the famous text : when adam delve and eve span who be then the gentleman and again it break out into the violent rebellion of wat tyler all these thing show the same saxon spirit that have win its freedom in a thousand year ' struggle against foreign enemy and that now feel itself oppress by a social and industrial tyranny in its own midst aside from these two movement the age be one of unusual stir and progress chivalry that mediæval institution of mixed good and evil be in its indian summer -- a sentiment rather than a practical system trade and its resultant wealth and luxury be increase enormously follow trade as the viking have follow glory the english begin to be a conquering and colonize people like the anglo-saxon the native shed something of he insularity and become a traveler go first to view the place where trade have open the way and return with wider interest and a larger horizon above all the first dawn of the renaissance be herald in england as in spain and italy by the appearance of a national literature five writer of the age the literary movement of the age clearly reflect the stir life of the time there be langland voice the social discontent preach the equality of man and the dignity of labor wyclif greatest of english religious reformer give the gospel to the people in they own tongue and the freedom of the gospel in unnumbered tract and address gower the scholar and literary man criticise this vigorous life and plainly afraid of its consequence and mandeville the traveler romance about the wonder to be see abroad above all there be chaucer -- scholar traveler business man courtier share in all the stir life of he time and reflect it in literature as no other but shakespeare have ever do outside of england the greatest literary influence of the age be that of dante petrarch and boccaccio whose work then at the summit of they influence in italy profoundly affect the literature of all europe chaucer -lrb- 1340-1400 -rrb- ` what man artow ' quod he ` thou lokest as thou woldest finde a hare for ever upon the ground i see thee stare approchë neer and loke up merily he semeth elvish by he contenaunce ' -lrb- the host 's description of chaucer prologue _ sir thopa _ -rrb- on read chaucer the difficulty of read chaucer be more apparent than real be due largely to obsolete spelling and there be small necessity for use any modern version of the poet 's work which seem to miss the quiet charm and dry humor of the original if the reader will observe the follow general rule -lrb- which of necessity ignore many difference in pronunciation of fourteenth-century english -rrb- he may in a hour or two learn to read chaucer almost as easily as shakespeare : -lrb- 1 -rrb- get the lilt of the line and let the meter itself decide how final syllable be to be pronounced remember that chaucer be among the most musical of poet and that there be melody in nearly every line if the verse seem rough it be because we do not read it correctly -lrb- 2 -rrb- vowel in chaucer have much the same value as in modern german consonant be practically the same as in modern english -lrb- 3 -rrb- pronounce aloud any strange-looking word where the eye fail the ear will often recognize the meaning if eye and ear both fail then consult the glossary find in every good edition of the poet 's

the first of the word follow be run together as in read virgil at the end of a line the _ e _ if lightly pronounced add melody to the verse -lrb- 70 -rrb- in deal with chaucer 's masterpiece the reader be urge to read widely at first for the simple pleasure of the story and to remember that poetry and romance be more interesting and important than middle english when we like and appreciate chaucer -- he poetry he humor he good story he kind heart -- it will be time enough to study he language life of chaucer for we convenience the life of chaucer be divide into three period the first of thirty year include he youth and early manhood in which time he be influence almost exclusively by french literary model the second period of fifteen year cover chaucer 's active life as diplomat and man of affair and in this the italian influence seem stronger than the french the third of fifteen year generally know as the english period be the time of chaucer 's richest development he live at home observe life closely but kindly and while the french influence be still strong as show in the _ canterbury tale _ he seem to grow more independent of foreign model and be dominate chiefly by the vigorous life of he own english people chaucer 's boyhood be spend in london on thame street near the river where the world 's commerce be continually come and go there he see daily the shipman of the _ canterbury tale _ just home in he good ship maudelayne with the fascination of unknown land in he clothes and conversation of he education we know nothing except that he be a great reader he father be a wine merchant purveyor to the royal household and from this accidental relation between trade and royalty may have arise the fact that at seventeen year chaucer be make page to the princess elizabeth this be the beginning of he connection with the brilliant court which in the next forty year under three king he be to know so intimately at nineteen he go with the king on one of the many expedition of the hundred year ' war and here he see chivalry and all the pageantry of mediæval war at the height of they outward splendor take prisoner at the unsuccessful siege of rheim he be say to have be ransom by money out of the royal purse return to england he become after a few year squire of the royal household the personal attendant and confidant of the king it be during this first period that he marry a maid of honor to the queen this be probably philippa roet sister to the wife of john of gaunt the famous duke of lancaster from numerous whimsical reference in he early poem it have be think that this marriage into a noble family be not a happy one but this be purely a matter of supposition or of doubtful inference in 1370 chaucer be send abroad on the first of those diplomatic mission that be to occupy the greater part of the next fifteen year two year later he make he first official visit to italy to arrange a commercial treaty with genoa and from this time be noticeable a rapid development in he literary power and the prominence of italian literary influence during the interval between he different mission he fill various office at home chief of which be comptroller of custom at the port of london a enormous amount of personal labor be involve but chaucer seem to have find time to follow he spirit into the new field of italian literature : for whan thy labor doon al be and hast y-maad thy rekeninge in stede of reste and newe thinge thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon and also domb as any stoon thou sittest at another boke til fully dasw be thy loke and livest thus as a hermyte -lrb- 71 -rrb- in 1386 chaucer be elect member of parliament from kent and the distinctly english period of he life and work begin though exceedingly busy in public affair and as receiver of custom he heart be still with he book from which only nature could win he : and as for I though that my wit be lyte on boke for to rede i I delyte and to hem yeve i feyth and ful credence and in myn herte have hem in reverence so hertely that ther be game noon that fro my boke maketh I to goon but hit be seldom on the holyday save certeynly whan that the month of may be comen and that i here the foule singe and that the floure ginnen for to springe -- farwel my book and my devocioun -lrb- 72 -rrb- in the fourteenth century politics seem to have be for honest man a very uncertain business chaucer naturally adhere to the party of john of gaunt and he fortune rise or fall with those of he leader from this time until he death he be up and down on the political ladder to-day with money and good prospects to-morrow in poverty and neglect write he complaint to he empty pur which he humorously call he saveor doun in this werlde here this poem call the king 's attention to the poet 's need and increase he pension but he have but few month to enjoy the effect of this unusual complaint for he die the next year 1400 and be bury with honor in westminster abbey the last period of he life though outwardly most trouble be the most fruitful of all he truth or good counsel reveal the quiet beautiful spirit of he life unspoiled either by the greed of trade or the trickery of politics : flee fro the pree and dwelle with sothfastnesse suffyce unto thy good though hit be smal for hord -lrb- 73 -rrb- have hate and climb tikelnesse pree -lrb- 74 -rrb- have envye

lede : and trouthe shal delivere hit be no drede work of chaucer first period the work of chaucer be roughly divide into three class correspond to the three period of he life it should be remembered however that it be impossible to fix exact date for most of he work some of he _ canterbury tale _ be write earlier than the english period and be only group with the other in he final arrangement the best know though not the best poem of the first period be the _ romaunt of the rose _ -lrb- 83 -rrb- a translation from the french _ roman de la rise _ the most popular poem of the middle age -- a graceful but exceedingly tiresome allegory of the whole course of love the rise grow in its mystic garden be typical of the lady beauty gather the rose represent the lover 's attempt to win he lady 's favor and the different feeling arouse -- love hate envy jealousy idleness sweet look -- be the allegorical person of the poet 's drama chaucer translate this universal favorite put in some original english touch but of the present _ romaunt _ only the first seventeen hundred line be believe to be chaucer 's own work perhaps the best poem of this period be the dethe of blanche the duchesse better know as the boke of the duchesse a poem of considerable dramatic and emotional power write after the death of blanche wife of chaucer 's patron john of gaunt additional poem be the compleynte to pite a graceful love poem the a b c a prayer to the virgin translate from the french of a cistercian monk its verse begin with the successive letter of the alphabet and a number of what chaucer call ballad roundel and virelay with which say he friend gower the land be fill the latter be imitation of the prevail french love ditty second period the chief work of the second or italian period be _ troilus and criseyde _ a poem of eight thousand line the original story be a favorite of many author during the middle age and shakespeare make use of it in he _ troilus and cressida _ the immediate source of chaucer 's poem be boccaccio 's _ il filostrato _ the love-smitten one but he use he material very freely to reflect the ideal of he own age and society and so give to the whole story a dramatic force and beauty which it have never know before the hous of fame be one of chaucer 's unfinished poem have the rare combination of lofty thought and simple homely language show the influence of the great italian master in the poem the author be carry away in a dream by a great eagle from the brittle temple of venus in a sandy wilderness up to the hall of fame to this house come all rumor of earth as the spark fly upward the house stand on a rock of ice writen ful of name of folk that hadden grete fame many of these have disappear as the ice melt but the older name be clear as when first write for many of he idea chaucer be indebted to dante ovid and virgil but the unusual conception and the splendid workmanship be all he own the third great poem of the period be the _ legende of goode wimman _ as he be rest in the field among the daisy he fall asleep and a gay procession draw near first come the love god lead by the hand alcesti model of all wifely virtue whose emblem be the daisy and behind they follow a troup of glorious woman all of whom have be faithful in love they gather about the poet the god upbraid he for have translate the _ romance of the rose _ and for he early poem reflect on the vanity and fickleness of woman alcesti intercede for he and offer pardon if he will atone for he error by write a glorious legend of good woman chaucer promise and as soon as he awake set himself to the task nine legend be write of which thisbe be perhaps the best it be probable that chaucer intend to make this he masterpiece devote many year to story of famous woman who be true to love but either because he weary of he theme or because the plan of the _ canterbury tale _ be grow in he mind he abandon the task in the middle of he ninth legend -- fortunately perhaps for the reader will find the prologue more interesting than any of the legend third period chaucer 's masterpiece the _ canterbury tale _ one of the most famous work in all literature fill the third or english period of he life the plan of the work be magnificent : to represent the wide sweep of english life by gather a motley company together and let each class of society tell its own favorite story though the great work be never finish chaucer succeed in he purpose so well that in the _ canterbury tale _ he have give we a picture of contemporary english life its work and play its deed and dream its fun and sympathy and hearty joy of live such as no other single work of literature have ever equal plan of the canterbury tale opposite old london at the southern end of london bridge once stand the tabard inn of southwark a quarter make famous not only by the _ canterbury tale _ but also by the first playhouse where shakespeare have he training this southwark be the point of departure of all travel to the south of england especially of those mediæval pilgrimage to the shrine of thoma a becket in canterbury on a spring evening at the inspiring time of the year when longen folk to goon on pilgrimage chaucer alight at the tabard inn and find it occupy by a various company of people bent on a pilgrimage chance alone have bring they together for it be the custom of pilgrim to wait at some friendly inn until a sufficient company be gather to make the journey pleasant and safe from robber that might be encounter on the way chaucer join this company which include all class of english society from the oxford scholar to the drunken miller and accept gladly they invitation to go with they on the morrow at supper the jovial host of the tabard inn suggest that to enliven the journey each of the company shall tell four tale two go and two come on whatever subject shall suit he best the host will travel with they as master of ceremony and whoever tell the best story shall be give a fine supper at the general expense when they all come back again -- a shrewd bit of business and a fine idea as the pilgrim all agree when they draw lot for the first story the chance fall to the knight who tell one of the best of the _ canterbury tale _ the chivalric story of palamon and arcite then the tale follow rapidly each with its prologue and epilogue tell how the story come about and its effect on the merry company interruption be numerous the narrative be full of life and movement as when the miller get drunk and insist on tell he tale out of season or when they stop at a friendly inn for the night or when the poet with sly humor start he story of sir thopa in dreary imitation of the metrical romance of the day and be roar at by the host for he drasty ryming with chaucer we laugh at he own expense and be ready for the next tale from the number of person in the company thirty-two in all it be evident that chaucer meditate a immense work of one hundred and twenty-eight tale which should cover the whole life of england only twenty-four be write some of these be incomplete and other be take from he earlier work to fill out the general plan of the _ canterbury tale _ incomplete as they be they cover a wide range include story of love and chivalry of saint and legend travel adventure animal fable allegory satire and the coarse humor of the common people though all but two be write in verse and abound in exquisite poetical touch they be story as well as poem and chaucer be to be regard as we first short-story teller as well as we first modern poet the work end with a kindly farewell from the poet to he reader and so here taketh the makere of this book he leve prologue to the canterbury tale in the famous prologue the poet make we acquaint with the various character of he drama until chaucer 's day popular literature have be busy chiefly with the god and hero of a golden age it have be essentially romantic and so have never attempt to study man and woman as they be or to describe they so that the reader recognize they not as ideal hero but as he own neighbor chaucer not only attempt this new realistic task but accomplish it so well that he character be instantly recognize as true to life and they have since become the permanent possession of we literature beowulf and roland be ideal hero essentially creature of the imagination but the merry host of the tabard inn madame eglantyne the fat monk the parish priest the kindly plowman the poor scholar with he bookës black and red -- all seem more like personal acquaintance than character in a book say dryden : i see all the pilgrim they humor they feature and they very dress as distinctly as if i have sup with they at the tabard in southwark chaucer be the first english writer to bring the atmosphere of romantic interest about the man and woman and the daily work of one 's own world -- which be the aim of nearly all modern literature the historian of we literature be tempt to linger over this prologue and to quote from it passage after passage to show how keenly and yet kindly we first modern poet observe he fellow-men the character too attract one like a good play : the verray parfit gentil knight and he manly son the modest prioress model of sweet piety and society manners the sport monk and the fat friar the discreet man of law the well-fed country squire the sailor just home from sea the canny doctor the lovable parish priest who teach true religion to he flock but first he folw it himselve the coarse but good-hearted wyf of bath the thieve miller lead the pilgrim to the music of he bagpipe -- all these and many other from every walk of english life and all describe with a quiet kindly humor which seek instinctively the best in human nature and which have a ample garment of charity to cover even its fault and failing here indeed as dryden say be god 's plenty probably no keener or kinder critic ever describe he fellow and in this immortal prologue chaucer be a model for all those who would put we human life into write the student should read it entire as a introduction not only to the poet but to all we modern literature the knight 's tale as a story palamon and arcite be in many respects the best of the _ canterbury tale _ reflect as it do the ideal of the time in regard to romantic love and knightly duty though its dialogue and description be somewhat too long and interrupt the story yet it show chaucer at he best in he dramatic power he exquisite appreciation of nature and he tender yet profound philosophy of living which could overlook much of human frailty in the thought that infinite be the sorwe and the tere of oldë folk and folk of tendre yere the idea of the story be borrow from boccaccio but part of the original tale be much older and belong to the common literary stock of the middle age like shakespeare chaucer take the material for he poem wherever he find it and he originality consist in give to a old story some present human interest make it express the life and ideal of he own age in this respect the knight 's tale be remarkable its name be those of a ancient civilization but its character be man and woman of the english nobility as chaucer know they in consequence the story have many anachronism such as the mediæval tournament before the temple of mar but the reader scarcely notice these thing be absorb in the dramatic interest of the narrative briefly the knight 's tale be the story of two young man fast friend who be find wound on the battlefield and take prisoner to athen there from they dungeon window they behold the fair maid emily both fall desperately in love with she and they friendship turn to strenuous rivalry one be pardon the other escape and then knight empire nature -- the whole universe follow they desperate effort to win one small maiden who pray meanwhile to be deliver from both she bothersome suitor as the best of the _ canterbury tale _ be now easily accessible we omit here all quotation the story must be read entire with the prioress ' tale of hugh of lincoln the clerk 's tale of patient griselda and the nun 's priest 's merry tale of chanticleer and the fox if the reader would appreciate the variety and charm of we first modern poet and story-teller form of chaucer 's poetry there be three principal meter to be find in chaucer 's verse in the _ canterbury tale _ he use line of ten syllable and five accent each and the line run in couplet : he eyen twinkle in he heed aright as doon the sterre in the frosty night the same musical measure arrange in seven-line stanza but with a different rime call the rime royal be find in its most perfect form in _ troilus _ o blisful light of whiche the beme clere adorneth al the thridde hevene faire o sonne leef o jove doughter dere plesaunce of love o goodly debonaire in gentil herte ay redy to repaire o verray cause of hele and of gladnesse y-hery be thy might and thy goodnesse in hevene and helle in erthe and salte see be feel thy might if that i wel descerne as man brid best fish herbe and grene tree thee fele in tyme with vapor eterne god loveth and to love wol nought werne and in this world no lyve creature with-outen love be worth or may endure -lrb- 84 -rrb- the third meter be the eight-syllable line with four accent the line rime in couplet as in the boke of the duchesse : thereto she coude so wel pleye whan that hir liste that i dar seye that she be lyk to torche bright that every man may take-of light ynough and hit have never the lesse besides these principal meter chaucer in he short poem use many other poetical form model after the french who in the fourteenth century be cunning worker in every form of verse chief among these be the difficult but exquisite rondel now welcom somer with thy sonne softe which close the parliament of fowl and the ballad flee fro the pree which have be already quote in the monk 's tale there be a melodious measure which may have furnish the model for spenser 's famous stanza -lrb- 85 -rrb- chaucer 's poetry be extremely musical and must be judge by the ear rather than by the eye to the modern reader the line appear break and uneven but if one read they over a few time he soon catch the perfect swing of the measure and find that he be in the hand of a master whose ear be delicately sensitive to the smallest accent there be a lilt in all he line which be marvelous when we consider that he be the first to show we the poetic possibility of the language he claim upon we gratitude be twofold : -lrb- 86 -rrb- first for discover the music that be in we english speech and second for he influence in fix the midland dialect as the literary language of england chaucer 's contemporary william langland -lrb- 1332 -rrb- life very little be know of langland he be bear probably near malvern in worcestershire the son of a poor freeman and in he early life live in the field as a shepherd later he go to london with he wife and child get a hungry living as clerk in the church he real life meanwhile be that of a seer a prophet after isaiah 's own heart if we may judge by the prophecy which soon find a voice in _ pier plowman _ in 1399 after the success of he great work he be possibly write another poem call _ richard the redeless _ a protest against richard ii but we be not certain of the authorship of this poem which be leave unfinished by the assassination of the king after 1399 langland disappear utterly and the date of he death be unknown pier plowman the voice of he that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord might well be write at the beginning of this remarkable poem truth sincerity a direct and practical appeal to conscience and a vision of right triumphant over wrong -- these be the element of all prophecy and it be undoubtedly these element in _ pier plowman _ that produce such a impression on the people of england for century literature have be busy in please the upper class chiefly but here at last be a great poem which appeal directly to the common people and its success be enormous the whole poem be traditionally attribute to langland but it be now know to be the work of several different writer it first appear in 1362 as a poem of eighteen hundred line and this may have be langland 's work in the next thirty year during the desperate social condition which lead to tyler 's rebellion it be repeatedly revise and enlarged by different hand till it reach its final form of about fifteen thousand line the poem as we read it now be in two distinct part the first contain the vision of pier the second a series of vision call the search for dowel dobet dobest -lrb- do well better best -rrb- the entire poem be in strongly accented alliterative line something like _ beowulf _ and its immense popularity show that the common people still cherish this easily memorize form of saxon poetry its tremendous appeal to justice and common honesty its clarion call to every man whether king priest noble or laborer to do he christian duty take from it any trace of prejudice or bigotry with which such work usually abound its loyalty to the church while denounce abuse that have creep into it in that period be one of the great influence which lead to the reformation in england its two great principle the equality of man before god and the dignity of honest labor rouse a whole nation of freeman altogether it be one of the world 's great work partly because of its national influence partly because it be the very best picture we possess of the social life of the fourteenth century : briefly _ pier plowman _ be a allegory of life in the first vision that of the field full of folk the poet lie down on the malvern hill on a may morning and a vision come to he in sleep on the plain beneath he gather a multitude of folk a vast crowd express the varied life of the world all class and condition be there workingman be toiling that other may seize all the first fruit of they labor and live high on the proceeds and the genius of the throng be lady bribery a powerfully draw figure express the corrupt social life of the time the next vision be those of the seven deadly sin allegorical figure but powerful as those of _ pilgrim 's progress _ make the allegory of the _ romaunt of the rose _ seem like shadow in comparison these all come to pier ask the way to truth but pier be plow he half acre and refuse to leave he work and lead they he set they all to honest toil as the best possible remedy for they vice and preach the gospel of work as a preparation for salvation throughout the poem pier bear strong resemblance to john baptist preach to the crowd in the wilderness the later vision be proclamation of the moral and spiritual life of man the poem grow dramatic in its intensity rise to its highest power in pier 's triumph over death and then the poet wake from he vision with the sound of easter bell ring in he ear here be a few line to illustrate the style and language but the whole poem must be read if one be to understand its crude strength and prophetic spirit : in a somer sesun whon softe be the sonne i schop -lrb- 87 -rrb- I into a shroud as i a scheep be in habite as a heremite unholy of werke go wyde in this world wondre to here bote in a maye mornynge on malverne hulle I

in the native tongue and the power of he lollard to stir the soul of the common folk be too well know historically to need repetition though a university man and a profound scholar he side with langland and he interest be with the people rather than with the privileged class for whom chaucer write he great work which earn he he title of father of english prose be the translation of the bible wyclif himself translate the gospel and much more of the new testament the rest be finish by he follower especially by nichola of hereford these translation be make from the latin vulgate not from the original greek and hebrew and the whole work be revise in 1388 by john purvey a disciple of wyclif it be impossible to overestimate the influence of this work both on we english prose and on the life of the english people though wyclif 's work be now unread except by occasional scholar he still occupy a very high place in we literature he translation of the bible be slowly copy all over england and so fix a national standard of english prose to replace the various dialect portion of this translation in the form of favorite passage from scripture be copy by thousand and for the first time in we history a standard of pure english be establish in the home of the common people as a suggestion of the language of that day we quote a few familiar sentence from the sermon on the mount as give in the later version of wyclif 's gospel : and he openyde he mouth and taughte hem and seide blessid ben pore man in spirit for the kyngdom of hevene be herne -lrb- 91 -rrb- blessid ben mylde man for

sir john maundeville _ write in excellent style in the midland dialect which be then become the literary language of england for year this interesting work and its unknown author be subject of endless dispute but it be now fairly certain that this collection of traveler ' tale be simply a compilation from odoric marco polo and various other source the original work be probably in french which be speedily translate into latin then into english and other language and wherever it appear it become extremely popular its marvelous story of foreign land be exactly suit to the credulous spirit of the age -lrb- 103 -rrb- at the present time there be say to be three hundred copy manuscript of mandeville in various language -- more probably than of any other work save the gospel in the prologue of the english version the author call himself john maundeville and give a outline of he wide travels during thirty year but the name be probably a blind the prologue more or less spurious and the real compiler be still to be discover the modern reader may spend a hour or two very pleasantly in this old wonderland on its literary side the book be remarkable though a translation as be the first prose

history of the period political change the century and a half follow the death of chaucer -lrb- 1400-1550 -rrb- be the most volcanic period of english history the land be sweep by vast change inseparable from the rapid accumulation of national power but since power be the most dangerous of gift until man have learn to control it these change seem at first to have no specific aim or direction henry v -- whose erratic yet vigorous life as depict by shakespeare be typical of the life of he time -- first let europe feel the might of the new national spirit to divert that grow and unruly spirit from rebellion at home henry lead he army abroad in the apparently impossible attempt to gain for himself three thing : a french wife a french revenue and the french crown itself the battle of agincourt be fight in 1415 and five year later by the treaty of troye france acknowledge he right to all he outrageous demand the uselessness of the terrific struggle on french soil be show by the rapidity with which all its result be sweep away when henry die in 1422 leave he son heir to the crown of france and england a magnificent recumbent statue with head of pure silver be place in westminster abbey to commemorate he victory the silver head be presently steal and the loss be typical of all that he have struggle for he son henry vi be but the shadow of a king a puppet in the hand of powerful noble who seize the power of england and turn it to self - destruction meanwhile all he foreign possession be win back by the french under the magic leadership of joan of arc cade 's rebellion -lrb- 1450 -rrb- and the bloody war of the rose -lrb- 1455-1485 -rrb- be name to show how the energy of england be violently destroy itself like a great engine that have lose its balance wheel the frightful reign of richard iii follow which have however this redeeming quality that it mark the end of civil war and the self-destruction of feudalism and make possible a new growth of english national sentiment under the popular tudor in the long reign of henry viii the change be less violent but have more purpose and significance he age be mark by a steady increase in the national power at home and abroad by the entrance of the reformation by a side door and by the final separation of england from all ecclesiastical bondage in parliament 's famous act of supremacy in previous reign chivalry and the old feudal system have practically be banish now monasticism the third mediæval institution with its mixed evil and good receive its death-blow in the wholesale suppression of the monastery and the removal of abbot from the house of lord notwithstanding the evil character of the king and the hypocrisy of proclaim such a creature the head of any church or the defender of any faith we acquiesce silently in stubb 's declaration -lrb- 105 -rrb- that the world owe some of its greatest debt to man from whose memory the world recoil while england during this period be in constant political strife yet rise slowly like the spiral flight of a eagle to height of national greatness intellectually it move forward with bewildering rapidity printing be bring to england by caxton -lrb- _ c _ 1476 -rrb- and for the first time in history it be possible for a book or a idea to reach the whole nation school and university be establish in place of the old monastery greek idea and greek culture come to england in the renaissance and man 's spiritual freedom be proclaim in the reformation the great name of the period be numerous and significant but literature be strangely silent probably the very turmoil of the age prevent any literary development for literature be one of the art of peace it require quiet and meditation rather than activity and the stir life of the renaissance have first to be live before it could express itself in the new literature of the elizabethan period the revival of learn the revival of learn denote in its broadest sense that gradual enlightenment of the human mind after the darkness of the middle age the name renaissance and humanism which be often apply to the same movement have properly a narrower significance the term renaissance though use by many writer to denote the whole transition from the middle age to the modern world -lrb- 106 -rrb- be more correctly apply to the revival of art result from the discovery and imitation of classic model in the fourteenth and fifteenth century humanism apply to the revival of classic literature and be so call by its leader follow the example of petrarch because they hold that the study of the classic _ literae humaniore _ -- ie the more human writings rather than the old theology -- be the best means of promote the largest human interest we use the term revival of learn to cover the whole movement whose essence be accord to lamartine that man discover himself and the universe and accord to taine that man so long blind have suddenly open he eye and see we shall understand this better if we remember that in the middle age man 's whole world consist of the narrow mediterranean and the nation that cluster about it and that this little world seem bound by impassable barrier as if god have say to they sailor hitherto shalt thou come but no farther man 's mind also be bound by the same narrow line he culture as measure by the great deductive system of scholasticism consist not in discovery but rather in accept certain principle and tradition establish by divine and ecclesiastical authority as the basis of all truth these be he pillar of hercule he mental and spiritual bound that he must not pass and within these like a child play with letter block he proceed to build he intellectual system only as we remember they limitation can we appreciate the heroism of these toiler of the middle age giant in intellect yet play with child 's toy ignorant of the law and force of the universe while debate the essence and locomotion of angel eager to learn yet forbid to enter fresh field in the right of free exploration and the joy of individual discovery the revival stir these man as the voyage of da gama and columbus stir the mariner of the mediterranean first come the science and invention of the arab make they way slowly against the prejudice of the authority and open man 's eye to the unexplored realm of nature then come the flood of greek literature which the new art of printing carry swiftly to every school in europe reveal a new world of poetry and philosophy scholar flock to the university as adventurer to the new world of america and there the old authority receive a deathblow truth only be authority to search for truth everywhere as man seek for new land and gold and the fountain of youth -- that be the new spirit which awake in europe with the revival of learn ii literature of the revival the hundred and fifty year of the revival period be singularly destitute of good literature man 's mind be too much occupy with religious and political change and with the rapid enlargement of the mental horizon to find time for that peace and leisure which be essential for literary result perhaps also the flood of newly discover classic which occupy scholar and the new printing press alike be by they very power and abundance a discouragement of native talent roger ascham -lrb- 1515-1568 -rrb- a famous classical scholar who publish a book call _ toxophilus _ -lrb- school of shooting -rrb- in 1545 express in he preface or apology a very widespread dissatisfaction over the neglect of native literature when he say and as for ye latin or greke tongue every thing be so excellently do in they that none can do better : in the englysh tonge contrary every thinge in a maner so meanly both for the matter and handelynge that no man can do worse on the continent also this new interest in the classic serve to check the growth of native literature in italy especially for a full century after the brilliant age of dante and petrarch no great literature be produce and the italian language itself seem to go backward -lrb- 107 -rrb- the truth be that these great writer be like chaucer far in advance of they age and that the mediæval mind be too narrow too scantily furnish with idea to produce a varied literature the fifteenth century be a age of preparation of learn the beginning of science and of get acquaint with the great ideal -- the stern law the profound philosophy the suggestive mythology and the noble poetry of the greek and roman so the mind be furnish with idea for a new literature with the exception of malory 's _ morte d'arthur _ -lrb- which be still mediæval in spirit -rrb- the student will find little of interest in the literature of this period we give here a brief summary of the man and the book most worthy of remembrance but for the real literature of the renaissance one must go forward a century and a half to the age of elizabeth the two greatest book which appear in england during this period be undoubtedly erasmus 's -lrb- 108 -rrb- _ praise of folly _ -lrb- _ encomium moriae _ -rrb- and more 's _ utopia _ the famous kingdom of nowhere both be write in latin but be speedily translate into all european language the _ praise of folly _ be like a song of victory for the new learning which have drive away vice ignorance and superstition the three foe of humanity it be publish in 1511 after the accession of henry viii folly be represent as don cap and bell and mount a pulpit where the vice and cruelty of king the selfishness and ignorance of the clergy and the foolish standard of education be satirize without mercy more 's _ utopia _ publish in 1516 be a powerful and original study of social condition unlike anything which have ever appear in any literature -lrb- 109 -rrb- in we own day we have see its influence in bellamy 's _ look backward _ a enormously successful book which recently set people to thinking of the unnecessary cruelty of modern social condition more learn from a sailor one of amerigo vespuccus 's companion of a wonderful kingdom of nowhere in which all question of labor government society and religion have be easily settle by simple justice and common sense in this _ utopia _ we find for the first time as the foundation of civilized society the three great word liberty fraternity equality which retain they inspiration through all the violence of the french revolution and which be still the unrealized ideal of every free government as he hear of this wonderful country more wonder why after fifteen century of christianity he own land be so little civilized and as we read the book to-day we ask ourselves the same question the splendid dream be still far from be realize yet it seem as if any nation could become utopia in a single generation so simple and just be the requirement greater than either of these book in its influence upon the common people be tyndale 's translation of the new testament -lrb- 1525 -rrb- which fix a standard of good english and at the same time bring that standard not only to scholar but to the home of the common people tyndale make he translation from the original greek and later translate part of the old testament from the hebrew much of tyndale 's work be include in cranmer 's bible know also as the great bible in 1539 and be read in every parish church in england it be the foundation for the authorize version which appear nearly a century later and become the standard for the whole english-speaking race wyatt and surrey in 1557 appear probably the first print collection of miscellaneous english poem know as _ tottel 's miscellany _ it contain the work of the so-called courtly maker or poet which have hitherto circulate in manuscript form for the benefit of the court about half of these poem be the work of sir thoma wyatt -lrb- 1503-1542 -rrb- and of henry howard earl of surrey -lrb- 1517-1547 -rrb- both together write amorous sonnet model after the italian introduce a new verse form which although very difficult have be a favorite ever since with we english poet -lrb- 110 -rrb- surrey be note not for any especial worth or originality of he own poem but rather for he translation of two book of virgil in strange meter the strange meter be the blank verse which have never before appear in english the chief literary work of these two man therefore be to introduce the sonnet and the blank verse -- one the most dainty the other the most flexible and characteristic form of english poetry -- which in the hand of shakespeare and milton be use to make the world 's masterpiece malory 's morte d'arthur the greatest english work of this period measure by its effect on subsequent literature be undoubtedly the _ morte d'arthur _ a collection of the arthurian romance tell in simple and vivid prose of sir thoma malory the author caxton -lrb- 111 -rrb- in he introduction say that he be a knight and complete he work in 1470 fifteen year before caxton print it the record add that he be the servant of jesu both by day and night beyond that we know little -lrb- 112 -rrb- except what may be infer from the splendid work itself malory group the legend about the central idea of the search for the holy grail though many of the story like tristram and isolde be purely pagan malory treat they all in such a way as to preserve the whole spirit of mediæval christianity as it have be preserve in no other work it be to malory rather than to layamon or to the early french writer that shakespeare and he contemporary turn for they material and in we own age he have supply tennyson and matthew arnold and swinburne and morri with the inspiration for the idyll of the king and the death of tristram and the other exquisite poem which center about arthur and the knight of he round table in subject-matter the book belong to the mediæval age but malory himself with he desire to preserve the literary monument of the past belong to the renaissance and he deserve we lasting gratitude for attempt to preserve the legend and poetry of britain at a time when scholar be chiefly busy with the classic of greece and rome as the arthurian legend be one of the great recur motive of english literature malory 's work should be better know he story may be and should be tell to every child as part of he literary inheritance then malory may be read for he style and he english prose and he expression of the mediæval spirit and then the story may be read again in tennyson 's idyll to show how those exquisite old fancy appeal to the mind of we modern poet summary of the revival of learn period this transition period be at first one of decline from the age of chaucer and then of intellectual preparation for the age of elizabeth for a century and a half after chaucer not a single great english work appear and the general standard of literature be very low there be three chief cause to account for this : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the long war with france and the civil war of the rose distract attention from book and poetry and destroy of ruin many noble english family who have be friend and patron of literature -lrb- 2 -rrb- the reformation in the latter part of the period fill man 's mind with religious question -lrb- 3 -rrb- the revival of learn set scholar and literary man to a eager study of the classic rather than to the creation of native literature historically the age be noticeable for its intellectual progress for the introduction of printing for the discovery of america for the beginning of the reformation and for the growth of political power among the common people in we study we have note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the revival of learn what it be and the significance of the term humanism and renaissance -lrb- 2 -rrb- three influential literary work -- erasmus 's _ praise of folly _ more 's _ utopia _ and tyndale 's translation of the new testament -lrb- 3 -rrb- wyatt and surrey and the so-called courtly

the period political summary in the age of elizabeth all doubt seem to vanish from english history after the reign of edward and mary with defeat and humiliation abroad and persecution and rebellion at home the accession of a popular sovereign be like the sunrise after a long night and in milton 's word we suddenly see england a noble and puissant nation rouse herself like a strong man after sleep and shake she invincible lock with the queen 's character a strange mingling of frivolity and strength which remind one of that iron image with foot of clay we have nothing whatever to do it be the national life that concern the literary student since even a beginner must notice that any great development of the national life be invariably associate with a development of the national literature it be enough for we purpose therefore to point out two fact : that elizabeth with all she vanity and inconsistency steadily love england and england 's greatness and that she inspire all she people with the unbounded patriotism which exult in shakespeare and with the personal devotion which find a voice in the _ faery queen _ under she administration the english national life progress by gigantic leap rather than by slow historical process and english literature reach the very highest point of its development it be possible to indicate only a few general characteristic of this great age which have a direct bearing upon its literature characteristic of the elizabethan age the most characteristic feature of the age be the comparative religious tolerance which be due largely to the queen 's influence the frightful excess of the religious war know as the thirty year ' war on the continent find no parallel in england upon she accession elizabeth find the whole kingdom divide against itself the north be largely catholic while the southern county be as strongly protestant scotland have follow the reformation in its own intense way while ireland remain true to its old religious tradition and both country be openly rebellious the court make up of both party witness the rival intrigue of those who seek to gain the royal favor it be due partly to the intense absorption of man 's mind in religious question that the preceding century though a age of advance learn produce scarcely any literature worthy of the name elizabeth favor both religious party and presently the world see with amazement catholic and protestant act together as trust counselor of a great sovereign the defeat of the spanish armada establish the reformation as a fact in england and at the same time unite all englishman in a magnificent national enthusiasm for the first time since the reformation begin the fundamental question of religious toleration seem to be settle and the mind of man free from religious fear and persecution turn with a great creative impulse to other form of activity it be partly from this new freedom of the mind that the age of elizabeth receive its great literary stimulus 2 it be a age of comparative social contentment in strong contrast with the day of langland the rapid increase of manufacture town give employment to thousand who have before be idle and discontented increase trade bring enormous wealth to england and this wealth be share to this extent at least that for the first time some systematic care for the needy be attempt parish be make responsible for they own poor and the wealthy be tax to support they or give they employment the increase of wealth the improvement in live the opportunity for labor the new social content -- these also be factor which help to account for the new literary activity 3 it be a age of dream of adventure of unbounded enthusiasm spring from the new land of fabulous riches reveal by english explorer drake sail around the world shape the mighty course which english colonizer shall follow through the century and presently the young philosopher bacon be say confidently i have take all knowledge for my province the mind must search farther than the eye with new rich land open to the sight the imagination must create new form to people the new world hakluyt 's famous _ collection of voyage _ and _ purcha he pilgrimage _ be even more stimulate to the english imagination than to the english acquisitiveness while she explorer search the new world for the fountain of youth she poet be create literary work that be young forever marston write : -lrb- 114 -rrb- why man all they drip pan be pure gold the prisoner they take be fetter in gold and as for ruby and diamond they goe forth on holydaye and gather ` hem by the seashore to hang on they child 's coate this come nearer to be a description of shakespeare 's poetry than of the indian in virginium prospero in _ the tempest _ with he control over the mighty power and harmony of nature be only the literary dream of that science which have just begin to grapple with the force of the universe cabot drake frobisher gilbert raleigh willoughby hawkin -- a score of explorer reveal a new earth to man 's eye and instantly literature create a new heaven to match it so dream and deed increase side by side and the dream be ever greater than the deed that be the meaning of literature 4 to sum up the age of elizabeth be a time of intellectual liberty of grow intelligence and comfort among all class of unbounded patriotism and of peace at home and abroad for a parallel we must go back to the age of pericle in athen or of augustus in rome or go forward a little to the magnificent court of loui xiv when corneille racine and molière bring the drama in france to the point where marlowe shakespeare and jonson have leave it in england half a century earlier such a age of great thought and great action appeal to the eye as well as to the imagination and intellect find but one adequate literary expression neither poetry nor the story can express the whole man -- he thought feeling action and the result character hence in the age of elizabeth literature turn instinctively to the drama and bring it rapidly to the highest stage of its development ii the non-dramatic poet of the elizabethan age edmund spenser -lrb- 1552-1599 -rrb- _ -lrb- cuddie -rrb- _ pier i have pipéd erst so long with pain that all mine oaten reed be rent and wear and my poor muse have spend she sparéd store yet little good have get and much

perhaps as no biographer could possibly do he life and work seem to center about three great influence sum up in three name : cambridge where he grow acquaint with the classic and the italian poet london where he experience the glamour and the disappointment of court life and ireland which steep he in the beauty and imagery of old celtic poetry and first give he leisure to write he masterpiece life of spenser 's early life and parentage we know little except that he be bear in east smithfield near the tower of london and be poor he education begin at the merchant tailor ' school in london and be continue in cambridge where as a poor sizar and fag for wealthy student he earn a scant living here in the glorious world that only a poor scholar know how to create for himself he read the classic make acquaintance with the great italian poet and write numberless little poem of he own though chaucer be he beloved master he ambition be not to rival the _ canterbury tale _ but rather to express the dream of english chivalry much as ariosto have do for italy in _ orlando furioso _ after leave cambridge -lrb- 1576 -rrb- spenser go to the north of england on some unknown work or quest here he chief occupation be to fall in love and to record he melancholy over the lose rosalind in the _ shepherd 's calendar _ upon he friend harvey 's advice he come to london bring he poem and here he meet leicester then at the height of royal favor and the latter take he to live at leicester house here he finish the _ shepherd 's calendar _ and here he meet sidney and all the queen 's favorite the court be full of intrigue lie and flattery and spenser 's opinion of he own uncomfortable position be best express in a few line from mother hubbard 's tale : full little knowest thou that have not try what hell it be in sue long to bide : to lose good day that might be better spend to waste long night in pensive discontent \* \* \* \* \* to fret thy soul with cross and with care to eat thy

pacify the oppressed and rebellious people this be to bring a huge force of cavalry and infantry into the country give the irish a brief time to submit and after that to hunt they down like wild beast he calculate that cold famine and sickness would help the work of the sword and that after the rebel have be well hound for two winter the following summer would find the country peaceful this plan from the poet of harmony and beauty be somewhat milder than the usual treatment of a brave people whose offense be that they love liberty and religion strange as it may seem the _ view _ be consider most statesmanlike and be excellently well receive in england in kilcolman surround by great natural beauty spenser finish the first three book of the _ faery queen _ in 1589 raleigh visit he hear the poem with enthusiasm hurry the poet off to london and present he to elizabeth the first three book meet with instant success when publish and be acclaimed as the greatest work in the english language a yearly pension of fifty pound be confer by elizabeth but rarely pay and the poet turn back to exile that be to ireland again soon after he return spenser fall in love with he beautiful elizabeth a irish girl write he _ amorettus _ or sonnet in she honor and afterwards represent she in the _ faery queen _ as the beautiful woman dancing among the grace in 1594 he marry elizabeth celebrate he wedding with he epithalamion one of the most beautiful wedding hymn in any language spenser 's next visit to london be in 1595 when he publish astrophel a elegy on the death of he friend sidney and three more book of the _ faery queen _ on this visit he live again at leicester house now occupy by the new favorite essex where he probably meet shakespeare and the other literary light of the elizabethan age soon after he return to ireland spenser be appoint sheriff of cork a queer office for a poet which probably bring about he undoing the same year tyrone 's rebellion break out in munster kilcolman the ancient house of desmond be one of the first place attack by the rebel and spenser barely escape with he wife and two child it be suppose that some unfinished part of the _ faery queen _ be burn in the castle from the shock of this frightful experience spenser never recover he return to england heartbroken and in the following year -lrb- 1599 -rrb- he die in a inn at westminster accord to ben jonson he die for want of bread but whether that be a poetic way of say that he have lose he property or that he actually die of destitution will probably never be know he be bury beside he master chaucer in westminster abbey the poet of that age thronging to he funeral and accord to camden cast they elegy and the pen that have write they into he tomb spenser 's work _ the faery queen _ be the great work upon which the poet 's fame chiefly rest the original plan of the poem include twenty-four book each of which be to recount the adventure and triumph of a knight who represent a moral virtue spenser 's purpose as indicate in a letter to raleigh which introduce the poem be as follow : to pourtraict in arthure before he be king the image of a brave knight perfect in the twelve private morall vertue as aristotle have devise which be the purpose of these first twelve booke : which if i finde to be well accept i may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of polliticke vertue in he person after that hee come to be king each of the virtue appear as a knight fight he opposing vice and the poem tell the story of the conflict it be therefore purely allegorical not only in its personify virtue but also in its representation of life as a struggle between good and evil in its strong moral element the poem differ radically from _ orlando furioso _ upon which it be model spenser complete only six book celebrate holiness temperance chastity friendship justice and courtesy we have also a fragment of the seventh treat of constancy but the rest of this book be not write or else be lose in the fire at kilcolman the first three book be by far the best and judge by the way the interest lag and the allegory grow incomprehensible it be perhaps as well for spenser 's reputation that the other eighteen book remain a dream argument of the faery queen from the introductory letter we learn that the hero visit the queen 's court in fairy land while she be hold a twelve-days festival on each day some distressed person appear unexpectedly tell a woful story of dragon of enchantress or of distressed beauty or virtue and ask for a champion to right the wrong and to let the oppressed go free sometimes a knight volunteer or beg for the dangerous mission again the duty be assign by the queen and the journey and adventure of these knight be the subject of the several book the first recount the adventure of the redcross knight represent holiness and the lady una represent religion they contest be symbolical of the world-wide struggle between virtue and faith on the one hand and sin and heresy on the other the second book tell the story of sir guyon or temperance the third of britomarti represent chastity the fourth fifth and sixth of cambel and triamond -lrb- friendship -rrb- artegall -lrb- justice -rrb- and sir calidore -lrb- courtesy -rrb- spenser 's plan be a very elastic one and he fill up the measure of he narrative with everything that catch he fancy -- historical event and personage under allegorical mask beautiful lady chivalrous knight giant monster dragon siren enchanter and adventure enough to stock a library of fiction if you read homer or virgil you know he subject in the first strong line if you read cædmon 's _ paraphrase _ or milton 's epic the introduction give you the theme but spenser 's great poem -- with the exception of a single line in the prologue fierce warre and faithfull love shall moralize my song -- give hardly a hint of what be come as to the meaning of the allegorical figure one be generally in doubt in the first three book the shadowy faery queen sometimes represent the glory of god and sometimes elizabeth who be naturally flatter by the parallel britomarti be also elizabeth the redcross knight be sidney the model englishman arthur who always appear to rescue the oppressed be leicester which be another outrageous flattery una be sometimes religion and sometimes the protestant church while duessa represent mary queen of scot or general catholicism in the last three book elizabeth appear again as mercillum henry iv of france as bourbon the war in the netherland as the story of lady belge raleigh as timia the earl of northumberland and westmoreland -lrb- lover of mary or duessa -rrb- as blandamor and paridell and so on through the wide range of contemporary character and event till the allegory become as difficult to follow as the second part of goethe 's _ faust _ poetical form for the _ faery queen _ spenser invent a new verse form which have be call since he day the spenserian stanza because of its rare beauty it have be much use by nearly all we poet in they best work the new stanza be a improved form of ariosto 's _ ottava rima _ -lrb- ie eight-line stanza -rrb- and bear a close resemblance to one of chaucer 's most musical verse form in the monk 's tale spenser 's stanza be in nine line eight of five foot each and the last of six foot riming _ ababbcbcc _ a few selection from the first book which be best worth reading be reproduce here to show the style and melody of the verse a gentle knight be prick on the plaine ycladd -lrb- 117 -rrb- in mightie arme and silver shielde wherein old dint of deepe wounde do remaine the cruell marke of many a bloody fielde yet arme till that time do he never wield : he angry steede do chide he

124 -rrb- o how can beautie maister the most strong and simple truth subdue avenge wrong minor poem next to he masterpiece the _ shepherd 's calendar _ -lrb- 1579 -rrb- be the best know of spenser 's poem though as he first work it be below many other in melody it consist of twelve pastoral poem or eclogue one for each month of the year the theme be generally rural life nature love in the field and the speaker be shepherd and shepherdess to increase the rustic effect spenser use strange form of speech and obsolete word to such a extent that jonson complain he work be not english or any other language some be melancholy poem on he lose rosalind some be satire on the clergy one the briar and the oak be a allegory one flatter elizabeth and other be pure fable touch with the puritan spirit they be write in various style and meter and show plainly that spenser be practice and prepare himself for greater work other noteworthy poem be mother hubbard 's tale a satire on society astrophel a elegy on the death of sidney _ amorettus _ or sonnet to he elizabeth the marriage hymn epithalamion and four hymn on love beauty heavenly love and heavenly beauty there be numerous other poem and collection of poem but these show the scope of he work and be best worth read importance of the shepherd 's calendar the publication of this work in 1579 by a unknown writer who sign himself modestly immerito mark a important epoch in we literature we shall appreciate this better if we remember the long year during which england have be without a great poet chaucer and spenser be often study together as poet of the renaissance period and the idea prevail that they be almost contemporary in fact nearly two century pass after chaucer 's death -- year of enormous political and intellectual development -- and not only do chaucer have no successor but we language have change so rapidly that englishman have lose the ability to read he line correctly -lrb- 125 -rrb- this first publish work of spenser be noteworthy in at least four respects : first it mark the appearance of the first national poet in two century second it show again the variety and melody of english verse which have be largely a tradition since chaucer third it be we first pastoral the beginning of a long series of english pastoral composition model on spenser and as such exert a strong influence on subsequent literature and fourth it mark the real beginning of the outburst of great elizabethan poetry characteristic of spenser 's poetry the five main quality of spenser 's poetry be -lrb- 1 -rrb- a perfect melody -lrb- 2 -rrb- a rare sense of beauty -lrb- 3 -rrb- a splendid imagination which could gather into one poem hero knight lady dwarf demon and dragon classic mythology story of chivalry and the throng ideal of the renaissance -- all pass in gorgeous procession across a ever-changing and ever-beautiful landscape -lrb- 4 -rrb- a lofty moral purity and seriousness -lrb- 5 -rrb- a delicate idealism which could make all nature and every common thing beautiful in contrast with these excellent quality the reader will probably note the strange appearance of he line due to he fondness for obsolete word like _ eyne _ -lrb- eye -rrb- and _ shend _ -lrb- shame -rrb- and he tendency to coin other like _ mercify _ to suit he own purpose it be spenser 's idealism he love of beauty and he exquisite melody which have cause he to be know as the poet ' poet nearly all we subsequent singer acknowledge they delight in he and they indebtedness macaulay alone among critic voice a fault which all who be not poet quickly feel namely that with all spenser 's excellence he be difficult to read the modern man lose himself in the confused allegory of the _ faery queen _ skip all but the marked passage and softly close the book in gentle weariness even the best of he longer poem while of exquisite workmanship and delightfully melodious generally fail to hold the reader 's attention the movement be languid there be little dramatic interest and only a suggestion of humor the very melody of he verse sometimes grow monotonous like a strauss waltz too long continue we shall best appreciate spenser by read at first only a few well-chosen selection from the _ faery queen _ and the _ shepherd 's calendar _ and a few of the minor poem which exemplify he wonderful melody comparison between chaucer and spenser at the outset it be well to remember that though spenser regard chaucer as he master two century intervene between they and that they writings have almost nothing in common we shall appreciate this better by a brief comparison between we first two modern poet chaucer be a combined poet and man of affair with the latter predominate though deal largely with ancient or mediæval material he have a curiously modern way of look at life indeed he be we only author precede shakespeare with whom we feel thoroughly at home he throw aside the outgrow metrical romance which be practically the only form of narrative in he day invent the art of story-telling in verse and bring it to a degree of perfection which have probably never since be equal though a student of the classic he live wholly in the present study the man and woman of he own time paint they as they be but add always a touch of kindly humor or romance to make they more interesting so he mission appear to be simply to amuse himself and he reader he mastery of various and melodious verse be marvelous and have never be surpass in we language but the english of he day be change rapidly and in a very few year man be unable to appreciate he art so that even to spenser and dryden for example he seem deficient in metrical skill on this account he influence on we literature have be much less than we should expect from the quality of he work and from he position as one of the greatest of english poet like chaucer spenser be a busy man of affair but in he the poet and the scholar always predominate he write as the idealist describe man not as they be but as he think they should be he have no humor and he mission be not to amuse but to reform like chaucer he study the classic and contemporary french and italian writer but instead of adapt he material to present-day condition he make poetry as in he eclogue for instance more artificial even than he foreign model where chaucer look about he and describe life as he see it spenser always look backward for he inspiration he live dreamily in the past in a realm of purely imaginary emotion and adventure he first quality be imagination not observation and he be the first of we poet to create a world of dream fancy and illusion he second quality be a wonderful sensitiveness to beauty which show itself not only in he subject-matter but also in the manner of he poetry like chaucer he be a almost perfect workman but in read chaucer we think chiefly of he natural character or he idea while in read spenser we think of the beauty of expression the exquisite spenserian stanza and the rich melody of spenser 's verse have make he the model of all we modern poet minor poet though spenser be the one great non-dramatic poet of the elizabethan age a multitude of minor poet demand attention of the student who would understand the tremendous literary activity of the period one need only to read _ the paradyse of daynty devise _ -lrb- 1576 -rrb- or _ a gorgeous gallery of gallant invention _ -lrb- 1578 -rrb- or any other of the miscellaneous collection to find hundred of song many of they of exquisite workmanship by poet whose name now awaken no response a glance be enough to assure one that over all england the sweet spirit of song have arise like the first chirping of bird after a storm nearly two hundred poet be record in the short period from 1558 to 1625 and many of they be prolific writer in a work like this we can hardly do more than mention a few of the best know writer and spend a moment at least with the work that suggest marlowe 's description of infinite riches in a little room the reader will note for himself the interesting union of action and think in these man so characteristic of the elizabethan age for most of they be engage chiefly in business or war or politics and literature be to they a pleasant recreation rather than a absorb profession thoma sackville -lrb- 1536-1608 -rrb- sir thoma sackville earl of dorset and lord high treasurer of england be generally class with wyatt and surrey among the predecessor of the elizabethan age in imitation of dante 's _ inferno _ sackville form the design of a great poem call _ the mirror for magistrate _ under guidance of a allegorical personage call sorrow he meet the spirit of all the important actor in english history the idea be to follow lydgate 's _ fall of prince _ and let each character tell he own story so that the poem would be a mirror in which present ruler might see themselves and read this warning : who reckless rule right soon may hope to rue sackville finish only the induction and the complaint of the duke of buckingham these be write in the rime royal and be mark by strong poetic feeling and expression unfortunately sackville turn from poetry to politics and the poem be carry on by two inferior poet william baldwin and george ferrer sackville write also in connection with thoma norton the first english tragedy _ ferrex and porrex _ call also _ gorboduc _ which will be consider in the follow section on the rise of the drama philip sidney -lrb- 1554-1586 -rrb- sidney the ideal gentleman the sir calidore of spenser 's legend of courtesy be vastly more interesting as a man than as a writer and the student be recommend to read he biography rather than he book he life express better than any single literary work the two ideal of the age -- personal honor and national greatness as a writer he be know by three principal work all publish after he death show how little importance he attach to he own writing even while he be encourage spenser the _ arcadium _ be a pastoral romance intersperse with eclogue in which shepherd and shepherdess sing of the delight of rural life though the work be take up idly as a summer 's pastime it become immensely popular and be imitate by a hundred poet the _ apologie for poetrie _ -lrb- 1595 -rrb- generally call the _ defense of poesie _ appear in answer to a pamphlet by stephen gosson call _ the school of abuse _ -lrb- 1579 -rrb- in which the poetry of the age and its unbridled pleasure be denounce with puritan thoroughness and conviction the _ apologie _ be one of the first critical essay in english and though its style now seem labored and unnatural -- the pernicious result of euphue and he school -- it be still one of the best expression of the place and meaning of poetry in any language _ astrophel and stellum _ be a collection of song and sonnet address to lady penelope devereux to whom sidney have once be betroth they abound in exquisite line and passage contain more poetic feeling and expression than the song of any other minor writer of the age george chapman -lrb- 1559-1634 -rrb- chapman spend he long quiet life among the dramatist and write chiefly for the stage he play which be for the most part merely poem in dialogue fall far below the high dramatic standard of he time and be now almost unread he most famous work be the metrical translation of the _ iliad _ -lrb- 1611 -rrb- and of the _ odyssey _ -lrb- 1614 -rrb- chapman 's _ homer _ though lack the simplicity and dignity of the original have a force and rapidity of movement which make it superior in many respects to pope 's more familiar translation chapman be remember also as the finisher of marlowe 's _ hero and leander _ in which apart from the drama the renaissance movement be see at perhaps its highest point in english poetry out of score of long poem of the period _ hero and leander _ and the _ faery queen _ be the only two which be even slightly know to modern reader michael drayton -lrb- 1563-1631 -rrb- drayton be the most voluminous and to antiquarian at least the most interesting of the minor poet he be the layamon of the elizabethan age and vastly more scholarly than he predecessor he chief work be _ polyolbion _ a enormous poem of many thousand couplet describe the town mountain and river of britain with the interesting legend connect with each it be a extremely valuable work and represent a lifetime of study and research two other long work be the _ baron ' war _ and the _ heroic epistle of england _ and besides these be many minor poem one of the best of these be the battle of agincourt a ballad write in the lively meter which tennyson use with some variation in the charge of the light brigade and which show the old english love of brave deed and of the song that stir a people 's heart in memory of noble ancestor iii the first english dramatist the origin of the drama first the deed then the story then the play that seem to be the natural development of the drama in its simplest form the great deed of a people be treasured in its literature and later generation represent in play or pantomime certain part of the story which appeal most powerfully to the imagination among primitive race the deed of they god and hero be often represent at the yearly festival and among child whose instinct be not yet blunt by artificial habit one see the story that be hear at bedtime repeat next day in vigorous action when we boy turn scout and we girl princess precisely as we first dramatist turn to the old legend and hero of britain for they first stage production to act a part seem as natural to humanity as to tell a story and originally the drama be but a old story retold to the eye a story put into action by live performer who for the moment make believe or imagine themselves to be the old hero to illustrate the matter simply there be a great life live by he who be call the christ inevitably the life find its way into literature and we have the gospel around the life and literature spring up a great religion its worship be at first simple -- the common prayer the evening meal together the remembered word of the master and the closing hymn gradually a ritual be establish which grow more elaborate and impressive as the century go by scene from the master 's life begin to be represent in the church especially at christmas time when the story of christ 's birth be make more effective to the eye of a people who could not read by a babe in a manger surround by magus and shepherd with a choir of angel chant the _ glorium in excelsis _ -lrb- 126 -rrb- other impressive scene from the gospel follow then the old testament be call upon until a complete cycle of play from the creation to the final judgment be establish and we have the mystery and miracle play of the middle age out of these come directly the drama of the elizabethan age period in the development of the drama 1 the religious period in europe as in greece the drama have a distinctly religious origin -lrb- 127 -rrb- the first character be draw from the new testament and the object of the first play be to make the church service more impressive or to emphasize moral lesson by show the reward of the good and the punishment of the evil doer in the latter day of the roman empire the church find the stage possess by frightful play which debase the moral of a people already fall too low reform seem impossible the corrupt drama be drive from the stage and play of every kind be forbid but mankind love a spectacle and soon the church itself provide a substitute for the forbid play in the famous mystery and miracle miracle and mystery play in france the name _ miracle _ be give to any play represent the life of the saint while the _ mystère _ represent scene from the life of christ or story from the old testament associate with the come of messiah in england this distinction be almost unknown the name miracle be use indiscriminately for all play have they origin in the bible or in the life of the saint and the name mystery to distinguish a certain class of play be not use until long after the religious drama have pass away the earliest miracle of which we have any record in england be the _ ludus de sancta katharina _ which be perform in dunstable about the year 1110 -lrb- 128 -rrb- it be not know who write the original play of st catherine but we first version be prepare by geoffrey of st alban a french school-teacher of dunstable whether or not the play be give in english be not know but it be customary in the earliest play for the chief actor to speak in latin or french to show they importance while minor and comic part of the same play be give in english for four century after this first record play the miracle increase steadily in number and popularity in england they be give first very simply and impressively in the church then as the actor increase in number and the play in liveliness they overflow to the churchyard but when fun and hilarity begin to predominate even in the most sacred representation the scandalize priest forbid play altogether on church grounds by the year 1300 the miracle be out of ecclesiastical hand and adopt eagerly by the town guild and in the follow two century we find the church preach against the abuse of the religious drama which it have itself introduce and which at first have serve a purely religious purpose -lrb- 129 -rrb- but by this time the miracle have take strong hold upon the english people and they continue to be immensely popular until in the sixteenth century they be replace by the elizabethan drama the early miracle play of england be divide into two class : the first give at christmas include all play connect with the birth of christ the second at easter include the play relate to he death and triumph by the beginning of the fourteenth century all these play be in various locality unite in single cycle begin with the creation and end with the final judgment the complete cycle be present every spring beginning on corpus christus day and as the presentation of so many play mean a continuous outdoor festival of a week or more this day be look forward to as the happiest of the whole year probably every important town in england have its own cycle of play for its own guild to perform but nearly all have be lose at the present day only four cycle exist -lrb- except in the most fragmentary condition -rrb- and these though they furnish a interesting commentary on the time add very little to we literature the four cycle be the chester and york play so call from the town in which they be give the towneley or wakefield play name for the towneley family which for a long time own the manuscript and the coventry play which on doubtful evidence have be associate with the gray friar -lrb- franciscan -rrb- of coventry the chester cycle have 25 play the wakefield 30 the coventry 42 and the york 48 it be impossible to fix either the date or the authorship of any of these play we only know certainly that they be in great favor from the twelfth to the sixteenth century the york play be generally consider to be the best but those of wakefield show more humor and variety and better workmanship the former cycle especially show a certain unity result from its aim to represent the whole of man 's life from birth to death the same thing be noticeable in _ cursor mundus _ which with the york and wakefield cycle belong to the fourteenth century at first the actor as well as the author of the miracle be the priest and they choose assistant later when the town guild take up the play and each guild become responsible for one or more of the series the actor be carefully select and train by four o'clock on the morning of corpus christus all the player have to be in they place in the movable theater which be scatter throughout the town in the square and open place each of these theater consist of a two-story platform set on wheel the lower story be a dress room for the actor the upper story be the stage proper and be reach by a trapdoor from below when the play be over the platform be drag away and the next play in the cycle take its place so in a single square several play would be present in rapid sequence to the same audience meanwhile the first play move on to another square where another audience be wait to hear it though the play be distinctly religious in character there be hardly one without its humorous element in the play of noah for instance noah 's shrewish wife make fun for the audience by wrangle with she husband in the crucifixion play herod be a prankish kind of tyrant who leave the stage to rant among the audience so that to out-herod herod become a common proverb in all the play the devil be a favorite character and the butt of every joke he also leave the stage to play prank or frighten the wonder child on the side of the stage be often see a huge dragon 's head with gaping red jaw belch forth fire and smoke out of which pour a tumultuous troop of devil with club and pitchfork and gridiron to punish the wicked character and to drag they away at last howling and shriek into hell-mouth as the dragon 's head be call so the fear of hell be ingrain into a ignorant people for four century alternate with these horror be bit of rough horse-play and domestic scene of peace and kindliness represent the life of the english field and home with these be song and carol like that of the nativity for instance : as i out ride this endere -lrb- last -rrb- night of three jolly shepherd i see a sight and all about they fold a star shone bright they sing _ terli terlow _ so merryly the shepherd they pipe can blow down from heaven from heaven so high of angel there come a great companye with mirth and joy and great solemnitye they sing _ terli terlow _ so merryly the shepherd they pipe can blow such song be take home by the audience and sing for a season as a popular tune be now catch from the stage and sing on the street and at time the whole audience would very likely join in the chorus after these play be write accord to the general outline of the bible story no change be tolerate the audience insist like child at punch and judy upon see the same thing year after year no originality in plot or treatment be possible therefore the only variety be in new song and joke and in the prank of the devil childish as such play seem to we they be part of the religious development of all uneducated people even now the persian play of the martyrdom of alus be celebrated yearly and the famous passion play a true miracle be give every ten year at oberammergau 2 the moral period of the drama -lrb- 130 -rrb- the second or moral period of the drama be show by the increase prevalence of the morality play in these the character be allegorical personage -- life death repentance goodness love greed and other virtue and vice the morality may be regard therefore as the dramatic counterpart of the once popular allegorical poetry exemplify by the _ romance of the rose _ it do not occur to we first unknown dramatist to portray man and woman as they be until they have first make character of abstract human quality nevertheless the morality mark a distinct advance over the miracle in that it give free scope to the imagination for new plot and incident in spain and portugal these play under the name _ auto _ be wonderfully develop by the genius of calderon and gil vicente but in england the morality be a dreary kind of performance like the allegorical poetry which precede it to enliven the audience the devil of the miracle play be introduce and another lively personage call the vice be the predecessor of we modern clown and jester he business be to torment the virtue by mischievous prank and especially to make the devil 's life a burden by beat he with a bladder or a wooden sword at every opportunity the morality generally end in the triumph of virtue the devil leap into hell-mouth with vice on he back the best know of the morality be everyman which have recently be revive in england and america the subject of the play be the summon of every man by death and the moral be that nothing can take away the terror of the inevitable summons but a honest life and the comfort of religion in its dramatic unity it suggest the pure greek drama there be no change of time or scene and the stage be never empty from the begin to the end of the performance other well-known morality be the pride of life hyckescorner and castell of perseverance in the latter man be represent as shut up in a castle garrison by the virtue and besiege by the vice like the miracle play most of the old morality be of unknown date and origin of the known author of morality two of the best be john skelton who write magnificence and probably also the necromancer and sir david lindsay -lrb- 1490-1555 -rrb- the poet of the scotch reformation whose religious business it be to make ruler uncomfortable by tell they unpleasant truth in the form of poetry with these man a new element enter into the morality they satirize or denounce abuse of church and state and introduce live personage thinly disguise as allegory so that the stage first become a power in shape event and correct abuse the interlude it be impossible to draw any accurate line of distinction between the morality and interlude in general we may think of the latter as dramatic scene sometimes give by themselves -lrb- usually with music and singing -rrb- at banquet and entertainment where a little fun be want and again slip into a miracle play to enliven the audience after a solemn scene thus on the margin of a page of one of the old chester play we read the boye and pigge when the kinge be go certainly this be no part of the original scene between herod and the three king so also the quarrel between noah and he wife be probably a late addition to a old play the interlude originate undoubtedly in a sense of humor and to john heywood -lrb- 1497-1580 -rrb- a favorite retainer and jester at the court of mary be due the credit for raise the interlude to the distinct dramatic form know as comedy heywood 's interlude be write between 1520 and 1540 he most famous be the four p 's a contest of wit between a pardoner a palmer a pedlar and a poticary the character here strongly suggest those of chaucer -lrb- 131 -rrb- another interesting interlude be call the play of the weather in this jupiter and the god assemble to listen to complaint about the weather and to reform abuse naturally everybody want he own kind of weather the climax be reach by a boy who announce that a boy 's pleasure consist in two thing catch bird and throw snowball and beg for the weather to be such that he can always do both jupiter decide that he will do just as he please about the weather and everybody go home satisfied all these early play be write for the most part in a mingling of prose and wretched doggerel and add nothing to we literature they great work be to train actor to keep alive the dramatic spirit and to prepare the way for the true drama 3 the artistic period of the drama the artistic be the final stage in the development of the english drama it differ radically from the other two in that its chief purpose be not to point a moral but to represent human life as it be the artistic drama may have purpose no less than the miracle play but the motive be always subordinate to the chief end of represent life itself the first true play in english with a regular plot divide into act and scene be probably the comedy ralph royster doyster it be write by nichola udall master of eton and later of westminster school and be first act by he schoolboy some time before 1556 the story be that of a conceited fop in love with a widow who be already engage to another man the play be a adaptation of the _ mile gloriosus _ a classic comedy by plautus and the english character be more or less artificial but as furnish a model of a clear plot and natural dialogue the influence of this first comedy with its mixture of classic and english element can hardly be overestimate the next play gammer gurton 's needle _ -lrb- cir _ 1562 -rrb- be a domestic comedy a true bit of english realism represent the life of the peasant class gammer gurton be patch the leather breeches of she man hodge when gib the cat get into the milk pan while gammer chase the cat the family needle be lose a veritable calamity in those day the whole household be turn upside down and the neighbor be drag into the affair various comical situation be bring about by diccon a thieving vagabond who tell gammer that she neighbor dame chatte have take she needle and who then hurry to tell dame chatte that she be accuse by gammer of steal a favorite rooster naturally there be a terrible row when the two irate old woman meet and misunderstand each other diccon also drag doctor rat the curate into the quarrel by tell he that if he will but creep into dame chatte 's cottage by a hidden way he will find she use the steal needle then diccon secretly warn dame chatte that gammer gurton 's man hodge be come to steal she chicken and the old woman hide in the dark passage and cudgel the curate soundly with the door bar all the party be finally bring before the justice when hodge suddenly and painfully find the lose needle -- which be all the while stick in he leather breeches -- and the scene end uproariously for both audience and actor this first wholly english comedy be full of fun and coarse humor and be wonderfully true to the life it represent it be long attribute to john still afterwards bishop of bath but the authorship be now definitely assign to william stevenson -lrb- 132 -rrb- we earliest edition of the play be print in 1575 but a similar play call dyccon of bedlam be license in 1552 twelve year before shakespeare 's birth to show the spirit and the metrical form of the play we give a fragment of the boy 's description of the dullard hodge try to light a fire on the hearth from the cat 's eye and another fragment of the old drinking song at the beginning of the second act at last in a dark corner two sparke he think he see which be indede nought el but gyb we cat 's two eye puffe quod hodge think therby to have fyre without doubt with that gyb shut she two eye and so the fyre be out and by-and-by they open even as they be

be nothinge a-colde i stuffe my skyn so full within of ioly good ale and olde _ backe and syde go bare _ etc we first tragedy gorboduc be write by thoma sackville and thoma norton and be act in 1562 only two year before the birth of shakespeare it be remarkable not only as we first tragedy but as the first play to be write in blank verse the latter be most significant since it start the drama into the style of verse best suit to the genius of english playwright the story of gorboduc be take from the early annals of britain and recall the story use by shakespeare in _ king lear _ gorboduc king of britain divide he kingdom between he son ferrex and porrex the son quarrel and porrex the younger slay he brother who be the queen 's favorite videna the queen slay porrex in revenge the people rebel and slay videna and gorboduc then the noble kill the rebel and in turn fall to fight each other the line of brutus be extinct with the death of gorboduc the country fall into anarchy with rebel noble and a scottish invader all fight for the right of succession the curtain fall upon a scene of bloodshed and utter confusion the artistic finish of this first tragedy be mar by the author ' evident purpose to persuade elizabeth to marry it aim to show the danger to which england be expose by the uncertainty of succession otherwise the plan of the play follow the classical rule of seneca there be very little action on the stage bloodshed and battle be announce by a messenger and the chorus of four old man of britain sum up the situation with a few moral observation at the end of each of the first four act classical influence upon the drama the revival of latin literature have a decide influence upon the english drama as it develop from the miracle play in the fifteenth century english teacher in order to increase the interest in latin begin to let they boy act the play which they have read as literature precisely as we college now present greek or german play at the yearly festival seneca be the favorite latin author and all he tragedy be translate into english between 1559 and 1581 this be the exact period in which the first english playwright be shape they own idea but the severe simplicity of the classical drama seem at first only to hamper the exuberant english spirit to understand this one have only to compare a tragedy of seneca or of euripide with one of shakespeare and see how widely the two master differ in method in the classic play the so-called dramatic unity of time place and action be strictly observe time and place must remain the same the play could represent a period of only a few hour and whatever action be introduce must take place at the spot where the play begin the character therefore must remain unchanged throughout there be no possibility of the child become a man or of the man 's growth with change circumstance as the play be within door all vigorous action be deem out of place on the stage and battle and important event be simply announce by a messenger the classic drama also draw a sharp line between tragedy and comedy all fun be rigorously exclude from serious representation the english drama on the other hand strove to represent the whole sweep of life in a single play the scene change rapidly the same actor appear now at home now at court now on the battlefield and vigorous action fill the stage before the eye of the spectator the child of one act appear as the man of the next and the imagination of the spectator be call upon to bridge the gap from place to place and from year to year so the dramatist have free scope to present all life in a single place and a single hour moreover since the world be always laugh and always cry at the same moment tragedy and comedy be present side by side as they be in life itself as hamlet sing after the play that amuse the court but strike the king with deadly fear : why let the stricken deer go weep the hart ungalled play for some must watch while some must sleep : so run the world away naturally with these two ideal struggle to master the english drama two school of writer arise the university two school wit as man of learning be call generally of drama uphold the classical ideal and ridicule the crude-ness of the new english play sackville and norton be of this class and gorboduc be classic in its construction in the defense of poesie sidney uphold the classic and ridicule the too ambitious scope of the english drama against these be the popular playwright lyly peele greene marlowe and many other who recognize the english love of action and disregard the dramatic unity in they endeavor to present life as it be in the end the native drama prevail aid by the popular taste which have be train by four century of miracle we first play especially of the romantic type be extremely crude and often lead to ridiculously extravagant scene and here be where the classic drama exercise a immense influence for good by insist upon beauty of form and definiteness of structure at a time when the tendency be to satisfy a taste for stage spectacles without regard to either in the year 1574 a royal permit to lord leicester 's actor allow they to give play anywhere throughout we realm of england and this must be regard as the beginning of the regular drama two year later the first playhouse know as the theater be build for these actor by jame burbage in finsbury field just north of london it be in this theater that shakespeare probably find employment when he first come to the city the success of this venture be immediate and the next thirty year see a score of theatrical company at least seven regular theater and a dozen or more inn yard permanently fit for the give of play -- all establish in the city and its immediate suburb the growth seem all the more remarkable when we remember that the london of those day would now be consider a small city have -lrb- in 1600 -rrb- only about a hundred thousand inhabitant a dutch traveler johanne de witt who visit london in 1596 have give we the only contemporary drawing we possess of the interior of one of these theater they be build of stone and wood round or octagonal in shape and without a roof be simply a inclosed courtyard at one side be the stage and before it on the bare ground or pit stand that large part of the audience who could afford to pay only a admission fee the player and these groundling be expose to the weather those that pay for seat be in gallery sheltered by a narrow porch-roof project inwards from the encircle wall while the young noble and gallant who come to be see and who could afford the extra fee take seat on the stage itself and smoke and chaff the actor and throw nut at the groundling -lrb- 133 -rrb- the whole idea of these first theater accord to de witt be like that of the roman amphitheater and the resemblance be heighten by the fact that when no play be on the board the stage might be take away and the pit give over to bull and bear baiting in all these theater probably the stage consist of a bare platform with a curtain or traverse across the middle separate the front from the rear stage on the latter unexpected scene or character be discover by simply draw the curtain aside at first little or no scenery be use a gilded sign be the only announcement of a change of scene and this very lack of scenery lead to better act since the actor must be realistic enough to make the audience forget its shabby surroundings -lrb- 134 -rrb- by shakespeare 's day however paint scenery have appear first at university play and then in the regular theater -lrb- 135 -rrb- in all we first play female part be take by boy actor who evidently be more distressing than the crude scenery for contemporary literature have many satirical reference to they acting -lrb- 136 -rrb- and even the tolerant shakespeare write : some squeak cleopatra boy my greatness however that may be the stage be deem unfit for woman and actress be unknown in england until after the restoration shakespeare 's predecessor in the drama the english drama as it develop from the miracle play have a interesting history it begin with schoolmaster like udall who translate and adapt latin play for they boy to act and who be naturally govern by classic ideal it be continue by the choir master of st paul and the royal and the queen 's chapel whose company of choir-boy actor be famous in london and rival the player of the regular theater -lrb- 137 -rrb- these choir master be we first stage manager they begin with masque and interlude and the dramatic presentation of classic myth model after the italian but some of they like richard edward -lrb- choir master of the queen 's chapel in 1561 -rrb- soon add farce from english country life and dramatize some of chaucer 's story finally the regular playwright kyd nash lyly peele greene and marlowe bring the english drama to the point where shakespeare begin to experiment upon it each of these playwright add or emphasize some essential element in the drama which appear later in the work of shakespeare thus john lyly -lrb- 1554-1606 -rrb- who be now know chiefly as have develop the pernicious literary style call euphuism -lrb- 138 -rrb- be one of the most influential of the early dramatist he court comedy be remarkable for they witty dialogue and for be we first play to aim definitely at unity and artistic finish thoma kyd 's _ spanish tragedy _ -lrb- _ c _ 1585 -rrb- first give we the drama or rather the melodrama of passion copy by marlowe and shakespeare this be the most popular of the early elizabethan play it be revise again and again and ben jonson be say to have write one version and to have act the chief part of hieronimo -lrb- 139 -rrb- and robert greene -lrb- 1558-1592 -rrb- play the chief part in the early development of romantic comedy and give we some excellent scene of english country life in play like _ friar bacon and friar bungay _ even a brief glance at the life and work of these first playwright show three noteworthy thing which have a bearing on shakespeare 's career : -lrb- 1 -rrb- these man be usually actor as well as dramatist they know the stage and the audience and in write they play they remember not only the actor 's part but also the audience 's love for story and brave spectacles will it act well and will it please we audience be the question of chief concern to we early dramatist -lrb- 2 -rrb- they training begin as actor then they revise old play and finally become independent writer in this they work show a exact parallel with that of shakespeare -lrb- 3 -rrb- they often work together probably as shakespeare work with marlowe and fletcher either in revise old play or in create new one they have a common store of material from which they derive they story and character hence they frequent repetition of name and they often produce two or more play on the same subject much of shakespeare 's work depend as we shall see on previous play and even he _ hamlet _ use the material of a earlier play of the same name probably by kyd which be well know to the london stage in 1589 some twelve year before shakespeare 's great work be write all these thing be significant if we be to understand the elizabethan drama and the man who bring it to perfection shakespeare be not simply a great genius he be also a great worker and he develop in exactly the same way as do all he fellow craftsman and contrary to the prevalent opinion the elizabethan drama be not a minerva-like creation spring full grow from the head of one man it be rather a orderly though rapid development in which many man bear a part all we early dramatist be worthy of study for the part they play in the development of the drama but we can here consider only one the most typical of all whose best work be often rank with that of shakespeare christopher marlowe -lrb- 1564-1593 -rrb- marlowe be one of the most suggestive figure of the english renaissance and the greatest of shakespeare 's predecessor the glory of the elizabethan drama date from he _ tamburlaine _ -lrb- 1587 -rrb- wherein the whole restless temper of the age find expression : nature that frame we of four element war within we breast for regiment doth teach we all to have aspiring mind : we soul -- whose faculty can comprehend the wondrous architecture of the world and measure every wander planet 's course still climb after knowledge infinite and always move as the restless sphere -- will we to wear ourselves and never rest _ tamburlaine _ pt i ii vii life marlowe be bear in canterbury only a few month before shakespeare he be the son of a poor shoemaker but through the kindness of a patron be educate at the town grammar school and then at cambridge when he come to london -lrb- _ c _ 1584 -rrb- he soul be surge with the ideal of the renaissance which later find expression in faustus the scholar longing for unlimited knowledge and for power to grasp the universe unfortunately marlowe have also the unbridled passion which mark the early or pagan renaissance as taine call it and the conceit of a young man just enter the realm of knowledge he become a actor and live in a low-tavern atmosphere of excess and wretchedness in 1587 when but twenty-three year old he produce _ tamburlaine _ which bring he instant recognition thereafter notwithstanding he wretched life he hold steadily to a high literary purpose though all he play abound in violence no doubt reflect many of the violent scene in which he live he develop he mighty line and depict great scene in magnificent burst of poetry such as the stage have never hear before in five year while shakespeare be serve he apprenticeship marlowe produce all he great work then he be stab in a drunken brawl and die wretchedly as he have live the epilogue of _ faustus _ might be write across he tombstone : cut be the branch that might have grow full straight and burn be apollo 's laurel bough that sometime grow within this learnéd man marlowe 's work in addition to the poem hero and leander to which we have refer -lrb- 140 -rrb- marlowe be famous for four drama now know as the marlowesque or one-man type of tragedy each revolve about one central personality who be consume by the lust of power the first of these be _ tamburlaine _ the story of timur the tartar timur begin as a shepherd chief who first rebel and then triumph over the persian king intoxicate by he success timur rush like a tempest over the whole east seat on he chariot draw by captive king with a caged emperor before he he boast of he power which override all thing then afflict with disease he rave against the god and would overthrow they as he have overthrow earthly ruler _ tamburlaine _ be a epic rather than a drama but one can understand its instant success with a people only half civilized fond of military glory and the instant adoption of its mighty line as the instrument of all dramatic expression _ faustus _ the second play be one of the best of marlowe 's work -lrb- 141 -rrb- the story be that of a scholar who long for infinite knowledge and who turn from theology philosophy medicine and law the four science of the time to the study of magic much as a child might turn from jewel to tinsel and color paper in order to learn magic he sell himself to the devil on condition that he shall have twenty-four year of absolute power and knowledge the play be the story of those twenty-four year like _ tamburlaine _ it be lack in dramatic construction -lrb- 142 -rrb- but have a unusual number of passage of rare poetic beauty milton 's satan suggest strongly that the author of _ paradise lose _ have access to _ faustus _ and use it as he may also have use _ tamburlaine _ for the magnificent panorama display by satan in _ paradise regain _ for instance more than fifty year before milton 's hero say which way i turn be hell myself be hell marlowe have write : _ faust _ how come it then that thou art out of hell _ mephisto _ why this be hell nor be i out of it \* \* \* \* \* hell have no limit nor be circumscribe in one self place for where we be be hell and where hell be there must we ever be marlowe 's third play be _ the jew of malta _ a study of the lust for wealth which center about baraba a terrible old money lender strongly suggestive of shylock in _ the merchant of venice _ the first part of the play be well construct show a decide advance but the last part be a accumulation of melodramatic horror baraba be check in he murderous career by fall into a boiling caldron which he have prepare for another and die blaspheme he only regret be that he have not do more evil in he life marlowe 's last play be _ edward ii _ a tragic study of a king 's weakness and misery in point of style and dramatic construction it be by far the best of marlowe 's play and be a worthy predecessor of shakespeare 's historical drama marlowe be the only dramatist of the time who be ever compare with shakespeare -lrb- 143 -rrb- when we remember that he die at twenty-nine probably before shakespeare have produce a single great play we must wonder what he might have do have he outlive he wretched youth and become a man here and there he work be remarkable for its splendid imagination for the stateliness of its verse and for its rare bit of poetic beauty but in dramatic instinct in wide knowledge of human life in humor in delineation of woman 's character in the delicate fancy which present a ariel as perfectly as a macbeth -- in a word in all that make a dramatic genius shakespeare stand alone marlowe simply prepare the way for the master who be to follow variety of the early drama the thirty year between we first regular english play and shakespeare 's first comedy -lrb- 144 -rrb- witness a development of the drama which astonish we both by its rapidity and variety we shall better appreciate shakespeare 's work if we glance for a moment at the play that precede he and note how he cover the whole field and write almost every form and variety of the drama know to he age first in importance or at least in popular interest be the new chronicle play found upon historical event and character they show the strong national spirit of the elizabethan age and they popularity be due largely to the fact that audience come to the theater partly to gratify they awaken national spirit and to get they first knowledge of national history some of the morality like bayle 's _ king johan _ -lrb- 1538 -rrb- be crude chronicle play and the early robin hood play and the first tragedy _ gorboduc _ show the same awaken popular interest in english history during the reign of elizabeth the popular chronicle play increase till we have the record of over two hundred and twenty half of which be still extant deal with almost every important character real or legendary in english history of shakespeare 's thirty-seven drama ten be true chronicle play of english king three be from the legendary annals of britain and three more be from the history of other nation other type of the early drama be less clearly define but we may sum they up under a few general head : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the domestic drama begin with crude home scene introduce into the miracle and develop in a score of different way from the coarse humor of _ gammer gurton 's needle _ to the comedy of manners of jonson and the later dramatist shakespeare 's _ tame of the shrew _ and _ merry wife of windsor _ belong to this class -lrb- 2 -rrb- the so-called court comedy be the opposite of the former in that it represent a different kind of life and be intend for a different audience it be mark by elaborate dialogue by jest retort and endless play on word rather than by action it be make popular by lyly 's success and be imitate in shakespeare 's first or lylian comedy such as _ love 's labor 's lose _ and the complicated _ two gentleman of verona _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- romantic comedy and romantic tragedy suggest the most artistic and finished type of the drama which be experiment upon by peele greene and marlowe and be bring to perfection in _ the merchant of venice romeo and juliet _ and _ the tempest _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- in addition to the above type be several other -- the classical play model upon seneca and favor by cultivate audience the melodrama favorite of the groundling which depend not on plot or character but upon a variety of striking scene and incident and the tragedy of blood always more or less melodramatic like kyd 's _ spanish tragedy _ which grow more blood-and-thundery in marlowe and reach a climax of horror in shakespeare 's _ titus andronicus _ it be noteworthy that _ hamlet lear _ and _ macbeth _ all belong to this class but the develop genius of the author raise they to a height such as the tragedy of blood have never know before these varied type be quite enough to show with what doubtful and unguided experiment we first dramatist be engage like man first set out in raft and dugout on a unknown sea they be the more interesting when we remember that shakespeare try they all that he be the only dramatist whose play cover the whole range of the drama from its begin to its decline from the stage spectacle he develop the drama of human life and instead of the doggerel and bombast of we first play he give we the poetry of _ romeo and juliet _ and _ midsummer night 's dream _ in a word shakespeare bring order out of dramatic chaos in a few short year he raise the drama from a blunder experiment to a perfection of form and expression which have never since be rival iv shakespeare one who read a few of shakespeare 's great play and then the meager story of he life be generally fill with a vague wonder here be a unknown country boy poor and poorly educate accord to the standard of he age who arrive at the great city of london and go to work at odd job in a theater in a year or two he be associate with scholar and dramatist the master of they age write play of king and clown of gentleman and hero and noble woman all of whose life he seem to know by intimate association in a few year more he lead all that brilliant group of poet and dramatist who have give undying glory to the age of elizabeth play after play run from he pen mighty drama of human life and character follow one another so rapidly that good work seem impossible yet they stand the test of time and they poetry be still unrivaled in any language for all this great work the author apparently care little since he make no attempt to collect or preserve he writings a thousand scholar have ever since be busy collect identify classify the work which this magnificent workman toss aside so carelessly when he abandon the drama and retire to he native village he have a marvelously imaginative and creative mind but he invent few if any new plot or story he simply take a old play or a old poem make it over quickly and lo this old familiar material glow with the deepest thought and the tenderest feeling that ennoble we humanity and each new generation of man find it more wonderful than the last how do he do it that be still a unanswered question and the source of we wonder there be in general two theory to account for shakespeare the romantic school of writer have always hold that in he all come from within that he genius be he sufficient guide and that to the overmaster power of he genius alone we owe all he great work practical unimaginative man on the other hand assert that in shakespeare all come from without and that we must study he environment rather than he genius if we be to understand he he live in a play-loving age he study the crowd give they what they want and simply reflect they own thought and feeling in reflect the english crowd about he he unconsciously reflect all crowd which be alike in all age hence he continued popularity and in be guide by public sentiment he be not singular but follow the plain path that every good dramatist have always follow to success probably the truth of the matter be to be find somewhere between these two extreme of he great genius there can be no question but there be other thing to consider as we have already notice shakespeare be train like he fellow workman first as a actor second as a reviser of old play and last as a independent dramatist he work with other playwright and learn they secret like they he study and follow the public taste and he work indicate at least three stage from he first somewhat crude experiment to he finished masterpiece so it would seem that in shakespeare we have the result of hard work and of orderly human development quite as much as of transcendent genius life -lrb- 1564-1616 -rrb- two outward influence be powerful in develop the genius of shakespeare -- the little village of stratford center of the most beautiful and romantic district in rural england and the great city of london the center of the world 's political activity in one he learn to know the natural man in he natural environment in the other the social the artificial man in the most unnatural of surroundings from the register of the little parish church at stratford-on-avon we learn that william shakespeare be baptize there on the twenty-sixth of April 1564 -lrb- old style -rrb- as it be customary to baptize child on the third day after birth the twenty-third of April -lrb- may 3 accord to we present calendar -rrb- be generally accept as the poet 's birthday he father john shakespeare be a farmer 's son from the neighbor village of snitterfield who come to stratford about 1551 and begin to prosper as a trader in corn meat leather and other agricultural product he mother mary arden be the daughter of a prosperous farmer descend from a old warwickshire family of mixed anglo-saxon and norman blood in 1559 this married couple sell a piece of land and the document be sign the marke + of john shacksper the marke + of mary shacksper and from this it have be generally infer that like the vast majority of they countryman neither of the poet 's parent could read or write this be probably true of he mother but the evidence from stratford document now indicate that he father could write and that he also audit the town account though in attest document he sometimes make a mark leave he name to be fill in by the one who draw up the document of shakespeare 's education we know little except that for a few year he probably attend the endowed grammar school at stratford where he pick up the small latin and less greek to which he learn friend ben jonson refer he real teacher meanwhile be the man and woman and the natural influence which surround he stratford be a charming little village in beautiful warwickshire and near at hand be the forest of arden the old castle of warwick and kenilworth and the old roman camp and military road to appeal powerfully to the boy 's lively imagination every phase of the natural beauty of this exquisite region be reflect in shakespeare 's poetry just as he character reflect the nobility and the littleness the gossip vice emotion prejudice and tradition of the people about he i see a smith stand with he hammer thus the whilst he iron do on the anvil cool with open mouth swallow a tailor 's news who with he shears and measure in he hand standing on slipper which he nimble haste have falsely thrust upon contrary foot tell of a many thousand warlike french that be embattail and rank in kent -lrb- 145 -rrb- such passage suggest not only genius but also a keen sympathetic observer whose eye see every significant detail so with the nurse in _ romeo and juliet _ whose endless gossip and vulgarity can not quite hide a kind heart she be simply the reflection of some forget nurse with whom shakespeare have talk by the wayside not only the gossip but also the dream the unconscious poetry that sleep in the heart of the common people appeal tremendously to shakespeare 's imagination and be reflect in he greatest play othello try to tell a curt soldier 's story of he love but the account be like a bit of mandeville 's famous travels teem with the fancy that fill man 's head when the great round world be first bring to they attention by daring explorer here be a bit of folklore touch by shakespeare 's exquisite fancy which show what one boy listen to before the fire at halloween : she come in shape no bigger than a agate-stone on the fore-finger of a alderman draw with a team of little atomy athwart man 's nose as they lie asleep she waggon-spoke make of long spinner ' leg the cover of the wing of grasshopper the trace of the smallest spider 's web the collar of the moonshine 's watery beam she whip of cricket 's bone the lash of film she waggoner a small grey-coated gnat \* \* \* \* \* she chariot be a empty hazel nut make by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o ' mind the fairy ' coachmaker and in this state she gallop night by night through lover ' brain and then they dream of love \* \* \* \* \* o'er lawyer ' finger who straight dream on fee o'er lady ' lip who straight on kiss dream -lrb- 146 -rrb- so with shakespeare 's education at the hand of nature which come from keep he heart as well as he eye wide open to the beauty of the world he speak of a horse and we know the fine point of a thoroughbred he mention the duke 's hound and we hear they clamor on a fox trail they voice match like bell in the frosty air he stop for a instant in the sweep of a tragedy to note a flower a star a moonlit bank a hilltop touch by the sunrise and instantly we know what we own heart feel but could not quite express when we see the same thing because he note and remember every significant thing in the change panorama of earth and sky no other writer have ever approach he in the perfect natural setting of he character when shakespeare be about fourteen year old he father lose he little property and fall into debt and the boy probably leave school to help support the family of younger child what occupation he follow for the next eight year be a matter of conjecture from evidence find in he play it be allege with some show of authority that he be a country schoolmaster and a lawyer 's clerk the character of holoferne in _ love 's labor 's lose _ be the warrant for one and shakespeare 's knowledge of law term for the other but if we take such evidence then shakespeare must have be a botanist because of he knowledge of wild flower a sailor because he know the rope a courtier because of he extraordinary facility in quip and compliment and courtly language a clown because none other be so dull and foolish a king because richard and henry be true to life a woman because he have sound the depths of a woman 's feeling and surely a roman because in _ coriolanus _ and _ julius cæsar _ he have show we the roman spirit better than have the roman writer themselves he be everything in he imagination and it be impossible from a study of he scene and character to form a definite opinion as to he early occupation in 1582 shakespeare be marry to anne hathaway the daughter of a peasant family of shottery who be eight year older than she boy husband from numerous sarcastic reference to marriage make by the character in he play and from the fact that he soon leave he wife and family and go to london it be generally allege that the marriage be a hasty and unhappy one but here again the evidence be entirely untrustworthy in many miracle as well as in later play it be customary to depict the seamy side of domestic life for the amusement of the crowd and shakespeare may have follow the public taste in this as he do in other thing the reference to love and home and quiet joy in shakespeare 's play be enough if we take such evidence to establish firmly the opposite supposition that he love be a very happy one and the fact that after he enormous success in london he retire to stratford to live quietly with he wife and daughter tend to the same conclusion about the year 1587 shakespeare leave he family and go to london and join himself to burbage 's company of player a persistent tradition say that he have incur the anger of sir thoma lucy first by poach deer in that nobleman 's park and then when hale before a magistrate by write a scurrilous ballad about sir thoma which so arouse the old gentleman 's ire that shakespeare be oblige to flee the country a old record -lrb- 147 -rrb- say that the poet be much give to all unluckiness in steal venison and rabbit the unluckiness probably consist in get catch himself and not in any lack of luck in catch the rabbit the ridicule heap upon the lucy family in _ henry iv _ and the _ merry wife of windsor _ give some weight to this tradition nichola rowe who publish the first life of shakespeare -lrb- 148 -rrb- be the authority for this story but there be some reason to doubt whether at the time when shakespeare be say to have poach in the deer park of sir thoma lucy at charlescote there be any deer or park at the place refer to the subject be worthy of some scant attention if only to show how worthless be the attempt to construct out of rumor the story of a great life which fortunately perhaps have no contemporary biographer of he life in london from 1587 to 1611 the period of he greatest literary activity we know nothing definitely we can judge only from he play and from these it be evident that he enter into the stir life of england 's capital with the same perfect sympathy and understanding that mark he among the plain people of he native warwickshire the first authentic reference to he be in 1592 when greene 's -lrb- 149 -rrb- bitter attack appear show plainly that shakespeare have in five year assume a important position among playwright then appear the apology of the publisher of greene 's pamphlet with they tribute to the poet 's sterling character and occasional literary reference which show that he be know among he fellow as the gentle shakespeare ben jonson say of he : i love the man and do honor he memory on this side idolatry as much as any he be indeed honest and of a open and free nature to judge from only three of he earliest play -lrb- 150 -rrb- it would seem reasonably evident that in the first five year of he london life he have gain entrance to the society of gentleman and scholar have catch they characteristic mannerism and expression and so be ready by knowledge and observation as well as by genius to weave into he drama the whole stir life of the english people the play themselves with the testimony of contemporary and he business success be strong evidence against the tradition that he life in london be wild and dissolute like that of the typical actor and playwright of he time shakespeare 's first work may well have be that of a general helper a odd-job man about the theater but he soon become a actor and the record of the old london theater show that in the next ten year he gain a prominent place though there be little reason to believe that he be count among the star within two year he be at work on play and he course here be exactly like that of other playwright of he time he work with other man and he revise old play before write he own and so gain a practical knowledge of he art _ henry vi _ -lrb- _ c _ 1590-1591 -rrb- be a example of this tinkering work in which however he native power be unmistakably manifest the three part of _ henry vi _ -lrb- and _ richard iii _ which belong with they -rrb- be a succession of scene from english chronicle history string together very loosely and only in the last be there any definite attempt at unity that he soon fall under marlowe 's influence be evident from the atrocity and bombast of _ titus andronicus _ and _ richard iii _ the former may have be write by both playwright in collaboration or may be one of marlowe 's horror leave unfinished by he early death and bring to a end by shakespeare he soon break away from this apprentice work and then appear in rapid succession _ love 's labor 's lose comedy of error two gentleman of verona _ the first english chronicle play -lrb- 151 -rrb- _ a midsummer night 's dream _ and _ romeo and juliet _ this order be more or less conjectural but the wide variety of these play as well as they unevenness and frequent crudity mark the first or experimental stage of shakespeare 's work it be as if the author be try he power or more likely try the temper of he audience for it must be remember that to please he audience be probably the ruling motive of shakespeare as of the other early dramatist during the most vigorous and prolific period of he career shakespeare 's poem rather than he dramatic work mark the beginning of he success venus and adoni become immensely popular in london and its dedication to the earl of southampton bring accord to tradition a substantial money gift which may have lay the foundation for shakespeare 's business success he appear to have shrewdly invest he money and soon become part owner of the globe and blackfriar theater in which he play be present by he own company he success and popularity grow amazingly within a decade of he unnoticed arrival in london he be one of the most famous actor and literary man in england follow he experimental work there come a succession of wonderful play -- _ merchant of venice as you like it twelfth night julius cæsar hamlet macbeth othello king lear antony and cleopatra _ the great tragedy of this period be associate with a period of gloom and sorrow in the poet 's life but of its cause we have no knowledge it may have be this unknown sorrow which turn he thought back to stratford and cause apparently a dissatisfaction with he work and profession but the latter be generally attribute to other cause actor and playwright be in he day generally look upon with suspicion or contempt and shakespeare even in the midst of success seem to have look forward to the time when he could retire to stratford to live the life of a farmer and country gentleman he own and he father 's family be first release from debt then in 1597 he buy new place the finest house in stratford and soon add a tract of farm land to complete he estate he profession may have prevent he acquire the title of gentleman or he may have only follow a custom of the time -lrb- 152 -rrb- when he apply for and obtain a coat of arm for he father and so indirectly secure the title by inheritance he home visit grow more and more frequent till about the year 1611 he leave london and retire permanently to stratford though still in the prime of life shakespeare soon abandon he dramatic work for the comfortable life of a country gentleman of he later play _ coriolanus cymbeline winter 's tale _ and _ pericle _ show a decide fall off from he previous work and indicate another period of experimentation this time not to test he own power but to catch the fickle humor of the public as be usually the case with a theater-going people they soon turn from serious drama to sentimental or more questionable spectacles and with fletcher who work with shakespeare and succeed he as the first playwright of london the decline of the drama have already begin in 1609 however occur a event which give shakespeare he chance for a farewell to the public a english ship disappear and all on board be give up for lose a year later the sailor return home and they arrival create intense excitement they have be wreck on the unknown bermuda and have live there for ten month terrify by mysterious noise which they think come from spirit and devil five different account of this fascinating shipwreck be publish and the bermuda become know as the ile of divel shakespeare take this story -- which cause as much popular interest as that later shipwreck which give we _ robinson crusoe _ -- and weave it into _ the tempest _ in the same year -lrb- 1611 -rrb- he probably sell he interest in the globe and blackfriar theater and he dramatic work be end a few play be probably leave unfinished -lrb- 153 -rrb- and be turn over to fletcher and other dramatist that shakespeare think little of he success and have no idea that he drama be the greatest that the world ever produce seem evident from the fact that he make no attempt to collect or publish he work or even to save he manuscript which be carelessly leave to stage manager of the theater and so find they way ultimately to the ragman after a few year of quiet life of which we have less record than of hundred of simple country gentleman of the time shakespeare die on the probable anniversary of he birth April 23 1616 he be give a tomb in the chancel of the parish church not because of he preëminence in literature but because of he interest in the affair of a country village and in the sad irony of fate the broad stone that cover he tomb -- now a object of veneration to the thousand that yearly visit the little church -- be inscribe as follow : good friend for jesus ' sake forbeare to dig the dust enclosed heare bleste be the man that spare these stone and curst be he that move my bone this wretched doggerel over the world 's greatest poet be intend no doubt as a warn to some stupid sexton lest he should empty the grave and give the honor place to some amiable gentleman who have give more tithe to the parish work of shakespeare at the time of shakespeare 's death twenty-one play exist in manuscript in the various theater a few other have already be print in quarto form and the latter be the only publication that could possibly have meet with the poet 's own approval more probably they be take down in shorthand by some listener at the play and then pirate by some publisher for he own profit the first print collection of he play now call the first folio -lrb- 1623 -rrb- be make by two actor heme and condell who assert that they have access to the papers of the poet and have make a perfect edition in order to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive this contain thirty-six of the thirty-seven play generally attribute to shakespeare _ pericle _ be omit this celebrated first folio be print from playhouse manuscript and from print quarto contain many note and change by individual actor and stage manager moreover it be full of typographical error though the editor allege great care and accuracy and so though it be the only authoritative edition we have it be of little value in determine the date or the classification of the play as they exist in shakespeare 's mind notwithstanding this uncertainty a careful reading of the play and poem leave we with a impression of four different period of work probably correspond with the growth and experience of the poet 's life these be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a period of early experimentation it be mark by youthfulness and exuberance of imagination by extravagance of language and by the frequent use of rimed couplet with he blank verse the period date from he arrival in london to 1595 typical work of this first period be he early poem _ love 's labor 's lose two gentleman of verona _ and _ richard iii _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- a period of rapid growth and development from 1595 to 1600 such play as _ the merchant of venice midsummer night 's dream as you like it _ and _ henry iv _ all write in this period show more careful and artistic work better plot and a marked increase in knowledge of human nature -lrb- 3 -rrb- a period of gloom and depression from 1600 to 1607 which mark the full maturity of he power what cause this evident sadness be unknown but it be generally attribute to some personal experience couple with the political misfortune of he friend essex and southampton the _ sonnet _ with they note of personal disappointment _ twelfth night _ which be shakespeare 's farewell to mirth and he great tragedy _ hamlet lear macbeth othello _ and _ julius cæsar _ belong to this period -lrb- 4 -rrb- a period of restore serenity of calm after storm which mark the last year of the poet 's literary work _ the winter 's tale _ and _ the tempest _ be the best of he later play but they all show a fall off from he previous work and indicate a second period of experimentation with the taste of a fickle public to read in succession four play take a typical work from each of the above period be one of the very best way of get quickly at the real life and mind of shakespeare following be a complete list with the approximate date of he work classify accord to the above four period first period early experiment _ venus and adonis rape of lucrece _ 1594 _ titus andronicus henry vi _ -lrb- three part -rrb- 1590-1591 _ love 's labor 's lose _ 1590 _ comedy of error two gentleman of verona _ 1591-1592 _ richard-iii _ 1593 _ richard ii king john _ 1594-1595 second period development _ romeo and juliet midsummer night 's dream _ 1595 _ merchant of venice henry iv _ -lrb- first part -rrb- 1596 _ henry iv _ -lrb- second part -rrb- _ merry wife of windsor _ 1597 _ much ado about nothing _ 1598 _ as you like it henry v _ 1599 third period maturity and gloom _ sonnet _ -lrb- 1600 - -rrb- _ twelfth night _ 1600 _ tame of the shrew julius cæsar hamlet troilus and cressida _ 1601-1602 _ all 's well that end well measure for measure _ 1603 _ othello _ 1604 _ king lear _ 1605 _ macbeth _ 1606 _ antony and cleopatra timon of athen _ 1607 fourth period late experiment _ coriolanus pericle _ 1608 _ cymbeline _ 1609 _ winter 's tale _ 1610-1611 _ the tempest _ 1611 _ henry viii _ -lrb- unfinished -rrb- classification accord to source in history legend and story shakespeare find the material for nearly all he drama and so they be often divide into three class call historical play like _ richard iii _ and _ henry v _ legendary or partly historical play like _ macbeth king lear _ and _ julius cæsar _ and fictional play like _ romeo and juliet _ and _ the merchant of venice _ shakespeare invent few if any of the plot or story upon which he drama be found but borrow they freely after the custom of he age wherever he find they for he legendary and historical material he depend largely on _ holinshed 's chronicle of england scotland and ireland _ and on north 's translation of plutarch 's famous _ life _ a full half of he play be fictional and in these he use the most popular romance of the day seem to depend most on the italian story-teller only two or three of he plot as in _ love 's labor 's lose _ and _ merry wife of windsor _ be say to be original and even these be doubtful occasionally shakespeare make over a older play as in _ henry vi comedy of error _ and _ hamlet _ and in one instance at least he seize upon a incident of shipwreck in which london be greatly interested and make out of it the original and fascinating play of _ the tempest _ in much the same spirit which lead we modern playwright when they dramatize a popular novel or a war story to catch the public fancy classification accord to dramatic type shakespeare 's drama be usually divide into three class call tragedy comedy and historical play strictly speak the drama have but two division tragedy and comedy in which be include the many subordinate form of tragi-comedy melodrama lyric drama -lrb- opera -rrb- farce etc a tragedy be a drama in which the principal character be involve in desperate circumstance or lead by overwhelming passion it be invariably serious and dignified the movement be always stately but grow more and more rapid as it approach the climax and the end be always calamitous result in death or dire misfortune to the principal as chaucer 's monk say before he begin to biwayle in maner of tragedie : tragedie be to seyn a certeyn storie of he that stand in great prosperitee and be y-fallen out of heigh degree into miserie and endeth wrecchedly a comedy on the other hand be a drama in which the character be place in more or less humorous situation the movement be light and often mirthful and the play end in general good will and happiness the historical drama aim to present some historical age or character and may be either a comedy or a tragedy the follow list include the best of shakespeare 's play in each of the three class but the order indicate merely the author 's personal opinion of the relative merit of the play in each class thus _ merchant of venice _ would be the first of the comedy for the beginner to read and _ julius cæsar _ be a excellent introduction to the historical play and the tragedy comedy _ merchant of venice midsummer night 's dream as you like it winter 's tale the tempest twelfth night _ tragedy _ romeo and juliet macbeth hamlet king lear othello _ historical play _ julius cæsar richard iii henry iv henry v coriolanus antony and cleopatra _ doubtful play it be reasonably certain that some of the play generally attribute to shakespeare be partly the work of other dramatist the first of these doubtful play often call the pre-shakespearian group be _ titus andronicus _ and the first part of _ henry vi _ shakespeare probably work with marlowe in the two last part of _ henry vi _ and in _ richard iii _ the three play _ tame of the shrew timon _ and _ pericle _ be only partly shakespeare 's work but the other author be unknown _ henry viii _ be the work of fletcher and shakespeare opinion be divide as to whether shakespeare help fletcher or whether it be a unfinished work of shakespeare which be put into fletcher 's hand for completion _ two noble kinsman _ be a play not ordinarily find in edition of shakespeare but it be often place among he doubtful work the greater part of the play be undoubtedly by fletcher _ edward iii _ be one of several crude play publish at first anonymously and later attribute to shakespeare by publisher who desire to sell they wares it contain a few passage that strongly suggest shakespeare but the external evidence be all against he authorship shakespeare 's poem it be generally assert that if shakespeare have write no play he poem alone would have give he a commanding place in the elizabethan age nevertheless in the various history of we literature there be apparent a desire to praise and pass over all but the _ sonnet _ as rapidly as possible and the reason may be state frankly he two long poem venus and adoni and the rape of lucrece contain much poetic fancy but it must be say of both that the subject be unpleasant and that they be drag out to unnecessary length in order to show the play of youthful imagination they be extremely popular in shakespeare 's day but in comparison with he great dramatic work these poem be now of minor importance shakespeare 's _ sonnet _ one hundred and fifty-four in number be the only direct expression of the poet 's own feeling that we possess for he play be the most impersonal in all literature they be publish together in 1609 but if they have any unity in shakespeare 's mind they plan and purpose be hard to discover by some critic they be regard as mere literary exercise by other as the expression of some personal grief during the third period of the poet 's literary career still other take a hint from the sonnet begin two love i have of comfort and despair divide they all into two class address to a man who be shakespeare 's friend and to a woman who disdain he love the reader may well avoid such classification and read a few sonnet like the twenty - ninth for instance and let they speak they own message a few be trivial and artificial enough suggest the elaborate exercise of a piano player but the majority be remarkable for they subtle thought and exquisite expression here and there be one like that beginning when to the session of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of thing past which will haunt the reader long afterwards like the remembrance of a old german melody shakespeare 's place and influence shakespeare hold by general acclamation the foremost place in the world 's literature and he overwhelming greatness render it difficult to criticise or even to praise he two poet only homer and dante have be name with he but each of these write within narrow limit while shakespeare 's genius include all the world of nature and of man in a word he be the universal poet to study nature in he work be like explore a new and beautiful country to study man in he work be like go into a great city view the motley crowd as one view a great masquerade in which past and present mingle freely and familiarly as if the dead be all live again and the marvelous thing in this masquerade of all sort and condition of man be that shakespeare lift the mask from every face let we see the man as he be in he own soul and show we in each one some germ of good some soul of goodness even in thing evil for shakespeare strike no uncertain note and raise no doubt to add to the burden of you own good always overcome evil in the long run and love faith work and duty be the four element that in all age make the world right to criticise or praise the genius that create these man and woman be to criticise or praise humanity itself of he influence in literature it be equally difficult to speak goethe express the common literary judgment when he say i do not remember that any book or person or event in my life ever make so great a impression upon I as the play of shakespeare he influence upon we own language and thought be beyond calculation shakespeare and the king jame bible be the two great conservator of the english speech and one who habitually read they find himself possess of a style and vocabulary that be beyond criticism even those who read no shakespeare be still unconsciously guide by he for he thought and expression have so pervaded we life and literature that it be impossible so long as one speak the english language to escape he influence he life be gentle and the element so mixed in he that nature might stand up and say to all the world this be a man v shakespeare 's contemporary and successor in the drama decline of the drama it be inevitable that the drama should decline after shakespeare for the simple reason that there be no other great enough to fill he place aside from this other cause be at work and the chief of these be at the very source of the elizabethan drama it must be remember that we first playwright write to please they audience that the drama rise in england because of the desire of a patriotic people to see something of the stir life of the time reflect on the stage for there be no papers or magazine in those day and people come to the theater not only to be amuse but to be inform like child they want to see a story act and like man they want to know what it mean shakespeare fulfil they desire he give they they story and he genius be great enough to show in every play not only they own life and passion but something of the meaning of all life and of that eternal justice which use the war of human passion for its own great end thus good and evil mingle freely in he drama but the evil be never attractive and the good triumph as inevitably as fate though he language be sometimes coarse we be to remember that it be the custom of he age to speak somewhat coarsely and that in language as in thought and feeling shakespeare be far above most of he contemporary with he successor all this be change the audience itself have gradually change and in place of plain people eager for a story and for information we see a larger and larger proportion of those who go to the play because they have nothing else to do they want amusement only and since they have blunt by idleness the desire for simple and wholesome amusement they call for something more sensational shakespeare 's successor cater to the depraved taste of this new audience they lack not only shakespeare 's genius but he broad charity he moral insight into life with the exception of ben jonson they neglect the simple fact that man in he deepest nature be a moral being and that only a play which satisfy the whole nature of man by show the triumph of the moral law can ever wholly satisfy a audience or a people beaumont and fletcher forget the deep meaning of life strove for effect by increase the sensationalism of they play webster revel in tragedy of blood and thunder massinger and ford make another step downward produce evil and licentious scene for they own sake make character and situation more immoral till notwithstanding these dramatist ' ability the stage have become insincere frivolous and bad ben jonson 's ode come leave the loathe stage be the judgment of a large and honest nature grow weary of the play and the player of the time we read with a sense of relief that in 1642 only twenty-six year after shakespeare 's death both house of parliament vote to close the theater as breeder of lie and immorality ben jonson -lrb- 1573-1637 -rrb- personally jonson be the most commanding literary figure among the elizabethan for twenty-five year he be the literary dictator of london the chief of all the wit that gather nightly at the old devil tavern with he great learn he ability and he commanding position as poet laureate he set himself squarely against he contemporary and the romantic tendency of the age for two thing he fight bravely -- to restore the classic form of the drama and to keep the stage from its downward course apparently he fail the romantic school fix its hold more strongly than ever the stage go swiftly to a end as sad as that of the early dramatist nevertheless he influence live and grow more powerful till aid largely by french influence it result in the so-called classicism of the eighteenth century life jonson be bear at westminster about the year 1573 he father a educate gentleman have he property confiscate and be himself throw into prison by queen mary so we infer the family be of some prominence from he mother he receive certain strong characteristic and by a single short reference in jonson 's work we be lead to see the kind of woman she be it be while jonson be tell drummond of the occasion when he be throw into prison because some passage in the comedy of _ eastward ho _ give offense to king jame and he be in danger of a horrible death after have he ear and nose cut off he tell we how after he pardon he be banquet with he friend when he old mother come in and show a paper full of lusty strong poison which she intend to mix with he drink just before the execution and to show that she be no churl she intend first to drink of the poison herself the incident be all the more suggestive from the fact that chapman and marston one he friend and the other he enemy be first cast into prison as the author of _ eastward ho _ and rough ben jonson at once declare that he too have have a small hand in the writing and go to join they in prison jonson 's father come out of prison have give up he estate and become a minister he die just before the son 's birth and two year later the mother marry a bricklayer of london the boy be send to a private school and later make he own way to westminster school where the submaster camden strike by the boy 's ability teach and largely support he for a short time he may have study at the university in cambridge but he stepfather soon set he to learn the bricklayer 's trade he run away from this and go with the english army to fight spaniard in the low country he best know exploit there be to fight a duel between the line with one of the enemy 's soldier while both army look on jonson kill he man and take he arm and make he way back to he own line in a way to delight the old norman troubadour he soon return to england and married precipitately when only nineteen or twenty year old five year later we find he employ like shakespeare as actor and reviser of old play in the theater thereafter he life be a varied and stormy one he kill a actor in a duel and only escape hanging by plead benefit of clergy -lrb- 154 -rrb- but he lose all he poor goods and be brand for life on he left thumb in he first great play _ every man in he humor _ -lrb- 1598 -rrb- shakespeare act one of the part and that may have be the beginning of they long friendship other play follow rapidly upon the accession of jame jonson 's masque win he royal favor and he be make poet laureate he now become undoubted leader of the literary man of he time though he rough honesty and he hatred of the literary tendency of the age make he quarrel with nearly all of they in 1616 soon after shakespeare 's retirement he stop write for the stage and give himself up to study and serious work in 1618 he travel on foot to scotland where he visit drummond from whom we have the scant record of he varied life he impression of this journey call _ foot pilgrimage _ be lose in a fire before publication thereafter he produce less and he work decline in vigor but spite of grow poverty and infirmity we notice in he later work especially in the unfinished _ sad shepherd _ a certain mellowness and tender human sympathy which be lack in he earlier production he die poverty stricken in 1637 unlike shakespeare 's he death be mourn as a national calamity and he be bury with all honor in westminster abbey on he grave be lay a marble slab on which the word o rare ben jonson be he sufficient epitaph work of ben jonson jonson 's work be in strong contrast with that of shakespeare and of the later elizabethan dramatist alone he fight against the romantic tendency of the age and to restore the classic standard thus the whole action of he drama usually cover only a few hour or a single day he never take liberty with historical fact as shakespeare do but be accurate to the smallest detail he drama abound in classical learning be carefully and logically construct and comedy and tragedy be keep apart instead of crowd each other as they do in shakespeare and in life in one respect he comedy be worthy of careful reading -- they be intensely realistic present man and woman of the time exactly as they be from a few of jonson 's scene we can understand -- better than from all the play of shakespeare -- how man talk and act during the age of elizabeth jonson 's first comedy _ every man in he humor _ be a key to all he drama the word humor in he age stand for some characteristic whim or quality of society jonson give to he lead character some prominent humor exaggerate it as the cartoonist enlarge the most characteristic feature of a face and so hold it before we attention that all other quality be lose sight of which be the method that dicken use later in many of he novel _ every man in he humor _ be the first of three satire its special aim be to ridicule the humor of the city the second _ cynthium 's revel _ satirize the humor of the court while the third _ the poetaster _ the result of a quarrel with he contemporary be level at the false standard of the poet of the age the three best know of jonson 's comedy be _ volpone or the fox the alchemist _ and _ epicoene or the silent woman volpone _ be a keen and merciless analysis of a man govern by a overwhelming love of money for its own sake the first word in the first scene be a key to the whole comedy : _ -lrb- volpone -rrb- _ good morning to the day and next my gold open the shrine that i may see my saint -lrb- _ mosca withdraw a curtain and discover pile of gold plate jewel etc _ -rrb- hail the world 's soul and mine volpone 's method of increase he wealth be to play upon the avarice of man he pretend to be at the point of death and he suitor who know he love of gain and that he have no heir endeavor hypocritically to sweeten he last moment by give he rich present so that he will leave they all he wealth the intrigue of these suitor furnish the story of the play and show to what infamous depths avarice will lead a man _ the alchemist _ be a study of quackery on one side and of gullibility on the other found on the mediæval idea of the philosopher 's stone -lrb- 155 -rrb- and apply as well to the patent medicine and get-rich-quick scheme of we day as to the peculiar form of quackery with which jonson be more familiar in plot and artistic construction _ the alchemist _ be a almost perfect specimen of the best english drama it have some remarkably good passage and be the most readable of jonson 's play _ epicoene or the silent woman _ be a prose comedy exceedingly well construct full of life abound in fun and unexpected situation here be a brief outline from which the reader may see of what material jonson make up he comedy the chief character be morose a rich old codger whose humor be a horror of noise he live in a street so narrow that it will admit no carriage he pad the door plug the keyhole put mattress on the stair he dismiss a servant who wear squeaky boot make all the rest go about in thick stocking and they must answer he by sign since he can not bear to hear anybody but himself talk he disinherit he poor nephew eugenie and to make sure that the latter will not get any money out of he resolve to marry he confidant in this delicate matter be cutbeard the barber who unlike he kind never speak unless speak to and do not even knick he scissors as he work cutbeard -lrb- who be secretly in league with the nephew -rrb- tell he of epicoene a rare silent woman and morose be so delighted with she silence that he resolve to marry she on the spot cutbeard produce a parson with a bad cold who can speak only in a whisper to marry they and when the parson cough after the ceremony morose demand back five shilling of the fee to save it the parson cough more and be hurriedly bundle out of the house the silent woman find she voice immediately after the marriage begin to talk loudly and to make reform in the household drive morose to distraction a noisy dinner party from a neighbor house with drum and trumpet and a quarrel man and wife be skillfully guide in at this moment to celebrate the wedding morose flee for he life and be find perch like a monkey on a crossbeam in the attic with all he nightcap tie over he ear he seek a divorce but be drive frantic by the loud argument of a lawyer and a divine who be no other than cutbeard and a sea captain disguise when morose be past all hope the nephew offer to release he from he wife and she noisy friend if he will allow he five hundred pound a year morose offer he anything everything to escape he torment and sign a deed to that effect then come the surprise of the play when eugenie whip the wig from epicoene and show a boy in disguise it will be see that the _ silent woman _ with its rapid action and its unexpected situation offer a excellent opportunity for the actor but the reading of the play as of most of jonson 's comedy be mar by low intrigue show a sad state of moral among the upper class besides these and many other less known comedy jonson write two great tragedy _ sejanus _ -lrb- 1603 -rrb- and _ catiline _ -lrb- 1611 -rrb- upon severe classical line after cease he work for the stage jonson write many masque in honor of jame i and of queen anne to be play amid elaborate scenery by the gentleman of the court the best of these be the satyr the penate masque of blackness masque of beauty hue and cry after cupid and the masque of queen in all he play jonson show a strong lyric gift and some of he little poem and song like the triumph of chari drink to I only with thine eye and to the memory of my beloved mother be now better know than he great dramatic work a single volume of prose call _ timber or discovery make upon man and matter _ be a interesting collection of short essay which be more like bacon 's than any other work of the age beaumont and fletcher the work of these two man be so closely interwoven that though fletcher outlive beaumont by nine year and the latter have no hand in some forty of the play that bear they joint name we still class they together and only scholar attempt to separate they work so as to give each writer he due share unlike most of the elizabethan dramatist they both come from noble and culture family and be university train they work in strong contrast with jonson 's be intensely romantic and in it all however coarse or brutal the scene there be still as emerson point out the subtle recognition of gentility beaumont -lrb- 1584-1616 -rrb- be the brother of sir john beaumont of leicestershire from oxford he come to london to study law but soon give it up to write for the stage fletcher -lrb- 1579-1625 -rrb- be the son of the bishop of london and show in all he work the influence of he high social position and of he cambridge education the two dramatist meet at the mermaid tavern under ben jonson 's leadership and soon become inseparable friend live and work together tradition have it that beaumont supply the judgment and the solid work of the play while fletcher furnish the high-colored sentiment and the lyric poetry without which a elizabethan play would have be incomplete of they joint play the two best know be _ philaster _ whose old theme like that of _ cymbeline _ and _ griselda _ be the jealousy of a lover and the faithfulness of a girl and _ the maid 's tragedy _ concern fletcher 's work the most interesting literary question be how much do he write of shakespeare 's _ henry viii _ and how much do shakespeare help he in _ the two noble kinsman _ john webster of webster 's personal history we know nothing except that he be well know as a dramatist under jame i he extraordinary power of expression rank he with shakespeare but he talent seem to have be largely devote to the blood-and-thunder play begin by marlowe he two best know play be _ the white devil _ -lrb- pub 1612 -rrb- and _ the duchess of malfi _ -lrb- pub 1623 -rrb- the latter spite of its horror rank he as one of the greatest master of english tragedy it must be remember that he seek in this play to reproduce the italian life of the sixteenth century and for this no imaginary horror be need the history of any italian court or city in this period furnish more vice and violence and dishonor than even the gloomy imagination of webster could conceive all the so-called blood tragedy of the elizabethan period from thoma kyd 's _ spanish tragedy _ down however much they may condemn the brutal taste of the english audience be still only so many search light throw upon a history of horrible darkness thoma middleton -lrb- 1570-1627 -rrb- middleton be best know by two great play _ the changele _ -lrb- 156 -rrb- and _ woman beware woman _ in poetry and diction they be almost worthy at time to rank with shakespeare 's play otherwise in they sensationalism and unnaturalness they do violence to the moral sense and be repulsive to the modern reader two earlier play _ a trick to catch the old one _ he best comedy and _ a fair quarrel _ he earliest tragedy be less mature in thought and expression but more readable because they seem to express middleton 's own idea of the drama rather than that of the corrupt court and playwright of he later age thoma heywood -lrb- 1580-1650 -rrb- heywood 's life of which we know little in detail cover the whole period of the elizabethan drama to the glory of that drama he contribute accord to he own statement the greater part at least of nearly two hundred and twenty play it be a enormous amount of work but he seem to have be animated by the modern literary spirit of follow the best market and striking while the financial iron be hot naturally good work be impossible even to genius under such circumstance and few of he play be now know the two best if the reader would obtain he own idea of heywood 's undoubted ability be _ a woman kill with kindness _ a pathetic story of domestic life and _ the fair maid of the west _ a melodrama with plenty of fighting of the popular kind thoma dekker -lrb- 1570 - -rrb- dekker be in please contrast with most of the dramatist of the time all we know of he must be infer from he work which show a happy and sunny nature pleasant and good to meet the reader will find the best expression of dekker 's personality and erratic genius in _ the shoemaker ' holiday _ a humorous study of plain work people and _ old fortunatus _ a fairy drama of the wish hat and no end of money whether intend for child or not it have the effect of charming the elder far more than the young people and the play become immensely popular massinger ford shirley these three man mark the end of the elizabethan drama they work do largely while the struggle be on between the actor and the corrupt court on one side and the puritan on the other show a deliberate turn away not only from puritan standard but from the high ideal of they own art to pander to the corrupt taste of the upper class philip massinger -lrb- 1584-1640 -rrb- be a dramatic poet of great natural ability but he plot and situation be usually so strained and artificial that the modern reader find no interest in they in he best comedy _ a new way to pay old debt _ he achieve great popularity and give we one figure sir gile overreach which be one of the typical character of the english stage he best play be _ the great duke of florence the virgin martyr _ and _ the maid of honor _ john ford -lrb- 1586-1642 -rrb- and jame shirley -lrb- 1596-1666 -rrb- have leave we little of permanent literary value and they work be read only by those who wish to understand the whole rise and fall of the drama a occasional scene in ford 's play be as strong as anything that the elizabethan age produce but as a whole the play be unnatural and tiresome probably he best play be _ the broken heart _ -lrb- 1633 -rrb- shirley be give to imitation of he predecessor and he very imitation be characteristic of a age which have lose its inspiration a single play _ hyde park _ with its frivolous realistic dialogue be sometimes read for its reflection of the fashionable gossipy talk of the day long before shirley 's death the actor say farewell othello 's occupation 's go parliament vote to close the theater thereby save the drama from a more inglorious death by dissipation -lrb- 157 -rrb- vi the prose writer franci bacon -lrb- 1561-1626 -rrb- in bacon we see one of those complex and contradictory nature which be the despair of the biographer if the writer be a admirer of bacon he find too much that he must excuse or pass over in silence and if he take he stand on the law to condemn the avarice and dishonesty of he subject he find enough moral courage and nobility to make he question the justice of he own judgment on the one hand be rugged ben jonson 's tribute to he power and ability and on the other hallam 's summary that he be a man who be intrust with the highest gift of heaven habitually abuse they for the poorest purpose of earth -- hire they out for guinea place and title in the service of injustice covetousness and oppression lay aside the opinion of other and rely only upon the fact of bacon 's life we find on the one side the politician cold calculate selfish and on the other the literary and scientific man with a impressive devotion to truth for its own great sake here a man use questionable means to advance he own interest and there a man seek with zeal and endless labor to penetrate the secret way of nature with no other object than to advance the interest of he fellow-men so in we ignorance of the secret motive and spring of the man 's life judgment be necessarily suspend bacon be apparently one of those double nature that only god be competent to judge because of the strange mixture of intellectual strength and moral weakness that be in they life bacon be the son of sir nichola bacon lord keeper of the seal and of the learn ann cook sister-in-law to lord burleigh greatest of the queen 's statesman from these connection as well as from native gift he be attract to the court and as a child be call by elizabeth she little lord keeper at twelve he go to cambridge but leave the university after two year declare the whole plan of education to be radically wrong and the system of aristotle which be the basis of all philosophy in those day to be a childish delusion since in the course of century it have produce no fruit but only a jungle of dry and useless branch strange even for a sophomore of fourteen thus to condemn the whole system of the university but such be the boy and the system next year in order to continue he education he accompany the english ambassador to france where he be say to have busy himself chiefly with the practical study of statistics and diplomacy two year later he be recall to london by the death of he father without money and naturally with expensive taste he apply to he uncle burleigh for a lucrative position it be in this application that he use the expression so characteristic of the elizabethan age that he have take all knowledge for he province burleigh who misjudge he as a dreamer and self-seeker not only refuse to help he at the court but successfully oppose he advancement by elizabeth bacon then take up the study of law and be admit to the bar in 1582 that he have not lose he philosophy in the maze of the law be show by he tract write about this time on the greatest birth of time which be a plea for he inductive system of philosophy reasoning from many fact to one law rather than from a assumed law to particular fact which be the deductive method that have be in use for century in he famous plea for progress bacon demand three thing : the free investigation of nature the discovery of fact instead of theory and the verification of result by experiment rather than by argument in we day these be the a b c of science but in bacon 's time they seem revolutionary as a lawyer he become immediately successful he knowledge and power of plead become widely know and it be almost at the beginning of he career that jonson write the fear of every one that hear he speak be that he should make a end the publication of he _ essay _ add greatly to he fame but bacon be not content he head be buzz with huge scheme -- the pacification of unhappy ireland the simplification of english law the reform of the church the study of nature the establishment of a new philosophy meanwhile sad to say he play the game of politics for he personal advantage he devote himself to essex the young and dangerous favorite of the queen win he friendship and then use he skillfully to better he own position when the earl be try for treason it be partly at least through bacon 's effort that he be convict and behead and though bacon claim to have be actuate by a high sense of justice we be not convince that he understand either justice or friendship in appear as queen 's counsel against the man who have befriend he he coldbloodedness and lack of moral sensitiveness appear even in he essay on love and friendship indeed we can understand he life only upon the theory that he intellectuality leave he cold and dead to the higher sentiment of we humanity during elizabeth 's reign bacon have seek repeatedly for high office but have be block by burleigh and perhaps also by the queen 's own shrewdness in judge man with the advent of jame i -lrb- 1603 -rrb- bacon devoted himself to the new ruler and rise rapidly in favor he be knight and soon afterwards attain another object of he ambition in marry a rich wife the appearance of he great work the _ advancement of learn _ in 1605 be largely the result of the mental stimulus produce by he change in fortune in 1613 he be make attorney-general and speedily make enemy by use the office to increase he personal end he justify himself in he course by he devotion to the king 's cause and by the belief that the higher he position and the more ample he mean the more he could do for science it be in this year that bacon write he series of _ state papers _ which show a marvelous grasp of the political tendency of he age have he advice be follow it would have certainly avert the struggle between king and parliament that follow speedily in 1617 he be appoint to he father 's office lord keeper of the seal and the next year to the high office of lord chancellor with this office he receive the title of baron verulam and later of viscount st alban which he affix with some vanity to he literary work two year later appear he greatest work the _ novum organum _ call after aristotle 's famous _ organon _ bacon do not long enjoy he political honor the storm which have be long gather against jame 's government break suddenly upon bacon 's head when parliament assemble in 1621 it vent its distrust of jame and he favorite villier by striking unexpectedly at they chief adviser bacon be sternly accuse of accept bribe and the evidence be so great that he confess that there be much political corruption abroad in the land that he be personally guilty of some of it and he throw himself upon the mercy of he judge parliament at that time be in no mood for mercy bacon be deprive of he office and be sentence to pay the enormous fine of 40000 pound to be imprison during the king 's pleasure and thereafter to be banish forever from parliament and court though the imprisonment last only a few day and the fine be largely remitted bacon 's hope and scheme for political honor be end and it be at this point of appalling adversity that the nobility in the man 's nature assert itself strongly if the reader be interested to apply a great man 's philosophy to he own life he will find the essay of great place most interesting in this connection bacon now withdraw permanently from public life and devoted he splendid ability to literary and scientific work he complete the _ essay _ experiment largely write history scientific article and one scientific novel and make addition to he _ instauratio magna _ the great philosophical work which be never finish in the spring of 1626 while drive in a snowstorm it occur to he that snow might be use as a preservative instead of salt true to he own method of arrive at truth he stop at the first house buy a fowl and proceed to test he theory the experiment chill he and he die soon after from the effect of he exposure as macaulay write the great apostle of experimental philosophy be destine to be its martyr work of bacon bacon 's philosophic work _ the advancement of learn _ and the _ novum organum _ will be best understand in connection with the _ instauratio magna _ or _ the great institution of true philosophy _ of which they be part the _ instauratio _ be never complete but the very idea of the work be magnificent -- to sweep away the involve philosophy of the schoolman and the educational system of the university and to substitute a single great work which should be a complete education a rich storehouse for the glory of the creator and for the relief of man 's estate the object of this education be to bring practical result to all the people instead of a little selfish culture and much useless speculation which he conceive be the only product of the university the instauratio magna this be the most ambitious though it be not the best know of bacon 's work for the insight it give we into the author 's mind we note here a brief outline of he subject it be divide into six part as follow : 1 _ partitione scientiarum _ this be to be a classification and summary of all human knowledge philosophy and all speculation must be cast out and the natural science establish as the basis of all education the only part complete be _ the advancement of learn _ which serve as a introduction 2 _ novum organum _ or the new instrument that be the use of reason and experiment instead of the old aristotelian logic to find truth one must do two thing : -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- get rid of all prejudice or idol as bacon call they these idol be four : idol of the tribe that be prejudice due to common method of thought among all race idol of the cave or den that be personal peculiarity and prejudice idol of the market place due to error of language and idol of the theater which be the unreliable tradition of man -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- after discard the above idol we must interrogate nature must collect fact by means of numerous experiment arrange they in order and then determine the law that underlie they it will be see at a glance that the above be the most important of bacon 's work the _ organum _ be to be in several book only two of which he complete and these he write and rewrite twelve time until they satisfy he 3 _ historic naturalis et experimentalis _ the study of all the phenomenon of nature of four part of this work which he complete one of they at least the _ sylva sylvarum _ be decidedly at variance with he own idea of fact and experiment it abound in fanciful explanation more worthy of the poetic than of the scientific mind nature be see to be full of desire and instinct the air thirst for light and fragrance body rise or sink because they have a appetite for height or depth the quality of body be the result of a essence so that when we discover the essence of gold and silver and diamond it will be a simple matter to create as much of they as we may need 4 _ scalum intellectus _ or ladder of the mind be the rational application of the _ organum _ to all problem by it the mind should ascend step by step from particular fact and instance to general law and abstract principle 5 _ prodromus _ prophecy or anticipation be a list of discovery that man shall make when they have apply bacon 's method of study and experimentation 6 _ philosophium secunda _ which be to be a record of practical result of the new philosophy when the succeed age should have apply it faithfully it be impossible to regard even the outline of such a vast work without a involuntary thrill of admiration for the bold and original mind which conceive it we may say bacon make no despicable beginning the destiny of the human race must complete the work for upon this will depend not only a speculative good but all the fortune of mankind and all they power there be the unconscious expression of one of the great mind of the world bacon be like one of the architect of the middle age who draw he plan for a mighty cathedral perfect in every detail from the deep foundation stone to the cross on the highest spire and who give over he plan to the builder know that in he own lifetime only one tiny chapel would be complete but know also that the very beauty of he plan would appeal to other and that succeed age would finish the work which he dare to begin the essay bacon 's famous _ essay _ be the one work which will interest all student of we literature he _ instauratio _ be in latin write mostly by pay helper from short english abstract he regard latin as the only language worthy of a great work but the world neglect he latin to seize upon he english -- marvelous english terse pithy pack with think in a age that use endless circumlocution the first ten essay publish in 1597 be brief notebook jotting of bacon 's observation they success astonish the author but not till fifteen year later be they republish and enlarged they charm grow upon bacon himself and during he retirement he give more think to the wonderful language which he have at first despise as much as aristotle 's philosophy in 1612 appear a second edition contain thirty-eight essay and in 1625 the year before he death he republish the _ essay _ in they present form polishing and enlarge the original ten to fifty-eight cover a wide variety of subject suggest by the life of man around he concern the best of these essay there be as many opinion as there be reader and what one get out of they depend largely upon he own thought and intelligence in this respect they be like that nature to which bacon direct man 's thought the whole volume may be read through in a evening but after one have read they a dozen time he still find as many place to pause and reflect as at the first reading if one must choose out of such a storehouse we would suggest study goodness riches atheism unity in religion adversity friendship and great place as a introduction to bacon 's worldly-wise philosophy miscellaneous work other work of bacon be interesting as a revelation of the elizabethan mind rather than because of any literary value _ the new atlanti _ be a kind of scientific novel describe another utopia as see by bacon the inhabitant of atlanti have banish philosophy and apply bacon 's method of investigate nature use the result to better they own condition they have a wonderful civilization in which many of we later discovery -- academy of the science observatory balloon submarine the modification of species and several other -- be foreshadow with a strange mixture of cold reason and poetic intuition _ de sapientium veterum _ be a fanciful attempt to show the deep meaning underlie ancient myth -- a meaning which would have astonish the myth maker themselves the _ history of henry vii _ be a calm dispassionate and remarkably accurate history which make we regret that bacon do not do more historical work besides these be metrical version of certain psalm -- which be valuable in view of the controversy anent shakespeare 's play for show bacon 's utter inability to write poetry -- and a large number of letter and state papers show the range and power of he intellect bacon 's place and work although bacon be for the greater part of he life a busy man of affair one can not read he work without become conscious of two thing -- a perennial freshness which the world insist upon in all literature that be to endure and a intellectual power which mark he as one of the great mind of the world of late the general tendency be to give less and less prominence to he work in science and philosophy but criticism of he _ instauratio _ in view of he lofty aim be of small consequence it be true that he science to-day seem woefully inadequate true also that though he seek to discover truth he think perhaps to monopolize it and so look with the same suspicion upon copernicus as upon the philosopher the practical man who despise philosophy have simply misunderstand the thing he despise in be practical and experimental in a romantic age he be not unique as be often allege but only express the tendency of the english mind in all age three century earlier the monk roger bacon do more practical experiment than the elizabethan sage and the latter 's famous idol be strongly suggestive of the former 's four source of human ignorance although bacon do not make any of the scientific discovery at which he aim yet the whole spirit of he work especially of _ the organum _ have strongly influence science in the direction of accurate observation and of carefully test every theory by practical experiment he that regardeth the cloud shall not sow say a wise writer of old and bacon turn man 's thought from the heaven above with which they have be too busy to the earth beneath which they have too much neglect in a age when man be busy with romance and philosophy he insist that the first object of education be to make a man familiar with he natural environment from book he turn to man from theory to fact from philosophy to nature -- and that be perhaps he greatest contribution to life and literature like mose upon pisgah he stand high enough above he fellow to look out over a promised land which he people would inherit but into which he himself might never enter richard hooker -lrb- 1554-1600 -rrb- in strong contrast with bacon be richard hooker one of the greatest prose writer of the elizabethan age one must read the story of he life a obscure and lowly life animated by a great spirit as tell by izaak walton to appreciate the full force of this contrast bacon take all knowledge for he province but master no single part of it hooker take a single theme the law and practice of the english church so handle it that no scholar even of the present day would dream of supersede it or of building upon any other foundation than that which hooker lay down he one great work be _ the law of ecclesiastical polity _ -lrb- 158 -rrb- a theological and argumentative book but entirely apart from its subject it will be read wherever man desire to hear the power and stateliness of the english language here be a single sentence remarkable not only for its perfect form but also for its expression of the reverence for law which lie at the heart of anglo-saxon civilization : of law there can be no less acknowledged than that she seat be the bosom of god she voice the harmony of the world all thing in heaven and earth do she homage the very least as feel she care and the greatest as not exempt from she power both angel and man and creature of what condition soever though each in different sort and manner yet all with uniform consent admire she as the mother of they peace and joy sidney and raleigh among the prose writer of this wonderful literary age there be many other that deserve pass notice though they fall far below the standard of bacon and hooker sir philip sidney -lrb- 1554-1586 -rrb- who have already be consider as a poet be quite as well know by he prose work _ arcadia _ a pastoral romance and the _ defense of poesie _ one of we earliest literary essay sidney whom the poet shelley have eulogize represent the whole romantic tendency of he age while sir walter raleigh -lrb- 1552-1618 -rrb- represent its adventurous spirit and activity the life of raleigh be a almost incomprehensible mixture of the poet scholar and adventurer now help the huguenot or the struggle dutch in europe and now lead a expedition into the unmapped wild of the new world busy here with court intrigue and there with piratical attempt to capture the gold-laden spanish galleon one moment sailing the high sea in utter freedom and the next write history and poetry to solace he imprisonment such a life in itself be a volume far more interesting than anything that he write he be the restless spirit of the elizabethan age personify raleigh 's chief prose work be the _ discoverie of guiana _ a work which would certainly have be interesting enough have he tell simply what he see but which be fill with colonization scheme and vision of a el dorado to fill the eye and ear of the credulous and the _ history of the world _ write to occupy he prison hour the history be a wholly untrustworthy account of event from creation to the downfall of the macedonian empire it be interesting chiefly for its style which be simple and dignified and for the flash of wit and poetry that break into the fantastic combination of miracle tradition hearsay and state record which he call history in the conclusion be the famous apostrophe to death which suggest what raleigh might have do have he live less strenuously and write more carefully o eloquent just and mighty death whom none could advise thou hast persuade what none have dare thou hast do and whom all the world have flattered thou only hast cast out of the world and despise thou hast draw together all the star-stretched greatness all the pride cruelty and ambition of man and cover it all over with these two narrow word _ hic jacet _ john foxe -lrb- 1516-1587 -rrb- foxe will be remembered always for he famous _ book of martyr _ a book that we elder give to we on sunday when we be young think it good discipline for we to afflict we soul when we want to be roam the sunlit field or when in we enforced idleness we would if we own taste in the matter have be consult have make good shift to be quiet and happy with _ robinson crusoe _ so we have a gloomy memory of foxe and something of a grievance which prevent a just appreciation of he worth foxe have be drive out of england by the marian persecution and in a wander but diligent life on the continent he conceive the idea of write a history of the persecution of the church from the earliest day to he own the part relate to england and scotland be publish in latin in 1559 under a title as sonorous and impressive as the roman office for the dead -- _ rerum in ecclesium gestarum maximarumque per europam persecutionum commentarius _ on he return to england foxe translate this work call it the _ act and monument _ but it soon become know as the _ book of martyr _ and so it will always be call foxe 's own bitter experience cause he to write with more heat and indignation than he saintly theme would warrant and the holy tone sometimes spoil a narrative that would be impressive in its bare simplicity nevertheless the book have make for itself a secure place in we literature it be strongest in its record of humble man like rowland taylor and thoma hawke whose sublime heroism but for this narrative would have be lose amid the great name and the great event that fill the elizabethan age camden and knox two historian william camden and john knox stand out prominently among the numerous historical writer of the age camden 's _ britannium _ -lrb- 1586 -rrb- be a monumental work which mark the beginning of true antiquarian research in the field of history and he _ annals of queen elizabeth _ be worthy of a far higher place than have thus far be give it john knox the reformer in he _ history of the reformation in scotland _ have some very vivid portrait of he helper and enemy the personal and aggressive element enter too strongly for a work of history but the autobiographical part show rare literary power he account of he famous interview with mary queen of scot be clear-cut as a cameo and show the man 's extraordinary power better than a whole volume of biography such scene make one wish that more of he time have be give to literary work rather than to the dispute and trouble of he own scotch kirk hakluyt and purcha two editor of this age have make for themselves a enviable place in we literature they be richard hakluyt -lrb- 1552-1616 -rrb- and samuel purcha -lrb- 1575-1626 -rrb- hakluyt be a clergyman who in the midst of he little parish set himself to achieve two great patriotic end -- to promote the wealth and commerce of he country and to preserve the memory of all he countryman who add to the glory of the realm by they travels and exploration to further the first object he concern himself deeply with the commercial interest of the east indium company with raleigh 's colonize plan in virginium and with a translation of de soto 's travels in america to further the second he make himself familiar with book of voyage in all foreign language and with the brief report of exploration of he own countryman he _ principal navigation voyage and discovery of the english nation _ in three volume appear first in 1589 and a second edition follow in 1598-1600 the first volume tell of voyage to the north the second to indium and the east the third which be as large as the other two to the new world with the exception of the very first voyage that of king arthur to iceland in 517 which be found on a myth all the voyage be authentic account of the explorer themselves and be immensely interesting reading even at the present day no other book of travels have so well express the spirit and energy of the english race or better deserve a place in we literature samuel purcha who be also a clergyman continue the work of hakluyt use many of the latter 's unpublished manuscript and condense the record of numerous other voyage he first famous book _ purcha he pilgrimage _ appear in 1613 and be follow by _ hakluytus posthumus or purcha he pilgrime _ in 1625 the very name incline one to open the book with pleasure and when one follow he inclination -- which be after all one of the best guide in literature -- he be rarely disappointed though it fall far below the standard of hakluyt both in accuracy and literary finish there be still plenty to make one glad that the book be write and that he can now comfortably follow purcha on he pilgrimage thoma north among the translator of the elizabethan age sir thoma north -lrb- 1535-1601 -rrb- be most deserving of notice because of he version of _ plutarch 's life _ -lrb- 1579 -rrb- from which shakespeare take the character and many of the incident for three great roman play thus in north we read : cæsar also have cassius in great jealousy and suspect he much : whereupon he say on a time to he friend : what will cassius do think ye i like not he pale look another time when cæsar 's friend warn he of antonius and dolabellum he answer they again i never reckon of they but these pale-visaged and carrion lean people i fear they most mean brutus and cassius shakespeare merely touch such a scene with the magic of he genius and he cæsar speak : let I have man about I that be fat : sleek-headed man and such as sleep o ' night yond cassius have a lean and hungry look : he think too much : such man be dangerous a careful reading of north 's _ plutarch _ and then of the famous roman play show to how great a extent shakespeare be dependent upon he obscure contemporary north 's translation to which we owe so many heroic model in we literature be probably make not from plutarch but from amyot 's excellent french translation nevertheless he reproduce the spirit of the original and notwithstanding we modern and more accurate translation he remain the most inspiring interpreter of the great biographer whom emerson call the historian of heroism summary of the age of elizabeth this period be generally regard as the greatest in the history of we literature historically we note in this age the tremendous impetus receive from the renaissance from the reformation and from the exploration of the new world it be mark by a strong national spirit by patriotism by religious tolerance by social content by intellectual progress and by unbounded enthusiasm such a age of thought feeling and vigorous action find its best expression in the drama and the wonderful development of the drama culminate in shakespeare be the most significant characteristic of the elizabethan period though the age produce some excellent prose work it be essentially a age of poetry and the poetry be remarkable for its variety its freshness its youthful and romantic feeling both the poetry and the drama be permeate by italian influence which be dominant in english literature from chaucer to the restoration the literature of this age be often call the literature of the renaissance though as we have see the renaissance itself begin much earlier and for a century and a half add very little to we literary possession in we study of this great age we have note -lrb- 1 -rrb- the non-dramatic poet that be poet who do not write for the stage the center of this group be edmund spenser whose _ shepherd 's calendar _ -lrb- 1579 -rrb- mark the appearance of the first national poet since chaucer 's death in 1400

regard as a second and greater renaissance a rebirth of the moral nature of man follow the intellectual awakening of europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth century in italy whose influence have be uppermost in elizabethan literature the renaissance have be essentially pagan and sensuous it have hardly touch the moral nature of man and it bring little relief from the despotism of ruler one can hardly read the horrible record of the medicus or the borgia or the political observation of machiavellus without marvel at the moral and political degradation of a culture nation in the north especially among the german and english people the renaissance be accompany by a moral awakening and it be precisely that awaken in england that greatest moral and political reform which ever sweep over a nation in the short space of half a century which be mean by the puritan movement we shall understand it better if we remember that it have two chief object : the first be personal righteousness the second be civil and religious liberty in other word it aim to make man honest and to make they free such a movement should be clear of all the misconception which have cling to it since the restoration when the very name of puritan be make ridiculous by the jeer of the gay courtier of charle ii though the spirit of the movement be profoundly religious the puritan be not a religious sect neither be the puritan a narrow-minded and gloomy dogmatist as he be still picture even in the history pym and hampden and eliot and milton be puritan and in the long struggle for human liberty there be few name more honor by freeman everywhere cromwell and thomas hooker be puritan yet cromwell stand like a rock for religious tolerance and thoma hooker in connecticut give to the world the first write constitution in which freeman before elect they officer lay down the strict limit of the office to which they be elect that be a puritan document and it mark one of the greatest achievement in the history of government from a religious view point puritanism include all shades of belief the name be first give to those who advocate certain change in the form of worship of the reform english church under elizabeth but as the ideal of liberty rise in man 's mind and oppose to it be the king and he evil counselor and the band of intolerant churchman of whom laud be the great example then puritanism become a great national movement it include english churchman as well as extreme separatist calvinist covenanter catholic nobleman -- all bind together in resistance to despotism in church and state and with a passion for liberty and righteousness such as the world have never since see naturally such a movement have its extreme and excess and it be from a few zealot and fanatic that most of we misconception about the puritan arise life be stern in those day too stern perhaps and the intensity of the struggle against despotism make man narrow and hard in the triumph of puritanism under cromwell severe law be pass many simple pleasure be forbid and a austere standard of living be force upon a unwilling people so the criticism be make that the wild outbreak of immorality which follow the restoration of charle be partly due to the unnatural restriction of the puritan era the criticism be just but we must not forget the whole spirit of the movement that the puritan prohibit maypole dancing and horse racing be of small consequence beside the fact that he fight for liberty and justice that he overthrow despotism and make a man 's life and property safe from the tyranny of ruler a great river be not judge by the foam on its surface and certain austere law and doctrine which we have ridicule be but froth on the surface of the mighty puritan current that have flow steadily like a river of life through english and american history since the age of elizabeth change ideal the political upheaval of the period be sum up in the terrible struggle between the king and parliament which result in the death of charle at the block and the establishment of the commonwealth under cromwell for century the english people have be wonderfully loyal to they sovereign but deeper than they loyalty to king be the old saxon love for personal liberty at time as in the day of alfred and elizabeth the two ideal go hand in hand but more often they be in open strife and a final struggle for supremacy be inevitable the crisis come when jame i who have receive the right of royalty from a act of parliament begin by the assumption of divine right to ignore the parliament which have create he of the civil war which follow in the reign of charle i and of the triumph of english freedom it be unnecessary to write here the blasphemy of a man 's divine right to rule he fellow-man be end modern england begin with the charge of cromwell 's brigade of puritan at naseby religiously the age be one of even greater ferment than that which mark the beginning of the reformation a great ideal the ideal of a national church be pound to piece like a ship in the breaker and in the confusion of such a hour the action of the various sect be like that of frantic passenger each strive to save he possession from the wreck the catholic church as its name imply have always hold true to the ideal of a unite church a church which like the great roman government of the early century can bring the splendor and authority of rome to bear upon the humblest village church to the farthest end of the earth for a time that mighty ideal dazzle the german and english reformer but the possibility of a unite protestant church perish with elizabeth then instead of the world-wide church which be the ideal of catholicism come the ideal of a purely national protestantism this be the ideal of laud and the reactionary bishop no less than of the scholarly richard hooker of the rugged scotch covenanter and of the puritan of massachusett bay it be intensely interesting to note that charle call irish rebel and scotch highlander to he aid by promise to restore they national religion and that the english puritan turn to scotland for help enter into the solemn covenant of 1643 establish a national presbyterianism whose object be : to bring the church of god in the three kingdom to uniformity in religion and government to preserve the rights of parliament and the liberty of the kingdom that we and we posterity may as brethren live in faith and love and the lord may delight to live in the midst of we in this famous covenant we see the national the ecclesiastical and the personal dream of puritanism side by side in all they grandeur and simplicity year pass year of bitter struggle and heartache before the impossibility of unite the various protestant sect be generally recognize the ideal of a national church die hard and to its death be due all the religious unrest of the period only as we remember the national ideal and the struggle which it cause can we understand the amazing life and work of bunyan or appreciate the heroic spirit of the american colonist who leave home for a wilderness in order to give the new ideal of a free church in a free state its practical demonstration literary characteristic in literature also the puritan age be one of confusion due to the break up of old ideal mediaeval standard of chivalry the impossible love and romance of which spenser furnish the type perish no less surely than the ideal of a national church and in the absence of any fixed standard of literary criticism there be nothing to prevent the exaggeration of the metaphysical poet who be the literary parallel to religious sect like the anabaptist poetry take new and startling form in donne and herbert and prose become as somber as burton 's _ anatomy of melancholy _ the spiritual gloom which sooner or later fasten upon all the writer of this age and which be unjustly attribute to puritan influence be due to the break up of accept standard in government and religion no people from the greek to those of we own day have suffer the loss of old ideal without cause its writer to cry ichabod the glory have depart that be the unconscious tendency of literary man in all time who look backward for they golden age and it need not concern the student of literature who even in the break-up of cherish institution look for some foregleam of a better light which be to break upon the world this so-called gloomy age produce some minor poem of exquisite workmanship and one great master of verse whose work would glorify any age or people -- john milton in whom the indomitable puritan spirit find its noblest expression there be three main characteristic in which puritan literature differ from that of the precede age : -lrb- 1 -rrb- elizabethan literature with all its diversity have a marked unity in spirit result from the patriotism of all class and they devotion to a queen who with all she fault seek first the nation 's welfare under the stuart all this be change the king be the open enemy of the people the country be divide by the struggle for political and religious liberty and the literature be as divide in spirit as be the struggle party -lrb- 2 -rrb- elizabethan literature be generally inspiring it throb with youth and hope and vitality that which follow speak of age and sadness even its brightest hour be follow by gloom and by the pessimism inseparable from the passing of old standard -lrb- 3 -rrb- elizabethan literature be intensely romantic the romance spring from the heart of youth and believe all thing even the impossible the great schoolman 's _ credo _ i believe because it be impossible be a better expression of elizabethan literature than of mediæval theology in the literature of the puritan period one look in vain for romantic ardor even in the lyric and love poem a critical intellectual spirit take its place and whatever romance assert itself be in form rather than in feel a fantastic and artificial adornment of speech rather than the natural utterance of a heart in which sentiment be so strong and true that poetry be its only expression ii literature of the puritan period the transition poet when one attempt to classify the literature of the first half of the seventeenth century from the death of elizabeth -lrb- 1603 -rrb- to the restoration -lrb- 1660 -rrb- he realize the impossibility of group poet by any accurate standard the classification attempt here have small dependence upon date or sovereign and be suggestive rather than accurate thus shakespeare and bacon write largely in the reign of jame i but they work be elizabethan in spirit and bunyan be no less a puritan because he happen to write after the restoration the name metaphysical poet give by dr johnson be somewhat suggestive but not descriptive of the follower of donne the name caroline or cavalier poet bring to mind the careless temper of the royalist who follow king charle with a devotion of which he be unworthy and the name spenserian poet recall the little band of dreamer who cling to spenser 's ideal even while he romantic mediæval castle be batter down by science at the one gate and puritanism at the other at the beginning of this bewildering confusion of ideal express in literature we note a few writer who be generally know as jacobean poet but whom we have call the transition poet because with the later dramatist they show clearly the change standard of the age samuel daniel -lrb- 1562-1619 -rrb- daniel who be often class with the first metaphysical poet be interesting to we for two reason -- for he use of the artificial sonnet and for he literary desertion of spenser as a model for poet he _ delium _ a cycle of sonnet model perhaps after sidney 's _ astrophel and stellum _ help to fix the custom of celebrate love or friendship by a series of sonnet to which some pastoral pseudonym be affix in he sonnet many of which rank with shakespeare 's and in he later poetry especially the beautiful complaint of rosamond and he civil war he aim solely at grace of expression and become influential in give to english poetry a greater individuality and independence than it have ever know in matter he set himself squarely against the mediæval tendency : let other sing of king and paladine in aged accent and untimely word paint shadow in imaginary line this fling at spenser and he follower mark the beginning of the modern and realistic school which see in life as it be enough poetic material without the invention of allegory and impossible heroine daniel 's poetry which be forget soon after he death have receive probably more homage than it deserve in the praise of wordsworth southey lamb and coleridge the latter say : read daniel the admirable daniel the style and language be just such as any pure and manly writer of the present day would use it seem quite modern in comparison with the style of shakespeare the song writer in strong contrast with the above be two distinct group the song writer and the spenserian poet the close of the reign of elizabeth be mark by a outburst of english song as remarkable in its sudden development as the rise of the drama two cause contribute to this result -- the increase influence of french instead of italian verse and the rapid development of music as a art at the close of the sixteenth century the two song writer best worth study be thoma campion -lrb- 1567-1619 -rrb- and nicholas breton -lrb- 1545-1626 -rrb- like all the lyric poet of the age they be a curious mixture of the elizabethan and the puritan standard they sing of sacred and profane love with the same zest and a careless love song be often find on the same page with a plea for divine grace the spenserian poet of the spenserian poet gile fletcher and wither be best worth study gile fletcher -lrb- 1588-1623 -rrb- have at time a strong suggestion of milton -lrb- who be also a follower of spenser in he early year -rrb- in the noble simplicity and majesty of he line he best know work christ 's victory and triumph -lrb- 1610 -rrb- be the greatest religious poem that have appear in england since pier plowman and be not a unworthy predecessor of _ paradise lose _ the life of george wither -lrb- 1588-1667 -rrb- cover the whole period of english history from elizabeth to the restoration and the enormous volume of he work cover every phase of the literature of two great age he life be a varied one now as a royalist leader against the covenanter and again announce he puritan conviction and suffer in prison for he faith at he best wither be a lyric poet of great originality rise at time to positive genius but the bulk of he poetry be intolerably dull student of this period find he interesting as a epitome of the whole age in which he live but the average reader be more inclined to note with interest that he publish in 1623 _ hymn and song of the church _ the first hymn book that ever appear in the english language the metaphysical poet this name -- which be give by dr johnson in derision because of the fantastic form of donne 's poetry -- be often apply to all minor poet of the puritan age we use the term here in a narrower sense exclude the follower of daniel and that later group know as the cavalier poet it include donne herbert waller denham cowley vaughan davenant marvell and crashaw the advanced student find they all worthy of study not only for they occasional excellent poetry but because of they influence on later literature thus richard crashaw -lrb- 1613-1649 -rrb- the catholic mystic be interesting because he troubled life be singularly like donne 's and he poetry be at time like herbert 's set on fire -lrb- 160 -rrb- abraham cowley -lrb- 1618-1667 -rrb- who blossom young and who at twenty-five be proclaim the greatest poet in england be now scarcely know even by name but he pindaric ode -lrb- 161 -rrb- set a example which influence english poetry throughout the eighteenth century henry vaughan -lrb- 1622-1695 -rrb- be worthy of study because he be in some respects the forerunner of wordsworth -lrb- 162 -rrb- and andrew marvell -lrb- 1621-1678 -rrb- because of he loyal friendship with milton and because he poetry show the conflict between the two school of spenser and donne edmund waller -lrb- 1606-1687 -rrb- stand between the puritan age and the restoration he be the first to use consistently the closed couplet which dominate we poetry for the next century by this and especially by he influence over dryden the greatest figure of the restoration he occupy a larger place in we literature than a reading of he rather tiresome poetry would seem to warrant of all these poet each of whom have he special claim we can consider here only donne and herbert who in different way be the type of revolt against earlier form and standard of poetry in feeling and imagery both be poet of a high order but in style and expression they be the leader of the fantastic school whose influence largely dominate poetry during the half century of the puritan period john donne -lrb- 1573-1631 -rrb- life the briefest outline of donne 's life show its intense human interest he be bear in london the son of a rich iron merchant at the time when the merchant of england be create a new and higher kind of prince on he father 's side he come from a old welsh family and on he mother 's side from the heywood and sir thoma more 's family both family be catholic and in he early life persecution be bring near for he brother die in prison for harbor a proscribed priest and he own education could not be continue in oxford and cambridge because of he religion such a experience generally set a man 's religious standard for life but presently donne as he study law at lincoln 's inn be investigate the philosophic grounds of all faith gradually he leave the church in which he be bear renounce all denomination and call himself simply christian meanwhile he write poetry and share he wealth with needy catholic relative he join the expedition of essex for cadiz in 1596 and for the azore in 1597 and on sea and in camp find time to write poetry two of he best poem the storm and the calm belong to this period next he travel in europe for three year but occupy himself with study and poetry return home he become secretary to lord egerton fall in love with the latter 's young niece anne more and marry she for which cause donne be cast into prison strangely enough he poetical work at this time be not a song of youthful romance but the progress of the soul a study of transmigration year of wander and poverty follow until sir george more forgive the young lover and make a allowance to he daughter instead of enjoy he new comfort donne grow more ascetic and intellectual in he taste he refuse also the nattering offer of enter the church of england and of receive a comfortable living by he pseudo martyr he attract the favor of jame i who persuade he to be ordain yet leave he without any place or employment when he wife die she allowance cease and donne be leave with seven child in extreme poverty then he become a preacher rise rapidly by sheer intellectual force and genius and in four year be the greatest of english preacher and dean of st paul 's cathedral in london there he carry some to heaven in holy rapture and lead other to amend they life and as he lean over the pulpit with intense earnestness be liken by izaak walton to a angel lean from a cloud here be variety enough to epitomize he age and yet in all he life stronger than any impression of outward weal or woe be the sense of mystery that surround donne in all he work one find a mystery a hiding of some deep thing which the world would gladly know and share and which be suggest in he haunting little poem the undertaking : i have do one braver thing than all the worthy do and yet a braver thence doth spring which be to keep that hide donne 's poetry donne 's poetry be so uneven at time so startling and fantastic that few critic would care to recommend it to other only a few will read he work and they must be leave to they own browsing to find what please they like deer which in the midst of plenty take a bite here and there and wander on tasting twenty variety of food in a hour 's feed one who read much will probably bewail donne 's lack of any consistent style or literary standard for instance chaucer and milton be as different as two poet could well be yet the work of each be mark by a distinct and consistent style and it be the style as much as the matter which make the _ tale _ or the _ paradise lose _ a work for all time donne throw style and all literary standard to the wind and precisely for this reason he be forget though he great intellect and he genius have mark he as one of those who should do thing worthy to be remember while the tendency of literature be to exalt style at the expense of think the world have many man and woman who exalt feeling and think above expression and to these donne be good reading browning be of the same school and compel attention while donne play havoc with elizabethan style he nevertheless influence we literature in the way of boldness and originality and the present tendency be to give he a larger place nearer to the few great poet than he have occupy since ben jonson declare that he be the first poet of the world in some thing but likely to perish for not be understand for to much of he poetry we must apply he own satiric verse on another 's crudity : infinite work which doth so far extend that none can study it to any end george herbert -lrb- 1593-1633 -rrb- o day most calm most bright sing george herbert and we may safely take that single line as expressive of the whole spirit of he writings professor palmer whose scholarly edition of this poet 's work be a model for critic and editor call herbert the first in english poetry who speak face to face with god that may be true but it be interesting to note that not a poet of the first half of the seventeenth century not even the gayest of the cavalier but have write some noble verse of prayer or aspiration which express the underlie puritan spirit of he age herbert be the greatest the most consistent of they all in all the other the puritan struggle against the cavalier or the cavalier break loose from the restrain puritan but in herbert the struggle be past and peace have come that he life be not all calm that the puritan in he have struggle desperately before it subdue the pride and idleness of the cavalier be evident to one who read between he line : i strike the board and cry would no more i will abroad what shall i ever sigh and pine my line and life be free free as the road loose as the wind there speak the cavalier of the university and the court and as one read to the end of the little poem which he call by the suggestive name of the collar he may know that he be read condensed biography those who seek for fault for strained imagery and fantastic verse form in herbert 's poetry will find they in abundance but it will better repay the reader to look for the deep thought and fine feeling that be hide in these wonderful religious lyric even in those that appear most artificial the fact that herbert 's reputation be greater at time than milton 's and that he poem when publish after he death have a large sale and influence show certainly that he appeal to the man of he age and he poem will probably be read and appreciate if only by the few just so long as man be strong enough to understand the puritan 's spiritual conviction life herbert 's life be so quiet and uneventful that to relate a few biographical fact can be of little advantage only as one read the whole story by izaak walton can he share the gentle spirit of herbert 's poetry he be bear at montgomery castle -lrb- 163 -rrb- wale 1593 of a noble welsh family he university course be brilliant and after graduation he wait long year in the vain hope of preferment at court all he life he have to battle against disease and this be undoubtedly the cause of the long delay before each new step in he course not till he be thirty-seven be he ordain and place over the little church of bemerton how he live here among plain people in this happy corner of the lord 's field hope all thing and blessing all people ask he own way to sion and show other the way should be read in walton it be a brief life less than three year of work before be cut off by consumption but remarkable for the single great purpose and the glorious spiritual strength that shine through physical weakness just before he death he give some manuscript to a friend and he message be worthy of john bunyan : deliver this little book to my dear brother ferrar and tell he he shall find in it a picture of the many spiritual conflict that have pass betwixt god and my soul before i could subject mine to the will of jesus my master in whose service i have now find perfect freedom desire he to read it and then if he can think it may turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul let it be make public if not let he burn it for i and it be less than the least of god 's mercy herbert 's poem herbert 's chief work _ the temple _ consist of over one hundred and fifty short poem suggest by the church she holiday and ceremonial and the experience of the christian life the first poem the church porch be the longest and though polish with a care that foreshadow the classic school the least poetical it be a wonderful collection of condensed sermon wise precept and moral lesson suggest chaucer 's good counsel pope 's essay on man and polonius 's advice to laerte in _ hamlet _ only it be more packed with thought than any of these of truth-speaking he say : dare to be true nothing can need a lie a fault which need it most grow two thereby and of calmness in argument : calmness be great advantage : he that let another chafe may warm he at he fire among the remain poem of _ the temple _ one of the most suggestive be the pilgrimage here in six short stanza every line close-packed with thought we have the whole of bunyan 's _ pilgrim 's progress _ the poem be write probably before bunyan be bear but remember the wide influence of herbert 's poetry it be a interesting question whether bunyan receive the idea of he immortal work from this pilgrimage probably the best know of all he poem be the one call the pulley which generally appear however under the name rest or the gift of god when god at first make man have a glass of blessing stand by let we say he pour on he all we can : let the world 's riches which disperse lie contract into a span so strength first make a way then beauty flow then wisdom honor pleasure when almost all be out god make a stay perceive that alone of all he treasure rest in the bottom lay for if i should say he bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gift instead of I and rest in nature not the god of nature : so both should loser be yet let he keep the rest but keep they with repine restlessness : let he be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead he not yet weariness may toss he to my breast among the poem which may be read as curiosity of versification and which arouse the wrath of the critic against the whole metaphysical school be those like easter wing and the altar which suggest in the print form of the poem the thing of which the poet sing more ingenious be the poem in which rime be make by cut off the first letter of a precede word as in the five stanza of paradise : i bless thee lord because i grow among thy tree which in a row to thee both fruit and order ow and more ingenious still be odd conceit like the poem heaven in which echo by repeat the last syllable of each line give a answer to the poet 's question the cavalier poet in the literature of any age there be generally find two distinct tendency the first express the dominant spirit of the time the second a secret or a open rebellion so in this age side by side with the serious and rational puritan live the gallant and trivial cavalier the puritan find expression in the best poetry of the period from donne to milton and in the prose of baxter and bunyan the cavalier in a small group of poet -- herrick lovelace suckling and carew -- who write song generally in lighter vein gay trivial often licentious but who can not altogether escape the tremendous seriousness of puritanism thoma carew -lrb- 1598-1639 -rrb- carew may be call the inventor of cavalier love poetry and to he more than to any other be due the peculiar combination of the sensual and the religious which mark most of the minor poet of the seventeenth century he poetry be the spenserian pastoral strip of its refinement of feeling and make direct coarse vigorous he poem publish in 1640 be generally like he life trivial or sensual but here and there be find one like the follow which indicate that with the metaphysical and cavalier poet a new and stimulate force have enter english literature : ask I no more where jove bestow when June be past the fading rose for in you beauty 's orient deep these flower as in they cause sleep ask I no more where those star light that downward fall in dead of night for in you eye they sit and there fixèd become as in they sphere ask I no more if east or west the phoenix build she spicy nest for unto you at last she fly and in you fragrant bosom die robert herrick -lrb- 1591-1674 -rrb- herrick be the true cavalier gay devil-may - care in disposition but by some freak of fate a clergyman of dean prior in south devon a county make famous by he and blackmore here in a country parish he live discontentedly longing for the joy of london and the mermaid tavern he bachelor establishment consist of a old housekeeper a cat a dog a goose a tame lamb one hen -- for which he thank god in poetry because she lay a egg every day -- and a pet pig that drink beer with herrick out of a tankard with admirable good nature herrick make the best of these uncongenial surroundings he watch with sympathy the country life about he and catch its spirit in many lyric a few of which like corinna 's maying gather ye rosebud while ye may and to daffodil be among the best know in we language he poem cover a wide range from trivial love song pagan in spirit to hymn of deep religious feeling only the best of he poem should be read and these be remarkable for they exquisite sentiment and they graceful melodious expression the rest since they reflect something of the coarseness of he audience may be pass over in silence late in life herrick publish he one book _ hesperide and noble number _ -lrb- 1648 -rrb- the latter half contain he religious poem and one have only to read there the remarkable litany to see how the religious terror that find expression in bunyan 's _ grace abound _ could master even the most careless of cavalier singer suckle and lovelace sir john suckling -lrb- 1609-1642 -rrb- be one of the most brilliant wit of the court of charle i who write poetry as he exercise a horse or fight a duel because it be consider a gentleman 's accomplishment in those day he poem strike from he wild life like spark from he rapier be utterly trivial and even in he best know ballad upon a wedding rarely rise above mere doggerel it be only the romance of he life -- he rich brilliant careless youth and he poverty and suicide in pari whither he flee because of he devotion to the stuart -- that keep he name alive in we literature in he life and poetry sir richard lovelace -lrb- 1618-1658 -rrb- offer a remarkable parallel to suckling and the two be often class together as perfect representative of the follower of king charle lovelace 's _ lucasta _ a volume of love lyric be generally on a higher plane than suckling 's work and a few of the poem like to lucasta and to althea from prison deserve the secure place they have win in the latter occur the oft-quoted line : stone wall do not a prison make nor iron bar a cage mind innocent and quiet take that for a hermitage if i have freedom in my love and in my soul be free angel alone that soar above enjoy such liberty john milton -lrb- 1608-1674 -rrb- thy soul be like a star and dwelt apart thou hadst a voice whose sound be like the sea -- pure as the naked heaven majestic free so didst thou travel on life 's common way in cheerful godliness : and yet thy heart the lowliest duty on herself do lay -lrb- from wordsworth 's sonnet on milton -rrb- shakespeare and milton be the two figure that tower conspicuously above the goodly fellowship of man who have make we literature famous each be representative of the age that produce he and together they form a suggestive commentary upon the two force that rule we humanity -- the force of impulse and the force of a fix purpose shakespeare be the poet of impulse of the love hate fear jealousy and ambition that sway the man of he age milton be the poet of steadfast will and purpose who move like a god amid the fear and hope and change impulse of the world regard they as trivial and momentary thing that can never swerve a great soul from its course it be well to have some such comparison in mind while study the literature of the elizabethan and the puritan age while shakespeare and ben jonson and they unequaled company of wit make merry at the mermaid tavern there be already grow up on the same london street a poet who shall bring a new force into literature who shall add to the renaissance culture and love of beauty the tremendous moral earnestness of the puritan such a poet must begin as the puritan always begin with he own soul to discipline and enlighten it before express its beauty in literature he that would hope to write well hereafter in laudable thing say milton ought himself to be a true poem that be a composition and pattern of the best and most honorable thing here be a new proposition in art which suggest the lofty ideal of fra angelico that before one can write literature which be the expression of the ideal he must first develop in himself the ideal man because milton be human he must know the best in humanity therefore he study give he day to music art and literature he night to profound research and meditation but because he know that man be more than mortal he also pray depend as he tell we on devout prayer to that eternal spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge such a poet be already in spirit far beyond the renaissance though he live in the autumn of its glory and associate with its literary master there be a spirit in man say the old hebrew poet and the inspiration of the almighty giveth he understand here in a word be the secret of milton 's life and write hence he long silence year pass without a word and when he speak it be like the voice of a prophet who begin with the sublime announcement the spirit of the lord be upon I hence he style produce a impression of sublimity which have be mark for wonder by every historian of we literature he style be unconsciously sublime because he live and think consciously in a sublime atmosphere life of milton milton be like a ideal in the soul like a lofty mountain on the horizon we never attain the ideal we never climb the mountain but life would be inexpressibly poorer be either to be take away from childhood milton 's parent set he apart for the attainment of noble end and so left nothing to chance in the matter of train he father john milton be say to have turn puritan while a student at oxford and to have be disinherit by he family whereupon he settle in london and prosper greatly as a scrivener that be a kind of notary in character the elder milton be a rare combination of scholar and business man a radical puritan in politics and religion yet a musician whose hymn tune be still sing and a lover of art and literature the poet 's mother be a woman of refinement and social grace with a deep interest in religion and in local charity so the boy grow up in a home which combine the culture of the renaissance with the piety and moral strength of early puritanism he begin therefore as the heir of one great age and the prophet of another apparently the elder milton share bacon 's dislike for the educational method of the time and so take charge of he son 's training encourage he natural taste teach he music and seek out a tutor who help the boy to what he seek most eagerly not the grammar and mechanism of greek and latin but rather the story the ideal the poetry that hide in they incomparable literature at twelve year we find the boy already a scholar in spirit unable to rest till after midnight because of the joy with which he study be reward from boyhood two great principle seem to govern milton 's career : one the love of beauty of music art literature and indeed of every form of human culture the other a steadfast devotion to duty as the highest object in human life a brief course at the famous st paul 's school in london be the prelude to milton 's entrance to christ 's college cambridge here again he follow he natural bent and like bacon find himself often in opposition to the authority aside from some latin poem the most noteworthy song of this period of milton 's life be he splendid ode ` on the morning of christ 's nativity which be begin on christmas day 1629 milton while deep in the classic have yet a greater love for he native literature spenser be for year he master in he verse we find every evidence of he loving study of shakespeare and he last great poem show clearly how he have be influence by fletcher 's _ christ 's victory and triumph _ but it be significant that this first ode rise higher than anything of the kind produce in the famous age of elizabeth while at cambridge it be the desire of he parent that milton should take order in the church of england but the intense love of mental liberty which stamp the puritan be too strong within he and he refuse to consider the oath of servitude as he call it which would mark he ordination throughout he life milton though profoundly religious hold aloof from the strife of sect in belief he belong to the extreme puritan call separatist independent congregationalist of which we pilgrim father be the great example but he refuse to be bind by any creed or church discipline : as ever in my great task-master 's eye in this last line of one of he sonnet -lrb- 164 -rrb- be find milton 's rejection of every form of outward religious authority in face of the supreme puritan principle the liberty of the individual soul before god a long period of retirement follow milton 's withdrawal from the university in 1632 at he father 's country home in horton he give himself up for six year to solitary reading and study roaming over the wide field of greek latin hebrew spanish french italian and english literature and study hard at mathematics science theology and music -- a curious combination to he love of music we owe the melody of all he poetry and we note it in the rhythm and balance which make even he mighty prose argument harmonious in lycida l'allegro il penseroso arcade comus and a few sonnet we have the poetic result of this retirement at horton -- few indeed but the most perfect of they kind that we literature have record out of solitude where he talent be perfect milton enter the busy world where he character be to be prove to the utmost from horton he travel abroad through france switzerland and italy everywhere receive with admiration for he learning and courtesy win the friendship of the exile dutch scholar grotius in pari and of galileo in he sad imprisonment in florence -lrb- 165 -rrb- he be on he way to greece when news reach he of the break between king and parliament with the practical insight which never desert he milton see clearly the meaning of the news he cordial reception in italy so chary of praise to anything not italian have reawaken in milton the old desire to write a epic which england would not willingly let die but at thought of the conflict for human freedom all he dream be fling to the wind he give up he travels and literary ambition and hurry to england for i think it base he say to be travel at my ease for intellectual culture while my fellow-countryman at home be fight for liberty then for nearly twenty year the poet of great achievement and still greater promise disappear we hear no more song but only the prose denunciation and argument which be as remarkable as he poetry in all we literature there be nothing more worthy of the puritan spirit than this lay aside of personal ambition in order to join in the struggle for human liberty in he best know sonnet on he blindness which reflect he grief not at darkness but at he abandon dream we catch the sublime spirit of this renunciation milton 's opportunity to serve come in the crisis of 1649 the king have be send to the scaffold pay the penalty of he own treachery and england sit shiver at its own deed like a child or a russian peasant who in sudden passion resist unbearable brutality and then be afraid of the consequence two week of anxiety of terror and silence follow then appear milton 's _ tenure of king and magistrate _ to england it be like the come of a strong man not only to protect the child but to justify he blow for liberty king no less than people be subject to the eternal principle of law the divine right of a people to defend and protect themselves -- that be the mighty argument which calm a people 's dread and proclaim that a new man and a new principle have arise in england milton be call to be secretary for foreign tongue in the new government and for the next few year until the end of the commonwealth there be two leader in england cromwell the man of action milton the man of think it be doubtful to which of the two humanity owe most for its emancipation from the tyranny of king and prelate two thing of personal interest deserve mention in this period of milton 's life he marriage and he blindness in 1643 he marry mary powell a shallow pleasure-loving girl the daughter of a royalist and that be the beginning of sorrow after a month tiring of the austere life of a puritan household she abandon she husband who with the same radical reasoning with which he deal with affair of state promptly repudiate the marriage he _ doctrine and discipline of divorce _ and he _ tetrachordon _ be the argument to justify he position but they arouse a storm of protest in england and they suggest to a modern reader that milton be perhaps as much to blame as he wife and that he have scant understanding of a woman 's nature when he wife fear for she position appear before he in tear all he ponderous argument be sweep aside by a generous impulse and though the marriage be never a happy one milton never again mention he wife 's desertion the scene in _ paradise lose _ where eve come weep to adam seek peace and pardon be probably a reflection of a scene in milton 's own household he wife die in 1653 and a few year later he marry another whom we remember for the sonnet methought i see my late espoused saint in which she be celebrated she die after fifteen month and in 1663 he marry a third wife who help the blind old man to manage he poor household from boyhood the strain on the poet 's eye have grow more and more severe but even when he sight be threaten he hold steadily to he purpose of use he pen in the service of he country during the king 's imprisonment a book appear call _ eikon basilike _ -lrb- royal image -rrb- give a rosy picture of the king 's piety and condemn the puritan the book speedily become famous and be the source of all royalist argument against the commonwealth in 1649 appear milton 's _ eikonoklaste _ -lrb- image breaker -rrb- which demolish the flimsy argument of the _ eikon basilike _ as a charge of cromwell 's ironside have overwhelm the king 's follower after the execution of the king appear another famous attack upon the puritan _ defensio regium pro carlo i _ instigate by charle ii who be then live in exile it be write in latin by salmasius a dutch professor at leyden and be hail by the royalist as a invincible argument by order of the council of state milton prepare a reply he eyesight have sadly fail and he be warn that any further strain would be disastrous he reply be characteristic of the man and the puritan as he have once sacrifice he poetry so he be now ready he say to sacrifice he eye also on the altar of english liberty he magnificent _ defensio pro populo anglicano _ be one of the most masterly controversial work in literature the power of the press be already strongly feel in england and the new commonwealth owe its standing partly to milton 's prose and partly to cromwell 's policy the _ defensio _ be the last work that milton saw blindness fall upon he ere it be finish and from 1652 until he death he labor in total darkness the last part of milton 's life be a picture of solitary grandeur unequale in literary history with the restoration all he labor and sacrifice for humanity be apparently waste from he retirement he could hear the bell and the shout that welcome back a vicious monarch whose first act be to set he foot upon he people 's neck milton be immediately mark for persecution he remain for month in hide he be reduce to poverty and he book be burn by the public hangman he daughter upon whom he depend in he blindness rebel at the task of read to he and record he thought in the midst of all these sorrow we understand in _ samson _ the cry of the blind champion of israel : now blind disheartened shame dishonored quell to what can i be useful wherein serve my nation and the work from heaven impose but to sit idle on the household hearth a burdenous drone to visitant a gaze or pity object milton 's answer be worthy of he own great life without envy or bitterness he go back to the early dream of a immortal poem and begin with superb consciousness of power to dictate he great epic _ paradise lose _ be finish in 1665 after seven year ' labor in darkness with great difficulty he find a publisher and for the great work now the most honor poem in we literature he receive less than certain verse maker of we day receive for a little song in one of we popular magazine its success be immediate though like all he work it meet with venomous criticism dryden sum up the impression make on thoughtful mind of he time when he say this man cut we all out and the ancient too thereafter a bit of sunshine come into he darkened home for the work stamp he as one of the world 's great writer and from england and the continent pilgrim come in increase number to speak they gratitude the next year milton begin he _ paradise regain _ in 1671 appear he last important work _ samson agoniste _ the most powerful dramatic poem on the greek model which we language possess the picture of israel 's mighty champion blind alone afflict by thoughtless enemy but preserve a noble ideal to the end be a fitting close to the life work of the poet himself for year he be silent dream who shall say what dream in he darkness and say cheerfully to he friend still guide the heavenly vision he die peacefully in 1674 the most sublime and the most lonely figure in we literature milton 's early poetry -lrb- 166 -rrb- in he early work milton appear as the inheritor of all that be best in elizabethan literature and he first work the ode on the morning of christ 's nativity approach the high-water mark of lyric poetry in england in the next six year from 1631 to 1637 he write but little scarcely more than two thousand line but these be among the most exquisite and the most perfectly finish in we language l'allegro and ii penseroso be twin poem contain many line and short descriptive passage which linger in the mind like strain of music and which be know and love wherever english be speak l'allegro -lrb- the joyous or happy man -rrb- be like a excursion into the english field at sunrise the air be sweet bird be sing a multitude of sight sound fragrance fill all the sens and to this appeal of nature the soul of man respond by be happy see in every flower and hearing in every harmony some exquisite symbol of human life il penseroso take we over the same ground at twilight and at moonrise the air be still fresh and fragrant the symbolism be if possible more tenderly beautiful than before but the gay mood be go though its memory linger in the afterglow of the sunset a quiet thoughtfulness take the place of the pure joyous sensation of the morning a thoughtfulness which be not sad though like all quiet mood it be akin to sadness and which sound the deep of human emotion in the presence of nature to quote scattered line of either poem be to do injustice to both they should be read in they entirety the same day one at morning the other at eventide if one be to appreciate they beauty and suggestiveness the masque of comus be in many respects the most perfect of milton 's poem it be write in 1634 to be perform at ludlow castle before the earl of bridgewater and he friend there be a tradition that the earl 's three child have be lose in the wood and whether true or not milton take the simple theme of a person lose call in a attendant spirit to protect the wanderer and out of this with its natural action and melodious song make the most exquisite pastoral drama that we possess in form it be a masque like those gorgeous product of the elizabethan age of which ben jonson be the master england have borrow the idea of the masque from italy and have use it as the chief entertainment at all festival until it have become to the noble of england what the miracle play have be to the common people of a previous generation milton with he strong puritan spirit could not be content with the mere entertainment of a idle hour comus have the gorgeous scenic effect the music and dancing of other masque but its moral purpose and its ideal teaching be unmistakable the triumph of virtue would be a better name for this perfect little masque for its theme be that virtue and innocence can walk through any peril of this world without permanent harm this eternal triumph of good over evil be proclaim by the attendant spirit who have protect the innocent in this life and who now disappear from mortal sight to resume its life of joy : mortal that would follow I love virtue she alone be free she can teach ye how to climb higher than the sphery chime or if virtue feeble be heaven itself would stoop to she while there be undoubted trace of jonson and john fletcher in milton 's comus the poem far surpass its predecessor in the airy beauty and melody of its verse in the next poem lycida a pastoral elegy write in 1637 and the last of he horton poem milton be no longer the inheritor of the old age but the prophet of a new a college friend edward king have be drown in the irish sea and milton follow the poetic custom of he age by represent both he friend and himself in the guise of shepherd lead the pastoral life milton also use all the symbolism of he predecessor introduce faun satyr and sea nymph but again the puritan be not content with heathen symbolism and so introduce a new symbol of the christian shepherd responsible for the soul of man whom he liken to hungry sheep that look up and be not feed the puritan and royalist at this time be drift rapidly apart and milton use he new symbolism to denounce the abuse that have creep into the church in any other poet this moral teaching would hinder the free use of the imagination but milton seem equal to the task of combine high moral purpose with the noblest poetry in its exquisite finish and exhaustless imagery lycida surpass most of the poetry of what be often call the pagan renaissance besides these well-known poem milton write in this early period a fragmentary masque call arcade several latin poem which like he english be exquisitely finish and he famous sonnet which bring this italian form of verse nearly to the point of perfection in they he seldom write of love the usual subject with he predecessor but of patriotism duty music and subject of political interest suggest by the struggle into which england be drift among these sonnet each reader must find he own favorite those best know and most frequently quote be on he deceased wife to the nightingale on reach the age of twenty-three the massacre in piedmont and the two on he blindness milton 's prose of milton 's prose work there be many divergent opinion range from macaulay 's unbounded praise to the condemnation of some of we modern critic from a literary view point milton 's prose would be stronger if less violent and a modern writer would hardly be excuse for use he language or he method but we must remember the time and the method of he opponent in he fiery zeal against injustice the poet be suddenly dominate by the soldier 's spirit he first muster he fact in battalion and charge upon the enemy to crush and overpower without mercy for milton hate injustice and because it be a enemy of he people he can not and will not spare it when the victory be win he exult in a paean of victory as soul-stirring as the song of deborah he be the poet again spite of himself and he mind fill with magnificent image even with a subject so dull so barren of the bare possibility of poetry as he animadversion upon the remonstrant ' defense he break out into a invocation oh thou that sittest in light and glory unapproachable parent of angel and man which be like a chapter from the apocalypse in such passage milton 's prose be as taine suggest a outpouring of splendor which suggest the noblest poetry on account of they controversial character these prose work be seldom read and it be probable that milton never think of they as worthy of a place in literature of they all _ areopagitica _ have perhaps the most permanent interest and be best worth reading in milton 's time there be a law forbid the publication of book until they be indorse by the official censor needless to say the censor hold he office and salary by favor be naturally more concerned with the divine right of king and bishop than with the delight of literature and many book be suppress for no better reason than that they be displease to the authority milton protest against this as against every other form of tyranny and he _ areopagitica _ -- so call from the areopagus or forum of athen the place of public appeal and the mar hill of st paul 's address -- be the most famous plea in english for the freedom of the press milton 's later poetry undoubtedly the noblest of milton 's work write when he be blind and suffering be _ paradise lose paradise regain _ and _ samson agoniste _ the first be the greatest indeed the only generally acknowledge epic in we literature since _ beowulf _ the last be the most perfect specimen of a drama after the greek method in we language of the history of the great epic we have some interesting glimpse in cambridge there be preserve a notebook of milton 's contain a list of nearly one hundred subject -lrb- 167 -rrb- for a great poem select while he be a boy at the university king arthur attract he at first but he choice finally settle upon the fall of man and we have four separate outline show milton 's proposed treatment of the subject these outline indicate that he contemplate a mighty drama or miracle play but whether because of puritan antipathy to play and player or because of the wretched dramatic treatment of religious subject which milton have witness in italy he abandon the idea of a play and settle on the form of a epic poem most fortunately it must be concede for milton have not the knowledge of man necessary for a drama as a study of character _ paradise lose _ would be a grievous failure adam the central character be something of a prig while satan loom up a magnificent figure entirely different from the devil of the miracle play and completely overshadow the hero both in interest and in manliness the other character the almighty the son raphael michael the angel and fall spirit be merely mouthpiece for milton 's declamation without any personal or human interest regard as a drama therefore _ paradise lose _ could never have be a success but as poetry with its sublime imagery its harmonious verse its titanic background of heaven hell and the illimitable void that lie between it be unsurpassed in any literature in 1658 milton in he darkness sit down to dictate the work which he have plan thirty year before in order to understand the mighty sweep of the poem it be necessary to sum up the argument of the twelve book as follow : book i open with a statement of the subject the fall of man and a noble invocation for light and divine guidance then begin the account of satan and the rebel angel they banishment from heaven and they plot to oppose the design of the almighty by drag down he child we first parent from they state of innocence the book close with a description of the land of fire and endless pain where the fall spirit abide and the erection of pandemonium the palace of satan book ii be a description of the council of evil spirit of satan 's consent to undertake the temptation of adam and eve and he journey to the gate of hell which be guard by sin and death book iii transport we to heaven again god foresee the fall send raphael to warn adam and eve so that they disobedience shall be upon they own head then the son offer himself a sacrifice to take away the sin of the come disobedience of man at the end of this book satan appear in a different scene meet uriel the angel of the sun inquire from he the way to earth and take he journey thither disguise as a angel of light book iv show we paradise and the innocent state of man a angel guard be set over eden and satan be arrest while tempting eve in a dream but be curiously allow to go free again book v show we eve relate she dream to adam and then the morning prayer and the daily employment of we first parent raphael visit they be entertain by a banquet -lrb- which eve propose in order to show he that all god 's gift be not keep in heaven -rrb- and tell they of the revolt of the fall spirit he story be continue in book vi in book vii we read the story of the creation of the world as raphael tell it to adam and eve in book viii adam tell raphael the story of he own life and of he meeting with eve book ix be the story of the temptation by satan follow the account in genesis book x record the divine judgment upon adam and eve show the construction by sin and death of a highway through chaos to the earth and satan 's return to pandemonium adam and eve repent of they disobedience and satan and he angel be turn into serpent in book xi the almighty accept adam 's repentance but condemn he to be banish from paradise and the archangel michael be send to execute the sentence at the end of the book after eve 's feminine grief at the loss of paradise michael begin a prophetic vision of the destiny of man book xii continue michael 's vision adam and eve be comfort by hearing of the future redemption of they race the poem end as they wander forth out of paradise and the door close behind they it will be see that this be a colossal epic not of a man or a hero but of the whole race of man and that milton 's character be such as no human hand could adequately portray but the scene the splendor of heaven the horror of hell the serene beauty of paradise the sun and planet suspend between celestial light and gross darkness be picture with a imagination that be almost superhuman the abide interest of the poem be in these colossal picture and in the lofty thought and the marvelous melody with which they be impressed on we mind the poem be in blank verse and not until milton use it do we learn the infinite variety and harmony of which it be capable he play with it change its melody and movement on every page as a organist out of a single theme develop a unending variety of harmony lamartine have describe _ paradise lose _ as the dream of a puritan fall asleep over he bible and this suggestive description lead we to the curious fact that it be the dream not the theology or the description of bible scene that chiefly interest we thus milton describe the separation of earth and water and there be little or nothing add to the simplicity and strength of _ genesis _ but the sunset which follow be milton 's own dream and instantly we be transport to a land of beauty and poetry : now come still evening on and twilight gray have in she sober livery all thing clothe silence accompany for beast and bird they to they grassy couch these to they nest be slink all but the wakeful nightingale she all night long she amorous descant sing : silence be please now glow the firmament with live sapphire hesperus that lead the starry host ride brightest till the moon rise in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveil she peerless light and o'er the dark she silver mantle throw so also milton 's almighty consider purely as a literary character be unfortunately tinge with the narrow and literal theology of the time he be a be enormously egotistic the despot rather than the servant of the universe seat upon a throne with a chorus of angel about he eternally sing he praise and minister to a kind of divine vanity it be not necessary to search heaven for such a character the type be too common upon earth but in satan milton break away from crude mediæval conception he follow the dream again and give we a character to admire and understand : be this the region this the soil the clime say then the lose archangel this the seat that we must change for heaven -- this mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since he who now be sovran can dispose and bid what shall be right : farthest from he be best whom reason have equal force have make supreme above he equal farewell happy field where joy forever dwell hail horror hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor -- one who bring a mind not to be change by place or time the mind be its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less than he whom thunder have make greater here at least we shall be free the almighty have not build here for he envy will not drive we hence : here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign be worth ambition though in hell : better to reign in hell than serve in heaven in this magnificent heroism milton have unconsciously immortalize the puritan spirit the same unconquerable spirit that set man to write poem and allegory when in prison for the faith and that send they over the stormy sea in a cockleshell to find a free commonwealth in the wild of america for a modern reader the understanding of _ paradise lose _ presuppose two thing -- a knowledge of the first chapter of the scripture and of the general principle of calvinistic theology but it be a pity to use the poem as have so often be do to teach a literal acceptance of one or the other of the theology of _ paradise lose _ the least say the better but to the splendor of the puritan dream and the glorious melody of its expression no word can do justice even a slight acquaintance will make the reader understand why it rank with the _ divina commedium _ of dante and why it be generally accept by critic as the greatest single poem in we literature soon after the completion of _ paradise lose _ thoma ellwood a friend of milton ask one day after read the paradise manuscript but what hast thou to say of paradise find it be in response to this suggestion that milton write the second part of the great epic know to we as _ paradise regain _ the first tell how mankind in the person of adam fall at the first temptation by satan and become a outcast from paradise and from divine grace the second show how mankind in the person of christ withstand the tempter and be establish once more in the divine favor christ 's temptation in the wilderness be the theme and milton follow the account in the fourth chapter of matthew 's gospel though _ paradise regain _ be milton 's favorite and though it have many passage of noble thought and splendid imagery equal to the best of _ paradise lose _ the poem as a whole fall below the level of the first and be less interesting to read in _ samson agoniste _ milton turn to a more vital and personal theme and he genius transfigure the story of samson the mighty champion of israel now blind and scorned working as a slave among the philistine the poet 's aim be to present in english a pure tragedy with all the passion and restraint which mark the old greek drama that he succeed where other fail be due to two cause : first milton himself suggest the hero of one of the greek tragedy -- he sorrow and affliction give to he noble nature that touch of melancholy and calm dignity which be in perfect keep with he subject second milton be tell he own story like samson he have struggle mightily against the enemy of he race he have take a wife from the philistine and have pay the penalty he be blind alone scorn by he vain and thoughtless master to the essential action of the tragedy milton could add therefore that touch of intense yet restrain personal feeling which carry more conviction than any argument _ samson _ be in many respects the most convincing of he work entirely apart from the interest of its subject and treatment one may obtain from it a better idea of what great tragedy be among the greek than from any other work in we language nothing be here for tear nothing to wail or knock the breast no weakness no contempt dispraise or blame -- nothing but well and fair and what may quiet we in a death so noble iii prose writer of the puritan period john bunyan -lrb- 1628-1688 -rrb- as there be but one poet great enough to express the puritan spirit so there be but one command prose writer john bunyan milton be the child of the renaissance inheritor of all its culture and the most profoundly educate man of he age bunyan be a poor uneducated tinker from the renaissance he inherit nothing but from the reformation he receive a excess of that spiritual independence which have cause the puritan struggle for liberty these two man represent the extreme of english life in the seventeenth century write the two work that stand to-day for the mighty puritan spirit one give we the only epic since _ beowulf _ the other give we we only great allegory which have be read more than any other book in we language save the bible life of bunyan bunyan be a extraordinary figure we must study he as well as he book fortunately we have he life story in he own word write with the same lovable modesty and sincerity that mark all he work read that story now in _ grace abound _ we see two great influence at work in he life one from within be he own vivid imagination which see vision allegory parable revelation in every common event the other from without be the spiritual ferment of the age the multiplication of strange sect -- quaker free-willer ranter anabaptist millenarian -- and the untempered zeal of all class like a engine without a balance wheel when man be break away from authority and set up they own religious standard bunyan 's life be a epitome of that astonishing religious individualism which mark the close of the english reformation he be bear in the little village of elstow near bedford in 1628 the son of a poor tinker for a little while the boy be send to school where he learn to read and write after a fashion but he be soon busy in he father 's shop where amid the glowing pot and the fire and smoke of he little forge he see vivid picture of hell and the devil which haunt he all he life when he be sixteen year old he father marry the second time whereupon bunyan run away and become a soldier in the parliamentary army the religious ferment of the age make a tremendous impression on bunyan 's sensitive imagination he go to church occasionally only to find himself wrap in terror and torment by some fiery itinerant preacher and he would rush violently away from church to forget he fear by join in Sunday sport on the village green as night come on the sport be forget but the terror return multiply like the evil spirit of the parable vision of hell and the demon swarm in he brain he would groan aloud in he remorse and even year afterwards he bemoan the sin of he early life when we look for they fearfully expect some shocking crime and misdemeanor we find that they consist of play ball on Sunday and swearing the latter sin sad to say be begin by listen to he father cursing some obstinate kettle which refuse to be tinker and it be perfect in the parliamentary army one day he terrible swearing scare a woman a very loose and ungodly wretch as he tell we who reprimand he for he profanity the reproach of the poor woman go straight home like the voice of a prophet all he profanity leave he he hang down he head with shame i wish with all my heart he say that i might be a little child again that my father might learn I to speak without this wicked way of swearing with characteristic vehemence bunyan hurl himself upon a promise of scripture and instantly the reformation begin to work in he soul he cast out the habit root and branch and find to he astonishment that he can speak more freely and vigorously than before nothing be more characteristic of the man than this sudden seize upon a text which he have doubtless hear many time before and be suddenly raise up or cast down by its influence with bunyan 's marriage to a good woman the real reformation in he life begin while still in he teens he marry a girl as poor as himself we come together he say as poor as might be have not so much household stuff as a dish or spoon between we both the only dowry which the girl bring to she new home be two old threadbare book _ the plain man 's pathway to heaven _ and _ the practice of piety _ -lrb- 168 -rrb- bunyan read these book which instantly give fire to he imagination he see new vision and dream terrible new dream of lose soul he attendance at church grow exemplary he begin slowly and painfully to read the bible for himself but because of he own ignorance and the contradictory interpretation of scripture which he hear on every side he be toss about like a feather by all the wind of doctrine the record of the next few year be like a nightmare so terrible be bunyan 's spiritual struggle one day he feel himself a outcast the next the companion of angel the third he try experiment with the almighty in order to put he salvation to the proof as he go along the road to bedford he think he will work a miracle like gideon with he fleece he will say to the little puddle of water in the horse ' track be ye dry and to all the dry track he will say be ye puddle as he be about to perform the miracle a thought occur to he : but go first under yonder hedge and pray that the lord will make you able to perform a miracle he go promptly and pray then he be afraid of the test and go on he way more troubled than before after year of such struggle chase about between heaven and hell bunyan at last emerge into a saner atmosphere even as pilgrim come out of the horrible valley of the shadow soon lead by he intense feeling he become a open-air preacher and crowd of laborer gather about he on the village green they listen in silence to he word they end in groan and tear score of they amend they sinful life for the anglo-saxon people be remarkable for this that however deeply they be engage in business or pleasure they be still sensitive as barometer to any true spiritual influence whether of priest or peasant they recognize what emerson call the accent of the holy ghost and in this recognition of spiritual leadership lie the secret of they democracy so this village tinker with he strength and sincerity be presently the acknowledged leader of a immense congregation and he influence be feel throughout england it be a tribute to he power that after the return of charle ii bunyan be the first to be prohibit from hold public meeting concern bunyan 's imprisonment in bedford jail which follow he refusal to obey the law prohibit religious meeting without the authority of the established church there be a difference of opinion that the law be unjust go without say but there be no religious persecution as we understand the term bunyan be allow to worship when and how he please he be simply forbid to hold public meeting which frequently become fierce denunciation of the established church and government he judge plead with bunyan to conform with the law he refuse say that when the spirit be upon he he must go up and down the land call on man everywhere to repent in he refusal we see much heroism a little obstinacy and perhaps something of that desire for martyrdom which tempt every spiritual leader that he final sentence to indefinite imprisonment be a hard blow to bunyan be beyond question he groan aloud at the thought of he poor family and especially at the thought of leave he little blind daughter : i find myself a man encompass with infirmity the parting be like pull the flesh from my bone oh the thought of the hardship i think my poor blind one might go under would break my heart to piece poor child think i what sorrow thou art like to have for thy portion in this world thou must be beat must beg suffer hunger cold nakedness and a thousand calamity though i can not now endure that the wind should blow upon thee -lrb- 169 -rrb- and then because he think always in parable and seek out most curious text of scripture he speak of the two milch kine that be to carry the ark of god into another country and leave they calf behind they poor cow poor bunyan such be the mind of this extraordinary man with characteristic diligence bunyan set to work in prison make shoe lace and so earn a living for he family he imprisonment last for nearly twelve year but he see he family frequently and be for some time a regular preacher in the baptist church in bedford occasionally he even go about late at night hold the proscribed meeting and increase he hold upon the common people the best result of this imprisonment be that it give bunyan long hour for the working of he peculiar mind and for study of he two only book the king jame bible and foxe 's _ book of martyr _ the result of he study and meditation be _ the pilgrim 's progress _ which be probably write in prison but which for some reason he do not publish till long after he release the year which follow be the most interesting part of bunyan 's strange career the publication of _ pilgrim 's progress _ in 1678 make he the most popular writer as he be already the most popular preacher in england book tract sermon nearly sixty work in all come from he pen and when one remember he ignorance he painfully slow writing and he activity as a itinerant preacher one can only marvel he evangelistic journey carry he often as far as london and wherever he go crowd throng to hear he scholar bishop statesman go in secret to listen among the laborer and come away wonder and silent at southwark the largest building could not contain the multitude of he hearer and when he preach in london thousand would gather in the cold dusk of the winter morning before work begin and listen until he have make a end of speak bishop bunyan he be soon call on account of he missionary journey and he enormous influence what we most admire in the midst of all this activity be he perfect mental balance he charity and humor in the strife of many sect he be badger for year by petty enemy and he arouse we enthusiasm by he tolerance he self-control and especially by he sincerity to the very end he retain that simple modesty which no success could spoil once when he have preach with unusual power some of he friend wait after the service to congratulate he tell he what a sweet sermon he have deliver aye say bunyan you need not remind I the devil tell I that before i be out of the pulpit for sixteen year this wonderful activity continue without interruption then one day when ride through a cold storm on a labor of love to reconcile a stubborn man with he own stubborn son he catch a severe cold and appear ill and suffering but rejoice in he success at the house of a friend in read he die there a few day later and be lay away in bunhill field burial ground london which have be ever since a _ campo santo _ to the faithful work of bunyan the world 's literature have three great allegory -- spenser 's _ faery queen _ dante 's _ divina commedium _ and bunyan 's _ pilgrim 's progress _ the first appeal to poet the second to scholar the third to people of every age and condition here be a brief outline of the famous work : as i walk through the wilderness of this world i light on a certain place where be a den -lrb- bedford jail -rrb- and lay I down in that place to sleep and as i sleep i dream a dream so the story begin he see a man call christian set out with a book in he hand and a great load on he back from the city of destruction christian have two object -- to get rid of he burden which hold the sin and fear of he life and to make he way to the holy city at the outset evangelist find he weep because he know not where to go and point he to a wicket gate on a hill far away as christian go forward he neighbor friend wife and child call to he to come back but he put he finger in he ear cry out life life eternal life and so rush across the plain then begin a journey in ten stage which be a vivid picture of the difficulty and triumph of the christian life every trial every difficulty every experience of joy or sorrow of peace or temptation be put into the form and discourse of a live character other allegorist write in poetry and they character be shadowy and unreal but bunyan speak in terse idiomatic prose and he character be live man and woman there be mr worldly wiseman a self-satisfied and dogmatic kind of man youthful ignorance sweet piety courteous dema garrulous talkative honest faithful and a score of other who be not at all the bloodless creature of the _ romance of the rose _ but man real enough to stop you on the road and to hold you attention scene after scene follow in which be picture many of we own spiritual experience there be the slough of despond into which we all have fall out of which pliable scramble on the hither side and go back grumble but through which christian struggle mightily till helpful stretch he a hand and drag he out on solid ground and bid he go on he way then come interpreter 's house the palace beautiful the lion in the way the valley of humiliation the hard fight with the demon apollyon the more terrible valley of the shadow vanity fair and the trial of faithful the latter be condemn to death by a jury make up of mr blindman mr nogood mr heady mr liveloose mr hatelight and other of they kind to whom question of justice be commit by the jury system most famous be doubt castle where christian and hopeful be throw into a dungeon by giant despair and then at last the delectable mountain of youth the deep river that christian must cross and the city of all delight and the glorious company of angel that come singing down the street at the very end when in sight of the city and while he can hear the welcome with which christian be greet ignorance be snatch away to go to he own place and bunyan quaintly observe then i see that there be a way to hell even from the gate of heaven as well as from the city of destruction so i awake and behold it be a dream such in brief be the story the great epic of a puritan 's individual experience in a rough world just as _ paradise lose _ be the epic of mankind as dream by the great puritan who have fall asleep over he bible the chief fact which confront the student of literature as he pause before this great allegory be that it have be translate into seventy-five language and dialect and have be read more than any other book save one in the english language as for the secret of its popularity taine say next to the bible the book most widely read in england be the _ pilgrim 's progress _ protestantism be the doctrine of salvation by grace and no writer have equal bunyan in make this doctrine understand and this opinion be echo by the majority of we literary historian it be perhaps sufficient answer to quote the simple fact that _ pilgrim 's progress _ be not exclusively a protestant study it appeal to christian of every name and to mohammedan and buddhist in precisely the same way that it appeal to christian when it be translate into the language of catholic country like france and portugal only one or two incident be omit and the story be almost as popular there as with english reader the secret of its success be probably simple it be first of all not a procession of shadow repeat the author 's declamation but a real story the first extended story in we language we puritan father may have read the story for religious instruction but all class of man have read it because they find in it a true personal experience tell with strength interest humor -- in a word with all the quality that such a story should possess young people have read it first for its intrinsic worth because the dramatic interest of the story lure they on to the very end and second because it be they introduction to true allegory the child with he imaginative mind -- the man also who have preserve he simplicity -- naturally personify object and take pleasure in give they power of think and speak like himself bunyan be the first writer to appeal to this pleasant and natural inclination in a way that all could understand add to this the fact that _ pilgrim 's progress _ be the only book have any story interest in the great majority of english and american home for a full century and we have find the real reason for its wide reading _ the holy war _ publish in 1665 be the first important work of bunyan it be a prose _ paradise lose _ and would undoubtedly be know as a remarkable allegory be it not overshadow by its great rival _ grace abound to the chief of sinner _ publish in 1666 twelve year before _ pilgrim 's progress _ be the work from which we obtain the clearest insight into bunyan 's remarkable life and to a man with historical or antiquarian taste it be still excellent reading in 1682 appear _ the life and death of mr badman _ a realistic character study which be a precursor of the modern novel and in 1684 the second part of _ pilgrim 's progress _ show the journey of christiana and she child to the city of all delight besides these bunyan publish a multitude of treatise and sermon all in the same style -- direct simple convincing express every thought and emotion perfectly in word that even a child can understand many of these be masterpiece admire by workingman and scholar alike for they thought and expression take for instance the heavenly footman put it side by side with the best work of latimer and the resemblance in style be startling it be difficult to realize that one work come from a ignorant tinker and the other from a great scholar both engage in the same general work as bunyan 's one book be the bible we have here a suggestion of its influence in all we prose literature minor prose writer the puritan period be generally regard as one destitute of literary interest but that be certainly not the result of any lack of book or writer say burton in he _ anatomy of melancholy : _ i have new book every day pamphlet curranto story whole catalogue of volume of all sort new paradox opinion schism heresies controversy in philosophy and religion now come tiding of wedding masking entertainment jubilee embassy sport play then again as in a new-shipped scene treason cheating trick robbery enormous villainy in all kind funeral death new discovery expedition now comical then tragical matter so the record continue till one rub he eye and think he must have pick up by mistake the last literary magazine and for all these kaleidoscopic event there be wait a multitude of writer ready to seize the abundant material and turn it to literary account for a tract a article a volume or a encyclopedia if one be to recommend certain of these book as expressive of this age of outward storm and inward calm there be three that deserve more than a pass notice namely the _ religio medicus _ _ holy living _ and _ the compleat angler _ the first be write by a busy physician a supposedly scientific man at that time the second by the most learn of english churchman and the third by a simple merchant and fisherman strangely enough these three great book -- the reflection of nature science and revelation -- all interpret human life alike and tell the same story of gentleness charity and noble living if the age have produce only these three book we could still be profoundly grateful to it for its inspiring message robert burton -lrb- 1577-1640 -rrb- burton be famous chiefly as the author of the _ anatomy of melancholy _ one of the most astonishing book in all literature which appear in 1621 burton be a clergyman of the established church a incomprehensible genius give to brooding and melancholy and to reading of every conceivable kind of literature thanks to he wonderful memory everything he read be store up for use or ornament till he mind resemble a huge curiosity shop all he life he suffer from hypochondria but curiously trace he malady to the star rather than to he own liver it be related of he that he use to suffer so from despondency that no help be to be find in medicine or theology he only relief be to go down to the river and hear the bargeman swear at one another burton 's _ anatomy _ be begin as a medical treatise on morbidness arrange and divide with all the exactness of the schoolman 's demonstration of doctrine but it turn out to be a enormous hodgepodge of quotation and reference to author know and unknown living and dead which seem to prove chiefly that much study be a weariness to the flesh by some freak of taste it become instantly popular and be proclaimed one of the greatest book in literature a few scholar still explore it with delight as a mine of classic wealth but the style be hopelessly involve and to the ordinary reader most of he numerous reference be now as unmeaning as a hyper-jacobian surface sir thoma browne -lrb- 1605-1682 -rrb- browne be a physician who after much study and travel settle down to he profession in norwich but even then he give far more time to the investigation of natural phenomenon than to the barbarous practice which largely constitute the art of medicine in he day he be know far and wide as a learn doctor and a honest man whose scientific study have place he in advance of he age and whose religious view be liberal to the point of heresy with this in mind it be interesting to note as a sign of the time that this most scientific doctor be once call to give expert testimony in the case of two old woman who be be try for the capital crime of witchcraft he testify under oath that the fit be natural but heighten by the devil 's coöperating with the witch at whose instance he -lrb- the allege devil -rrb- do the villainy browne 's great work be the _ religio medicus _ ie the religion of a physician -lrb- 1642 -rrb- which meet with most unusual success hardly ever be a book publish in britain say oldy a chronicler who write nearly a century later that make more noise than the _ religio medicus _ its success may be due largely to the fact that among thousand of religious work it be one of the few which see in nature a profound revelation and which treat purely religious subject in a reverent kindly tolerant way without ecclesiastical bias it be still therefore excellent reading but it be not so much the matter as the manner -- the charm the gentleness the remarkable prose style -- which have establish the book as one of the classic of we literature two other work of browne be _ vulgar error _ -lrb- 1646 -rrb- a curious combination of scientific and credulous research in the matter of popular superstition and _ urn burial _ a treatise suggest by the discovery of roman burial urn at walsingham it begin as a inquiry into the various method of burial but end in a dissertation on the vanity of earthly hope and ambition from a literary point of view it be browne 's best work but be less read than the _ religio medicus _ thoma fuller -lrb- 1608-1661 -rrb- fuller be a clergyman and royalist whose lively style and witty observation would naturally place he with the gay caroline poet he best know work be _ the holy war the holy state and the profane state church history of britain _ and the _ history of the worthy of england the holy and profane state _ be chiefly a biographical record the first part consist of numerous historical example to be imitate the second of example to be avoid the _ church history _ be not a scholarly work notwithstanding its author 's undoubted learning but be a lively and gossipy account which have at least one virtue that it entertain the reader the _ worthy _ the most widely read of he work be a racy account of the important man of england fuller travel constantly for year collect information from out-of-the-way source and gain a minute knowledge of he own country this with he overflow humor and numerous anecdote and illustration make lively and interesting reading indeed we hardly find a dull page in any of he numerous book jeremy taylor -lrb- 1613-1667 -rrb- taylor be the greatest of the clergyman who make this period famous a man who like milton uphold a noble ideal in storm and calm and himself live it nobly he have be call the shakespeare of divine and a kind of spenser in a cassock and both description apply to he very well he writings with they exuberant fancy and they noble diction belong rather to the elizabethan than to the puritan age from the large number of he work two stand out as representative of the man himself : _ the liberty of prophesy _ -lrb- 1646 -rrb- which hallam call the first plea for tolerance in religion on a comprehensive basis and on deep-seated foundation and _ the rule and exercise of holy living _ -lrb- 1650 -rrb- to the latter might be add its companion volume _ holy die _ publish in the following year _ the holy living and die _ as a single volume be for many year read in almost every english cottage with baxter 's _ saint ' rest pilgrim 's progress _ and the _ king jame bible _ it often constitute the entire library of multitude of puritan home and as we read its noble word and breathe its gentle spirit we can not help wish that we modern library be gather together on the same thoughtful foundation richard baxter -lrb- 1615-1691 -rrb- this busiest man of he age strongly suggest bunyan in he life and writings like bunyan he be poor and uneducated a nonconformist minister expose continually to insult and persecution and like bunyan he throw himself heart and soul into the conflict of he age and become by he public speech a mighty power among the common people unlike jeremy taylor who write for the learn and whose involved sentence and classical allusion be sometimes hard to follow baxter go straight to he mark appeal directly to the judgment and feeling of he reader the number of he work be almost incredible when one think of he busy life as a preacher and the slowness of manual writing in all he leave nearly one hundred and seventy different work which if collect would make fifty or sixty volume as he write chiefly to influence man on the immediate question of the day most of this work have fall into oblivion he two most famous book be _ the saint ' everlasting rest _ and _ a call to the unconverted _ both of which be exceedingly popular run through score of successive edition and have be widely read in we own generation izaak walton -lrb- 1593-1683 -rrb- walton be a small tradesman of london who prefer trout brook and good reading to the profit of business and the doubtful joy of a city life so at fifty year when he have save a little money he leave the city and follow he heart out into the country he begin he literary work or rather he recreation by write he famous _ life _ -- kindly and readable appreciation of donne wotton hooker herbert and sanderson which stand at the beginning of modern biographical writing in 1653 appear _ the compleat angler _ which have grow steadily in appreciation and which be probably more widely read than any other book on the subject of fishing it begin with a conversation between a falconer a hunter and a angler but the angler soon do most of the talk as fisherman sometimes do the hunter become a disciple and learn by the easy method of hear the fisherman discourse about he art the conversation it must be confess be often diffuse and pedantic but they only make we feel most comfortably sleepy as one invariably feel after a good day 's fishing so kindly be the spirit of the angler so exquisite he appreciation of the beauty of the earth and sky that one return to the book as to a favorite trout stream with the undying expectation of catch something among a thousand book on angle it stand almost alone in possess a charming style and so it will probably be read as long as man go fishing best of all it lead to a better appreciation of nature and it drop little moral lesson into the reader 's mind as gently as one cast a fly to a wary trout so that one never suspect he better nature be be angle for though we have sometimes see angler catch more than they need or sneak ahead of brother fisherman to the best pool we be glad for walton 's sake to overlook such unaccountable exception and agree with the milkmaid that we love all angler they be such honest civil quiet man summary of the puritan period the half century between 1625 and 1675 be call the puritan period for two reason : first because puritan standard prevail for a time in england and second because the greatest literary figure during all these year be the puritan john milton historically the age be one of tremendous conflict the puritan struggle for righteousness and liberty and because he prevail the age be one of moral and political revolution in he struggle for liberty the puritan overthrow the corrupt monarchy behead charle i and establish the commonwealth under cromwell the commonwealth last but a few year and the restoration of charle ii in 1660 be often put as the end of the puritan period the age have no distinct limit but overlap the elizabethan period on one side and the restoration period on the other the age produce many writer a few immortal book and one of the world 's great literary leader the literature of the age be extremely diverse in character and the diversity be due to the break up of the ideal of political and religious unity this literature differ from that of the precede age in three marked way : -lrb- 1 -rrb- it have no unity of spirit as in the day of elizabeth result from the patriotic enthusiasm of all class -lrb- 2 -rrb- in contrast with the hopefulness and vigor of elizabethan writings much of the literature of this period be somber in character it sadden rather than inspire we -lrb- 3 -rrb- it have lose the romantic impulse of youth and become critical and intellectual it make we think rather than feel deeply in we study we have note -lrb- 1 -rrb- the transition poet of whom daniel be chief -lrb- 2 -rrb- the song writer campion and breton -lrb- 3 -rrb- the spenserian poet wither and gile fletcher -lrb- 4 -rrb- the metaphysical poet donne and herbert -lrb- 5 -rrb- the cavalier poet herrick carew lovelace and suckling -lrb- 6 -rrb- john milton he life

it seem a curious contradiction at first glance to place the return of charle ii at the beginning of modern england as we historian be wont to do for there be never a time when the progress of liberty which history record be more plainly turn backwards the puritan régime have be too severe it have repress too many natural pleasure now release from restraint society abandon the decency of life and the reverence for law itself and plunge into excess more unnatural than have be the restraint of puritanism the inevitable effect of excess be disease and for almost a entire generation follow the restoration in 1660 england lay sick of a fever socially politically morally london suggest a italian city in the day of the medicus and its literature especially its drama often seem more like the delirium of illness than the expression of a healthy mind but even a fever have its advantage whatever impurity be in the blood be burnt and purge away and a man rise from fever with a new strength and a new idea of the value of life like king hezekiah who after he sickness and fear of death resolve to go softly all he day the restoration be the great crisis in english history and that england live through it be due solely to the strength and excellence of that puritanism which she think she have fling to the wind when she welcome back a vicious monarch at dover the chief lesson of the restoration be this -- that it show by awful contrast the necessity of truth and honesty and of a strong government of free man for which the puritan have stand like a rock in every hour of he rugged history through fever england come slowly back to health through gross corruption in society and in the state england learn that she people be at heart sober sincere religious folk and that they character be naturally too strong to follow after pleasure and be satisfy so puritanism suddenly gain all that it have struggle for and gain it even in the hour when all seem lose when milton in he sorrow unconsciously portray the government of charle and he cabal in that tremendous scene of the council of the infernal peer in pandemonium plot the ruin of the world of the king and he follower it be difficult to write temperately most of the dramatic literature of the time be atrocious and we can understand it only as we remember the character of the court and society for which it be write unspeakably vile in he private life the king have no redeeming patriotism no sense of responsibility to he country for even he public act he give high office to blackguard steal from the exchequer like a common thief play off catholic and protestant against each other disregard he pledge to both alike break he solemn treaty with the dutch and with he own minister and betray he country for french money to spend on he own pleasure it be useless to paint the dishonor of a court which follow gayly after such a leader the first parliament while it contain some noble and patriotic member be dominate by young man who remember the excess of puritan zeal but forget the despotism and injustice which have compel puritanism to stand up and assert the manhood of england these young politician vie with the king in pass law for the subjugation of church and state and in they thirst for revenge upon all who have be connect with cromwell 's iron government once more a wretched formalism -- that perpetual danger to the english church -- come to the front and exercise authority over the free church the house of lord be largely increase by the creation of hereditary title and estate for ignoble man and shameless woman who have flatter the king 's vanity even the bench that last strong refuge of english justice be corrupt by the appointment of judge like the brutal jeffrey whose aim like that of they royal master be to get money and to exercise power without personal responsibility amid all this dishonor the foreign influence and authority of cromwell 's strong government vanish like smoke the valiant little dutch navy sweep the english fleet from the sea and only the thunder of dutch gun in the thame under the very window of london awake the nation to the realization of how low it have fall two consideration must modify we judgment of this disheartening spectacle first the king and he court be not england though we history be largely fill with the record of king and soldier of intrigue and fight these no more express the real life of a people than fever and delirium express a normal manhood though king and court and high society arouse we disgust or pity record be not want to show that private life in england remain honest and pure even in the worst day of the restoration while london society might be entertain by the degenerate poetry of rochester and the drama of dryden and wycherley english scholar hail milton with delight and the common people follow bunyan and baxter with they tremendous appeal to righteousness and liberty second the king with all he pretension to divine right remain only a figurehead and the anglo-saxon people when they tire of one figurehead have always the will and the power to throw it overboard and choose a better one the country be divide into two political party : the whig who seek to limit the royal power in the interest of parliament and the people and the tory who strive to check the grow power of the people in the interest of they hereditary ruler both party however be largely devoted to the anglican church and when jame ii after four year of misrule attempt to establish a national catholicism by intrigue which arouse the protest of the pope -lrb- 171 -rrb- as well as of parliament then whig and tory catholic and protestant unite in england 's last great revolution the complete and bloodless revolution of 1688 which call william of orange to the throne be simply the indication of england 's restore health and sanity it proclaim that she have not long forget and could never again forget the lesson teach she by puritanism in its hundred year of struggle and sacrifice modern england be firmly establish by the revolution which be bring about by the excess of the restoration literary characteristic in the literature of the restoration we note a sudden break away from old standard just as society break away from the restraint of puritanism many of the literary man have be drive out of england with charle and he court or else have follow they patron into exile in the day of the commonwealth on they return they renounce old ideal and demand that english poetry and drama should follow the style to which they have become accustomed in the gayety of pari we read with astonishment in pepy 's _ diary _ -lrb- 1660-1669 -rrb- that he have be to see a play call _ midsummer night 's dream _ but that he will never go again to hear shakespeare for it be the most insipid ridiculous play that ever i saw in my life and again we read in the diary of evelyn -- another writer who reflect with wonderful accuracy the life and spirit of the restoration -- i see _ hamlet _ play but now the old play begin to disgust this refined age since he majesty 's be so long abroad since shakespeare and the elizabethan be no longer interesting literary man begin to imitate the french writer with whose work they have just grow familiar and here begin the so-called period of french influence which show itself in english literature for the next century instead of the italian influence which have be dominant since spenser and the elizabethan one have only to consider for a moment the french writer of this period pascal bossuet fénelon malherbe corneille racine molière -- all that brilliant company which make the reign of loui xiv the elizabethan age of french literature -- to see how far astray the early writer of the restoration go in they wretched imitation when a man take another for he model he should copy virtue not vice but unfortunately many english writer reverse the rule copy the vice of french comedy without any of its wit or delicacy or abundant idea the poem of rochester the play of dryden wycherley congreve vanbrugh and farquhar all popular in they day be mostly unreadable milton 's son of belial fly with insolence and wine be a good expression of the vile character of the court writer and of the london theater for thirty year follow the restoration such work can never satisfy a people and when jeremy collier -lrb- 172 -rrb- in 1698 publish a vigorous attack upon the evil play and the playwright of the day all london tire of the coarseness and excess of the restoration join the literary revolution and the corrupt drama be drive from the stage with the final rejection of the restoration drama we reach a crisis in the history of we literature the old elizabethan spirit with its patriotism its creative vigor its love of romance and the puritan spirit with its moral earnestness and individualism be both thing of the past and at first there be nothing to take they place dryden the greatest writer of the age voice a general complaint when he say that in he prose and poetry he be draw the outline of a new art but have no teacher to instruct he but literature be a progressive art and soon the writer of the age develop two marked tendency of they own -- the tendency to realism and the tendency to that preciseness and elegance of expression which mark we literature for the next hundred year in realism -- that be the representation of man exactly as they be the expression of the plain unvarnished truth without regard to ideal or romance -- the tendency be at first thoroughly bad the early restoration writer seek to paint realistic picture of a corrupt court and society and as we have suggest they emphasize vice rather than virtue and give we coarse low play without interest or moral significance like hobbe they see only the externals of man he body and appetite not he soul and its ideal and so like most realist they resemble a man lose in the wood who wander aimlessly around in circle see the confusing tree but never the whole forest and who seldom think of climb the nearest high hill to get he bearing later however this tendency to realism become more wholesome while it neglect romantic poetry in which youth be eternally interested it lead to a keener study of the practical motive which govern human action the second tendency of the age be toward directness and simplicity of expression and to this excellent tendency we literature be greatly indebted in both the elizabethan and the puritan age the general tendency of writer be towards extravagance of thought and language sentence be often involve and load with latin quotation and classical allusion the restoration writer oppose this vigorously from france they bring back the tendency to regard established rule for write to emphasize close reasoning rather than romantic fancy and to use short clean-cut sentence without a unnecessary word we see this french influence in the royal society -lrb- 173 -rrb- which have for one of its object the reform of english prose by get rid of its swelling of style and which bind all its member to use a close naked natural way of speak as near to mathematical plainness as they can dryden accept this excellent rule for he prose and adopt the heroic couplet as the next best thing for the greater part of he poetry as he tell we himself : and this unpolished rugged verse i choose as fittest for discourse and nearest prose it be largely due to he that writer develop that formalism of style that precise almost mathematical elegance miscall classicism which rule english literature for the next century -lrb- 174 -rrb- another thing which the reader will note with interest in restoration literature be the adoption of the heroic couplet that be two iambic pentameter line which rime together as the most suitable form of poetry waller -lrb- 175 -rrb- who begin to use it in 1623 be generally regard as the father of the couplet for he be the first poet to use it consistently in the bulk of he poetry chaucer have use the rimed couplet wonderfully well in he _ canterbury tale _ but in chaucer it be the poetical thought more than the expression which delight we with the restoration writer form count for everything waller and dryden make the couplet the prevail literary fashion and in they hand the couplet become closed that be each pair of line must contain a complete thought state as precisely as possible thus waller write : the soul 's dark cottage batter and decay let in new light through chink that time have make -lrb- 176 -rrb- that be a kind of aphorism such as pope make in large quantity in the follow age it contain a thought be catchy quotable easy to remember and the restoration writer delighted in it soon this mechanical closed couplet in which the second line be often make first -lrb- 177 -rrb- almost exclude all other form of poetry it be dominant in england for a full century and we have grow familiar with it and somewhat weary of its monotony in such famous poem as pope 's essay on man and goldsmith 's desert village these however be essay rather than poem that even the couplet be capable of melody and variety be show in chaucer 's _ tale _ and in keat 's exquisite _ endymion _ these four thing the tendency to vulgar realism in the drama a general formalism which come from follow set rule the development of a simpler and more direct prose style and the prevalence of the heroic couplet in poetry be the main characteristic of restoration literature they be all exemplify in the work of one man john dryden john dryden -lrb- 1631-1700 -rrb- dryden be the greatest literary figure of the restoration and in he work we have a excellent reflection of both the good and the evil tendency of the age in which he live if we can think for a moment of literature as a canal of water we may appreciate the figure that dryden be the lock by which the water of english poetry be let down from the mountain of shakespeare and milton to the plain of pope that be he stand between two very different age and serve as a transition from one to the other life dryden 's life contain so many conflicting element of greatness and littleness that the biographer be continually take away from the fact which be he chief concern to judge motive which be manifestly outside he knowledge and business judge by he own opinion of himself as express in the numerous preface to he work dryden be the soul of candor write with no other master than literature and with no other object than to advance the welfare of he age and nation judge by he act he be apparently a timeserver catering to a depraved audience in he drama and dedicate he work with much flattery to those who be easily cajole by they vanity into share they purse and patronage in this however he only follow the general custom of the time and be above many of he contemporary dryden be bear in the village of aldwinkle northamptonshire in 1631 he family be prosperous people who bring he up in the strict puritan faith and send he first to the famous westminster school and then to cambridge he make excellent use of he opportunity and study eagerly become one of the best educate man of he age especially in the classic though of remarkable literary taste he show little evidence of literary ability up to the age of thirty by he training and family connection he be ally to the puritan party and he only well-known work of this period the heroic stanza be write on the death of cromwell : he grandeur he derive from heaven alone for he be great ere fortune make he so and war like mist that rise against the sun make he but greater seem not greater grow in these four line take almost at random from the heroic stanza we have a epitome of the think the preciseness and the polish that mark all he literary work this poem make dryden well know and he be in a fair way to become the new poet of puritanism when the restoration make a complete change in he method he have come to london for a literary life and when the royalist be again in power he place himself promptly on the win side he astraea redux a poem of welcome to charle ii and he panegyric to he sacred majesty breathe more devotion to the old goat as the king be know to he courtier than have he earlier poem to puritanism in 1667 he become more widely know and popular by he annus mirabili a narrative poem describe the terror of the great fire in london and some event of the disgraceful war with holland but with the theater reopen and nightly fill the drama offer the most attractive field to one who make he living by literature so dryden turn to the stage and agree to furnish three play yearly for the actor of the king 's theater for nearly twenty year the best of he life dryden give himself up to this unfortunate work both by nature and habit he seem to have be clean in he personal life but the stage demand unclean play and dryden follow he audience that he deplore this be evident from some of he later work and we have he statement that he write only one play he best to please himself this be _ all for love _ which be write in blank verse most of the other be in rimed couplet during this time dryden have become the best know literary man of london and be almost as much a dictator to the literary set which gather in the tavern and coffeehouse as ben jonson have be before he he work meanwhile be reward by large financial return and by he be appoint poet laureate and collector of the port of london the latter office it may be remember have once be hold by chaucer at fifty year of age and before jeremy collier have drive he drama from the stage dryden turn from dramatic work to throw himself into the strife of religion and politics write at this period he numerous prose and poetical treatise in 1682 appear he _ religio laicus _ -lrb- religion of a layman -rrb- defend the anglican church against all other sect especially the catholic and presbyterian but three year later when jame ii come to the throne with scheme to establish the roman faith dryden turn catholic and write he most famous religious poem the hind and the panther beginning : a milk-white hind immortal and unchanged fed on the lawn and in the forest range without unspotted innocent within she fear no danger for she know no sin this hind be a symbol for the roman church and the anglican as a panther be represent as persecute the faithful numerous other sect -- calvinist anabaptist quaker -- be represent by the wolf boar hare and other animal which give the poet a excellent chance for exercise he satire dryden 's enemy make the accusation often since repeat of hypocrisy in thus change he church but that he be sincere in the matter can now hardly be question for he know how to suffer for the faith and to be true to he religion even when it mean misjudgment and loss of fortune at the revolution of 1688 he refuse allegiance to william of orange he be deprive of all he office and pension and as a old man be again throw back on literature as he only means of livelihood he go to work with extraordinary courage and energy writing play poem preface for other man eulogy for funeral occasion -- every kind of literary work that man would pay for he most successful work at this time be he translation which result in the complete _ aeneid _ and many selection from homer ovid and juvenal appear in english rimed couplet he most enduring poem the splendid ode call alexander 's feast be write in 1697 three year later he publish he last work _ fable _ contain poetical paraphrase of the tale of boccaccio and chaucer and the miscellaneous poem of he last year long preface be the fashion in dryden 's day and he best critical work be find in he introduction the preface to the _ fable _ be generally admire as a example of the new prose style develop by dryden and he follower from the literary view point these last troubled year be the best of dryden 's life though they be make bitter by obscurity and by the criticism of he numerous enemy he die in 1700 and be bury near chaucer in westminster abbey work of dryden the numerous dramatic work of dryden be best leave in that obscurity into which they have fall now and then they contain a bit of excellent lyric poetry and in _ all for love _ another version of _ antony and cleopatra _ where he leave he cherish heroic couplet for the blank verse of marlowe and shakespeare he show what he might have do have he not sell he talent to a depraved audience on the whole read he play be like nibble at a rot apple even the good spot be affect by the decay and one end by throw the whole thing into the garbage can where most of the dramatic work of this period belong the controversial and satirical poem be on a higher plane though it must be confess dryden 's satire often strike we as cut and revengeful rather than witty the best know of these and a masterpiece of its kind be absalom and achitophel which be undoubtedly the most powerful political satire in we language take the bible story of david and absalom he use it to ridicule the whig party and also to revenge himself upon he enemy charle ii appear as king david he natural son the duke of monmouth who be mix up in the rye house plot parade as absalom shaftesbury be achitophel the evil counselor and the duke of buckingham be satirize as zimrus the poem have enormous political influence and raise dryden in the opinion of he contemporary to the front rank of english poet two extract from the powerful characterization of achitophel and zimrus be give here to show the style and spirit of the whole work -lrb- shaftesbury -rrb- of these the false achitophel be first a name to all succeed age curse : for close design and crooked counsel fit sagacious bold and turbulent of wit restless unfixed in principle and place in power unpleased impatient of disgrace : a fiery soul which work out its way fret the pygmy body to decay a daring pilot in extremity pleased with the danger when the wave go high he seek the storm : but for a calm unfit would steer too nigh the sand to boast he wit great wit be sure to madness near ally and thin partition do they bound divide else why should he with wealth and honor blest refuse he age the needful hour of rest punish a body which he could not please bankrupt of life yet prodigal of ease and all to leave what with he toil he win to that unfeathered two-legged thing a son in friendship false implacable in hate resolve to ruin or to rule the state then seize with fear yet still affect fame usurp a patriot 's all-atoning name so easy still it prove in factious time with public zeal to cancel private crime -lrb- the duke of buckingham -rrb- some of they chief be prince of the land in the first rank of these do zimrus stand a man so various that he seem to be not one but all mankind 's epitome : stiff in opinion always in the wrong be everything by start and nothing long but in the course of one revolve moon be chymist fiddler statesman and buffoon then all for woman paint rhyming drinking besides ten thousand freak that die in think blest madman who could every hour employ with something new to wish or to enjoy railing and praise be he usual theme and both to show he judgment in extreme : so over-violent or over-civil that every man with he be god or devil of the many miscellaneous poem of dryden the curious reader will get a idea of he sustained narrative power from the _ annus mirabili _ the best expression of dryden 's literary genius however be find in alexander 's feast which be he most enduring ode and one of the best in we language as a prose writer dryden have a very marked influence on we literature in shorten he sentence and especially in write naturally without depend on literary ornamentation to give effect to what he be say if we compare he prose with that of milton or browne or jeremy taylor we note that dryden care less for style than any of the other but take more pain to state he thought clearly and concisely as man speak when they wish to be understand the classical school which follow the restoration look to dryden as a leader and to he we owe largely that tendency to exactness of expression which mark we subsequent prose write with he prose dryden rapidly develop he critical ability and become the foremost critic -lrb- 178 -rrb- of he age he criticism instead of be publish as independent work be generally use as preface or introduction to he poetry the best know of these criticism be the preface to the _ fable _ of heroic play discourse on satire and especially the essay of dramatic poesy -lrb- 1668 -rrb- which attempt to lay a foundation for all literary criticism dryden 's influence on literature dryden 's place among author be due partly to he great influence on the succeed age of classicism briefly this influence may be sum up by note the three new element which he bring into we literature these be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the establishment of the heroic couplet as the fashion for satiric didactic and descriptive poetry -lrb- 2 -rrb- he development of a direct serviceable prose style such as we still cultivate and -lrb- 3 -rrb- he development of the art of literary criticism in he essay and in the numerous preface to he poem this be certainly a large work for one man to accomplish and dryden be worthy of honor though comparatively little of what he write be now find on we bookshelf samuel butler -lrb- 1612-1680 -rrb- in marked contrast with dryden who devote he life to literature and win he success by hard work be samuel butler who jump into fame by a single careless work which represent not any serious intent or effort but the pastime of a idle hour we be to remember that though the royalist have triumph in the restoration the puritan spirit be not dead nor even sleep and that the puritan hold steadfastly to he own principle against these principle of justice truth and liberty there be no argument since they express the manhood of england but many of the puritan practice be open to ridicule and the royalist in revenge for they defeat begin to use ridicule without mercy during the early year of the restoration doggerel verse ridicule puritanism and burlesque -- that be a ridiculous representation of serious subject or a serious representation of ridiculous subject -- be the most popular form of literature with london society of all this burlesque and doggerel the most famous be butler 's _ hudibra _ a work to which we can trace many of the prejudice that still prevail against puritanism of butler himself we know little he be one of the most obscure figure in we literature during the day of cromwell 's protectorate he be in the employ of sir samuel luke a crabbed and extreme type of puritan nobleman and here he collect he material and probably write the first part of he burlesque which of course he do not dare to publish until after the restoration _ hudibra _ be plainly model upon the _ don quixote _ of cervante it describe the adventure of a fanatical justice of the peace sir hudibra and of he squire ralpho in they endeavor to put down all innocent pleasure in hudibra and ralpho the two extreme type of the puritan party presbyterian and independent be mercilessly ridicule when the poem first appear in public in 1663 after circulate secretly for year in manuscript it become at once enormously popular the king carry a copy in he pocket and courtier vie with each other in quote its most scurrilous passage a second and a third part continue the adventure of hudibra be publish in 1664 and 1668 at best the work be a wretched doggerel but it be clever enough and strikingly original and since it

restraint of puritanism which suggest the wide swing of a pendulum from one extreme to the other for a generation many natural pleasure have be suppress now the theater be reopen bull and bear baiting revive and sport music dancing -- a wild delight in the pleasure and vanity of this world replace that absorption in other-worldliness which characterize the extreme of puritanism in literature the change be no less marked from the elizabethan drama playwright turn to coarse evil scene which presently disgust the people and be drive from the stage from romance writer turn to realism from italian influence with its exuberance of imagination they turn to france and learn to repress the emotion to follow the head rather than the heart and to write in a clear concise formal style accord to set rule poet turn from the noble blank verse of shakespeare and milton from the variety and melody which have characterize english poetry since chaucer 's day to the monotonous heroic couplet with its mechanical perfection the greatest writer of the age be john dryden who establish the heroic couplet as the prevail verse form in english poetry and who develop a new and serviceable prose style suit to the practical need of the age the popular ridicule of puritanism in burlesque and doggerel be best exemplify in butler 's _ hudibra _ the realistic tendency the study of fact and of man as they be

have largely spend in fight for freedom in endless political discussion and in effort to improve he government in order to bring about reform vote be now necessary and to get vote the people of england must be approach with idea fact argument information so the newspaper be bear -lrb- 182 -rrb- and literature in its widest sense include the book the newspaper and the magazine become the chief instrument of a nation 's progress the first half of the eighteenth century be remarkable for the rapid social development in england hitherto man have be more or less govern by the narrow isolate standard of the middle age and when they differ they fall speedily to blow now for the first time they set themselves to the task of learn the art of live together while still hold different opinion in a single generation nearly two thousand public coffeehouse each a center of sociability spring up in london alone and the number of private club be quite as astonishing -lrb- 183 -rrb- this new social life have a marked effect in polish man 's word and manners the typical londoner of queen anne 's day be still rude and a little vulgar in he taste the city be still very filthy the street unlighted and infested at night by band of rowdy and mohawk but outwardly man seek to refine they manners accord to prevail standard and to be elegant to have good form be a man 's first duty whether he enter society or write literature one can hardly read a book or poem of the age without feel this superficial elegance government still have its opposing tory and whig party and the church be divide into catholic anglican and dissenter but the grow social life offset many antagonism produce at least the outward impression of peace and unity nearly every writer of the age busy himself with religion as well as with party politics the scientist newton as sincerely as the churchman barrow the philosophical locke no less earnestly than the evangelical wesley but nearly all temper they zeal with moderation and argue from reason and scripture or use delicate satire upon they opponent instead of denounce they as follower of satan there be exception of course __ but the general tendency of the age be toward toleration man have find himself in the long struggle for personal liberty now he turn to the task of discover he neighbor of finding in whig and tory in catholic and protestant in anglican and dissenter the same general human characteristic that he find in himself this good work be help moreover by the spread of education and by the growth of the national spfrit follow the victory of marlborough on the continent in the midst of heated argument it need only a word -- gibraltar blenheim ramilly malplaquet -- or a poem of victory write in a garret -lrb- 184 -rrb- to tell a patriotic people that under they many difference they be all alike englishmen in the latter half of the century the political and social progress be almost bewilder the modern form of cabinet government responsible to parliament and the people have be establish under george i and in 1757 the cynical and corrupt practice of walpole premier of the first tory cabinet be replace by the more enlighten policy of pitt school be establish club and coffeehouse increase book and magazine multiply until the press be the greatest visible power in england the modern great daily the _ chronicle post _ and _ time _ begin they career of public education religiously all the church of england feel the quicken power of that tremendous spiritual revival know as methodism under the preaching of wesley and whitefield outside she own border three great man -- clive in indium wolfe on the plain of abraham cook in australium and the island of the pacific -- be unfurl the banner of st george over the untold wealth of new land and spread the world-wide empire of the anglo-saxon literary characteristic in every precede age we have note especially the poetical work which constitute accord to matthew arnold the glory of english literature now for the first time we must chronicle the triumph of english prose a multitude of practical interest arise from the new social and political condition demand expression not simply in book but more especially in pamphlet magazine and newspaper poetry be inadequate for such a task hence the development of prose of the unfettered word as dante call it -- a development which astonish we by its rapidity and excellence the graceful elegance of addison 's essay the terse vigor of swift 's satire the artistic finish of fielding 's novel the sonorous eloquence of gibbon 's history and of burke 's oration -- these have no parallel in the poetry of the age indeed poetry itself become prosaic in this respect that it be use not for creative work of imagination but for essay for satire for criticism -- for exactly the same practical end as be prose the poetry of the first half of the century as typify in the work of pope be polish and witty enough but artificial it lack fire fine feeling enthusiasm the glow of the elizabethan age and the moral earnestness of puritanism in a word it interest we as a study of life rather than delight or inspire we by its appeal to the imagination the variety and excellence of prose work and the development of a serviceable prose style which have be begin by dryden until it serve to express clearly every human interest and emotion -- these be the chief literary glory of the eighteenth century in the literature of the precede age we note two marked tendency -- the tendency to realism in subject-matter and the tendency to polish and refinement of expression both these tendency be continue in the augustan age and be see clearly in the poetry of pope who bring the couplet to perfection and in the prose of addison a third tendency be show in the prevalence of satire result from the unfortunate union of politics with literature we have already note the power of the press in this age and the perpetual strife of political party nearly every writer of the first half of the century be use and reward by whig or tory for satirize they enemy and for advance they special political interest pope be a marked exception but he nevertheless follow the prose writer in use satire too largely in he poetry now satire -- that be a literary work which search out the fault of man or institution in order to hold they up to ridicule -- be at best a destructive kind of criticism a satirist be like a laborer who clear away the ruin and rubbish of a old house before the architect and builder begin on a new and beautiful structure the work may sometimes be necessary but it rarely arouse we enthusiasm while the satire of pope swift and addison be doubtless the best in we language we hardly place they with we great literature which be always constructive in spirit and we have the feeling that all these man be capable of better thing than they ever write the classic age the period we be study be know to we by various name it be often call the age of queen anne but unlike elizabeth this meekly stupid queen have practically no influence upon we literature the name classic age be more often hear but in use it we should remember clearly these three different way in which the word classic be apply to literature : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the term classic refer in general to writer of the highest rank in any nation as use in we literature it be first apply to the work of the great greek and roman writer like homer and virgil and any english book which follow the simple and noble method of these writer be say to have a classic style later the term be enlarged to cover the great literary work of other ancient nation so that the bible and the avesta as well as the iliad and the aeneid be call classic -lrb- 2 -rrb- every national literature have at least one period in which a unusual number of great writer be produce book and this be call the classic period of a nation 's literature thus the reign of augustus be the classic or golden age of rome the generation of dante be the classic age of italian literature the age of loui xiv be the french classic age and the age of queen anne be often call the classic age of england -lrb- 3 -rrb- the word classic acquire a entirely different meaning in the period we be study and we shall better understand this by reference to the precede age the elizabethan writer be lead by patriotism by enthusiasm and in general by romantic emotion they write in a natural style without regard to rule and though they exaggerate and use too many word they work be delightful because of they vigor and freshness and fine feeling in the follow age patriotism have largely disappear from politics and enthusiasm from literature poet no longer write naturally but artificially with strange and fantastic verse form to give effect since fine feeling be want and this be the general character of the poetry of the puritan age -lrb- 185 -rrb- gradually we writer rebel against the exaggeration of both the natural and the fantastic style they demand that poetry should follow exact rule and in this they be influence by french writer especially by boileau and rapin who insist on precise method of write poetry and who profess to have discover they rule in the classic of horace and aristotle in we study of the elizabethan drama we note the good influence of the classic movement in insist upon that beauty of form and definiteness of expression which characterize the drama of greece and rome and in the work of dryden and he follower we see a revival of classicism in the effort to make english literature conform to rule establish by the great writer of other nation at first the result be excellent especially in prose but as the creative vigor of the elizabethan be lack in this age writing by rule soon develop a kind of elegant formalism which suggest the elaborate social code of the time just as a gentleman might not act naturally but must follow exact rule in doff he hat or address a lady or enter a room or wear a wig or offer he snuffbox to a friend so we writer lose individuality and become formal and artificial the general tendency of literature be to look at life critically to emphasize intellect rather than imagination the form rather than the content of a sentence writer strive to repress all emotion and enthusiasm and to use only precise and elegant method of expression this be what be often mean by the classicism of the age of pope and johnson it refer to the critical intellectual spirit of many writer to the fine polish of they heroic couplet or the elegance of they prose and not to any resemblance which they work bear to true classic literature in a word the classic movement have become pseudo-classic ie a false or sham classicism and the latter term be now often use to designate a considerable part of eighteenth-century literature -lrb- 186 -rrb- to avoid this critical difficulty we have adopt the term augustan age a name choose by the writer themselves who see in pope addison swift johnson and burke the modern parallel to horace virgil cicero and all that brilliant company who make roman literature famous in the day of augustus alexander pope -lrb- 1688-1744 -rrb- pope be in many respects a unique figure in the first place he be for a generation the poet of a great nation to be sure poetry be limit in the early eighteenth century there be few lyric little or no love poetry no epic no drama or song of nature worth consider but in the narrow field of satiric and didactic verse pope be the undisputed master he influence completely dominate the poetry of he age and many foreign writer as well as the majority of english poet look to he as they model second he be a remarkably clear and adequate reflection of the spirit of the age in which he live there be hardly a ideal a belief a doubt a fashion a whim of queen anne 's time that be not neatly express in he poetry third he be the only important writer of that age who give he whole life to letter swift be a clergyman and politician addison be secretary of state other writer depend on patron or politics or pension for fame and a livelihood but pope be independent and have no profession but literature and fourth by the sheer force of he ambition he win he place and hold it in spite of religious prejudice and in the face of physical and temperamental obstacle that would have discourage a stronger man for pope be deform and sickly dwarfish in soul and body he know little of the world of nature or of the world of the human heart he be lack apparently in noble feeling and instinctively choose a lie when the truth have manifestly more advantage yet this jealous peevish waspish little man become the most famous poet of he age and the acknowledged leader of english literature we record the fact with wonder and admiration but we do not attempt to explain it life pope be bear in london in 1688 the year of the revolution he parent be both catholic who presently remove from london and settle in binfield near windsor where the poet 's childhood be pass partly because of a unfortunate prejudice against catholic in the public school partly because of he own weakness and deformity pope receive very little school education but browse for himself among english book and pick up a smattering of the classic very early he begin to write poetry and record the fact with he usual vanity : as yet a child nor yet a fool to fame i lisp in number for the number come be debar by he religion from many desirable employment he resolve to make literature he life work and in this he resemble dryden who he tell we be he only master though much of he work seem to depend on boileau the french poet and critic -lrb- 187 -rrb- when only sixteen year old he have write he pastoral a few year later appear he essay on criticism which make he famous with the publication of the _ rape of the lock _ in 1712 pope 's name be know and honor all over england and this dwarf of twenty-four year by the sheer force of he own ambition have jump to the foremost place in english letter it be soon after this that voltaire call he the best poet of england and at present of all the world -- which be about as near the truth as voltaire generally get in he numerous universal judgment for the next twelve year pope be busy with poetry especially with he translation of homer and he work be so successful financially that he buy a villa at twickenham on the thame and remain happily independent of wealthy patron for a livelihood lead by he success pope return to london and for a time endeavor to live the gay and dissolute life which be suppose to be suitable for a literary genius but he be utterly unfitted for it mentally and physically and soon retire to twickenham there he give himself up to poetry manufacture a little garden more artificial than he verse and cultivate he friendship with martha blount with whom for many year he spend a good part of each day and who remain faithful to he to the end of he life at twickenham he write he _ moral epistle _ -lrb- poetical satire model after horace -rrb- and revenge himself upon all he critic in the bitter abuse of the _ dunciad _ he die in 1744 and be bury at twickenham he religion prevent he from the honor which be certainly he due of a rest place in westminster abbey work of pope for convenience we may separate pope 's work into three group correspond to the early middle and later period of he life in the first he write he pastoral windsor forest messiah essay on criticism eloise to abelard and the _ rape of the lock _ in the second he translation of homer in the third the _ dunciad _ and the _ epistle _ the latter contain the famous essay on man and the epistle to dr arbuthnot which be in truth he apologium and in which alone we see pope 's life from he own view point the essay on criticism sum up the art of poetry as teach first by horace then by boileau and the eighteenth-century classicist though write in heroic couplet we hardly consider this as a poem but rather as a storehouse of critical maxim for fool rush in where angel fear to tread to err be human to forgive divine a little learning be a dangerous thing -- these line and many more like they from the same source have find they way into we common speech and be use without thinking of the author whenever we need a apt quotation the _ rape of the lock _ be a masterpiece of its kind and come nearer to be a creation than anything else that pope have write the occasion of the famous poem be trivial enough a fop at the court of queen anne one lord petre snip a lock of hair from the abundant curl of a pretty maid of honor name arabellum fermor the young lady resent it and the two family be plunge into a quarrel which be the talk of london pope be appeal to seize the occasion to construct not a ballad as the cavalier would have do nor a epigram as french poet love to do but a long poem in which all the mannerism of society be picture in minutest detail and satirize with the most delicate wit the first edition consist of two canto be publish in 1712 and it be amazing now to read of the trivial character of london court life at the time when english soldier be battle for a great continent in the french and indian war its instant success cause pope to lengthen the poem by three more canto and in order to make a more perfect burlesque of a epic poem he introduce gnome sprite sylph and salamander -lrb- 188 -rrb- instead of the god of the great epic with which he reader be familiar the poem be model after two foreign satire : boileau 's _ le lutrin _ -lrb- reading desk -rrb- a satire on the french clergy who raise a huge quarrel over the location of a lectern and _ la secchia rapita _ -lrb- steal bucket -rrb- a famous italian satire on the petty cause of the endless italian war pope however go far ahead of he master in style and in delicacy of handle a mock-heroic theme and during he lifetime the _ rape of the lock _ be consider as the greatest poem of its kind in all literature the poem be still well worth read for as a expression of the artificial life of the age -- of its card party toilette lapdog tea-drinking snuff-taking and idle vanity -- it be as perfect in its way as _ tamburlaine _ which reflect the boundless ambition of the elizabethan the fame of pope 's _ iliad _ which be financially the most successful of he book be due to the fact that he interpret homer in the elegant artificial language of he own age not only do he word follow literary fashion but even the homeric character lose they strength and become fashionable man of the court so the criticism of the scholar bentley be most appropriate when he say it be a pretty poem mr pope but you must not call it homer pope translate the entire _ iliad _ and half of the _ odyssey _ and the latter work be finish by two cambridge scholar elijah fenton and william broome who imitate the mechanical couplet so perfectly that it be difficult to distinguish they work from that of the greatest poet of the age a single selection be give to show how in the nobler passage even pope may faintly suggest the elemental grandeur of homer : the troops exult sit in order round and beam fire illumine all the ground as when the moon refulgent lamp of night o'er heaven 's clear azure spread she sacred light when not a breath disturb the deep serene and not a cloud o'ercast the solemn scene around she throne the vivid planet roll and star unnumbered gild the glowing pole o'er the dark tree a yellower verdure shed and tip with silver every mountain 's head the essay be the best know and the most quote of all pope 's work except in form it be not poetry and when one consider it as a essay and reduce it to plain prose it be find to consist of numerous literary ornament without any very solid structure of think to rest upon the purpose of the essay be in pope 's word to vindicate the way of god to man and as there be no unanswered problem in pope 's philosophy the vindication be perfectly accomplish in four poetical epistle concern man 's relation to the universe to himself to society and to happiness the final result be sum up in a few well-known line : all nature be but art unknown to thee all chance direction which thou canst not see all discord harmony not understand all partial evil universal good : and spite of pride in err reason 's spite one truth be clear whatever be be right like the essay on criticism the poem abound in quotable line such as the follow which make the entire work well worth reading : hope spring eternal in the human breast : man never be but always to be blest know then thyself presume not god to scan the proper study of mankind be man the same ambition can destroy or save and make a patriot as it make a knave honor and shame from no condition rise act well you part there all the honor lie vice be a monster of so frightful mien as to be hate need but to be see yet see too oft familiar with she face we first endure then pity then embrace behold the child by nature 's kindly law pleased with a rattle tickled with a straw : some livelier plaything give he youth delight a little louder but as empty quite : scarf garter gold amuse he riper stage and bead and prayer book be the toy of age : please with this bauble still as that before till tired he sleep and life 's poor play be o'er -lrb- 189 -rrb- _ the dunciad _ -lrb- ie the iliad of the dunce -rrb- begin originally as a controversy concern shakespeare but turn out to be a coarse and revengeful satire upon all the literary man of the age who have arouse pope 's anger by they criticism or lack of appreciation of he genius though brilliantly write and immensely popular at one time its present effect on the reader be to arouse a sense of pity that a man of such acknowledged power and position should abuse both by devote he talent to personal spite and petty quarrel among the rest of he numerous work the reader will find pope 's estimate of himself best set forth in he epistle to dr arbuthnot and it will be well to close we study of this strange mixture of vanity and greatness with the universal prayer which show at least that pope have consider and judge himself and that all further judgment be consequently superfluous jonathan swift -lrb- 1667-1745 -rrb- in each of marlowe 's tragedy we have the picture of a man dominate by a single passion the lust of power for its own sake in each we see that a powerful man without self-control be like a dangerous instrument in the hand of a child and the tragedy end in the destruction of the man by the ungoverned power which he possess the life of swift be just such a living tragedy he have the power of gain wealth like the hero of the _ jew of malta _ yet he use it scornfully and in sad irony leave what remain to he of a large property to find a hospital for lunatic by hard work he win enormous literary power and use it to satirize we common humanity he wrest political power from the hand of the tory and use it to insult the very man who have help he and who hold he fate in they hand by he dominant personality he exercise a curious power over woman and use it brutally to make they feel they inferiority be love supremely by two good woman he bring sorrow and death to both and endless misery to himself so he power bring always tragedy in its wake it be only when we remember he life of struggle and disappointment and bitterness that we can appreciate the personal quality in he satire and perhaps find some sympathy for this greatest genius of all the augustan writer life swift be bear in dublin of english parent in 1667 he father die before he be bear he mother be poor and swift though proud as lucifer be compel to accept aid from relative who give it grudgingly at the kilkenny school and especially at dublin university he detest the curriculum reading only what appeal to he own nature but since a degree be necessary to he success he be compel to accept it as a favor from the examiner whom he despise in he heart after graduation the only position open to he be with a distant relative sir william temple who give he the position of private secretary largely on account of the unwelcome relationship temple be a statesman and a excellent diplomatist but he think himself to be a great writer as well and he enter into a literary controversy concern the relative merit of the classic and modern literature swift 's first notable work _ the battle of the book _ write at this time but not publish be a keen satire upon both party in the controversy the first touch of bitterness show itself here for swift be in a galling position for a man of he pride know he intellectual superiority to the man who employ he and yet be look upon as a servant and eating at the servant ' table thus he spend ten of the best year of he life in the pretty moor park surrey grow more bitter each year and steadily cursing he fate nevertheless he read and study widely and after he position with temple grow unbearable quarrel with he patron take order and enter the church of england some year later we find he settle in the little church of laracor ireland -- a country which he dislike intensely but whither he go because no other living be open to he in ireland faithful to he church duty swift labor to better the condition of the unhappy people around he never before have the poor of he parish be so well care for but swift chafe under he yoke grow more and more irritated as he see small man advance to large position while he remain unnoticed in a little country church -- largely because he be too proud and too blunt with those who might have advance he while at laracor he finish he _ tale of a tub _ a satire on the various church of the day which be publish in london with the _ battle of the book _ in 1704 the work bring he into notice as the most powerful satirist of the age and he soon give up he church to enter the strife of party politics the cheap pamphlet be then the most powerful political weapon know and as swift have no equal at pamphlet write he soon become a veritable dictator for several year especially from 1710 to 1713 swift be one of the most important figure in london the whig fear the lash of he satire the tory fear to lose he support he be court flattered cajole on every side but the use he make of he new power be sad to contemplate a unbearable arrogance take possession of he lord statesman even lady be compel to sue for he favor and to apologize for every fancied slight to he egoism it be at this time that he write in he _ journal to stellum : _ mr secretary tell I the duke of buckingham have be talk much about I and desire my acquaintance i answer it could not be for he have not yet make sufficient advance then shrewsbury say he think the duke be not use to make advance i say i could not help that for i always expect advance in proportion to man 's quality and more from a duke than any other man write to the duchess of queensberry he say : i be glad you know you duty for it have be a known and established rule above twenty year in england that the first advance have be constantly make I by all lady who aspire to my acquaintance and the greater they quality the greater be they advance when the tory go out of power swift 's position become uncertain he expect and have probably be promise a bishopric in england with a seat among the peer of the realm but the tory offer he instead the place of dean of st patrick 's cathedral in dublin it be galling to a man of he proud spirit but after he merciless satire on religion in _ the tale of a tub _ any ecclesiastical position in england be render impossible dublin be the best he could get and he accept it bitterly once more cursing the fate which he have bring upon himself with he return to ireland begin the last act in the tragedy of he life he best know literary work _ gulliver 's travels _ be do here but the bitterness of life grow slowly to insanity and a frightful personal sorrow of which he never speak reach its climax in the death of esther johnson a beautiful young woman who have love swift ever since the two have meet in temple 's household and to whom he have write he _ journal to stellum _ during the last year of he life a brain disease of which he have show frequent symptom fasten its terrible hold upon swift and he become by turn a idiot and a madman he die in 1745 and when he will be open it be find that he have leave all he property to find st patrick 's asylum for lunatic and incurable it stand to-day as the most suggestive monument of he peculiar genius the work of swift from swift 's life one can readily foresee the kind of literature he will produce take together he work be a monstrous satire on humanity and the spirit of that satire be show clearly in a little incident of he first day in london there be in the city at that time a certain astrologer name partridge who dupe the public by calculate nativity from the star and by sell a yearly almanac predict future event swift who hate all sham write with a great show of learn he famous _ bickerstaff almanac _ contain prediction for the year 1708 as determine by the unerring star as swift rarely sign he name to any literary work let it stand or fall on its own merit he burlesque appear over the pseudonym of isaac bickerstaff a name afterwards make famous by steele in _ the tatler _ among the prediction be the following : my first prediction be but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretender to astrology be in they own concern : it relate to partridge the almanack maker i have consult the star of he nativity by my own rule and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th of march next about eleven at night of a rage fever therefore i advise he to consider of it and settle he affair in time on march 30 the day after the prediction be to be fulfil there appear in the newspaper a letter from a revenue officer give the detail of partridge 's death with the doings of the bailiff and the coffin maker and on the follow morning appear a elaborate elegy of mr partridge when poor partridge who suddenly find himself without customer publish a denial of the burial swift answer with a elaborate vindication of isaac bickerstaff in which he prove by astrological rule that partridge be dead and that the man now in he place be a impostor try to cheat the heir out of they inheritance this ferocious joke be suggestive of all swift 's satire against any case of hypocrisy or injustice he set up a remedy of precisely the same kind only more atrocious and defend he plan with such seriousness that the satire overwhelm the reader with a sense of monstrous falsity thus he solemn argument to prove that the abolish of christianity may be attend with some inconvenience be such a frightful satire upon the abuse of christianity by its profess follower that it be impossible for we to say whether swift intend to point out need reform or to satisfy he conscience -lrb- 190 -rrb- or to perpetrate a joke on the church as he have do on poor partridge so also with he modest proposal concern the child of ireland which set up the proposition that poor irish farmer ought to raise child as dainty to be eat like roast pig on the table of prosperous englishman in this most characteristic work it be impossible to find swift or he motive the injustice under which ireland suffer she perversity in raise large family to certain poverty and the indifference of english politician to she suffering and protest be all mercilessly portray but why that be still the unanswered problem of swift 's life and writings swift 's two greatest satire be he _ tale of a tub _ and _ gulliver 's travels _ the _ tale _ begin as a grim exposure of the alleged weakness of three principal form of religious belief catholic lutheran and calvinist as oppose to the anglican but it end in a satire upon all science and philosophy swift explain he whimsical title by the custom of mariner in throw out a tub to a whale in order to occupy the monster 's attention and divert it from a attack upon the ship -- which only prove how little swift know of whale or sailor but let that pass he book be a tub throw out to the enemy of church and state to keep they occupy from further attack or criticism and the substance of the argument be that all church and indeed all religion and science and statesmanship be arrant hypocrisy the best known part of the book be the allegory of the old man who die and leave a coat -lrb- which be christian truth -rrb- to each of he three son peter martin and jack with minute direction for its care and use these three name stand for catholic lutheran and calvinist and the way in which the son evade they father 's will and change the fashion of they garment be part of the bitter satire upon all religious sect though it profess to defend the anglican church that institution fare perhaps worse than the other for nothing be leave to she but a thin cloak of custom under which to hide she alleged hypocrisy in _ gulliver 's travels _ the satire grow more unbearable strangely enough this book upon which swift 's literary fame generally rest be not write from any literary motive but rather as a outlet for the author 's own bitterness against fate and human society it be still read with pleasure as _ robinson crusoe _ be read for the interesting adventure of the hero and fortunately those who read it generally overlook its degrading influence and motive _ gulliver 's travels _ record the pretended four voyage of one lemuel gulliver and he adventure in four astounding country the first book tell of he voyage and shipwreck in lilliput where the inhabitant be about as tall as one 's thumb and all they act and motive be on the same dwarfish scale in the petty quarrel of these dwarf we be suppose to see the littleness of humanity the statesman who obtain place and favor by cut monkey caper on the tight rope before they sovereign and the two great party the littleendian and bigendian who plunge the country into civil war over the momentous question of whether a egg should be break on its big or on its little end be satire on the politics of swift 's own day and generation the style be simple and convince the surprising situation and adventure be as absorb as those of defoe 's masterpiece and altogether it be the most interesting of swift 's satire on the second voyage gulliver be abandon in brobdingnag where the inhabitant be giant and everything be do upon a enormous scale the meanness of humanity seem all the more detestable in view of the greatness of these superior being when gulliver tell about he own people they ambition and war and conquest the giant can only wonder that such great venom could exist in such little insect in the third voyage gulliver continue he adventure in laputa and this be a satire upon all the scientist and philosopher laputa be a fly island hold up in the air by a loadstone and all the professor of the famous academy at lagado be of the same airy constitution the philosopher who work eight year to extract sunshine from cucumber be typical of swift 's satiric treatment of all scientific problem it be in this voyage that we hear of the struldbrug a ghastly race of man who be doom to live upon earth after lose hope and the desire for life the picture be all the more terrible in view of the last year of swift 's own life in which he be compel to live on a burden to himself and he friend in these three voyage the evident purpose be to strip off the veil of habit and custom with which man deceive themselves and show the crude vice of humanity as swift fancy he see they in the fourth voyage the merciless satire be carry out to its logical conclusion this bring we to the land of the houyhnhnm in which horse superior and intelligent creature be the ruling animal all we interest however be center on the yahoo a frightful race have the form and appearance of man but live in unspeakable degradation the _ journal to stella _ write chiefly in the year 1710-1713 for the benefit of esther johnson be interesting to we for two reason it be first a excellent commentary on contemporary character and political event by one of the most powerful and original mind of the age and second in its love passage and purely personal description it give we the best picture we possess of swift himself at the summit of he power and influence as we read now its word of tenderness for the woman who love he and who bring almost the only ray of sunlight into he life we can only wonder and be silent entirely different be he _ drapier 's letter _ a model of political harangue and of popular argument which rouse a unthinking english public and do much benefit to ireland by prevent the politician ' plan of debase the irish coinage swift 's poem though vigorous and original -lrb- like defoe 's of the same period -rrb- be generally satirical often coarse and seldom rise above doggerel unlike he friend addison swift see in the grow polish and decency of society only a mask for hypocrisy and he often use he verse to shock the new-born modesty by point out some native ugliness which he diseased mind discover under every beautiful exterior that swift be the most original writer of he time and one of the greatest master of english prose be undeniable directness vigor simplicity mark every page among writer of that age he stand almost alone in he disdain of literary effect keep he object steadily before he he drive straight on to the end with a convincing power that have never be surpass in we language even in he most grotesque creation the reader never lose the sense of reality of be present as a eyewitness of the most impossible event so powerful and convincing be swift 's prose defoe have the same power but in write _ robinson crusoe _ for instance he task be comparatively easy since he hero and he adventure be both natural while swift give reality to pygmy giant and the most impossible situation as easily as if he be write of fact notwithstanding these excellent quality the ordinary reader will do well to confine himself to _ gulliver 's travels _ and a book of well-chosen selection for it must be confess the bulk of swift 's work be not wholesome reading it be too terribly satiric and destructive it emphasize the fault and failing of humanity and so run counter to the general course of we literature which from cynewulf to tennyson follow the ideal as merlin follow the gleam -lrb- 191 -rrb- and be not satisfied till the hidden beauty of man 's soul and the divine purpose of he struggle be manifest joseph addison -lrb- 1672-1719 -rrb- in the pleasant art of live with one 's fellow addison be easily a master it be due to he perfect expression of that art of that new social life which as we have note be characteristic of the age of anne that addison occupy such a large place in the history of literature of less power and originality than swift he nevertheless wield and deserve to wield a more lasting influence swift be the storm roar against the ice and frost of the late spring of english life addison be the sunshine which melt the ice and dry the mud and make the earth thrill with light and hope like swift he despise sham but unlike he he never lose faith in humanity and in all he satire there be a gentle kindliness which make one think better of he fellow-men even while he laugh at they little vanity two thing addison do for we literature which be of inestimable value first he overcome a certain corrupt tendency bequeath by restoration literature it be the apparent aim of the low drama and even of much of the poetry of that age to make virtue ridiculous and vice attractive addison set himself squarely against this unworthy tendency to strip off the mask of vice to show its ugliness and deformity but to reveal virtue in its own native loveliness -- that be addison 's purpose and he succeed so well that never since he day have we english literature seriously follow after false god as macaulay say so effectually do he retort on vice the mockery which have recently be direct against virtue that since he time the open violation of decency have always be consider amongst we a sure mark of a fool and second prompt and aid by the more original genius of he friend steele addison seize upon the new social life of the club and make it the subject of endless pleasant essay upon type of man and manners _ the tatler _ and _ the spectator _ be the beginning of the modern essay and they study of human character as exemplify in sir roger de coverley be a preparation for the modern novel life addison 's life like he writings be in marked contrast to that of swift he be bear in milston wiltshire in 1672 he father be a scholarly english clergyman and all he life addison follow naturally the quiet and culture way to which he be early accustom at the famous charterhouse school in london and in he university life at oxford he excel in character and scholarship and become know as a writer of graceful verse he have some intention at one time of enter the church but be easily persuade by he friend to take up the government service instead unlike swift who abuse he political superior addison take the more tactful way of win the friendship of man in large place he line to dryden win that literary leader 's instant favor and one of he latin poem the peace of ryswick -lrb- 1697 -rrb- with its kindly appreciation of king william 's statesman bring he into favorable political notice it bring he also a pension of three hundred pound a year with a suggestion that he travel abroad and cultivate the art of diplomacy which he promptly do to he own great advantage from a literary view point the most interesting work of addison 's early life be he _ account of the greatest english poet _ -lrb- 1693 -rrb- write while he be a fellow of oxford university one rub he eye to find dryden lavishly praise spenser excuse or patronize while shakespeare be not even mention but addison be write under boileau 's classic rule and the poet like the age be perhaps too artificial to appreciate natural genius while he be travel abroad the death of william and the loss of power by the whig suddenly stop addison 's pension necessity bring he home and for a time he live in poverty and obscurity then occur the battle of blenheim and in the effort to find a poet to celebrate the event addison be bring to the tory ' attention he poem the campaign celebrate the victory take the country by storm instead of make the hero slay he thousand and ten thousand like the old epic hero addison have some sense of what be require in a modern general and so make marlborough direct the battle from the outside compare he to a angel ride on the whirlwind : ' t be then great marlbro 's mighty soul be prove that in the shock of charge host unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair examine all the dreadful scene of war in peaceful think the field of death survey to faint squadron send the timely aid inspire repulse battalion to engage and teach the doubtful battle where to rage so when a angel by divine command with rise tempest shake a guilty land -lrb- such as of late o'er pale britannium past -rrb- calm and serene he drive the furious blast and pleased th ' almighty 's order to perform ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm that one doubtful simile make addison 's fortune never before or since be a poet 's mechanical work so well reward it be call the finest thing ever write and from that day addison rise steadily in political favor and office he become in turn undersecretary member of parliament secretary for ireland and finally secretary of state probably no other literary man aid by he pen alone ever rise so rapidly and so high in office the rest of addison 's life be divide between political duty and literature he essay for the _ tatler _ and _ spectator _ which we still cherish be write between 1709 and 1714 but he win more literary fame by he classic tragedy _ cato _ which we have almost forget in 1716 he marry a widow the countess of warwick and go to live at she home the famous holland house he married life last only three year and be probably not a happy one certainly he never write of woman except with gentle satire and he become more and more a clubman spending most of he time in the club and coffeehouse of london up to this time he life have be singularly peaceful but he last year be shadow by quarrel first with pope then with swift and finally with he lifelong friend steele the first quarrel be on literary grounds and be largely the result of pope 's jealousy the latter 's venomous caricature of addison as atticus show how he take he petty revenge on a great and good man who have be he friend the other quarrel with swift and especially with he old friend steele be the unfortunate result of political difference and show how impossible it be to mingle literary ideal with party politics he die serenely in 1719 a brief description from thackeray 's _ english humorist _ be he best epitaph : a life prosperous and beautiful a calm death a immense fame and affection afterwards for he happy and spotless name work of addison the most enduring of addison 's work be he famous _ essay _ collect from the _ tatler _ and _ spectator _ we have speak of he as a master of the art of gentle living and these essay be a perpetual inducement to other to know and to practice the same fine art to a age of fundamental coarseness and artificiality he come with a wholesome message of refinement and simplicity much as ruskin and arnold speak to a later age of materialism only addison 's success be greater than theirs because of he greater knowledge of life and he greater faith in man he attack all the little vanity and all the big vice of he time not in swift 's terrible way which make we feel hopeless of humanity but with a kindly ridicule and gentle humor which take speedy improvement for grant to read swift 's brutal letter to a young lady and then to read addison 's dissection of a beau 's head and he dissection of a coquette 's heart be to know at once the secret of the latter 's more enduring influence three other result of these delightful essay be worthy of attention : first they be the best picture we possess of the new social life of england with its many new interest second they advance the art of literary criticism to a much higher stage than it have ever before reach and however much we differ from they judgment and they interpretation of such a man as milton they certainly lead englishman to a better knowledge and appreciation of they own literature and finally in ned softly the literary dabbler will wimble the poor relation sir andrew freeport the merchant will honeycomb the fop and sir roger the country gentleman they give we character that live forever as part of that goodly company which extend from chaucer 's country parson to kipling 's mulvaney addison and steele not only introduce the modern essay but in such character as these they herald the dawn of the modern novel of all he essay the best know and love be those which introduce we to sir roger de coverley the genial dictator of life and manners in the quiet english country in style these essay be remarkable as show the grow perfection of the english language johnson say whoever wish to attain a english style familiar but not coarse and elegant but not ostentatious must give he day and night to the volume of addison and again he say give night and day sir to the study of addison if you mean to be a good writer or what be more worth a honest man that be good criticism for its day and even at the present time critic be agree that addison 's _ essay _ be well worth read once for they own sake and many time for they influence in shape a clear and graceful style of write addison 's poem which be enormously popular in he day be now seldom read he _ cato _ with its classic unity and lack of dramatic power must be regard as a failure if we study it as tragedy but it offer a excellent example of the rhetoric and fine sentiment which be then consider the essential of good write the best scene from this tragedy be in the fifth act where cato soliloquize with plato 's _ immortality of the soul _ open in he hand and a draw sword on the table before he : it must be so -- plato thou reason ` st well -- else whence this please hope this fond desire this longing after immortality or whence this secret dread and inward horror of fall into nought why shrink the soul back on herself and startle at destruction ` tis the divinity that stir within we ` tis heaven itself that point out a hereafter and intimate eternity to man many reader make frequent use of one portion of addison 's poetry without know to whom they be indebted he devout nature find expression in many hymn a few of which be still use and love in we church many a congregation thrill as thackeray do to the splendid sweep of he god in nature begin the spacious firmament on high almost as well know and love be he traveler 's hymn and he continued help beginning when all thy mercy o my god the latter hymn -- write in a storm at sea off the italian coast when the captain and crew be demoralize by terror -- show that poetry especially a good hymn that one can sing in the same spirit as one would say he prayer be sometimes the most practical and helpful thing in the world richard steele -lrb- 1672-1729 -rrb- steele be in almost every respect the antithesis of he friend and fellow-worker -- a rollick good-hearted emotional lovable irishman at the charterhouse school and at oxford he share everything with addison ask nothing but love in return unlike addison he study but little and leave the university to enter the horse guard he be in turn soldier captain poet playwright essayist member of parliament manager of a theater publisher of a newspaper and twenty other thing -- all of which he begin joyously and then abandon sometimes against he will as when he be expel from parliament and again because some other interest of the moment have more attraction he poem and play be now little known but the reader who search they out will find one or two suggestive thing about steele himself for instance he love child and he be one of the few writer of he time who show a sincere and unswerving respect for womanhood even more than addison he ridicule vice and make virtue lovely he be the originator of the _ tatler _ and join with addison in create the _ spectator _ -- the two periodical which in the short space of less than four year do more to influence subsequent literature than all other magazine of the century combine moreover he be the original genius of sir roger and of many other character and essay for which addison usually receive the whole credit it be often impossible in the _ tatler _ essay to separate the work of the two man but the majority of critic hold that the more original part the character the think the overflow kindliness be largely steele 's creation while to addison fall the work of polish and perfect the essay and of add that touch of humor which make they the most welcome literary visitor that england have ever receive the tatler and the spectator on account of he talent in write political pamphlet steele be award the position of official gazetteer while in this position and write for several small newspaper the idea occur to steele to publish a paper which should contain not only the political news but also the gossip of the club and coffeehouse with some light essay on the life and manners of the age the immediate result -- for steele never let a idea remain idle -- be the famous _ tatler _ the first number of which appear April 12 1709 it be a small folio sheet appear on post day three time a week and it sell for a penny a copy that it have a serious purpose be evident from this dedication to the first volume of collect _ tatler _ essay : the general purpose of this paper be to expose the false art of life to pull off the disguise of cunning vanity and affectation and to recommend a general simplicity in we dress we discourse and we behavior the success of this unheard-of combination of news gossip and essay be instantaneous not a club or a coffeehouse in london could afford to be without it and over it be page begin the first general interest in contemporary english life as express in literature steele at first write the entire paper and sign he essay with the name of isaac bickerstaff which have be make famous by swift a few year before addison be say to have soon recognize one of he own remark to steele and the secret of the authorship be out from that time addison be a regular contributor and occasionally other writer add essay on the new social life of england -lrb- 192 -rrb- steele lose he position as gazetteer and the _ tatler _ be discontinue after less than two year ' life but not till it win a astonishing popularity and make ready the way for its successor two month later on march 1 1711 appear the first number of the _ spectator _ in the new magazine politics and news as such be ignore it be a literary magazine pure and simple and its entire contents consist of a single light essay it be consider a crazy venture at the time but its instant success prove that man be eager for some literary expression of the new social ideal the following whimsical letter to the editor may serve to indicate the part play by the _ spectator _ in the daily life of london : mr spectator -- you paper be a part of my tea equipage and my servant know my humor so well that in call for my breakfast this morning -lrb- it be past my usual hour -rrb- she answer the _ spectator _ be not yet come in but the teakettle boil and she expect it every moment it be in the incomparable _ spectator _ papers that addison show himself most worthy to be remember he contribute the majority of its essay and in its first number appear this description of the spectator by which name addison be now generally know : there be no place of general resort wherein i do not often make my appearance sometimes i be see thrust my head into a round of politician at will 's -lrb- coffeehouse -rrb- and listen with great attention to the narrative that be make in those little circular audience sometimes i smoke a pipe at child 's and whilst i seem attentive to nothing but _ the postman _ overhear the conversation of every table in the room i appear on Sunday night at st jame 's and sometimes join the little committee of politics in the inner room as one who come to hear and improve my face be likewise very well know at the grecian the cocoa tree and in the theater both of drury lane and the haymarket i have be take for a merchant upon the exchange for above these ten year and sometimes pass for a jew in the assembly of stock jobber at jonathan 's thus i live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of the species which be the character i intend to preserve in this paper the large place which these two little magazine hold in we literature seem most disproportionate to they short span of day in the short space of four year in which addison and steele work together the light essay be establish as one of the most important form of modern literature and the literary magazine win its place as the expression of the social life of a nation samuel johnson -lrb- 1709-1784 -rrb- the reader of boswell 's _ johnson _ after listen to endless grumbling and watch the clumsy action of the hero often find himself wonder why he should end he reading with a profound respect for this old bear who be the object of boswell 's grovel attention here be a man who be certainly not the greatest writer of he age perhaps not even a great writer at all but who be nevertheless the dictator of english letter and who still loom across the century of a magnificent literature as its most striking and original figure here moreover be a huge fat awkward man of vulgar manners and appearance who monopolize conversation argue violently abuse everybody club down opposition -- madam -lrb- speak to he cultivate hostess at table -rrb- talk no more nonsense sir -lrb- turn to a distinguished guest -rrb- i perceive you be a vile whig while talk he make curious animal sound sometimes give a half whistle sometimes cluck like a hen and when he have conclude a violent dispute and lay he opponent low by dogmatism or ridicule he lean back to blow out he breath like a whale and gulp down numberless cup of hot tea yet this curious dictator of a elegant age be a veritable lion much seek after by society and around he in he own poor house gather the foremost artist scholar actor and literary man of london -- all honor the man loving he and listen to he dogmatism as the greek listen to the voice of they oracle what be the secret of this astounding spectacle if the reader turn naturally to johnson 's work for a explanation he will be disappointed read he verse we find nothing to delight or inspire we but rather gloom and pessimism with a few moral observation in rimed couplet : but scarce observe the know and the bold fall in the general massacre of gold wide-wasting pest that rage unconfined and crowd with crime the record of mankind for gold he sword the hirele ruffian draw for gold the hirele judge distort the law wealth heap on wealth nor truth nor safety buy the danger gather as the treasure rise -lrb- 193 -rrb- that be excellent common sense but it be not poetry and it be not necessary to hunt through johnson 's bulky volume for the information since any moralist can give we offhand the same doctrine as for he _ rambler _ essay once so successful though we marvel at the big word the carefully balanced sentence the classical allusion one might as well try to get interested in a old-fashioned three-hour sermon we read a few page listlessly yawn and go to bed since the man 's work fail to account for he leadership and influence we examine he personality and here everything be interesting because of a few oft-quoted passage from boswell 's biography johnson appear to we as a eccentric bear who amuse we by he growling and clumsy antic but there be another johnson a brave patient kindly religious soul who as goldsmith say have nothing of the bear but he skin a man who battle like a hero against poverty and pain and melancholy and the awful fear of death and who overcome they manfully _ that trouble pass away so will this _ sing the sorrowing deor in the first old anglo-saxon lyric and that express the great and suffer spirit of johnson who in the face of enormous obstacle never lose faith in god or in himself though he be a reactionary in politics uphold the arbitrary power of king and oppose the grow liberty of the people yet he political theory like he manners be no deeper than he skin for in all london there be none more kind to the wretched and none more ready to extend a open hand to every struggle man and woman who cross he path when he pass poor homeless arab sleep in the street he would slip a coin into they hand in order that they might have a happy awakening for he himself know well what it mean to be hungry such be johnson -- a mass of genuine manhood as carlyle call he and as such man love and honor he -lrb- 194 -rrb- life of johnson johnson be bear in lichfield staffordshire in 1709 he be the son of a small bookseller a poor man but intelligent and fond of literature as bookseller invariably be in the good day when every town have its bookshop from he childhood johnson have to struggle against physical deformity and disease and the consequent disinclination to hard work he prepare for the university partly in the school but largely by omnivorous reading in he father 's shop and when he enter oxford he have read more classical author than have most of the graduate before finish he course he have to leave the university on account of he poverty and at once he begin he long struggle as a hack writer to earn he living at twenty-five year he marry a woman old enough to be he mother -- a genuine love match he call it -- and with she dowry of # 800 they start a private school together which be a dismal failure then without money or influential friend he leave he home and wife in lichfield and tramp to london accompany only by david garrick afterwards the famous actor who have be one of he pupil here lead by old association johnson make himself know to the bookseller and now and then earn a penny by write preface review and translation it be a dog 's life indeed that he lead there with he literary brethren many of the writer of the day who be ridicule in pope 's heartless _ dunciad _ have no wealthy patron to support they live largely in the street and tavern sleep on a ash heap or under a wharf like rat glad of a crust and happy over a single meal which enable they to work for a while without the reminder of hunger a few favored one live in wretched lodgings in grub street which have since become a synonym for the fortune of struggle writer -lrb- 195 -rrb- often johnson tell we he walk the street all night long in dreary weather when it be too cold to sleep without food or shelter but he write steadily for the bookseller and for the _ gentleman 's magazine _ and presently he become know in london and receive enough work to earn a bare live the work which occasion this small success be he poem london and he _ life of the poet savage _ a wretched life at best which be perhaps better leave without a biographer but he success be genuine though small and presently the bookseller of london be come to he to ask he to write a dictionary of the english language it be a enormous work take nearly eight year of he time and long before he have finish it he have eat up the money which he receive for he labor in the leisure interval of this work he write the vanity of human wish and other poem and finish he classic tragedy of _ irene _ lead by the great success of the _ spectator _ johnson start two magazine _ the rambler _ -lrb- 1750 -- 1752 -rrb- and _ the idler _ -lrb- 1758 -- 1760 -rrb- later the _ rambler _ essay be publish in book form and run rapidly through ten edition but the financial return be small and johnson spend a large part of he earnings in charity when he mother die in 1759 johnson although one of the best know man in london have no money and hurriedly finish _ rassela _ he only romance in order it be say to pay for he mother 's burial it be not till 1762 when johnson be fifty-three year old that he literary labor be reward in the usual way by royalty and he receive from george iii a yearly pension of three hundred pound then begin a little sunshine in he life with joshua reynold the artist he found the famous literary club of which burke pitt fox gibbon goldsmith and indeed all the great literary man and politician of the time be member this be the period of johnson 's famous conversation which be catch in minutest detail by boswell and give to the world he idea of conversation as show in a hundred place in boswell be to overcome you adversary at any cost to knock he down by argument or when these fail by personal ridicule to dogmatize on every possible question pronounce a few oracle and then desist with the air of victory concern the philosopher hume 's view of death he say : sir if he really think so he perception be disturbed he be mad if he do not think so he lie exit opposition there be nothing more to be say curiously enough it be often the palpable blunder of these monologue that now attract we as if we be enjoy a good joke at the dictator 's expense once a lady ask he dr johnson why do you define _ pastern _ as the knee of a horse ignorance madame pure ignorance thunder the great authority when seventy year of age johnson be visit by several bookseller of the city who be about to bring out a new edition of the english poet and who want johnson as the lead literary man of london to write the preface to the several volume the result be he _ life of the poet _ as it be now know and this be he last literary work he die in he poor fleet street house in 1784 and be bury among england 's honor poet in westminster abbey johnson 's work a book say dr johnson should help we either to enjoy life or to endure it judge by this standard one be puzzle what to recommend among johnson 's numerous book the two thing which belong among the thing worthy to be remember be he _ dictionary _ and he _ life of the poet _ though both these be valuable not as literature but rather as a study of literature the _ dictionary _ as the first ambitious attempt at a english lexicon be extremely valuable notwithstanding the fact that he derivation be often faulty and that he frequently exercise he humor or prejudice in he curious definition in define oats for example as a grain give in england to horse and in scotland to the people he indulge he prejudice against the scotch whom he never understand just as in he definition of pension he take occasion to rap the writer who have flatter they patron since the day of elizabeth though he afterwards accept a comfortable pension for himself with characteristic honesty he refuse to alter he definition in subsequent edition of the _ dictionary _ the _ life of the poet _ be the simplest and most readable of he literary work for ten year before begin these biography he have give himself up to conversation and the ponderous style of he _ rambler _ essay here give way to a lighter and more natural expression as criticism they be often misleading give praise to artificial poet like cowley and pope and do scant justice or abundant injustice to nobler poet like gray and milton and they be not to be compare with those find in thoma warton 's _ history of english poetry _ which be publish in the same generation as biography however they be excellent reading and we owe to they some of we best know picture of the early english poet of johnson 's poem the reader will have enough if he glance over the vanity of human wish he only story _ rassela prince of abyssinium _ be a matter of rhetoric rather than of romance but be interesting still to the reader who want to hear johnson 's personal view of society philosophy and religion any one of he _ essay _ like that on reading or the pernicious effect of revery will be enough to acquaint the reader with the johnsonese style which be once much admire and copy by orator but which happily have be replace by a more natural way of speak most of he work it must be confess be rather tiresome it be not to he book but rather to the picture of the man himself as give by boswell that johnson owe he great place in we literature boswell 's life of johnson in jame boswell -lrb- 1740-1795 -rrb- we have another extraordinary figure -- a shallow little scotch barrister who trot about like a dog at the heel of he big master frantic at a caress and groveling at a cuff and abundantly contented if only he can be near he and record he oracle all he life long boswell 's one ambition seem to have be to shine in the reflect glory of great man and he chief task to record they saying and doings when he come to london at twenty-two year of age johnson then at the beginning of he great fame be to this insatiable little glory-seeker like a silver doctor to a hungry trout he seek a introduction as a man seek gold haunt every place where johnson declaim until in davy 's bookstore the supreme opportunity come this be he record of the great event : i be much agitate -lrb- say boswell -rrb- and recollect he prejudice against the scotch of which i have hear much i say to davy do not tell he where i come from from scotland cry davy roguishly mr johnson say i i do indeed come from scotland but i can not help it that sir -lrb- cry johnson -rrb- i find be what a very great many of you countryman can not help this stroke stun I a good deal and when we have sit down i feel myself not a little embarrassed and apprehensive of what might come next then for several year with a persistency that no rebuff could abate and with a thick skin that no amount of ridicule could render sensitive he follow johnson force he way into the literary club where he be not welcome in order to be near he idol carry he off on a visit to the hebride talk with he on every possible occasion and when he be not invite to a feast wait outside the house or tavern in order to walk home with he master in the thick fog of the early morning and the moment the oracle be out of sight and in bed boswell patter home to record in detail all that he have see and hear it be to he minute record that we owe we only perfect picture of a great man all he vanity as well as he greatness he prejudice superstition and even the detail of he personal appearance : there be the gigantic body the huge face seam with the scar of disease the brown coat the black worsted stocking the gray wig with the scorched foretop the dirty hand the nail bite and pare to the quick we see the eye and mouth move with convulsive twitch we see the heavy form rolling we hear it puffing and then come the why sir and the what then sir and the no sir and the you do not see you way through the question sir -lrb- 196 -rrb- to boswell 's record we be indebted also for we knowledge of those famous conversation those wordy knockdown battle which make johnson famous in he time and which still move we to wonder here be a specimen conversation take almost at random from a hundred such in boswell 's incomparable biography after listen to johnson 's prejudice against scotland and he dogmatic utterance on voltaire robertson and twenty other a unfortunate theorist bring up a recent essay on the possible future life of brute quote some possible authority from the sacred scripture : johnson who do not like to hear anything concern a future state which be not authorize by the regular canon of orthodoxy discourage this talk and be offend at its continuation he watch a opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehension so when the poor speculatist with a serious metaphysical pensive face address he but really sir when we see a very sensible dog we do not know what to think of he johnson roll with joy at the thought which beam in he eye turn quickly round and reply true sir and when we see a very _ foolish fellow _ we do not know what to think of _ he _ he then rise up stride to the fire and stand for some time laugh and exult then the oracle proceed to talk of scorpion and natural history deny fact and demand proof which nobody could possibly furnish : he seem pleased to talk of natural philosophy that woodcock say he fly over the northern country be prove because they have be observe at sea swallow certainly sleep all the winter a number of they conglobulate together by fly round and round and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lie in the bed of a river he tell we one of he first essay be a latin poem upon the glowworm : i be sorry i do not ask where it be to be find then follow a astonishing array of subject and opinion he catalogue library settle affair in china pronounce judgment on man who marry woman superior to themselves flout popular liberty hammer swift unmercifully and add a few miscellaneous oracle most of which be about as reliable as he knowledge of the hibernation of swallow when i call upon dr johnson next morning i find he highly satisfy with he colloquial prowess the precede evening well say he we have good talk yes sir -lrb- say i -rrb- you toss and gore several person far from resent this curious mental dictatorship he auditor never seem to weary they hang upon he word praise he flatter he repeat he judgment all over london the next day and return in the evening hungry for more whenever the conversation begin to flag boswell be like a woman with a parrot or like a man with a dancing bear he must excite the creature make he talk or dance for the edification of the company he sidle obsequiously towards he hero and with utter irrelevancy propound a question of theology a social theory a fashion of dress or marriage a philosophical conundrum : do you think sir that natural affection be bear with we or sir if you be shut up in a castle and a newborn babe with you what would you do then follow more johnsonian law judgment oracle the insatiable audience cluster around he and applaud while boswell listen with shine face and presently go home to write the wonder down it be a astonishing spectacle one do not know whether to laugh or grieve over it but we know the man and the audience almost as well as if we have be there and that unconsciously be the superb art of this matchless biographer when johnson die the opportunity come for which boswell have be watch and wait some twenty year he would shine in the world now not by reflection but by he own luminosity he gather together he endless note and record and begin to write he biography but he do not hurry several biography of johnson appear in the four year after he death without disturbing boswell 's perfect complacency after seven year ' labor he give the world he _ life of johnson _ it be a immortal work praise be superfluous it must be read to be appreciate like the greek sculptor the little slave produce a more enduring work than the great master the man who read it will know johnson as he know no other man who dwell across the border and he will lack sensitiveness indeed if he lay down the work without a greater love and appreciation of all good literature later augustan writer with johnson who succeed dryden and pope in the chief place of english letter the classic movement have largely spend its force and the latter half of the eighteenth century give we a impose array of writer who differ so widely that it be almost impossible to classify they in general three school of writer be noticeable : first the classicist who under johnson 's lead insist upon elegance and regularity of style second the romantic poet like collin gray thomson and burn who revolt from pope 's artificial couplet and write of nature and the human heart -lrb- 197 -rrb- third the early novelist like defoe and fielding who introduce a new type of literature the romantic poet and the novelist be reserve for special chapter and of the other writer -- berkeley and hume in philosophy robertson hume and gibbon in history chesterfield and lady montagu in letter write adam smith in economics pitt burke fox and a score of lesser writer in politics -- we select only two burke and gibbon whose work be most typical of the augustan ie the elegant classic style of prose write edmund burke -lrb- 1729 -- 1797 -rrb- to read all of burke 's collect work and so to understand he thoroughly be something of a task few be equal to it on the other hand to read selection here and there as most of we do be to get a wrong idea of the man and to join either in fulsome praise of he brilliant oratory or in honest confession that he period be ponderous and he idea often bury under johnsonian verbiage such be the contrast to be find on successive page of burke 's twelve volume which cover the enormous range of the political and economic thought of the age and which mingle fact and fancy philosophy statistics and brilliant flight of the imagination to a degree never before see in english literature for burke belong in spirit to the new romantic school while in style he be a model for the formal classicist we can only glance at the life of this marvelous irishman and then consider he place in we literature life burke be bear in dublin the son of a irish barrister in 1729 after he university course in trinity college he come to london to study law but soon give up the idea to follow literature which in turn lead he to politics he have the soul the imagination of a poet and the law be only a clog to he progress he two first work _ a vindication of natural society _ and _ the origin of we idea of the sublime and the beautiful _ bring he political as well as literary recognition and several small office be in turn give to he when thirty-six year old he be elect to parliament as member from wendover and for the next thirty year he be the foremost figure in the house of common and the most eloquent orator which that body have ever know pure and incorruptible in he politics as in he personal life no more learn or devote servant of the commonwealth ever plead for justice and human liberty he be at the summit of he influence at the time when the colony be struggle for independence and the fact that he champion they cause in one of he greatest speech on conciliation with america give he a add interest in the eye of american reader he championship of america be all the more remarkable from the fact that in other matter burke be far from liberal he set himself squarely against the teaching of the romantic writer who be enthusiastic over the french revolution he denounce the principle of the revolutionist break with the liberal whig party to join the tory and be largely instrumental in bring on the terrible war with france which result in the downfall of napoleon it be good to remember that in all the strife and bitterness of party politics burke hold steadily to the noblest personal ideal of truth and honesty and that in all he work whether oppose the slave trade or plead for justice for america or protect the poor native of indium from the greed of corporation or set himself against the popular sympathy for france in she desperate struggle he aim solely at the welfare of humanity when he retire on a pension in 1794 he have win and he deserve the gratitude and affection of the whole nation work there be three distinctly marked period in burke 's career and these correspond closely to the year in which he be busy with the affair of america indium and france successively the first period be one of prophecy he have study the history and temper of the american colony and he warn england of the disaster which must follow she persistence in ignore the american demand and especially the american spirit he great speech on american taxation and on conciliation with america be deliver in 1774 and 1775 precede the declaration of independence in this period burke 's labor seem all in vain he lose he cause and england she greatest colony the second period be one of denunciation rather than of prophecy england have win indium but when burke study the method of she victory and understand the soulless way in which million of poor native be make to serve the interest of a english monopoly he soul rise in revolt and again he be the champion of a oppressed people he two greatest speech of this period be the nabob of arcot 's debt and he tremendous impeachment of warren hasting again he apparently lose he cause though he be still fight on the side of right hasting be acquit and the spoliation of indium go on but the seed of reform be sow and grow and bear fruit long after burke 's labor be end the third period be curiously enough one of reaction whether because the horror of the french revolution have frighten he with the danger of popular liberty or because he own advance in office and power have make he side unconsciously with the upper class be unknown that he be as sincere and noble now as in all he previous life be not question he break with the liberal whig and join force with the reactionary tory he oppose the romantic writer who be on fire with enthusiasm over the french revolution and thunder against the danger which the revolutionary spirit must breed forget that it be a revolution which have make modern england possible here where we must judge he to have be mistake in he cause he succeed for the first time it be due largely to burke 's influence that the grow sympathy for the french people be check in england and war be declare which end in the frightful victory of trafalgar and waterloo burke 's best know work of this period be he _ reflection on the french revolution _ which he polish and revise again essay on and again before it be finally print this ambitious literary essay though it meet with remarkable success be a disappointment to the reader though of celtic blood burke do not understand the french or the principle for which the common people be fight in they own way -lrb- 198 -rrb- and he denunciation and apostrophe to france suggest a preacher without humor hammer away at sinner who be not present in he congregation the essay have few illuminating idea but a great deal of johnsonian rhetoric which make its period tiresome notwithstanding we admiration for the brilliancy of its author more significant be one of burke 's first essay _ a philosophical inquiry into the origin of we idea of the sublime and beautiful _ which be sometimes read in order to show the contrast in style with addison 's _ spectator _ essay on the pleasure of the imagination burke 's best know speech on conciliation with america american taxation and the impeachment of warren hasting be still much study in we school as model of english prose and this fact tend to give they a exaggerated literary importance view purely as literature they have fault enough and the first of these so characteristic of the classic age be that they abound in fine rhetoric but lack simplicity -lrb- 199 -rrb- in a strict sense these eloquent speech be not literature to delight the reader and to suggest idea but study in rhetoric and in mental concentration all this however be on the surface a careful study of any of these three famous speech reveal certain admirable quality which account for the important place they be give in the study of english first as show the stateliness and the rhetorical power of we language these speech be almost unrivaled second though burke speak in prose he be essentially a poet whose imagery like that of milton 's prose work be more remarkable than that of many of we writer of verse he speak in figure image symbol and the musical cadence of he sentence reflect the influence of he wide reading of poetry not only in figurative expression but much more in spirit he belong with the poet of the revival at time he language be pseudo-classic reflect the influence of johnson and he school but he thought be always romantic he be govern by ideal rather than by practical interest and a profound sympathy for humanity be perhaps he most marked characteristic third the supreme object of these oration so different from the majority of political speech be not to win approval or to gain vote but to establish the truth like we own lincoln burke have a superb faith in the compelling power of the truth a faith in man also who if the history of we race mean anything will not willingly follow a lie the method of these two great leader be strikingly similar in this respect that each repeat he idea in many way present the truth from different view point so that it will appeal to man of widely different experience otherwise the two man be in marked contrast the uneducated lincoln speak in simple homely word draw he illustration from the farm and often add a humorous story so apt and tell that he hearer can never forget the point of he argument the scholarly burke speak in ornate majestic period and search all history and all literature for he illustration he wealth of imagery and allusion together with he rare combination of poetic and logical reasoning make these oration remarkable entirely apart from they subject and purpose fourth -lrb- and perhaps most significant of the man and he work -rrb- burke take he stand squarely upon the principle of justice he have study history and he find that to establish justice between man and man and between nation and nation have be the supreme object of every reformer since the world begin no small or merely temporary success attract he only the truth will suffice for a argument and nothing less than justice will ever settle a question permanently such be he platform simple as the golden rule unshakable as the moral law hence though he apparently fail of he immediate desire in each of these three oration the principle for which he contend can not fail as a modern writer say of lincoln the full rich flood of he life through the nation 's pulse be yet beat and he word be still potent in shape the course of english politics in the way of justice edward gibbon -lrb- 1737-1794 -rrb- to understand burke or johnson one must read a multitude of book and be wary in he judgment but with gibbon the task be comparatively easy for one have only to consider two book he _ memoirs _ and the first volume of he _ history _ to understand the author in he _ memoirs _ we have a interesting reflection of gibbon 's own personality -- a man who look with satisfaction on the material side of thing who seek always the easiest path for himself and avoid life 's difficulty and responsibility i sigh as a lover but i obey as a son he say when to save he inheritance he give up the woman he love and come home to enjoy the paternal loaf and fish that be suggestive of the man 's whole life he _ history _ on the other hand be a remarkable work it be the first in we language to be write on scientific principle and with a solid basis of fact and the style be the very climax of that classicism which have rule england for a entire century its combination of historical fact and literary style make _ the decline and fall of the roman empire _ the one thing of gibbon 's life that be worthy to be remembered gibbon 's history for many year gibbon have meditate like milton upon a immortal work and have try several historical subject only to give they up idly in he _ journal _ he tell we how he vague resolution be bring to a focus : it be at rome on the fifteenth of October 1764 as i sit muse amidst the ruin of the capitol while the barefooted friar be sing vespers in the temple of jupiter that the idea of write the decline and fall of the city first start to my mind twelve year later in 1776 gibbon publish the first volume of _ the decline and fall of the roman empire _ and the enormous success of the work encourage he to go on with the other five volume which be publish at interval during the next twelve year the history begin with the reign of trajan in ad 98 and build a straight roman road through the confused history of thirteen century end with the fall of the byzantine empire in 1453 the scope of the history be enormous it include not only the decline of the roman empire but such movement as the descent of the northern barbarian the spread of christianity the reorganization of the european nation the establishment of the great eastern empire the rise of mohammedanism and the splendor of the crusade on the one hand it lack philosophical insight be satisfy with fact without comprehend the cause and as gibbon seem lack in ability to understand spiritual and religious movement it be utterly inadequate in its treatment of the tremendous influence of christianity on the other hand gibbon 's scholarship leave little to criticise he read enormously sift he fact out of multitude of book and record and then marshal they in the impose array with which we have grow familiar moreover he be singularly just and discriminate in the use of all document and authority at he command hence he have give we the first history in english that have bear successfully the test of modern research and scholarship the style of the work be as impose as he great subject indeed with almost any other subject the sonorous roll of he majestic sentence would be out of place while it deserve all the adjective that have be apply to it by enthusiastic admirer -- finish elegant splendid round massive sonorous copious elaborate ornate exhaustive -- it must be confess though one whisper the confession that the style sometimes obscure we interest in the narrative as he sift he fact from a multitude of source so he often hide they again in endless period and one must often sift they out again in order to be quite sure of even the simple fact another drawback be that gibbon be hopelessly worldly in he point of view he love pageant and crowd rather than individual and he be lack in enthusiasm and in spiritual insight the result be so frankly material at time that one wonder if he be not reading of force or machine rather than of human being a little reading of he history here and there be a excellent thing leave one impressed with the elegant classical style and the scholarship but a continued reading be very apt to leave we longing for simplicity for naturalness and above all for the glow of enthusiasm which make the dead hero live once more in the write page this judgment however must not obscure the fact that the book have a remarkably large sale and that this of itself be a evidence that multitude of reader find it not only erudite but readable and interesting ii the revival of romantic poetry the old order changeth yield place to new and god fulfil himself in many way lest one good custom should corrupt the world tennyson 's the passing of arthur the meaning of romanticism while dryden pope and johnson be successively the dictator of english letter and while under they leadership the heroic couplet become the fashion of poetry and literature in general become satiric or critical in spirit and formal in expression a new romantic movement quietly make its appearance thomson 's _ the season _ -lrb- 1730 -rrb- be the first noteworthy poem of the romantic revival and the poem and the poet increase steadily in number and importance till in the age of wordsworth and scott the spirit of romanticism dominate we literature more completely than classicism have ever do this romantic movement -- which victor hugo call liberalism in literature -- be simply the expression of life as see by imagination rather than by prosaic common sense which be the central doctrine of english philosophy in the eighteenth century it have six prominent characteristic which distinguish it from the so-called classic literature which we have just study : 1 the romantic movement be marked and be always mark by a strong reaction and protest against the bondage of rule and custom which in science and theology as well as in literature generally tend to fetter the free human spirit 2 romanticism return to nature and to plain humanity for its material and so be in marked contrast to classicism which have confine itself largely to the club and drawing-room and to the social and political life of london thomson 's _ season _ whatever its defect be a revelation of the natural wealth and beauty which for nearly a century have be hardly notice by the great writer of england 3 it bring again the dream of a golden age -lrb- 200 -rrb- in which the stern reality of life be forget and the ideal of youth be establish as the only permanent reality for the dreamer live forever but the toiler die in a day express perhaps only the wild fancy of a modern poet but when we think of it seriously the dream and ideal of a people be cherish possession long after they stone monument have crumble away and they battle be forget the romantic movement emphasize these eternal ideal of youth and appeal to the human heart as the classic elegance of dryden and pope could never do 4 romanticism be mark by intense human sympathy and by a consequent understanding of the human heart not to intellect or to science do the heart unlock its treasure but rather to the touch of a sympathetic nature and thing that be hide from the wise and prudent be reveal unto child pope have no appreciable humanity swift 's work be a frightful satire addison delighted polite society but have no message for plain people while even johnson with all he kindness have no feeling for man in the mass but support sir robert walpole in he policy of let evil alone until force by a revolution to take notice of humanity 's appeal with the romantic revival all this be change while howard be work heroically for prison reform and wilberforce for the liberation of the slave gray write he short and simple annals of the poor and goldsmith he _ desert village _ and cowper sing my ear be pained my soul be sick with every day 's report of wrong and outrage with which earth be fill there be no flesh in man 's obdurate heart it do not feel for man -lrb- 201 -rrb- this sympathy for the poor and this cry against oppression grow stronger and stronger till it culminate in bobby burn who more than any other writer in any language be the poet of the unlettered human heart 5 the romantic movement be the expression of individual genius rather than of established rule in consequence the literature of the revival be as vary as the character and mood of the different writer when we read pope for instance we have a general impression of sameness as if all he polished poem be make in the same machine but in the work of the best romanticist there be endless variety to read they be like pass through a new village meet a score of different human type and finding in each one something to love or to remember nature and the heart of man be as new as if we have never study they hence in read the romanticist who go to these source for they material we be seldom wearied but often surprised and the surprise be like that of the sunrise or the sea which always offer some new beauty and stir we deeply as if we have never see it before 6 the romantic movement while it follow its own genius be not altogether unguided strictly speak there be no new movement either in history or in literature each grow out of some good thing which have precede it and look back with reverence to past master spenser shakespeare and milton be the inspiration of the romantic revival and we can hardly read a poem of the early romanticist without find a suggestion of the influence of one of these great leader -lrb- 202 -rrb- there be various other characteristic of romanticism but these six -- the protest against the bondage of rule the return to nature and the human heart the interest in old saga and mediæval romance as suggestive of a heroic age the sympathy for the toiler of the world the emphasis upon individual genius and the return to milton and the elizabethan instead of to pope and dryden for literary model -- be the most noticeable and the most interesting remember they we shall better appreciate the work of the follow writer who in vary degree illustrate the revival of romantic poetry in the eighteenth century thoma gray -lrb- 1716-1771 -rrb- the curfew toll the knell of parting day the low herd wind slowly o'er the lea the plowman homeward plod he weary way and leave the world to darkness and to I now fade the glimmer landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness hold save where the beetle wheel he drone flight and drowsy tinkling lull the distant fold so begin the best know poem in the english language a poem full of the gentle melancholy which mark all early romantic poetry it should be read entire as a perfect model of its kind not even milton 's il penseroso which it strongly suggest excel it in beauty and suggestiveness life of gray the author of the famous elegy be the most scholarly and well-balanced of all the early romantic poet in he youth he be a weakling the only one of twelve child who survive infancy and he unhappy childhood the tyranny of he father and the separation from he loved mother give to he whole life the stamp of melancholy which be noticeable in all he poem at the famous eton school and again at cambridge he seem to have follow he own scholarly taste rather than the curriculum and be shock like gibbon at the general idleness and aimlessness of university life one happy result of he school life be he friendship for horace walpole who take he abroad for a three year ' tour of the continent no better index of the essential difference between the classical and the new romantic school can be imagine than that which be reveal in the letter of gray and addison as they record they impression of foreign travel thus when addison cross the alp some twenty-five year before in good weather he write : a very troublesome journey you can not imagine how i be please with the sight of a plain gray cross the alp in the beginning of winter wrap in muff hood and mask of beaver fur boot and bearskin but write ecstatically not a precipice not a torrent not a cliff but be pregnant with religion and poetry on he return to england gray live for a short time at stoke poge where he write he ode on eton and probably sketch he elegy which however be not finish till 1750 eight year later during the latter year of he shy and scholarly life he be professor of modern history and language at cambridge without any troublesome work of lecture to student here he give himself up to study and to poetry vary he work by prowling among the manuscript of the new british museum and by he lilliputian travels in england and scotland he die in he room at pembroke college in 1771 and be bury in the little churchyard of stoke poge work of gray gray 's _ letter _ publish in 1775 be excellent reading and he _ journal _ be still a model of natural description but it be to a single small volume of poem that he owe he fame and he place in literature these poem divide themselves naturally into three period in which we may trace the progress of gray 's emancipation from the classic rule which have so long govern english literature in the first period he write several minor poem of which the best be he hymn to adversity and the ode to spring and on a distant prospect of eton college these early poem reveal two suggestive thing : first the appearance of that melancholy which characterize all the poetry of the period and second the study of nature not for its own beauty or truth but rather as a suitable background for the play of human emotion the second period show the same tendency more strongly develop the elegy write in a country churchyard -lrb- 1750 -rrb- the most perfect poem of the age belong to this period to read milton 's il penseroso and gray 's elegy be to see the beginning and the perfection of that literature of melancholy which largely occupy english poet for more than a century two other well-known poem of this second period be the pindaric ode the progress of poesy and the bard the first be strongly suggestive of dryden 's alexander 's feast but show milton 's influence in a greater melody and variety of expression the bard be in every way more romantic and original a old minstrel the last of the welsh singer halt king edward and he army in a wild mountain pass and with fine poetic frenzy prophesy the terror and desolation which must ever follow the tyrant from its first line ruin seize thee ruthless king to the end when the old bard plunge from he lofty crag and disappear in the river 's flood the poem thrill with the fire of a ancient and noble race of man it break absolutely with the classical school and proclaim a literary declaration of independence in the third period gray turn momentarily from he welsh material and reveal a new field of romantic interest in two norse poem the fatal sister and the descent of odin -lrb- 1761 -rrb- gray translate he material from the latin and though these two poem lack much of the elemental strength and grandeur of the norse saga they be remarkable for call attention to the unused wealth of literary material that be hide in northern mythologv to gray and to percy -lrb- who publish he _ northern antiquity _ in 1770 -rrb- be due in large measure the profound interest in the old norse saga which have continue to we own day take together gray 's work form a most interesting commentary on the varied life of the eighteenth century he be a scholar familiar with all the intellectual interest of he age and he work have much of the precision and polish of the classical school but he share also the reawaken interest in nature in common man and in mediæval culture and he work be generally romantic both in style and in spirit the same conflict between the classic and romantic school and the triumph of romanticism be show clearly in the most versatile of gray 's contemporary oliver goldsmith oliver goldsmith -lrb- 1728-1774 -rrb- because _ the desert village _ be one of the most familiar poem in we language goldsmith be generally give a high place among the poet of the romantic dawn but the _ village _ when we read it carefully turn out to be a rimed essay in the style of pope 's famous _ essay on man _ it owe its popularity to the sympathetic memory which it awaken rather than to its poetic excellence it be as a prose writer that goldsmith excel he be a essayist with addison 's fine polish but with more sympathy for human life he be a dramatist one of the very few who have ever write a comedy that can keep its popularity unchanged while a century roll over its head but greater perhaps than the poet and essayist and dramatist be goldsmith the novelist who set himself to the important work of purify the early novel of its brutal and indecent tendency and who have give we in _ the vicar of wakefield _ one of the most enduring character in english fiction in he manner especially in he poetry goldsmith be too much influence by he friend johnson and the classicist but in he matter in he sympathy for nature and human life he belong unmistakably to the new romantic school altogether he be the most versatile the most charming the most inconsistent and the most lovable genius of all the literary man who make famous the age of johnson life goldsmith 's career be that of a irresponsible unbalanced genius which would make one despair if the man himself do not remain so lovable in all he inconsistency he be bear in the village of palla ireland the son of a poor irish curate whose noble character be portray in dr primrose of _ the vicar of wakefield _ and in the country parson of _ the desert village _ after a unsatisfactory course in various school where he be regard as hopelessly stupid goldsmith enter trinity college dublin as a sizar ie a student who pay with labor for he tuition by he escapade he be bring into disfavor with the authority but that trouble he little he be also wretchedly poor which trouble he less for when he earn a few shilling by write ballad for street singer he money go oftener to idle beggar than to the pay of he honest debt after three year of university life he run away in dime-novel fashion and nearly starve to death before he be find and bring back in disgrace then he work a little and obtain he degree in 1749 strange that such a idle and irresponsible youth should have be urge by he family to take holy order but such be the fact for two year more goldsmith labor with theology only to be reject when he present himself as a candidate for the ministry he try teach and fail then he fancy turn to america and provide with money and a good horse he start off for cork where he be to embark for the new world he loaf along the pleasant irish way miss he ship and presently turn up cheerfully amongst he relative minus all he money and ride a sorry nag call fiddleback for which he have trade he own on the way -lrb- 203 -rrb- he borrow fifty pound more and start for london to study law but speedily lose he money at card and again appear amiable and irresponsible as ever among he despairing relative the next year they send he to edinburgh to study medicine here for a couple of year he become popular as a singer of song and a teller of tale to whom medicine be only a troublesome affliction suddenly the _ wanderlust _ seize he and he start abroad ostensibly to complete he medical education but in reality to wander like a cheerful beggar over europe singing and play he flute for food and lodging he may have study a little at leyden and at padua but that be only incidental after a year or more of vagabondage he return to london with a alleged medical degree say to have be obtain at louvain or padua the next few year be a pitiful struggle to make a living as tutor apothecary 's assistant comedian usher in a country school and finally as a physician in southwark gradually he drift into literature and live from hand to mouth by do hack work for the london bookseller some of he essay and he _ citizen of the world _ -lrb- 1760-1761 -rrb- bring he to the attention of johnson who look he up be attract first by he poverty and then by he genius and presently declare he to be one of the first man we now have as a author johnson 's friendship prove invaluable and presently goldsmith find himself a member of the exclusive literary club he promptly justified johnson 's confidence by publish _ the traveller _ -lrb- 1764 -rrb- which be hail as one of the finest poem of the century money now come to he liberally with order from the bookseller he take new quarter in fleet street and furnish they gorgeously but he have a inordinate vanity for bright-colored clothes and faster than he earn money he spend it on velvet cloak and in indiscriminate charity for a time he resume he practice as a physician but he fine clothes do not bring patient as he expect and presently he turn to write again to pay he debt to the bookseller he produce several superficial and grossly inaccurate schoolbook -- like he _ animated nature _ and he history of england greece and rome -- which bring he bread and more fine clothes and he _ vicar of wakefield the desert village _ and _ she stoop to conquer _ which bring he undying fame after meet with johnson goldsmith become the object of boswell 's magpie curiosity and to boswell 's _ life of johnson _ we be indebted for many of the detail of goldsmith 's life -- he homeliness he awkward way he drollery and absurdity which make he alternately the butt and the wit of the famous literary club boswell dislike goldsmith and so draw a unflattering portrait but even this do not disguise the contagious good humor which make man love he when in he forty-seventh year he fall sick of a fever and with childish confidence turn to a quack medicine to cure himself he die in 1774 and johnson place a tablet with a sonorous latin epitaph in westminster abbey though goldsmith be bury elsewhere let not he frailty be remember he be a very great man say johnson and the literary world -- which like that old dictator be kind enough at heart though often rough in its method -- be glad to accept and record the verdict work of goldsmith of goldsmith 's early essay and he later school history little need be say they have settle into they own place far out of sight of the ordinary reader perhaps the most interesting of these be a series of letter for the _ public ledger _ -lrb- afterwards publish as _ the citizen of the world _ -rrb- write from the view point of a alleged chinese traveler and give the latter 's comment on english civilization -lrb- 204 -rrb- the follow five work be those upon which goldsmith 's fame chiefly rest : _ the traveller _ -lrb- 1764 -rrb- make goldsmith 's reputation among he contemporary but be now seldom read except by student who would understand how goldsmith be at one time dominate by johnson and he pseudo-classic ideal it be a long poem in rimed couplet give a survey and criticism of the social life of various country in europe and reflect many of goldsmith 's own wanderings and impression _ the desert village _ -lrb- 1770 -rrb- though write in the same mechanical style be so permeate with honest human sympathy and voice so perfectly the revolt of the individual man against institution that a multitude of common people hear it gladly without consult the critic as to whether they should call it good poetry notwithstanding its fault to which matthew arnold have call sufficient attention it have become one of we best know poem though we can not help wish that the monotony of its couplet have be break by some of the irish folk song and ballad that charm street audience in dublin and that bring goldsmith a welcome from the french peasant wherever he stop to sing in the village parson and the schoolmaster goldsmith have increase chaucer 's list by two lovable character that will endure as long as the english language the criticism that the picture of prosperous sweet auburn never apply to any village in ireland be just no doubt but it be outside the question goldsmith be a hopeless dreamer bind to see everything as he see he debt and he gay clothes in a purely idealistic way _ the good-natured man _ and _ she stoop to conquer _ be goldsmith 's two comedy the former a comedy of character though it have some laughable scene and one laughable character croaker meet with failure on the stage and have never be revive with any success the latter a comedy of intrigue be one of the few play that have never lose its popularity its lively bustling scene and its pleasantly absurd character marlowe the hardcastle and tony lumpkin still hold the attention of modern theater goer and nearly every amateur dramatic club sooner or later place _ she stoop to conquer _ on its list of attraction _ the vicar of wakefield _ be goldsmith 's only novel and the first in any language that give to home life a enduring romantic interest however much we admire the beginning of the english novel to which we shall presently refer we be nevertheless shock by its frequent brutality and indecency goldsmith like steele have the irish reverence for pure womanhood and this reverence make he shun as a pest the vulgarity and coarseness in which contemporary novelist like smollett and sterne seem to delight so he do for the novel what addison and steele have do for the satire and the essay he refine and elevate it make it worthy of the old anglo-saxon ideal which be we best literary heritage briefly _ the vicar of wakefield _ be the story of a simple english clergyman dr primrose and he family who pass from happiness through great tribulation misfortune which be say never to come singly appear in this case in flock but through poverty sorrow imprisonment and the unspeakable loss of he daughter the vicar 's faith in god and man emerge triumphant to the very end he be like one of the old martyr who sing _ alleluium _ while the lion roar about he and he child in the arena goldsmith 's optimism it must be confess be here stretch to the breaking point the reader be sometimes offer fine johnsonian phrase where he would naturally expect homely and vigorous language and he be continually haunt by the suspicion that even in this best of all possible world the vicar 's cloud of affliction be somewhat too easily convert into shower of blessing yet he be force to read on and at the end he confess gladly that goldsmith have succeed in make a most interesting story out of material that in other hand would have develop either a burlesque or a brutal tragedy lay aside all romantic passion intrigue and adventure upon which other novelist depend goldsmith in this simple story of common life have accomplish three noteworthy result : he have make human fatherhood almost a divine thing he have glorify the moral sentiment which cluster about the family life as the center of civilization and he have give we in dr primrose a striking and enduring figure which seem more like a personal acquaintance than a character in a book william cowper -lrb- 1731 -- 1800 -rrb- in cowper we have another interesting poet who like gray and goldsmith show the struggle between romantic and classic ideal in he first volume of poem cowper be more hamper by literary fashion than be goldsmith in he _ traveller _ and he _ desert village _ in he second period however cowper use blank verse freely and he delight in nature and in homely character like the teamster and the mail carrier of _ the task _ show that he classicism be be rapidly thaw out by romantic feeling in he later work especially he immortal john gilpin cowper fling fashion aside give pegasus the rein take to the open road and so prove himself a worthy predecessor of burn who be the most spontaneous and the most interesting of all the early romanticist life cowper 's life be a pathetic story of a shy and timid genius who find the world of man too rough and who withdraw to nature like a wounded animal he be bear at great berkhamstead hertfordshire in 1731 the son of a english clergyman he be a delicate sensitive child whose early life be sadden by the death of he mother and by he neglect at home at six year he be send away to a boy ' school where he be terrify by young barbarian who make he life miserable there be one atrocious bully into whose face cowper could never look he recognize he enemy by he shoe buckle and shiver at he approach the fierce invective of he tirocinium or a review of school -lrb- 1784 -rrb- show how these school experience have affect he mind and health for twelve year he study law but at the approach of a public examination for a office he be so terrify that he attempt suicide the experience unsettle he reason and the next twelve month be spend in a asylum at st alban 's the death of he father in 1756 have bring the poet a small patrimony which place he above the necessity of struggle like goldsmith for he daily bread upon he recovery he board for year at the house of the unwin culture people who recognize the genius hide in this shy and melancholy yet quaintly humorous man mr unwin in particular care for he as a son and whatever happiness he experience in he poor life be the result of the devotion of this good woman who be the mary of all he poem a second attack of insanity be bring on by cowper 's morbid interest in religion influence perhaps by the untempered zeal of one john newton a curate with whom cowper work in the small parish of olney and with whom he compile the famous olney hymn the rest of he life between interval of melancholia or insanity be spend in gardening in the care of he numerous pet and in write he poem he translation of homer and he charming letter he two best know poem be suggest by a lively and cultivate widow lady austen who tell he the story of john gilpin and call for a ballad on the subject she also urge he to write a long poem in blank verse and when he demand a subject she whimsically suggest the sofa which be a new article of furniture at that time cowper immediately write the sofa and influence by the poetic possibility that lie in unexpected place he add to this poem from time to time and call he complete work _ the task _ this be publish in 1785 and the author be instantly recognize as one of the chief poet of he age the last year of he life be a long battle with insanity until death mercifully end the struggle in 1800 he last poem the castaway be a cry of despair in which under guise of a man wash overboard in a storm he describe himself perish in the sight of friend who be powerless to help cowper 's work cowper 's first volume of poem contain the progress of error truth table talk etc be interesting chiefly as show how the poet be bind by the classical rule of he age these poem be dreary on the whole but a certain gentleness and especially a vein of pure humor occasionally reward the reader for cowper be a humorist and only the constant shadow of insanity keep he from become famous in that line alone _ the task _ write in blank verse and publish in 1785 be cowper 's longest poem use as we be to the natural poetry of wordsworth and tennyson it be hard for we to appreciate the striking originality of this work much of it be conventional and wooden to be sure like much of wordsworth 's poetry but when after read the rimed essay and the artificial couplet of johnson 's age we turn suddenly to cowper 's description of homely scene of wood and brook of plowman and teamster and the letter carrier on he round we realize that we be at the dawn of a better day in poetry : he come the herald of a noisy world with spatter would boot strapp would waist and frozen lock : news from all nation lumber at he back true to he charge the close-packed load behind yet careless what he bring he one concern be to conduct it to the destine inn and have drop the expect bag pass on he whistle as he go light-hearted wretch cold and yet cheerful : messenger of grief perhaps to thousand and of joy to some to he indifferent whether grief or joy house in ash and the fall of stock birth death and marriage epistle wet with tear that trickle down the writer 's cheek fast as the period from he fluent quill or charge with amorous sigh of absent swain or nymph responsive equally affect he horse and he unconscious of they all cowper 's most laborious work the translation of homer in blank verse be publish in 1791 its stately milton-like movement and its better rendering of the greek make this translation far superior to pope 's artificial couplet it be also better in many respects than chapman 's more famous and more fanciful rendering but for some reason it be not successful and have never receive the recognition which it deserve entirely different in spirit be the poet 's numerous hymn which be publish in the olney collection in 1779 and which be still use in we church it be only necessary to mention a few first line -- god move in a mysterious way oh for a closer walk with god sometimes a light surprise -- to show how he gentle and devout spirit have leave its impress upon thousand who now hardly know he name with cowper 's charming _ letter _ publish in 1803 we reach the end of he important work and the student who enjoy reading letter will find that these rank among the best of they kind it be not however for he ambitious work that cowper be remembered but rather for he minor poem which have find they own way into so many home among these the one that bring quickest response from heart that understand be he little poem on the receipt of my mother 's picture beginning with the striking line oh that those lip have language another call alexander selkirk begin i be monarch of all i survey suggest how selkirk 's experience as a castaway -lrb- which give defoe he inspiration for _ robinson crusoe _ -rrb- affect the poet 's timid nature and imagination last and most famous of all be he immortal john gilpin cowper be in a terrible fit of melancholy when lady austen tell he the story which prove to be better than medicine for all night long chuckle and suppress laughter be hear in the poet 's bedroom next morning at breakfast he recite the ballad that have afford its author so much delight in the make the student should read it even if he read nothing else by cowper and he will be lack in humor or appreciation if he be not ready to echo heartily the last stanza : now let we sing long live the king and gilpin long live he and when he next doth ride abroad may i be there to see robert burn -lrb- 1759-1796 -rrb- after a century and more of classicism we note with interest the work of three man gray goldsmith and cowper whose poetry like the chorus of awaken bird suggest the dawn of another day two other poet of the same age suggest the sunrise the first be the plowman burn who speak straight from the heart to the primitive emotion of the race the second be the mystic blake who only half understand he own thought and whose word stir a sensitive nature as music do or the moon in midheaven rousing in the soul those vague desire and aspiration which ordinarily sleep and which can never be express because they have no name blake live he shy mystic spiritual life in the crowded city and he message be to the few who can understand burn live he sad toilsome err life in the open air with the sun and the rain and he song touch all the world the latter 's poetry so far as it have a philosophy rest upon two principle which the classic school never understand -- that common people be at heart romantic and lover of the ideal and that simple human emotion furnish the element of true poetry largely because he follow these two principle burn be probably the greatest song writer of the world he poetic creed may be sum up in one of he own stanza : give I ae spark o ' nature 's fire that be a ' the learning i desire then though i trudge thro ' dub a ' mire at pleugh or cart my muse though hamely in attire may touch the heart life -lrb- 205 -rrb- burn 's life be a life of fragment as carlyle call it and the different fragment be as unlike as the noble cotter 's Saturday night and the rant and riot of the jolly beggar the detail of this sad and disjointed life be better perhaps forget we call attention only to the fact which help we to understand the man and he poetry burn be bear in a clay cottage at alloway scotland in the bleak winter of 1759 he father be a excellent type of the scotch peasant of those day -- a poor honest god-fearing man who toil from dawn till dark to wrest a living for he family from the stubborn soil he tall figure be bent with unceasing labor he hair be thin and gray and in he eye be the careworn hunt look of a peasant drive by poverty and unpaid rent from one poor farm to another the family often fast of necessity and live in solitude to avoid the temptation of spend they hard-earned money the child go barefoot and barehead in all weather and share the parent ' toil and they anxiety over the rent at thirteen bobby the eldest be do a peasant 's full day 's labor at sixteen he be chief laborer on he father 's farm and he describe the life as the cheerless gloom of a hermit and the unceasing moil of a galley slave in 1784 the father after a lifetime of toil be save from a debtor 's prison by consumption and death to rescue something from the wreck of the home and to win a poor chance of bread for the family the two older boy set up a claim for arrears of wages that have never be pay with the small sum allow they they bury they father take another farm mossgiel in mauchline and begin again the long struggle with poverty such in outline be burn 's own story of he early life take mostly from he letter there be another and more please side to the picture of which we have glimpse in he poem and in he common-place book here we see the boy at school for like most scotch peasant the father give he boy the best education he possibly could we see he follow the plow not like a slave but like a free man croon over a old scotch song and make a better one to match the melody we see he stop the plow to listen to what the wind be say or turn aside lest he disturb the bird at they singing and nest making at supper we see the family about the table happy notwithstanding they scant fare each child with a spoon in one hand and a book in the other we hear betty davidson recite from she great store some heroic ballad that fire the young heart to enthusiasm and make they forget the day 's toil and in the cotter 's Saturday night we have a glimpse of scotch peasant life that make we almost reverence these heroic man and woman who keep they faith and they self-respect in the face of poverty and whose heart under they rough exterior be tender and true as steel a most unfortunate change in burn 's life begin when he leave the farm at seventeen and go to kirkoswald to study survey the town be the haunt of smuggler rough-live hard-drinking man and burn speedily find he way into those scene of riot and roar dissipation which be he bane ever afterwards for a little while he study diligently but one day while take the altitude of the sun he see a pretty girl in the neighbor garden and love put trigonometry to flight soon he give up he work and wander back to the farm and poverty again when twenty-seven year of age burn first attract literary attention and in the same moment spring to the first place in scottish letter in despair over he poverty and personal habit he resolve to emigrate to jamaica and gather together a few of he early poem hope to sell they for enough to pay the expense of he journey the result be the famous kilmarnock edition of burn publish in 1786 for which he be offer twenty pound it be say that he even buy he ticket and on the night before the ship sail write he farewell to scotland begin the gloomy night be gather fast which he intend to be he last song on scottish soil in the morning he change he mind lead partly by some dim foreshadowing of the result of he literary adventure for the little book take all scotland by storm not only scholar and literary man but even plowboy and maid servant say a contemporary eagerly spend they hard-earned shilling for the new book instead of go to jamaica the young poet hurry to edinburgh to arrange for another edition of he work he journey be a constant ovation and in the capital he be welcome and feast by the best of scottish society this inexpected triumph last only one winter burn 's fondness for tavern and riotous living shock he culture entertainer and when he return to edinburgh next winter after a pleasure jaunt through the highland he receive scant attention he leave the city in anger and disappointment and go back to the soil where he be more at home the last few year of burn 's life be a sad tragedy and we pass over they hurriedly he buy the farm ellisland dumfriesshire and marry the faithful jean armor in 1788 that he could write of she i see she in the dewy flower i see she sweet and fair i hear she in the tunefu ' bird i hear she charm the air : there be not a bonie flower that spring by fountain shaw or green there be not a bonie bird that sing but mind I o ' my jean be enough for we to remember the next year he be appoint exciseman ie collector of liquor revenue and the small salary with the return from he poem would have be sufficient to keep he family in modest comfort have he but keep away from tavern for a few year he life of alternate toil and dissipation be occasionally illumine by he splendid lyric genius and he produce many song -- bonnie doon my love 's like a red red rise auld lang syne highland mary and the soul-stirring scot wha ha compose while gallop over the moor in a storm -- which have make the name of burn know wherever the english language be speak and honor wherever scotchman gather together he die miserably in 1796 when only thirty-seven year old he last letter be a appeal to a friend for money to stave off the bailiff and one of he last poem a tribute to jessie lewar a kind lassie who help to care for he in he illness this last exquisite lyric o wert thou in the cauld blast set to mendelssohn 's music be one of we best know song though its history be seldom suspect by those who sing it the poetry of burn the publication of the kilmarnock burn with the title _ poem chiefly in the scottish dialect _ -lrb- 1786 -rrb- mark a epoch in the history of english literature like the publication of spenser 's _ shepherd 's calendar _ after a century of cold and formal poetry relieve only by the romanticism of gray and cowper these fresh inspired song go straight to the heart like the music of return bird in springtime it be a little volume but a great book and we think of marlowe 's line infinite riches in a little room in connection with it such poem as the cotter 's Saturday night to a mouse to mountain daisy man be make to mourn the twa dog address to the deil and halloween suggest that the whole spirit of the romantic revival be embody in this obscure plowman love humor patho the response to nature -- all the poetic quality that touch the human heart be here and the heart be touch as it have not be since the day of elizabeth if the reader will note again the six characteristic of the romantic movement and then read six poem of burn he will see at once how perfectly this one man express the new idea or take a single suggestion -- ae fond kiss and then we sever ae farewell and then forever deep in heart-wrung tear i 'll pledge thee war sigh and groan i 'll wage thee who shall say that fortune grieve he while the star of hope she leave he I nae cheerfu ' twinkle light I dark despair around benight I i 'll ne'er blame my partial fancy naething could resist my nancy but to see she be to love she love but she and love forever have we never lov would sae kindly have we never lov would sae blindly never meet -- or never part -- we have ne'er be broken-hearted the essence of a thousand love tale be in that one little song because he embody the new spirit of romanticism critic give he a high place in the history of we literature and because he song go straight to the heart he be the poet of common man of burn 's many song for music little need be say they have find they way into the heart of a whole people and there they speak for themselves they range from the exquisite o wert thou in the cauld blast to the tremendous appeal to scottish patriotism in scot wha ha wus ' wallace bleed which carlyle say should be sing with the throat of the whirlwind many of these song be compose in he best day when follow the plow or rest after he work while the music of some old scotch song be ring in he head it be largely because he think of music while he compose that so many of he poem have the singing quality suggest a melody as we read they among he poem of nature to a mouse and to a mountain daisy be unquestionably the best suggest the poetical possibility that daily pass unnoticed under we foot these two poem be as near as burn ever come to appreciate nature for its own sake the majority of he poem like winter and ye bank and brae o ' bonie doon regard nature in the same way that gray regard it as a background for the play of human emotion of he poem of emotion there be a immense number it be a curious fact that the world be always laugh and cry at the same moment and we can hardly read a page of burn without find this natural juxtaposition of smile and tear it be noteworthy also that all strong emotion when express naturally lend themselves to poetry and burn more than any other writer have a astonishing faculty of describe he own emotion with vividness and simplicity so that they appeal instantly to we own one can not read i love my jean for instance without be in love with some idealized woman or to mary in heaven without share the personal grief of one who have love and lose besides the song of nature and of human emotion burn have give we a large number of poem for which no general title can be give noteworthy among these be a man 's a man for a ' that which voice the new romantic estimate of humanity the vision from which we get a strong impression of burn 's early ideal the epistle to a young friend from which rather than from he satire we learn burn 's personal view of religion and honor the address to the unco guid which be the poet 's plea for mercy in judgment and a bard 's epitaph which as a summary of he own life might well be write at the end of he poem halloween a picture of rustic merrymaking and the twa dog a contrast between the rich and poor be generally class among the poet 's best work but one unfamiliar with the scotch dialect will find they rather difficult of burn 's longer poem the two best worth reading be the cotter 's Saturday night and tam o ' shanter -- the one give the most perfect picture we possess of a noble poverty the other be the most lively and the least objectionable of he humorous work it would be difficult to find elsewhere such a combination of the grewsome and the ridiculous as be pack up in tam o ' shanter with the exception of these two the longer poem add little to the author 's fame or to we own enjoyment it be better for the beginner to read burn 's exquisite song and gladly to recognize he place in the heart of a people and forget the rest since they only sadden we and obscure the poet 's better nature william blake -lrb- 1757-1827 -rrb- pipe down the valley wild piping song of pleasant glee on a cloud i see a child and he laugh say to I : pipe a song about a lamb so i pipe with merry cheer piper pipe that song again so i pipe : he weep to hear piper sit thee down and write in a book that all may read so he vanish from my sight and i pluck a hollow reed and i make a rural pen and i stain the water clear and i write my happy song every child may joy to hear -lrb- 206 -rrb- of all the romantic poet of the eighteenth century blake be the most independent and the most original in he earliest work write when he be scarcely more than a child he seem to go back to the elizabethan song writer for he model but for the greater part of he life he be the poet of inspiration alone follow no man 's lead and obey no voice but that which he hear in he own mystic soul though the most extraordinary literary genius of he age he have practically no influence upon it indeed we hardly yet understand this poet of pure fancy this mystic this transcendental madman who remain to the end of he busy life a incomprehensible child life blake the son of a london tradesman be a strange imaginative child whose soul be more at home with brook and flower and fairy than with the crowd of the city street beyond learn to read and write he receive education but he begin at ten year to copy print and to write verse he also begin a long course of art study which result in he publish he own book adorn with marginal engraving color by hand -- a unusual setting worthy of the strong artistic sense that show itself in many of he early verse as a child he have vision of god and the angel look in at he window and as a man he think he receive visit from the soul of the great dead mose virgil homer dante milton -- majestic shadow gray but luminous he call they he seem never to have ask himself the question how far these vision be pure illusion but believe and trust they implicitly to he all nature be a vast spiritual symbolism wherein he see elf fairy devil angel -- all look at he in friendship or enmity through the eye of flower and star : with the blue sky spread over with wing and the mild sun that mount and sing with tree and field full of fairy elf and little devil who fight for themselves with angel plant in hawthorne bower and god himself in the pass hour and this curious pantheistic conception of nature be not a matter of creed but the very essence of blake 's life strangely enough he make no attempt to find a new religious cult but follow he own way singing cheerfully work patiently in the face of discouragement and failure that writer of far less genius be exalt to favor while he remain poor and obscure do not seem to have trouble he in the least for over forty year he labor diligently at book engrave guide in he art by michael angelo but invent he own curious design at which we still wonder the illustration for young 's night thought for blair 's grave and the invention to the book of job show the peculiarity of blake 's mind quite as clearly as he poem while he work at he trade he fling off -- for he never seem to compose -- disjointed vision and incomprehensible rhapsody with a occasional little gem that still set we heart to singing : ah sunflower weary of time who countest the step of the sun seek after that sweet golden clime where the traveller 's journey be do where the youth pine away with desire and the pale virgin shroud in snow rise from they grave and aspire where my sunflower wish to go that be a curious flower to find grow in the london street but it suggest blake 's own life which be outwardly busy and quiet but inwardly full of adventure and excitement he last huge prophetic work like _ jerusalem _ and _ milton _ -lrb- 1804 -rrb- be dictate to he he declare by supernatural means and even against he own will they be only half intelligible but here and there one see flash of the same poetic beauty that mark he little poem critic generally dismiss blake with the word madman but that be only a evasion at best he be the writer of exquisite lyric at worst he be mad only north-northwest like hamlet and the puzzle be to find the method in he madness the most amazing thing about he be the perfectly sane and cheerful way in which he move through poverty and obscurity fling out exquisite poem or senseless rhapsody as a child might play with gem or straw or sunbeam indifferently he be a gentle kindly most unworldly little man with extraordinary eye which seem even in the lifeless portrait to reflect some unusual hypnotic power he die obscurely smile at a vision of paradise in 1827 that be nearly a century ago yet he still remain one of the most incomprehensible figure in we literature work of blake the _ poetical sketch _ publish in 1783 be a collection of blake 's earliest poetry much of it write in boyhood it contain much crude and incoherent work but also a few lyric of striking originality two later and better know volume be _ song of innocence _ and _ song of experience _ reflect two widely different view of the human soul as in all he work there be a abundance of apparently worthless stuff in these song but in the language of miner it be all pay dirt it show gleam of golden grain that await we sifting and now and then we find a nugget unexpectedly : my lord be like a flower upon the brow of lusty may ah life as frail as flower my lord be like a star in highest heaven draw down to earth by spell and wickedness my lord be like the opening eye of day but he be darken like the summer moon cloud fall 'n like the stately tree cut down the breath of heaven dwelt among he leaf on account of the chaotic character of most of blake 's work it be well to begin we reading with a short book of selection contain the best song of these three little volume swinburne call blake the only poet of supreme and simple poetic genius of the eighteenth century the one man of that age fit on all account to rank with the old great master -lrb- 207 -rrb- the praise be doubtless extravagant and the criticism somewhat intemperate but when we have read the evening star memory night love to the muse spring summer the tiger the lamb the clod and the pebble we may possibly share swinburne 's enthusiasm certainly in these three volume we have some of the most perfect and the most original song in we language of blake 's longer poem he titanic prophecy and apocalyptic splendor it be impossible to write justly in such a brief work as this outwardly they suggest a huge chaff pile and the scatter grain of wheat hardly warrant the labor of winnowing the curious reader will get a idea of blake 's amazing mysticism by dip into any of the work of he middle life -- _ urizen gate of paradise marriage of heaven and hell america the french revolution _ or _ the vision of the daughter of albion _ he latest work like _ jerusalem _ and _ milton _ be too obscure to have any literary value to read any of these work casually be to call the author a madman to study they remember blake 's song and he genius be to quote softly he own answer to the child who ask about the land of dream : o what land be the land of dream what be its mountain and what be its stream -- o father i see my mother there among the lily by water fair dear child i also by pleasant stream have wander all night in the land of dream but though calm and warm the water wide i could not get to the other side minor poet of the revival we have choose the five precede poet gray goldsmith cowper burn and blake as the most typical and the most interesting of the writer who proclaim the dawn of romanticism in the eighteenth century with they we associate a group of minor writer whose work be immensely popular in they own day the ordinary reader will pass they by but to the student they be all significant as expression of very different phase of the romantic revival jame thomson -lrb- 1700-1748 -rrb- thomson belong among the pioneer of romanticism like gray and goldsmith he waver between pseudo-classic and the new romantic ideal and for this reason if for no other he early work be interesting like the uncertainty of a child who hesitate whether to creep safely on all fours or risk a fall by walk he be worthy to be remember for three poem -- rule britannium which be still one of the national song of england _ the castle of indolence _ and _ the season _ the dreamy and romantic _ castle _ -lrb- 1748 -rrb- occupy by enchanter indolence and he willing captive in the land of drowsyhed be purely spenserian in its imagery and be write in the spenserian stanza _ the season _ -lrb- 1726 - 1730 -rrb- write in blank verse describe the sight and sound of the change year and the poet 's own feeling in the presence of nature these two poem though rather dull to a modern reader be significant of the early romantic revival in three way : they abandon the prevail heroic couplet they go back to the elizabethan instead of to pope for they model and they call attention to the long-neglected life of nature as a subject for poetry william collin -lrb- 1721-1759 -rrb- collin the friend and disciple of thomson be of a delicate nervous temperament like cowper and over he also brood the awful shadow of insanity he first work _ oriental eclogue _ -lrb- 1742 -rrb- be romantic in feeling but be write in the prevail mechanical couplet all he later work be romantic in both think and expression he ode on the popular superstition of the highland -lrb- 1750 -rrb- be a interesting event in the romantic revival for it introduce a new world of witch pygmy fairy and mediæval king for the imagination to play in collin 's best know poem be the ode to simplicity to fear to the passion the little unnamed lyric begin how sleep the brave and the exquisite ode to evening in read the latter one be scarcely aware that the line be so delicately balanced that they have no need of rime to accentuate they melody george crabbe -lrb- 1754-1832 -rrb- crabbe be a interesting combination of realism and romanticism he work of depict common life be at time vaguely suggestive of fielding 's novel _ the village _ -lrb- 1783 -rrb- a poem without a rival as a picture of the workingman of he age be sometimes like fielding in its coarse vigor and again like dryden in its precise versification the poem be not successful at first and crabbe abandon he literary dream for over twenty year he settle down as a clergyman in a country parish observe keenly the common life about he then he publish more poem exactly like _ the village _ which immediately bring he fame and money they bring he also the friendship of walter scott who like other regarded crabbe as one of the first poet of the age these later poem _ the parish register _ -lrb- 1807 -rrb- _ the borough _ -lrb- 1810 -rrb- _ tale in verse _ -lrb- 1812 -rrb- and _ tale of the hall _ -lrb- 1819 -rrb- be in the same strain they be write in couplet they be reflection of nature and of country life they contain much that be sordid and dull but be nevertheless real picture of real man and woman just as crabbe see they and as such they be still interesting goldsmith and burn have idealized the poor and we admire they for they sympathy and insight it remain for crabbe to show that in wretched fishing village in the life of hardwork man and woman child laborer smuggler pauper -- all sort and condition of common man -- there be abundant romantic without exaggerate or idealize they vice and virtue jame macpherson -lrb- 1736-1796 -rrb- in macpherson we have a unusual figure who cater to the new romantic interest in the old epic hero and win immense though momentary fame by a series of literary forgery macpherson be a scotch schoolmaster a educate man but evidently not over-tender of conscience whose imagination have be stir by certain old poem which he may have hear in gaelic among the highlander in 1760 he publish he _ fragment of ancient poetry collect in the highland _ and allege that he work be but a translation of gaelic manuscript whether the work of itself would have attract attention be doubtful but the fact that a abundance of literary material might be await discovery lead to a interest such as now attend the opening of a egyptian tomb and a subscription be promptly raise in edinburgh to send macpherson through the highland to collect more manuscript the result be the epic _ fingal _ -lrb- 1762 -rrb- that lank and lamentable counterfeit of poetry as swinburne call it which the author profess to have translate from the gaelic of the poet ossian its success be astonishing and macpherson follow it up with _ temora _ -lrb- 1763 -rrb- another epic in the same strain in both these work macpherson succeed in give a air of primal grandeur to he hero the character be big and shadowy the imagery be at time magnificent the language be a kind of chant bombastic prose : now fingal arise in he might and thrice he rear he voice cromlum answer around and the son of the desert stand still they bent they red face to earth ashamed at the presence of fingal he come like a cloud of rain in the day of the sun when slow it roll on the hill and field expect the shower swaran behold the terrible king of morven and stop in the midst of he course dark he lean on he spear roll he red eye around silent and tall he seem as a oak on the bank of lubar which have its branch blast of old by the lightning of heaven he thousand pour around the hero and the darkness of battle gather on the hill -lrb- 208 -rrb- the publication of this gloomy imaginative work produce a literary storm a few critic lead by dr johnson demand to see the original manuscript and when macpherson refuse to produce they -lrb- 209 -rrb- the ossianic poem be brand as a forgery nevertheless they have enormous success macpherson be honor as a literary explorer he be give a official position carry a salary for life and at he death in 1796 he be bury in westminster abbey blake burn and indeed most of the poet of the age be influence by this sham poetry even the scholarly gray be deceive and delight with ossian and man as far apart as goethe and napoleon praise it immoderately thoma chatterton -lrb- 1752-1770 -rrb- this marvelous boy to whom keat dedicate he endymion and who be celebrate in shelley 's adonai be one of the saddest and most interesting figure of the romantic revival during he childhood he haunt the old church of st mary redcliffe in bristol where he be fascinate by the mediæval air of the place and especially by one old chest know as canynge 's coffer contain musty document which have be preserve for three hundred year with strange uncanny intentness the child pore over these relic of the past copy they instead of he write book until he could imitate not only the spelling and language but even the handwriting of the original soon after the ossian forgery appear chatterton begin to produce document apparently very old contain mediæval poem legend and family history center around two character -- thoma rowley priest and poet and william canynge merchant of bristol in the day of henry vi it seem incredible that the whole design of these mediæval romance should have be work out by a child of eleven and that he could reproduce the style and the writing of caxton 's day so well that the printer be deceive but such be the fact more and more _ rowley papers _ as they be call be produce by chatterton -- apparently from the archive of the old church in reality from he own imagination -- delight a large circle of reader and deceive all but gray and a few scholar who recognize the occasional misuse of fifteenth-century english word all this work be carefully finish and bear the unmistakable stamp of literary genius reading now he ælla or the ballad of charite or the long poem in ballad style call bristowe tragedie it be hard to realize that it be a boy 's work at seventeen year of age chatterton go for a literary career to london where he soon afterwards take poison and kill himself in a fit of childish despondency bring on by poverty and hunger thoma percy -lrb- 1729-1811 -rrb- to percy bishop of the irish church in dromore we be indebted for the first attempt at a systematic collection of the folk song and ballad which be count among the treasure of a nation 's literature -lrb- 210 -rrb- in 1765 he publish in three volume he famous _ relique of ancient english poetry _ the most valuable part of this work be the remarkable collection of old english and scottish ballad such as chevy chase the nut brown mayde child of the wood battle of otterburn and many more which but for he labor might easily have perish we have now much better and more reliable edition of these same ballad for percy garble he material add and subtract freely and even invent a few ballad of he own two motive probably influence he in this first the different version of the same ballad vary greatly and percy in change they to suit himself take the same liberty as have many other writer in deal with the same material second percy be under the influence of johnson and he school and think it necessary to add a few elegant ballad to atone for the rudeness of the more obsolete poem that sound queer now use as we be to exactness in deal with historical and literary material but it express the general spirit of the age in which he live notwithstanding these drawback percy 's _ relique _ mark a epoch in the history of romanticism and it be difficult to measure its influence on the whole romantic movement scott say of it the first time i could scrape a few shilling together i buy myself a copy of these beloved volume nor do i believe i ever read a book half so frequently or with half the enthusiasm scott 's own poetry be strongly model upon these early ballad and he _ minstrelsy of the scottish border _ be due chiefly to the influence of percy 's work besides the _ relique _ percy have give we another good work in he _ northern antiquity _ -lrb- 1770 -rrb- translate from the french of mallet 's _ history of denmark _ this also be of immense influence since it introduce to english reader a new and fascinating mythology more rugged and primitive than that of the greek and we be still in music as in letter under the spell of thor and odin of frea and the valkyr maiden and of that stupendous drama of passion and tragedy which end in the twilight of the god the literary world owe a debt of gratitude to percy who write nothing of importance himself but who by collect and translate the work of other man do much to hasten the triumph of romanticism in the nineteenth century iii the first english novelist the chief literary phenomenon of the complex eighteenth century be the reign of so-called classicism the revival of romantic poetry and the discovery of the modern novel of these three the last be probably the most important aside from the fact that the novel be the most modern and at present the most widely read and influential type of literature we have a certain pride in regard it as england 's original contribution to the world of letter other great type of literature like the epic the romance and the drama be first produce by other nation but the idea of the modern novel seem to have be work out largely on english soil -lrb- 211 -rrb- and in the number and the fine quality of she novelist england have hardly be rival by any other nation before we study the writer who develop this new type of literature it be well to consider briefly its meaning and history meaning of the novel probably the most significant remark make by the ordinary reader concern a work of fiction take the form of a question : be it a good story for the reader of to-day be much like the child and the primitive man in this respect that he must be attract and hold by the story element of a narrative before he learn to appreciate its style or moral significance the story element be therefore essential to the novel but where the story originate be impossible to say as well might we seek for the origin of the race for wherever primitive man be find there we see they gather eagerly about the story-teller in the hall of we saxon ancestor the scop and the tale-bringer be ever the most welcome guest and in the bark wigwam of the american indian the man who tell the legend of hiawatha have a audience quite as attentive as that which gather at the greek festival to hear the story of ulyss 's wanderings to man 's instinct or innate love for a story we be indebted for all we literature and the novel must in some degree satisfy this instinct or fail of appreciation the second question which we ask concern a work of fiction be how far do the element of imagination enter into it for upon the element of imagination depend largely we classification of work of fiction into novel romance and mere adventure story the division here be as indefinite as the border land between childhood and youth between instinct and reason but there be certain principle to guide we we note in the development of any normal child that there come a time when for he story he desire knight giant elf fairy witch magic and marvelous adventure which have no basis in experience he tell extraordinary tale about himself which may be only the vague remembrance of a dream or the creation of a dawn imagination -- both of which be as real to he as any other part of life when we say that such a child romance we give exactly the right name to it for this sudden interest in extraordinary being and event mark the development of the human imagination -- run riot at first because it be not guide by reason which be a later development -- and to satisfy this new interest the romance -lrb- 212 -rrb- be invent the romance be originally a work of fiction in which the imagination be give full play without be limit by fact or probability it deal with extraordinary event with hero whose power be exaggerated and often add the element of superhuman or supernatural character it be impossible to draw the line where romance end but this element of excessive imagination and of impossible hero and incident be its distinguishing mark in every literature where the novel begin it be likewise impossible to say but again we have a suggestion in the experience of every reader there come a time naturally and inevitably in the life of every youth when the romance no longer enthrall he he live in a world of fact get acquaint with man and woman some good some bad but all human and he demand that literature shall express life as he know it by experience this be the stage of the awaken intellect and in we story the intellect as well as the imagination must now be satisfy at the beginning of this stage we delight in _ robinson crusoe _ we read eagerly a multitude of adventure narrative and a few so-called historical novel but in each case we must be lure by a story must find hero and move accident by flood and field to appeal to we imagination and though the hero and the adventure may be exaggerate they must both be natural and within the bound of probability gradually the element of adventure or surprising incident grow less and less important as we learn that true life be not adventurous but a plain heroic matter of work and duty and the daily choice between good and evil life be the most real thing in the world now -- not the life of king or hero or superhuman creature but the individual life with its struggle and temptation and triumph or failure like we own and any work that faithfully represent life become interesting so we drop the adventure story and turn to the novel for the novel be a work of fiction in which the imagination and the intellect combine to express life in the form of a story and the imagination be always direct and control by the intellect it be interested chiefly not in romance or adventure but in man and woman as they be it aim to show the motive and influence which govern human life and the effect of personal choice upon character and destiny such be the true novel -lrb- 213 -rrb- and as such it open a wider and more interesting field than any other type of literature precursor of the novel before the novel could reach its modern stage of a more or less sincere attempt to express human life and character it have to pass through several century of almost imperceptible development among the early precursor of the novel we must place a collection of tale know as the greek romance date from the second to the sixth century these be imaginative and delightful story of ideal love and marvelous adventure -lrb- 214 -rrb- which profoundly affect romance write for the next thousand year a second group of predecessor be find in the italian and spanish pastoral romance which be inspire by the _ eclogue _ of virgil these be extremely popular in the fourteenth and fifteenth century and they influence be see later in sidney 's _ arcadium _ which be the best of this type in english the third and most influential group of predecessor of the novel be make up of the romance of chivalry such as be find in malory 's _ morte d'arthur _ it be noticeable in read these beautiful old romance in different language that each nation change they somewhat so as to make they more expressive of national trait and ideal in a word the old romance tend inevitably towards realism especially in england where the excessive imagination be curb and the hero become more human in malory in the unknown author of _ sir gawain and the green knight _ and especially in chaucer we see the effect of the practical english mind in give these old romance a more natural setting and in make the hero suggest though faintly the man and woman of they own day the _ canterbury tale _ with they story interest and they character delightfully true to nature have in they the suggestion at least of a connected story whose chief aim be to reflect life as it be in the elizabethan age the idea of the novel grow more definite in sidney 's _ arcadium _ -lrb- 1580 -rrb- a romance of chivalry the pastoral setting at least be generally true to nature we credulity be not tax as in the old romance by the continual appearance of magic or miracle and the character though idealized till they become tiresome occasionally give the impression of be real man and woman in bacon 's _ the new atlanti _ -lrb- 1627 -rrb- we have the story of the discovery by mariner of a unknown country inhabit by a superior race of man more civilized than ourselves -- a idea which have be use by more in he _ utopia _ in 1516 these two book be neither romance nor novel in the strict sense but study of social institution they use the connected story as a means of teaching moral lesson and of bring about need reform and this valuable suggestion have be adopt by many of we modern writer in the so-called problem novel and novel of purpose nearer to the true novel be lodge 's romantic story of _ rosalynde _ which be use by shakespeare in _ as you like it _ this be model upon the italian novellum or short story which become very popular in england during the elizabethan age in the same age we have introduce into england the spanish picaresque novel -lrb- from _ picaro _ a knave or rascal -rrb- which at first be a kind of burlesque on the mediæval romance and which take for its hero some low scoundrel or outcast instead of a knight and follow he through a long career of scandal and villainy one of the earliest type of this picaresque novel in english be nash 's _ the unfortunate traveller or the life of jack wilton _ -lrb- 1594 -rrb- which be also a forerunner of the historical novel since its action take place during that gorgeous interview between henry viii and the king of france on the field of the cloth of gold in all these short story and picaresque novel the emphasis be lay not so much on life and character as on the adventure of the hero and the interest consist largely in wonder what would happen next and how the plot would end the same method be employ in all trashy novel and it be especially the bane of many modern story-writer this excessive interest in adventure or incident for they own sake and not for they effect on character be what distinguish the modern adventure story from the true novel in the puritan age we approach still nearer to the modern novel especially in the work of bunyan and as the puritan always lay emphasis on character story appear have a definite moral purpose bunyan 's _ the pilgrim 's progress _ -lrb- 1678 -rrb- differ from the _ faery queen _ and from all other mediæval allegory in this important respect -- that the character far from be bloodless abstraction be but thinly disguise man and woman indeed many a modern man read the story of the christian -- have find in it the reflection of he own life and experience in _ the life and death of mr badman _ -lrb- 1682 -rrb- we have another and even more realistic study of a man as he be in bunyan 's day these two striking figure christian and mr badman belong among the great character of english fiction bunyan 's good work -- he keen insight he delineation of character and he emphasis upon the moral effect of individual action -- be carry on by addison and steele some thirty year later the character of sir roger de coverley be a real reflection of english country life in the eighteenth century and with steele 's domestic sketch in _ the tatler the spectator _ and _ the guardian _ -lrb- 1709-1713 -rrb- we definitely cross the border land that lie outside of romance and enter the region of character study where the novel have its begin the discovery of the modern novel notwithstanding this long history of fiction to which we have call attention it be safe to say that until the publication of richardson 's _ pamelum _ in 1740 no true novel have appear in any literature by a true novel we mean simply a work of fiction which relate the story of a plain human life under stress of emotion which depend for its interest not on incident or adventure but on its truth to nature a number of english novelist -- goldsmith richardson fielding smollett sterne -- all seem to have seize upon the idea of reflect life as it be in the form of a story and to have develop it simultaneously the result be a extraordinary awakening of interest especially among people who have never before be greatly concern with literature we be to remember that in previous period the number of reader be comparatively small and that with the exception of a few writer like langland and bunyan author write largely for the upper class in the eighteenth century the spread of education and the appearance of newspaper and magazine lead to a immense increase in the number of reader and at the same time the middle-class people assume a foremost place in english life and history these new reader and this new powerful middle class have no classic tradition to hamper they they care little for the opinion of dr johnson and the famous literary club and so far as they read fiction at all they apparently take little interest in the exaggerated romance of impossible hero and the picaresque story of intrigue and villainy which have interest the upper class some new type of literature be demand this new type must express the new ideal of the eighteenth century namely the value and the importance of the individual life so the novel be bear express though in a different way exactly the same ideal of personality and of the dignity of common life which be later proclaim in the american and in the french revolution and be welcome with rejoice by the poet of the romantic revival to tell man not about knight or king or type of hero but about themselves in the guise of plain man and woman about they own thought and motive and struggle and the result of action upon they own character -- this be the purpose of we first novelist the eagerness with which they chapter be read in england and the rapidity with which they work be copy abroad show how powerfully the new discovery appeal to reader everywhere before we consider the work of these writer who first develop the modern novel we must glance at the work of a pioneer daniel defoe whom we place among the early novelist for the simple reason that we do not know how else to classify he daniel defoe -lrb- 1661 -lrb- -rrb- -1731 -rrb- to defoe be often give the credit for the discovery of the modern novel but whether or not he deserve that honor be a open question even a casual reading of _ robinson crusoe _ -lrb- 1719 -rrb- which generally head the list of modern fiction show that this exciting tale be largely a adventure story rather than the study of human character which defoe probably intend it to be young people still read it as they might a dime novel skip its moralizing passage and hurry on to more adventure but they seldom appreciate the excellent mature reason which banish the dime novel to a secret place in the haymow while _ crusoe _ hang proudly on the christmas tree or hold a honor place on the family bookshelf defoe 's _ apparition of mr veal memoirs of a cavalier _ and _ journal of the plague year _ be such mixture of fact fiction and credulity that they defy classification while other so-called novel like _ captain singleton moll flander _ and _ roxana _ be but little better than picaresque story with a deal of unnatural moralizing and repentance add for puritanical effect in _ crusoe _ defoe bring the realistic adventure story to a very high stage of its development but he work hardly deserve to be class as true novel which must subordinate incident to the faithful portrayal of human life and character life defoe be the son of a london butcher name foe and keep he family name until he be forty year of age when he add the aristocratic prefix with which we have grow familiar the event of he busy seventy year of life in which he pass through all extreme from poverty to wealth from prosperous brickmaker to starvele journalist from newgate prison to immense popularity and royal favor be obscure enough in detail but four fact stand out clearly which help the reader to understand the character of he work first defoe be a jack-at-all-trade as well as a writer he interest be largely with the work class and notwithstanding many questionable practice he seem to have have some continued purpose of educate and uplift the common people this partially account for the enormous popularity of he work and for the fact that they be criticise by literary man as be fit only for the kitchen second he be a radical nonconformist in religion and be intend by he father for the independent ministry the puritan zeal for reform possess he and he try to do by he pen what wesley be do by he preach without however have any great measure of the latter 's sincerity or singleness of purpose this zeal for reform mark all he numerous work and account for the moralizing to be find everywhere third defoe be a journalist and pamphleteer with a reporter 's eye for the picturesque and a newspaper man 's instinct for make a good story he write a immense number of pamphlet poem and magazine article conduct several papers -- one of the most popular the _ review _ be issue from prison -- and the fact that they often blow hot and cold upon the same question be hardly notice indeed so extraordinarily interesting and plausible be defoe 's article that he generally manage to keep employ by the party in power whether whig or tory this long journalistic career last half a century account for he direct simple narrative style which hold we even now by its intense reality to defoe 's genius we be also indebted for two discovery the interview and the lead editorial both of which be still in daily use in we best newspaper the fourth fact to remember be that defoe know prison life and thereby hang a tale in 1702 defoe publish a remarkable pamphlet call the shortest way with the dissenter support the claim of the free church against the high flier ie tory and anglican in a vein of grim humor which recall swift 's modest proposal defoe advocate hang all dissent minister and send all member of the free church into exile and so ferociously realistic be the satire that both dissenter and tory take the author literally defoe be try find guilty of seditious libel and sentence to be fine to stand three day in the pillory and to be imprison hardly have the sentence be pronounce when defoe write he hymn to the pillory -- hail hieroglyphic state machine contrived to punish fancy in -- a set of doggerel verse ridicule he prosecutor which defoe with a keen eye for advertising scatter all over london crowd flock to cheer he in the pillory and see that defoe be make popularity out of persecution he enemy bundle he off to newgate prison he turn this experience also to account by publish a popular newspaper and by get acquaint with rogue pirate smuggler and miscellaneous outcast each one with a good story to be use later after he release from prison in 1704 he turn he knowledge of criminal to further account and enter the government employ as a kind of spy or secret - service agent he prison experience and the further knowledge of criminal gain in over twenty year as a spy account for he numerous story of thief and pirate _ jonathan wild _ and _ captain avery _ and also for he later novel which deal almost exclusively with villain and outcast when defoe be nearly sixty year of age he turn to fiction and write the great work by which he be remembered _ robinson crusoe _ be a instant success and the author become famous all over europe other story follow rapidly and defoe earn money enough to retire to newington and live in comfort but not idly for he activity in produce fiction be rival only by that of walter scott thus in 1720 appear _ captain singleton duncan campbell _ and _ memoirs of a cavalier _ in 1722 _ colonel jack moll flander _ and the amazingly realistic _ journal of the plague year _ so the list grow with astonishing rapidity end with the _ history of the devil _ in 1726 in the latter year defoe 's secret connection with the government become known and a great howl of indignation rise against he in the public print destroy in a hour the popularity which he have gain by a lifetime of intrigue and labor he flee from he home to london where he die obscurely in 1731 while hide from real or imaginary enemy work of defoe at the head of the list stand _ robinson crusoe _ -lrb- 1719 - 1720 -rrb- one of the few book in any literature which have hold its popularity undiminished for nearly two century the story be base upon the experience of alexander selkirk or selcraig who have be maroon in the island of juan fernandez off the coast of chile and who have live there in solitude for five year on he return to england in 1709 selkirk 's experience become known and steele publish a account of they in _ the englishman _ without however attract any wide attention that defoe use selkirk 's story be practically certain but with he usual duplicity he claim to have write _ crusoe _ in 1708 a year before selkirk 's return however that may be the story itself be real enough to have come straight from a sailor 's logbook defoe as show in he _ journal of the plague year _ and he _ memoirs of a cavalier _ have the art of describe thing he have never see with the accuracy of a eyewitness the charm of the story be its intense reality in the succession of thought feeling incident which every reader recognize to be absolutely true to life at first glance it would seem that one man on a desert island could not possibly furnish the material for a long story but as we read we realize with amazement that every slightest thought and action -- the saving of the cargo of the shipwrecked vessel the preparation for defense against imaginary foe the intense agitation over the discovery of a footprint in the sand -- be a record of what the reader himself would do and feel if he be alone in such a place defoe 's long and vary experience now stand he in good stead in fact he be the only man of letter in he time who might have be throw on a desert island without find himself at a loss what to do -lrb- 215 -rrb- and he put himself so perfectly in he hero 's place that he repeat he blunder as well as he triumph thus what reader ever follow defoe 's hero through weary feverish month of build a huge boat which be too big to be launch by one man without recall some boy who spend many stormy day in shed or cellar building a boat or dog house and who when the thing be paint and finish find it a foot wider than the door and have to knock it to piece this absolute naturalness characterize the whole story it be a study of the human will also -- of patience fortitude and the indomitable saxon spirit overcome all obstacle and it be this element which make rousseau recommend _ robinson crusoe _ as a better treatise on education than anything which aristotle or the modern have ever write and this suggest the most significant thing about defoe 's masterpiece namely that the hero represent the whole of human society do with he own hand all the thing which by the division of labor and the demand of modern civilization be now do by many different worker he be therefore the type of the whole civilized race of man in the remain work of defoe more than two hundred in number there be a astonishing variety but all be mark by the same simple narrative style and the same intense realism the best know of these be the _ journal of the plague year _ in which the horror of a frightful plague be minutely record the _ memoirs of a cavalier _ so realistic that chatham quote it as history in parliament and several picaresque novel like _ captain singleton colonel jack moll flander _ and _ roxana _ the last work be by some critic give a very high place in realistic fiction but like the other three and like defoe 's minor narrative of jack sheppard and cartouche it be a disagreeable study of vice end with a force and unnatural repentance samuel richardson -lrb- 1689-1761 -rrb- to richardson belong the credit of write the first modern novel he be the son of a london joiner who for economy 's sake reside in some unknown town in derbyshire where samuel be bear in 1689 the boy receive very little education but he have a natural talent for write letter and even as a boy we find he frequently employ by work girl to write they love letter for they this early experience together with he fondness for the society of he dearest lady rather than of man give he that intimate knowledge of the heart of sentimental and uneducated woman which be manifest in all he work moreover he be a keen observer of manners and he surprisingly accurate description often compel we to listen even when he be most tedious at seventeen year of age he go to london and learn the printer 's trade which he follow to the end of he life when fifty year of age he have a small reputation as a writer of elegant epistle and this reputation lead certain publisher to approach he with a proposal that he write a series of _ familiar letter _ which could be use as model by people unused to write richardson gladly accept the proposal and have the happy inspiration to make these letter tell the connected story of a girl 's life defoe have tell a adventure story of human life on a desert island but richardson would tell the story of a girl 's inner life in the midst of english neighbor that sound simple enough now but it mark a epoch in the history of literature like every other great and simple discovery it make we wonder why some one have not think of it before richardson 's novel the result of richardson 's inspiration be _ pamelum or virtue reward _ a endless series of letter -lrb- 216 -rrb- tell of the trial tribulation and the final happy marriage of a too sweet young maiden publish in four volume extend over the year 1740 and 1741 its chief fame lie in the fact that it be we first novel in the modern sense aside from this important fact and view solely as a novel it be sentimental grandiloquent and wearisome its success at the time be enormous and richardson begin another series of letter -lrb- he could tell a story in no other way -rrb- which occupy he leisure hour for the next six year the result be _ clarissa or the history of a young lady _ publish in eight volume in 1747-1748 this be another and somewhat better sentimental novel and it be receive with immense enthusiasm of all richardson 's heroine clarissa be the most human in she doubt and scruple of conscience and especially in she bitter grief and humiliation she be a real woman in marked contrast with the mechanical hero lovelace who simply illustrate the author 's inability to portray a man 's character the dramatic element in this novel be strong and be increase by means of the letter which enable the reader to keep close to the character of the story and to see life from they different view point macaulay who be deeply impress by _ clarissa _ be say to have make the remark that be the novel lose he could restore almost the whole of it from memory richardson now turn from he middle-class heroine and in five or six year complete another series of letter in which he attempt to tell the story of a man and a aristocrat the result be _ sir charle grandison _ -lrb- 1754 -rrb- a novel in seven volume whose hero be intend to be a model of aristocratic manners and virtue for the middle-class people who largely constitute the novelist 's reader for richardson who begin in _ pamelum _ with the purpose of teach he hearer how to write end with the deliberate purpose of teach they how to live and in most of he work he chief object be in he own word to inculcate virtue and good deportment he novel therefore suffer as much from he purpose as from he own limitation notwithstanding he tedious moralizing and he other defect richardson in these three book give something entirely new to the literary world and the world appreciate the gift this be the story of human life tell from within and depend for its interest not on incident or adventure but on its truth to human nature read he work be on the whole like examine the antiquated model of a stern-wheel steamer it be interesting for its undeveloped possibility rather than for its achievement henry fielding -lrb- 1707-1754 -rrb- life judge by he ability alone field be the greatest of this new group of novel writer and one of the most artistic that we literature have produce he be bear in east stour dorsetshire in 1707 in contrast with richardson he be well educate have spend several year at the famous eton school and take a degree in letter at the university of leyden in 1728 moreover he have a deeper knowledge of life gain from he own varied and sometimes riotous experience for several year after return from leyden he gain a precarious living by write play farce and buffonery for the stage in 1735 he marry a admirable woman of whom we have glimpse in two of he character amelium and sophium western and live extravagantly on she little fortune at east stour have use up all he money he return to london and study law gain he living by occasional play and by newspaper work for ten year or more little be definitely know of he save that he publish he first novel _ joseph andrew _ in 1742 and that he be make justice of the peace for westminster in 1748 the remain year of he life in which he best novel be write be not give to literature but rather to he duty as magistrate and especially to break up the gang of thief and cutthroat which infested the street of london after nightfall he die in lisbon whither he have go for he health in 1754 and lie bury there in the english cemetery the pathetic account of this last journey together with a inkling of the generosity and kind-heartedness of the man notwithstanding the scandal and irregularity of he life be find in he last work the _ journal of a voyage to lisbon _ fielding 's work fielding 's first novel _ joseph andrew _ -lrb- 1742 -rrb- be inspire by the success of _ pamelum _ and begin as a burlesque of the false sentimentality and the conventional virtue of richardson 's heroine he take for he hero the alleged brother of pamelum who be expose to the same kind of temptation but who instead of be reward for he virtue be unceremoniously turn out of door by he mistress there the burlesque end the hero take to the open road and fielding forget all about pamelum in tell the adventure of joseph and he companion parson adam unlike richardson who have no humor who mince word and moralize and dote on the sentimental woe of he heroine fielding be direct vigorous hilarious and coarse to the point of vulgarity he be full of animal spirit and he tell the story of a vagabond life not for the sake of moralize like richardson or for emphasize a forced repentance like defoe but simply because it interest he and he only concern be to laugh man out of they folly so he story though it abound in unpleasant incident generally leave the reader with the strong impression of reality fielding 's later novel be _ jonathan wild _ the story of a rogue which suggest defoe 's narrative _ the history of tom jone a foundling _ -lrb- 1749 -rrb- he best work and _ amelium _ -lrb- 1751 -rrb- the story of a good wife in contrast with a unworthy husband he strength in all these work be in the vigorous but coarse figure like those of jan steen 's picture which fill most of he page he weakness be in lack of taste and in barrenness of imagination or invention which lead he to repeat he plot and incident with slight variation in all he work sincerity be perhaps the most marked characteristic fielding like virile man just as they be good and bad but detest sham of every sort he satire have none of swift 's bitterness but be subtle as that of chaucer and good-natured as that of steele he never moralize though some of he powerfully draw scene suggest a deeper moral lesson than anything in defoe or richardson and he never judge even the worst of he character without remember he own frailty and temper justice with mercy on the whole though much of he work be perhaps in bad taste and be too coarse for pleasant or profitable reading fielding must be regard as a artist a very great artist in realistic fiction and the advanced student who read he will probably concur in the judgment of a modern critic that by give we genuine picture of man and woman of he own age without moralize over they vice and virtue he become the real founder of the modern novel smollett and sterne tobia smollett -lrb- 1721-1771 -rrb- apparently try to carry on fielding 's work but he lack fielding 's genius as well as he humor and inherent kindness and so crowd he page with the horror and brutality which be sometimes mistake for realism smollett be a physician of eccentric manners and ferocious instinct who develop he unnatural peculiarity by go as a surgeon on a battleship where he seem to have pick up all the evil of the navy and of the medical profession to use later in he novel he three best know work be _ roderick random _ -lrb- 1748 -rrb- a series of adventure relate by the hero _ peregrine pickle _ -lrb- 1751 -rrb- in which he reflect with brutal directness the worst of he experience at sea and _ humphrey clinker _ -lrb- 1771 -rrb- he last work recount the mild adventure of a welsh family in a journey through england and scotland this last alone can be generally read without arouse the reader profound disgust without any particular ability he model he novel on _ don quixote _ and the result be simply a series of coarse adventure which be characteristic of the picaresque novel of he age be it not for the fact that he unconsciously imitate jonson 's _ every man in he humor _ he would hardly be name among we writer of fiction but in seize upon some grotesque habit or peculiarity and make a character out of it -- such as commodore trunnion in _ peregrine pickle _ matthew bramble in _ humphrey clinker _ and bowling in _ roderick random _ -- he lay the foundation for that exaggeration in portray human eccentricity which find a climax in dickens 's caricature lawrence sterne -lrb- 1713-1768 -rrb- have be compare to a little bronze satyr of antiquity in whose hollow body exquisite odor be store that be true so far as the satyr be concern for a more weazened unlovely personality would be hard to find the only question in the comparison be in regard to the character of the odor and that be a matter of taste in he work he be the reverse of smollett the latter be give over to coarse vulgarity which be often mistaken for realism the former to whim and vagary and sentimental tear which frequently only disguise a sneer at human grief and pity the two book by which sterne be remember be _ tristram shandy _ and _ a sentimental journey through france and italy _ these be term novel for the simple reason that we know not what else to call they the former be begin in he own word with no real idea of how it be to turn out its nine volume publish at interval from 1760 to 1767 proceed in the most aimless way record the experience of the eccentric shandy family and the book be never finish its strength lie chiefly in its brilliant style the most remarkable of the age and in its odd character like uncle toby and corporal trim which with all they eccentricity be so humanize by the author 's genius that they belong among the great creation of we literature the _ sentimental journey _ be a curious combination of fiction sketch of travel miscellaneous essay on odd subject -- all mark by the same brilliancy of style and all stamp with sterne 's false attitude towards everything in life many of its best passage be either adapt or take bodily from burton rabelai and a score of other writer so that in read sterne one be never quite sure how much be he own work though the mark of he grotesque genius be on every page the first novelist and they work with the publication of goldsmith 's _ vicar of wakefield _ in 1766 the first series of english novel come to a suitable close of this work with its abundance of homely sentiment clustering about the family life as the most sacred of anglo-saxon institution we have already speak -lrb- 217 -rrb- if we except _ robinson crusoe _ as a adventure story the _ vicar of wakefield _ be the only novel of the period which can be freely recommend to all reader as give a excellent idea of the new literary type which be perhaps more remarkable for its promise than for its achievement in the short space of twenty-five year there suddenly appear and flourish a new form of literature which influence all europe for nearly a century and which still furnish the largest part of we literary enjoyment each successive novelist bring some new element to the work as when field supply animal vigor and humor to richardson 's analysis of a human heart and sterne add brilliancy and goldsmith emphasize purity and the honest domestic sentiment which be still the greatest ruling force among man so these early worker be like man engage in carve a perfect cameo from the reverse side one work the profile another the eye a third the mouth and the fine line of character and not till the work be finish and the cameo turn do we see the complete human face and read its mean such in a parable be the story of the english novel summary of the eighteenth century the period we be study be include between the english revolution of 1688 and the beginning of the french revolution of 1789 historically the period begin in a remarkable way by the adoption of the bill of rights in 1689 this famous bill be the third and final step in the establishment of constitutional government the first step be the great charter -lrb- 1215 -rrb- and the second the petition of right -lrb- 1628 -rrb- the modern form of cabinet government be establish in the reign of george i -lrb- 1714-1727 -rrb- the foreign prestige of england be strengthen by the victory of marlborough on the continent in the war of the spanish succession and the bound of empire be enormously increase by clive in indium by cook in australium and the island of the pacific and by english victory over the french in canada and the mississippus valley during the seven year ' or french and indian war politically the country be divide into whig and tory : the former seek greater liberty for the people the latter uphold the king against popular government the continue strife between these two political party have a direct -lrb- and generally a harmful -rrb- influence on literature as many of the great writer be use by the whig or tory party to advance its own interest and to satirize its enemy notwithstanding this perpetual strife of party the age be remarkable for the rapid social development which soon express itself in literature club and coffeehouse multiply and the social life of these club result in better manners in a general feeling of toleration and especially in a kind of superficial elegance which show itself in most of the prose and poetry of the period on the other hand the moral standard of the nation be very low band of rowdy infested the city street after nightfall bribery and corruption be the rule in politics and drunkenness be frightfully prevalent among all class swift 's degraded race of yahoo be a reflection of the degradation to be see in multitude of london saloon this low standard of moral emphasize the importance of the great methodist revival under whitefield and wesley which begin in the second quarter of the eighteenth century the literature of the century be remarkably complex but we may classify it all under three general head -- the reign of so-called classicism the revival of romantic poetry and the beginning of the modern novel the first half of the century especially be a age of prose owe largely to the fact that the practical and social interest of the age demand expression modern newspaper like the _ chronicle post _ and _ time _ and literary magazine like the _ tatler _ and _ spectator _ which begin in this age greatly influence the development of a serviceable prose style the poetry of the first half of the century as typify in pope be polish unimaginative formal and the closed couplet be in general use supplant all other form of verse both prose and poetry be too frequently satiric and satire do not tend to produce a high type of literature these tendency in poetry be modify in the latter part of the century by the revival of romantic poetry in we study we have note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the augustan or classic age the meaning of classicism the life and work of alexander pope the greatest poet of the age of jonathan

age of romanticism -lrb- 1800-1850 -rrb- the second creative period of english literature the first half of the nineteenth century record the triumph of romanticism in literature and of democracy in government and the two movement be so closely associate in so many nation and in so many period of history that one must wonder if there be not some relation of cause and effect between they just as we understand the tremendous energize influence of puritanism in the matter of english liberty by remember that the common people have begin to read and that they book be the bible so we may understand this age of popular government by remember that the chief subject of romantic literature be the essential nobleness of common man and the value of the individual as we read now that brief portion of history which lie between the declaration of independence -lrb- 1776 -rrb- and the english reform bill of 1832 we be in the presence of such mighty political upheaval that the age of revolution be the only name by which we can adequately characterize it its great historic movement become intelligible only when we read what be write in this period for the french revolution and the american commonwealth as well as the establishment of a true democracy in england by the reform bill be the inevitable result of idea which literature have spread rapidly through the civilized world liberty be fundamentally a ideal and that ideal -- beautiful inspiring compelling as a loved banner in the wind -- be keep steadily before man 's mind by a multitude of book and pamphlet as far apart as burn 's _ poem _ and thoma paine 's _ rights of man _ -- all read eagerly by the common people all proclaim the dignity of common life and all utter the same passionate cry against every form of class or caste oppression first the dream the ideal in some human soul then the write word which proclaim it and impress other mind with its truth and beauty then the unite and determine effort of man to make the dream a reality -- that seem to be a fair estimate of the part that literature play even in we political progress historical summary the period we be consider begin in the latter half of the reign of george iii and end with the accession of victorium in 1837 when on a foggy morning in November 1783 king george enter the house of lord and in a tremble voice recognize the independence of the united state of america he unconsciously proclaim the triumph of that free government by free man which have be the ideal of english literature for more than a thousand year though it be not till 1832 when the reform bill become the law of the land that england herself learn the lesson teach she by america and become the democracy of which she writer have always dream the half century between these two event be one of great turmoil yet of steady advance in every department of english life the storm center of the political unrest be the french revolution that frightful uprising which proclaim the natural rights of man and the abolition of class distinction its effect on the whole civilized world be beyond computation patriotic club and society multiply in england all assert the doctrine of liberty equality fraternity the watchword of the revolution young england lead by pitt the younger hail the new french republic and offer it friendship old england which pardon no revolution but she own look with horror on the turmoil in france and mislead by burke and the noble of the realm force the two nation into war even pitt see a blessing in this at first because the sudden zeal for fight a foreign nation -- which by some horrible perversion be generally call patriotism -- might turn man 's thought from they own to they neighbor ' affair and so prevent a threaten revolution at home the cause of this threaten revolution be not political but economic by she invention in steel and machinery and by she monopoly of the carry trade england have become the workshop of the world she wealth have increase beyond she wildest dream but the unequal distribution of that wealth be a spectacle to make angel weep the invention of machinery at first throw thousand of skilled hand worker out of employment in order to protect a few agriculturist heavy duty be impose on corn and wheat and bread rise to famine price just when labor man have the least money to pay for it there follow a curious spectacle while england increase in wealth and spend vast sum to support she army and subsidize she ally in europe and while noble landowner manufacturer and merchant live in increase luxury a multitude of skilled laborer be clamor for work father send they wife and little child into the mine and factory where sixteen hour ' labor would hardly pay for the daily bread and in every large city be riotous mob make up chiefly of hungry man and woman it be this unbearable economic condition and not any political theory as burke suppose which occasion the danger of another english revolution it be only when we remember these condition that we can understand two book adam smith 's _ wealth of nation _ and thomas paine 's _ rights of man _ which can hardly be consider as literature but which exercise a enormous influence in england smith be a scottish thinker who write to uphold the doctrine that labor be the only source of a nation 's wealth and that any attempt to force labor into unnatural channel or to prevent it by protective duty from freely obtain the raw material for its industry be unjust and destructive paine be a curious combination of jekyll and hyde shallow and untrustworthy personally but with a passionate devotion to popular liberty he _ rights of man _ publish in london in 1791 be like one of burn 's lyric outcry against institution which oppress humanity come so soon after the destruction of the bastille it add fuel to the flame kindle in england by the french revolution the author be drive out of the country on the curious ground that he endanger the english constitution but not until he book have gain a wide sale and influence all these danger real and imaginary pass away when england turn from the affair of france to remedy she own economic condition the long continental war come to a end with napoleon 's overthrow at waterloo in 1815 and england have gain enormously in prestige abroad now turn to the work of reform at home the destruction of the african slave trade the mitigation of horribly unjust law which include poor debtor and petty criminal in the same class the prevention of child labor the freedom of the press the extension of manhood suffrage the abolition of restriction against catholic in parliament the establishment of hundred of popular school under the leadership of andrew bell and joseph lancaster -- these be but a few of the reform which mark the progress of civilization in a single half century when england in 1833 proclaim the emancipation of all slave in all she colony she unconsciously proclaim she final emancipation from barbarism literary characteristic of the age it be intensely interesting to note how literature at first reflect the political turmoil of the age and then when the turmoil be over and england begin she mighty work of reform how literature suddenly develop a new creative spirit which show itself in the poetry of wordsworth coleridge byron shelley keat and in the prose of scott jane austen lamb and de quincey -- a wonderful group of writer whose patriotic enthusiasm suggest the elizabethan day and whose genius have cause they age to be know as the second creative period of we literature thus in the early day when old institution seem crumble with the bastille coleridge and southey form they youthful scheme of a pantisocracy on the bank of the susquehanna -- a ideal commonwealth in which the principle of more 's _ utopia _ should be put in practice even wordsworth fire with political enthusiasm could write bliss be it in that dawn to be alive but to be young be very heaven the essence of romanticism be it must be remember that literature must reflect all that be spontaneous and unaffected in nature and in man and be free to follow its own fancy in its own way we have already note this characteristic in the work of the elizabethan dramatist who follow they own genius in opposition to all the law of the critic in coleridge we see this independence express in kublum khan and the ancient mariner two dream picture one of the populous orient the other of the lonely sea in wordsworth this literary independence lead he inward to the heart of common thing follow he own instinct as shakespeare do he too find tongue in tree book in the run brook sermon in stone and good in everything and so more than any other writer of the age he invest the common life of nature and the soul of common man and woman with glorious significance these two poet coleridge and wordsworth best represent the romantic genius of the age in which they live though scott have a greater literary reputation and byron and shelley have larger audience the second characteristic of this age be that it be emphatically a age of poetry the previous century with its practical outlook on life be largely one of prose but now as in the elizabethan age the young enthusiast turn as naturally to poetry as a happy man to sing the glory of the age be in the poetry of scott wordsworth coleridge byron shelley keat moore and southey of its prose work those of scott alone have attain a very wide reading though the essay of charle lamb and the novel of jane austen have slowly win for they author a secure place in the history of we literature coleridge and southey -lrb- who with wordsworth form the trio of so-called lake poet -rrb- write far more prose than poetry and southey 's prose be much better than he verse it be characteristic of the spirit of this age so different from we own that southey could say that in order to earn money he write in verse what would otherwise have be better write in prose it be during this period that woman assume for the first time a important place in we literature probably the chief reason for this interesting phenomenon lie in the fact that woman be for the first time give some slight chance of education of enter into the intellectual life of the race and as be always the case when woman be give anything like a fair opportunity she respond magnificently a secondary reason may be find in the nature of the age itself which be intensely emotional the french revolution stir all europe to its depths and during the follow half century every great movement in literature as in politics and religion be characterize by strong emotion which be all the more noticeable by contrast with the cold formal satiric spirit of the early eighteenth century as woman be naturally more emotional than man it may well be that the spirit of this emotional age attract she and give she the opportunity to express herself in literature as all strong emotion tend to extreme the age produce a new type of novel which seem rather hysterical now but which in its own day delighted multitude of reader whose nerve be somewhat excited and who revel in bogey story of supernatural terror mr anne radcliffe -lrb- 1764-1823 -rrb- be one of the most successful writer of this school of exaggerated romance she novel with they azure-eyed heroine haunt castle trapdoor bandit abduction rescue in the nick of time and a general medley of overwrought joy and horror -lrb- 219 -rrb- be immensely popular not only with the crowd of novel reader but also with man of unquestioned literary genius like scott and byron in marked contrast to these extravagant story be the enduring work of jane austen with she charming description of everyday life and of marium edgeworth whose wonderful picture of irish life suggest to walter scott the idea of write he scottish romance two other woman who attain a more or less lasting fame be hannah more poet dramatist and novelist and jane porter whose _ scottish chief _ and _ thaddeus of warsaw _ be still in demand in we library beside these be fanny burney -lrb- madame d'arblay -rrb- and several other writer whose work in the early part of the nineteenth century raise woman to the high place in literature which she have ever since maintain in this age literary criticism become firmly establish by the appearance of such magazine as the _ edinburgh review _ -lrb- 18o2 -rrb- _ the quarterly review _ -lrb- 1808 -rrb- _ blackwood 's magazine _ -lrb- 1817 -rrb- the _ westminster review _ -lrb- 1824 -rrb- _ the spectator _ -lrb- 1828 -rrb- _ the athenæum _ -lrb- 1828 -rrb- and _ fraser 's magazine _ -lrb- 1830 -rrb- these magazine edit by such man as franci jeffrey john wilson -lrb- who be know to we as christopher north -rrb- and john gibson lockhart who give we the _ life of scott _ exercise a immense influence on all subsequent literature at first they criticism be largely destructive as when jeffrey hammer scott wordsworth and byron most unmercifully and lockhart could find no good in either keat or tennyson but with add wisdom criticism assume its true function of construction and when these magazine begin to seek and to publish the work of unknown writer like hazlitt lamb and leigh hunt they discover the chief mission of the modern magazine which be to give every writer of ability the opportunity to make he work know to the world i the poet of romanticism william wordsworth -lrb- 1770-1850 -rrb- it be in 1797 that the new romantic movement in we literature assume definite form wordsworth and coleridge retire to the quantock hill somerset and there form the deliberate purpose to make literature adapt to interest mankind permanently which they declare classic poetry could never do help the two poet be wordsworth 's sister dorothy with a woman 's love for flower and all beautiful thing and a woman 's divine sympathy for human life even in its lowliest form though a silent partner she furnish perhaps the largest share of the inspiration which result in the famous _ lyrical ballad _ of 1798 in they partnership coleridge be to take up the supernatural or at least romantic while wordsworth be to give the charm of novelty to thing of everyday by awaken the mind 's attention from the lethargy of custom and direct it to the loveliness and the wonder of the world before we the whole spirit of they work be reflect in two poem of this remarkable little volume the rime of the ancient mariner which be coleridge 's masterpiece and line write a few mile above tintern abbey which express wordsworth 's poetical creed and which be one of the noblest and most significant of we poem that the _ lyrical ballad _ attract no attention -lrb- 220 -rrb- and be practically ignore by a public that would soon go into rapture over byron 's _ childe harold _ and _ don juan _ be of small consequence many man will hurry a mile to see skyrocket who never notice orion and the pleiade from they own doorstep have wordsworth and coleridge write only this one little book they would still be among the representative writer of a age that proclaim the final triumph of romanticism life of wordsworth to understand the life of he who in tennyson 's word utter nothing base it be well to read first _ the prelude _ which record the impression make upon wordsworth 's mind from he earliest recollection until he full manhood in 1805 when the poem be complete -lrb- 221 -rrb- outwardly he long and uneventful life divide itself naturally into four period : -lrb- 1 -rrb- he childhood and youth in the cumberland hill from 1770 to 1787 -lrb- 2 -rrb- a period of uncertainty of storm and stress include he university life at cambridge he travels abroad and he revolutionary experience from 1787 to 1797 -lrb- 3 -rrb- a short but significant period of find himself and he work from 1797 to 1799 -lrb- 4 -rrb- a long period of retirement in the northern lake region where he be bear and where for a full half century he live so close to nature that she influence be reflect in all he poetry when one have outline these four period he have tell almost all that can be tell of a life which be mark not by event but largely by spiritual experience wordsworth be bear in 1770 at cockermouth cumberland where the derwent fairest of all river love to blend he murmur with my nurse 's song and from he alder shades and rocky fall and from he ford and shallows send a voice that flow along my dream it be almost a shock to one who know wordsworth only by he calm and noble poetry to read that he be of a moody and violent temper and that he mother despair of he alone among she five child she die when he be but eight year old but not till she have exert a influence which last all he life so that he could remember she as the heart of all we learning and we love the father die some six year later and the orphan be take in charge by relative who send he to school at hawkshead in the beautiful lake region here apparently the unroofed school of nature attract he more than the discipline of the classic and he learn more eagerly from the flower and hill and star than from he book but one must read wordsworth 's own record in _ the prelude _ to appreciate this three thing in this poem must impress even the casual reader : first wordsworth love to be alone and be never lonely with nature second like every other child who spend much time alone in the wood and field he feel the presence of some living spirit real though unseen and companionable though silent third he impression be exactly like we own and delightfully familiar when he tell of the long summer day spend in swim bask in the sun and questing over the hill or of the winter night when on he skate he chase the reflection of a star in the black ice or of he explore the lake in a boat and get suddenly frighten when the world grow big and strange -- in all this he be simply recall a multitude of we own vague happy memory of childhood he go out into the wood at night to tend he woodcock snare he run across another boy 's snare follow they find a woodcock catch take it hurry away through the night and then i hear among the solitary hill low breathing come after I and sound of undistinguishable motion that be like a mental photograph any boy who have come home through the wood at night will recognize it instantly again he tell as of go bird 's - nesting on the cliff : oh when i have hang above the raven 's nest by knot of grass and half-inch fissure in the slippery rock but ill-sustained and almost -lrb- so it seem -rrb- suspend by the blast that blow amain shoulder the naked crag -- oh at that time while on the perilous ridge i hang alone with what strange utterance do the loud dry wind blow through my ear the sky seem not a sky of earth -- and with what motion move the cloud no man can read such record without find he own boyhood again and he own abound joy of life in the poet 's early impression the second period of wordsworth 's life begin with he university course at cambridge in 1787 in the third book of _ the prelude _ we find a dispassionate account of student life with its trivial occupation its pleasure and general aimlessness wordsworth prove to be a very ordinary scholar follow he own genius rather than the curriculum and look forward more eagerly to he vacation among the hill than to he examination perhaps the most interesting thing in he life at cambridge be he fellowship with the young political enthusiast whose spirit be express in he remarkable poem on the french revolution -- a poem which be better than a volume of history to show the hope and ambition that stir all europe in the first day of that mighty upheaval wordsworth make two trip to france in 1790 and 1791 see thing chiefly through the rosy spectacles of the young oxford republican on he second visit he join the girondist or the moderate republican and only the decision of he relative who cut off he allowance and hurry he back to england prevent he go headlong to the guillotine with the leader of he party two thing rapidly cool wordsworth 's revolutionary enthusiasm and end the only dramatic interest of he placid life one be the excess of the revolution itself and especially the execution of loui xvi the other be the rise of napoleon and the slavish adulation accord by france to this most vulgar and dangerous of tyrant he coolness soon grow to disgust and opposition as show by he subsequent poem and this bring upon he the censure of shelley byron and other extremist though it gain the friendship of scott who from the first have no sympathy with the revolution or with the young english enthusiast of the decisive period of wordsworth 's life when he be live with he sister dorothy and with coleridge at alfoxden we have already speak the importance of this decision to give himself to poetry be evident when we remember that at thirty year of age he be without money or any definite aim or occupation in life he consider the law but confess he have no sympathy for its contradictory precept and practice he consider the ministry but though strongly incline to the church he feel himself not good enough for the sacred office once he have want to be a soldier and serve he country but have waver at the prospect of die of disease in a foreign land and throw away he life without glory or profit to anybody a apparent accident which look more to we like a special providence determine he course he have take care of a young friend raisley calvert who die of consumption and leave wordsworth heir to a few hundred pound and to the request that he should give he life to poetry it be this unexpected gift which enable wordsworth to retire from the world and follow he genius all he life he be poor and live in a atmosphere of plain living and high think he poetry bring he almost nothing in the way of money reward and it be only by a series of happy accident that he be enable to continue he work one of these accident be that he become a tory and soon accept the office of a distributor of stamp and be later appoint poet laureate by the government -- which occasion browning 's famous but ill-considered poem of the lose leader : just for a handful of silver he leave we just for a riband to stick in he coat the last half century of wordsworth 's life in which he retire to he beloved lake district and live successively at grasmere and rydal mount remind one strongly of browning 's long struggle for literary recognition it be mark by the same steadfast purpose the same trust ideal the same continuous work and the same tardy recognition by the public he poetry be mercilessly ridicule by nearly all the magazine critic who seize upon the worst of he work as a standard of judgment and book after book of poem appear without meet any success save the approval of a few loyal friend without doubt or impatience he continue he work trust to the future to recognize and approve it he attitude here remind one strongly of the poor old soldier whom he meet in the hill -lrb- 222 -rrb- who refuse to beg or to mention he long service or the neglect of he country say with noble simplicity my trust be in the god of heaven and in the eye of he who pass I such work and patience be certain of they reward and long before wordsworth 's death he feel the warm sunshine of general approval the wave of popular enthusiasm for scott and byron pass by as they limitation be recognize and wordsworth be hail by critic as the first living poet and one of the greatest that england have ever produce on the death of southey -lrb- 1843 -rrb- he be make poet laureate against he own inclination the late excessive praise leave he quite as unmoved as the first excessive neglect the steady decline in the quality of he work be due not as might be expect to self-satisfaction at success but rather to he intense conservatism to he live too much alone and fail to test he work by the standard and judgment of other literary man he die tranquilly in 1850 at the age of eighty year and be bury in the churchyard at grasmere such be the brief outward record of the world 's greatest interpreter of nature 's message and only one who be acquaint with both nature and the poet can realize how inadequate be any biography for the best thing about wordsworth must always remain unsaid it be a comfort to know that he life noble sincere heroically happy never contradict he message poetry be he life he soul be in all he work and only by read what he have write can we understand the man the poetry of wordsworth there be often a sense of disappointment when one read wordsworth for the first time and this lead we to speak first of two difficulty which may easily prevent a just appreciation of the poet 's worth the first difficulty be in the reader who be often puzzle by wordsworth 's absolute simplicity we be so use to stage effect in poetry that beauty unadorned be apt to escape we notice -- like wordsworth 's lucy : a violet by a mossy stone half hide from the eye fair as a star when only one be shine in the sky wordsworth set himself to the task of free poetry from all its conceit of speak the language of simple truth and of portray man and nature as they be and in this good work we be apt to miss the beauty the passion the intensity that hide themselves under he simplest line the second difficulty be in the poet not in the reader it must be confess that wordsworth be not always melodious that he be seldom graceful and only occasionally inspire when he be inspired few poet can be compare with he at other time the bulk of he verse be so wooden and prosy that we wonder how a poet could have write it moreover he be absolutely without humor and so he often fail to see the small step that separate the sublime from the ridiculous in no other way can we explain the idiot boy or pardon the serious absurdity of peter bell and he grieving jackass on account of these difficulty it be well to avoid at first the longer work and begin with a good book of selection -lrb- 223 -rrb- when we read these exquisite shorter poem with they noble line that live forever in we memory we realize that wordsworth be the greatest poet of nature that we literature have produce if we go further and study the poem that impress we we shall find four remarkable characteristic : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wordsworth be sensitive as a barometer to every subtle change in the world about he in _ the prelude _ he compare himself to a æolian harp which answer with harmony to every touch of the wind and the figure be strikingly accurate as well as interesting for there be hardly a sight or a sound from a violet to a mountain and from a bird note to the thunder of the cataract that be not reflect in some beautiful way in wordsworth 's poetry -lrb- 2 -rrb- of all the poet who have write of nature there be none that compare with he in the truthfulness of he representation burn like gray be apt to read he own emotion into natural object so that there be more of the poet than of nature even in he mouse and mountain daisy but wordsworth give you the bird and the flower the wind and the tree and the river just as they be and be content to let they speak they own message -lrb- 3 -rrb- no other poet ever find such abundant beauty in the common world he have not only sight but insight that be he not only see clearly and describe accurately but penetrate to the heart of thing and always find some exquisite meaning that be not write on the surface it be idle to specify or to quote line on flower or star on snow or vapor nothing be ugly or commonplace in he world on the contrary there be hardly one natural phenomenon which he have not glorified by point out some beauty that be hide from we eye -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be the _ life _ of nature which be everywhere recognize not mere growth and cell change but sentient personal life and the recognition of this personality in nature characterize all the world 's great poetry in he childhood wordsworth regard natural object the stream the hill the flower even the wind as he companion and with he mature belief that all nature be the reflection of the living god it be inevitable that he poetry should thrill with the sense of a spirit that roll through all thing cowper burn keat tennyson -- all these poet give you the outward aspect of nature in vary degree but wordsworth give you she very life and the impression of some personal living spirit that meet and accompany the man who go alone through the wood and field we shall hardly find even in the philosophy of leibnitz or in the nature myth of we indian any such impression of live nature as this poet awaken in we and that suggest another delightful characteristic of wordsworth 's poetry namely that he seem to awaken rather than create a impression he stir we memory deeply so that in read he we live once more in the vague beautiful wonderland of we own childhood such be the philosophy of wordsworth 's nature poetry if we search now for he philosophy of human life we shall find four more doctrine which rest upon he basal conception that man be not apart from nature but be the very life of she life -lrb- 1 -rrb- in childhood man be sensitive as a wind harp to all natural influence he be a epitome of the gladness and beauty of the world wordsworth explain this gladness and this sensitiveness to nature by the doctrine that the child come straight from the creator of nature : we birth be but a sleep and a forget : the soul that rise with we we life 's star have have elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar : not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trail cloud of glory do we come from god who be we home in this exquisite ode which he call intimation of immortality from recollection of early childhood -lrb- 1807 -rrb- wordsworth sum up he philosophy of childhood and he may possibly be indebted here to the poet vaughan who more than a century before have proclaim in the retreat the same doctrine this kinship with nature and with god which glorify childhood ought to extend through a man 's whole life and ennoble it this be the teaching of tintern abbey in which the best part of we life be show to be the result of natural influence accord to wordsworth society and the crowded unnatural life of city tend to weaken and pervert humanity and a return to natural and simple living be the only remedy for human wretchedness -lrb- 2 -rrb- the natural instinct and pleasure of childhood be the true standard of a man 's happiness in this life all artificial pleasure soon grow tiresome the natural pleasure which a man so easily neglect in he work be the chief mean by which we may expect permanent and increase joy in tintern abbey the rainbow ode to duty and intimation of immortality we see this plain teaching but we can hardly read one of wordsworth 's page without find it slip in unobtrusively like the fragrance of a wild flower -lrb- 3 -rrb- the _ truth _ of humanity that be the common life which labor and love and share the general heritage of smile and tear be the only subject of permanent literary interest burn and the early poet of the revival begin the good work of show the romantic interest of common life and wordsworth continue it in michael the solitary reaper to a highland girl step westward _ the excursion _ and a score of lesser poem joy and sorrow not of prince or hero but in widest commonalty spread be he theme and the hidden purpose of many of he poem be to show that the keynote of all life be happiness -- not a occasional thing the result of chance or circumstance but a heroic thing to be win as one would win any other success by work and patience -lrb- 4 -rrb- to this natural philosophy of man wordsworth add a mystic element the result of he own belief that in every natural object there be a reflection of the living god nature be everywhere transfuse and illumine by spirit man also be a reflection of the divine spirit and we shall never understand the emotion rouse by a flower or a sunset until we learn that nature appeal through the eye of man to he inner spirit in a word nature must be spiritually discern in tintern abbey the spiritual appeal of nature be express in almost every line but the mystic conception of man be see more clearly in intimation of immortality which emerson call the high-water mark of poetry in the nineteenth century in this last splendid ode wordsworth add to he spiritual interpretation of nature and man the alluring doctrine of preëxistence which have appeal so powerfully to hindoo and greek in turn and which make of human life a continuous immortal thing without end or begin wordsworth 's longer poem since they contain much that be prosy and uninteresting may well be leave till after we have read the ode sonnet and short descriptive poem that have make he famous as show a certain heroic cast of wordsworth 's mind it be interesting to learn that the greater part of he work include _ the prelude _ and _ the excursion _ be intend for a place in a single great poem to be call _ the recluse _ which should treat of nature man and society _ the prelude _ treat of the growth of a poet 's mind be to introduce the work the _ home at grasmere _ which be the first book of _ the recluse _ be not publish till 1888 long after the poet 's death _ the excursion _ -lrb- 1814 -rrb- be the second book of _ the recluse _ and the third be never complete though wordsworth intend to include most of he shorter poem in this third part and so make a immense personal epic of a poet 's life and work it be perhaps just as well that the work remain unfinished the best of he work appear in the _ lyrical ballad _ -lrb- 1798 -rrb- and in the sonnet ode and lyric of the next ten year though the duddon sonnet -lrb- 1820 -rrb- to a skylark -lrb- 1825 -rrb- and yarrow revisit -lrb- 1831 -rrb- show that he retain till past sixty much of he youthful enthusiasm in he later year however he perhaps write too much he poetry like he prose become dull and unimaginative and we miss the flash of insight the tender memory of childhood and the recurrence of noble line -- each one a poem -- that constitute the surprise and the delight of read wordsworth the outward show of sky and earth of hill and valley he have view and impulse of deeper birth have come to he in solitude in common thing that round we lie some random truth he can impart -- the harvest of a quiet eye that brood and sleep on he own heart samuel taylor coleridge -lrb- 1772-1834 -rrb- a grief without a pang void dark and drear a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief which find no natural outlet no relief in word or sigh or tear in the wonderful ode to dejection from which the above fragment be take we have a single strong impression of coleridge 's whole life -- a sad broken tragic life in marked contrast with the peaceful existence of he friend wordsworth for himself during the greater part of he life the poet have only grief and remorse as he portion but for everybody else for the audience that be charm by the brilliancy of he literary lecture for the friend who gather about he to be inspire by he ideal and conversation and for all he reader who find unending delight in the little volume which hold he poetry he have and still have a cheer message full of beauty and hope and inspiration such be coleridge a man of grief who make the world glad life in 1772 there live in ottery st mary devonshire a queer little man the rev john coleridge vicar of the parish church and master of the local grammar school in the former capacity he preach profound sermon quote to open-mouthed rustic long passage from the hebrew which he tell they be the very tongue of the holy ghost in the latter capacity he write for he boy a new latin grammar to mitigate some of the difficulty of traverse that terrible jungle by means of ingenious bypath and short cut for instance when he boy find the ablative a somewhat difficult case to understand he tell they to think of it as the _ quale-quare-quidditive _ case which of course make its meaning perfectly clear in both these capacity the elder coleridge be a sincere man gentle and kindly whose memory be like a religion to he son and daughter in that same year be bear samuel taylor coleridge the youngest of thirteen child he be a extraordinarily precocious child who could read at three year of age and who before he be five have read the bible and the arabian night and could remember a astonishing amount from both book from three to six he attend a dame school and from six till nine -lrb- when he father die and leave the family destitute -rrb- he be in he father 's school learn the classic read a enormous quantity of english book avoid novel and delight in cumbrous theological and metaphysical treatise at ten he be send to the charity school of christ 's hospital london where he meet charle lamb who record he impression of the place and of coleridge in one of he famous essay -lrb- 224 -rrb- coleridge seem to have remain in this school for seven or eight year without visit he home -- a poor neglect boy whose comfort and entertainment be all within himself just as when a little child he use to wander over the field with a stick in he hand slash the top from weed and thistle and think himself to be the mighty champion of christendom against the infidel so now he would lie on the roof of the school forget the play of he fellow and the roar of the london street watch the white cloud drift over and follow they in spirit into all sort of romantic adventure at nineteen this hopeless dreamer who have read more book than a old professor enter cambridge as a charity student he remain for nearly three year then run away because of a trifling debt and enlist in the dragoon where he serve several month before he be discover and bring back to the university he leave in 1794 without take he degree and presently we find he with the youthful southey -- a kindred spirit who have be fire to wild enthusiasm by the french revolution -- found he famous pantisocracy for the regeneration of human society the fall of robespierre a poem compose by the two enthusiast be full of the new revolutionary spirit the pantisocracy on the bank of the susquehanna be to be a ideal community in which the citizen combine farming and literature and work be to be limit to two hour each day moreover each member of the community be to marry a good woman and take she with he the two poet obey the latter injunction first marry two sister and then find that they have no money to pay even they travel expense to the new utopia during all the rest of he career a tragic weakness of will take possession of coleridge make it impossible for he with all he genius and learn to hold himself steadily to any one work or purpose he study in germany work as a private secretary till the drudgery wear upon he free spirit then he go to rome and remain for two year lose in study later he start _ the friend _ a paper devote to truth and liberty lecture on poetry and the fine art to enraptured audience in london until he frequent failure to meet he engagement scatter he hearer be offer a excellent position and a half interest -lrb- amount to some # 2000 -rrb- in the _ morning post _ and _ the courier _ but decline it say that i would not give up the country and the lazy reading of old folio for two thousand time two thousand pound -- in short that beyond # 350 a year i consider money a real evil he family meanwhile be almost entirely neglect he live apart follow he own way and the wife and child be leave in charge of he friend southey need money he be on the point of become a unitarian minister when a small pension from two friend enable he to live for a few year without regular employment a terrible shadow in coleridge 's life be the apparent cause of most of he dejection in early life he suffer from neuralgia and to ease the pain begin to use opiate the result on such a temperament be almost inevitable he become a slave to the drug habit he naturally weak will lose all its directing and sustain force until after fifteen year of pain and struggle and despair he give up and put himself in charge of a physician one mr gillman of highgate carlyle who visit he at this time call he a king of man but record that he give you the idea of a life that have be full of suffering a life heavy-laden half-vanquished still swim painfully in sea of manifold physical and other bewilderment the shadow be dark indeed but there be gleam of sunshine that occasionally break through the cloud one of these be he association with wordsworth and he sister dorothy in the quantock hill out of which come the famous _ lyrical ballad _ of 1798 another be he loyal devotion to poetry for its own sake with the exception of he tragedy _ remorse _ which through byron 's influence be accept at drury lane theater and for which he be pay # 400 he receive almost nothing for he poetry indeed he seem not to have desire it for he say : poetry have be to I its own exceed great reward it have soothe my affliction it have multiply and refine my enjoyment it have endear solitude and it have give I the habit of wish to discover the good and the beautiful in all that meet and surround I one can better understand he exquisite verse after such a declaration a third ray of sunlight come from the admiration of he contemporary for though he write comparatively little he be by he talent and learn a leader among literary man and he conversation be as eagerly listen to as be those of dr johnson wordsworth say of he that though other man of the age have do some wonderful thing coleridge be the only wonderful man he have ever know of he lecture on literature a contemporary say : he word seem to flow as from a person repeat with grace and energy some delightful poem and of he conversation it be record : throughout a long-drawn summer 's day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tone concern thing human and divine marshal all history harmonize all experiment probe the depths of you consciousness and reveal vision of glory and terror to the imagination the last bright ray of sunlight come from coleridge 's own soul from the gentle kindly nature which make man love and respect he in spite of he weakness and which cause lamb to speak of he humorously as a archangel a little damaged the universal law of suffer seem to be that it refine and soften humanity and coleridge be no exception to the law in he poetry we find a note of human sympathy more tender and profound than can be find in wordsworth or indeed in any other of the great english poet even in he later poem when he have lose he first inspiration and something of the splendid imaginative power that make he work equal to the best of blake 's we find a soul tender triumphant quiet in the stillness of a great peace he die in 1834 and be bury in highgate church the last stanza of the boatman 's song in _ remorse _ serve better to express the world 's judgment than any epitaph : hark the cadence die away on the quiet moon-lit sea the boatman rest they oar and say _ miserere dominus _ work of coleridge the work of coleridge naturally divide themselves into three class -- the poetic the critical and the philosophical correspond to the early the middle and the later period of he career of he poetry stopford brooke well say : all that he do excellently might be bind up in twenty page but it should be bind in pure gold he early poem show the influence of gray and blake especially of the latter when coleridge begin he day dream with the line my eye make picture when they be shut we recall instantly blake 's haunting _ song of innocence _ but there be this difference between the two poet -- in blake we have only a dreamer in coleridge we have the rare combination of the dreamer and the profound scholar the quality of this early poetry with its strong suggestion of blake may be see in such poem as a day dream the devil 's thought the suicide 's argument and the wanderings of cain he later poem wherein we see he imagination bridle by thought and study but still run very freely may best be appreciate in kublum khan christabel and the rime of the ancient mariner it be difficult to criticise such poem one can only read they and wonder at they melody and at the vague suggestion which they conjure up in the mind kublum khan be a fragment painting a gorgeous oriental dream picture such as one might see in a October sunset the whole poem come to coleridge one morning when he have fall asleep over purcha and upon awaken he begin to write hastily in xanadu do kubla khan a stately pleasure-dome decree : where alph the sacred river run through cavern measureless to man down to a sunless sea he be interrupt after fifty-four line be write and he never finish the poem christabel be also a fragment which seem to have be plan as the story of a pure young girl who fall under the spell of a sorcerer in the shape of the woman geraldine it be full of a strange melody and contain many passage of exquisite poetry but it tremble with a strange unknown horror and so suggest the supernatural terror of the popular hysterical novel to which we have refer on this account it be not wholesome reading though one fly in the face of swinburne and of other critic by venture to suggest such a thing the rime of the ancient mariner be coleridge 's chief contribution to the _ lyrical ballad _ of 1798 and be one of the world 's masterpiece though it introduce the reader to a supernatural realm with a phantom ship a crew of dead man the overhang curse of the albatross the polar spirit and the magic breeze it nevertheless manage to create a sense of absolute reality concern these manifest absurdity all the mechanism of the poem its meter rime and melody be perfect and some of its description of the lonely sea have never be equal perhaps we should say suggestion rather than description for coleridge never describe thing but make a suggestion always brief and always exactly right and we own imagination instantly supply the detail it be useless to quote fragment one must read the entire poem if he read nothing else of the romantic school of poetry among coleridge 's shorter poem there be a wide variety and each reader must be leave largely to follow he own taste the beginner will do well to read a few of the early poem to which we have refer and then try the ode to france youth and age dejection love poem fear in solitude religious musing work without hope and the glorious hymn before sunrise in the vale of chamounus one exquisite little poem from the latin the virgin 's cradle hymn and he version of schiller 's _ wallenstein _ show coleridge 's remarkable power as a translator the latter be one of the best poetical translation in we literature of coleridge 's prose work the _ biographium literarium or sketch of my literary life and opinion _ -lrb- 1817 -rrb- he collect _ lecture on shakespeare _ -lrb- 1849 -rrb- and _ aid to reflection _ -lrb- 1825 -rrb- be the most interesting from a literary view point the first be a explanation and criticism of wordsworth 's theory of poetry and contain more sound sense and illuminating idea on the general subject of poetry than any other book in we language the _ lecture _ as refreshing as a west wind in midsummer be remarkable for they attempt to sweep away the arbitrary rule which for two century have stand in the way of literary criticism of shakespeare in order to study the work themselves no finer analysis and appreciation of the master 's genius have ever be write in he philosophical work coleridge introduce the idealistic philosophy of germany into england he set himself in line with berkeley and squarely against bentham malthus mill and all the materialistic tendency which be and still be the bane of english philosophy the _ aid to reflection _ be coleridge 's most profound work but be more interesting to the student of religion and philosophy than to the reader of literature robert southey -lrb- 1774-1843 -rrb- closely associate with wordsworth and coleridge be robert southey and the three on account of they residence in the northern lake district be refer to contemptuously as the laker by the scottish magazine reviewer southey hold he place in this group more by personal association than by he literary gift he be bear at bristol in 1774 study at westminster school and at oxford where he find himself in perpetual conflict with the authority on account of he independent view he finally leave the university and join coleridge in he scheme of a pantisocracy for more than fifty year he labor steadily at literature refuse to consider any other occupation he consider himself seriously as one of the greatest writer of the day and a reading of he ballad -- which connect he at once with the romantic school -- lead we to think that have he write less he might possibly have justify he own opinion of himself unfortunately he could not wait for inspiration be oblige to support not only he own family but also in large measure that of he friend coleridge southey gradually surround himself with one of the most extensive library in england and set himself to the task of of write something every work day the result of he industry be one hundred and nine volume besides some hundred and fifty article for the magazine most of which be now utterly forget he most ambitious poem be _ thalaba _ a tale of arabian enchantment _ the curse of kehama _ a medley of hindoo mythology _ madoc _ a legend of a welsh prince who discover the western world and _ roderick _ a tale of the last of the goth all these and many more although contain some excellent passage be on the whole exaggerated and unreal both in manner and in matter southey write far better prose than poetry and he admirable _ life of nelson _ be still often read besides these be he _ life of british admiral _ he life of cowper and wesley and he history of brazil and of the peninsular war southey be make poet laureate in 1813 and be the first to raise that office from the low estate into which it have fall since the death of dryden the opening line of thalaba begin how beautiful be night a dewy freshness fill the silent air be still sometimes quote and a few of he best know short poem like the scholar auld cloot the well of st keyne the inchcape rock and lodore will repay the curious reader the beauty of southey 's character he patience and helpfulness make he a worthy associate of the two greater poet with whom he be generally name walter scott -lrb- 1771-1832 -rrb- we have already call attention to two significant movement of the eighteenth century which we must for a moment recall if we be to appreciate scott not simply as a delightful teller of tale but as a tremendous force in modern literature the first be the triumph of romantic poetry in wordsworth and coleridge the second be the success of we first english novelist and the popularization of literature by take it from the control of a few patron and critic and put it into the hand of the people as one of the force which mold we modern life scott be a epitome of both these movement the poetry of wordsworth and coleridge be read by a select few but scott 's _ marmion _ and _ lady of the lake _ arouse a whole nation to enthusiasm and for the first time romantic poetry become really popular so also the novel have be content to paint man and woman of the present until the wonderful series of waverley novel appear when suddenly by the magic of this wizard of the north all history seem change the past which have hitherto appear as a dreary region of dead hero become alive again and fill with a multitude of man and woman who have the surprising charm of reality it be of small consequence that scott 's poetry and prose be both faulty that he poem be read chiefly for the story rather than for they poetic excellence and that much of the evident crudity and barbarism of the middle age be ignore or forget in scott 's writings by they vigor they freshness they rapid action and they breezy out-of-door atmosphere scott 's novel attract thousand of reader who else have know nothing of the delight of literature he be therefore the greatest known factor in establish and in popularize that romantic element in prose and poetry which have be for a hundred year the chief characteristic of we literature life scott be bear in edinburgh on August 15 1771 on both he mother 's and father 's side he be descend from old border family distinguish more for they feud and fight than for they intellectual attainment he father be a barrister a just man who often lose client by advise they to be first of all honest in they lawsuit he mother be a woman of character and education strongly imaginative a teller of tale which stir young walter 's enthusiasm by reveal the past as a world of live hero as a child scott be lame and delicate and be therefore send away from the city to be with he grandmother in the open country at sandy knowe in roxburghshire near the tweed this grandmother be a perfect treasure - house of legend concern the old border feud from she wonderful tale scott develop that intense love of scottish history and tradition which characterize all he work by the time he be eight year old when he return to edinburgh scott 's taste be fix for life at the high school he be a fair scholar but without enthusiasm be more interested in border story than in the text-book he remain at school only six or seven year and then enter he father 's office to study law at the same time attend lecture at the university he keep this up for some six year without develop any interest in he profession not even when he pass he examination and be admit to the bar in 1792 after nineteen year of desultory work in which he show far more zeal in gathering highland legend than in gain client he have win two small legal office which give he enough income to support he comfortably he home meanwhile be at ashestiel on the tweed where all he best poetry be write scott 's literary work begin with the translation from the german of bürger 's romantic ballad of _ lenore _ -lrb- 1796 -rrb- and of goethe 's _ götz von berlichingen _ -lrb- 1799 -rrb- but there be romance enough in he own loved highland and in 1802-1803 appear three volume of he _ minstrelsy of the scottish border _ which he have be collect for many year in 1805 when scott be 34 year old appear he first original work _ the lay of the last minstrel _ its success be immediate and when _ marmion _ -lrb- 1808 -rrb- and _ the lady of the lake _ -lrb- 1810 -rrb- arouse scotland and england to intense enthusiasm and bring unexpected fame to the author -- without in the least spoil he honest and lovable nature -- scott gladly resolve to abandon the law in which he have win scant success and give himself wholly to literature unfortunately however in order to increase he earnings he enter secretly into partnership with the firm of constable and the brother ballantyne as printer-publisher -- a sad mistake indeed and the cause of that tragedy which close the life of scotland 's greatest writer the year 1811 be remarkable for two thing in scott 's life in this year he seem to have realize that notwithstanding the success of he poem he have not yet find himself that he be not a poetic genius like burn that in he first three poem he have practically exhaust he material though he still continue to write verse and that if he be to keep he popularity he must find some other work the fact that only a year later byron suddenly become the popular favorite show how correctly scott have judge himself and the read public which be even more fickle than usual in this emotional age in that same year 1811 scott buy the estate of abbotsford on the tweed with which place he name be forever associate here he begin to spend large sum and to dispense the generous hospitality of a scotch laird of which he have be dream for year in 1820 he be make a baronet and he new title of sir walter come nearer to turn he honest head than have all he literary success he business partnership be keep secret and during all the year when the waverley novel be the most popular book in the world they authorship remain unknown for scott deem it beneath the dignity of he title to earn money by business or literature and seek to give the impression that the enormous sum spend at abbotsford in improve the estate and in entertaining lavishly be part of the dignity of the position and come from ancestral source it be the success of byron 's _ childe harold _ and the comparative failure of scott 's later poem _ rokeby _ _ the bridal of triermain _ and _ the lord of the isle _ which lead we author into the new field where he be to be without a rival rummage through a cabinet one day in search of some fishing tackle scott find the manuscript of a story which he have begin and lay aside nine year before he read this old story eagerly as if it have be another 's work finish it within three week and publish it without sign he name the success of this first novel _ waverley _ -lrb- 1814 -rrb- be immediate and unexpected its great sale and the general chorus of praise for its unknown author be without precedent and when _ guy manner the antiquary black dwarf old mortality rob roy _ and _ the heart of midlothian _ appear within the next four year england 's delight and wonder know no bound not only at home but also on the continent large number of these fresh and fascinating story be sell as fast as they could be print during the seventeen year which follow the appearance of _ waverley _ scott write on a average nearly two novel per year create a unusual number of character and illustrate many period of scotch english and french history from the time of the crusade to the fall of the stuart in addition to these historical novel he write _ tale of a grandfather demonology and witchcraft _ biography of dryden and of swift the _ life of napoleon _ in nine volume and a large number of article for the review and magazine it be a extraordinary amount of literary work but it be not quite so rapid and spontaneous as it seem he have be very diligent in look up old record and we must remember that in nearly all he poem and novel scott be draw upon a fund of legend tradition history and poetry which he have be gather for forty year and which he memory enable he to produce at will with almost the accuracy of a encyclopedia for the first six year scott hold himself to scottish history give we in nine remarkable novel the whole of scotland its heroism its superb faith and enthusiasm and especially its clannish loyalty to its hereditary chief give we also all party and character from covenanter to royalist and from king to beggar after read these nine volume we know scotland and scotchman as we can know they in no other way in 1819 he turn abruptly from scotland and in _ ivanhoe _ the most popular of he work show what a mine of neglect wealth lay just beneath the surface of english history it be hard to realize now as we read its rapid melodramatic action its vivid portrayal of saxon and norman character and all its picturesque detail that it be write rapidly at a time when the author be suffer from disease and could hardly repress a occasional groan from find its way into the rapid dictation it stand to-day as the best example of the author 's own theory that the will of a man be enough to hold he steadily against all obstacle to the task of do what he have a mind to do _ kenilworth nigel peveril _ and _ woodstock _ all write in the next few year show he grasp of the romantic side of english annals _ count robert _ and _ the talisman _ show he enthusiasm for the heroic side of the crusader ' nature and _ quentin durward _ and _ anne of geierstein _ suggest another mine of romance which he discover in french history for twenty year scott labor steadily at literature with the double object of give what be in he and of earn large sum to support the lavish display which he deem essential to a laird of scotland in 1826 while he be blithely at work on _ woodstock _ the crash come not even the vast earnings of all these popular novel could longer keep the wretched business of ballantyne on its foot and the firm fail after year of mismanagement though a silent partner scott assume full responsibility and at fifty-five year of age sick suffering and with all he best work behind he he find himself face a debt of over half a million dollar the firm could easily have compromise with its creditor but scott refuse to hear of bankruptcy law under which he could have take refuge he assume the entire debt as a personal one and set resolutely to work to pay every penny time be indeed change in england when instead of a literary genius starve until some wealthy patron give he a pension this man aid by he pen alone could confidently begin to earn that enormous amount of money and this be one of the unnoticed result of the popularization of literature without a doubt scott would have accomplish the task have he be grant only a few year of health he still live at abbotsford which he have offer to he creditor but which they generously refuse to accept and in two year by miscellaneous work have pay some two hundred thousand dollar of he debt nearly half of this sum come from he _ life of napoleon _ a new edition of the waverley novel appear which be very successful financially and scott have every reason to hope that he would soon face the world owe no man a penny when he suddenly break under the strain in 1830 occur a stroke of paralysis from which he never fully recover though after a little time he be again at work dictate with splendid patience and resolution he write in he diary at this time : the blow be a stunning one i suppose for i scarcely feel it it be singular but it come with as little surprise as if i have a remedy ready yet god know i be at sea in the dark and the vessel leaky it be good to remember that government be not always ungrateful and to record that when it become know that a voyage to italy might improve scott 's health the british government promptly place a naval vessel at the disposal of a man who have lead no army to the slaughter but have only given pleasure to multitude of peaceable man and woman by he story he visit malta naple and rome but in he heart he long for scotland and turn homeward after a few month of exile the river tweed the scotch hill the tree of abbotsford the joyous clamor of he dog bring forth the first exclamation of delight which have pass scott 's lip since he sail away he die in September of the same year 1832 and be bury with he ancestor in the old dryburgh abbey work of scott scott 's work be of a kind which the critic gladly pass over leave each reader to he own joyous and uninstructed opinion from a literary view point the work be faulty enough if one be look for fault but it be well to remember that they be intend to give delight and that they rarely fail of they object when one have read the stir _ marmion _ or the more enduring _ lady of the lake _ feel the heroism of the crusader in _ the talisman _ the picturesqueness of chivalry in _ ivanhoe _ the nobleness of soul of a scotch peasant girl in _ the heart of midlothian _ and the quality of scotch faith in _ old mortality _ then he own opinion of scott 's genius will be of more value than all the criticism that have ever be write at the outset we must confess frankly that scott 's poetry be not artistic in the highest sense and that it lack the deeply imaginative and suggestive quality which make a poem the noblest and most enduring work of humanity we read it now not for its poetic excellence but for its absorb story interest even so it serve a admirable purpose _ marmion _ and _ the lady of the lake _ which be often the first long poem read by the beginner in literature almost invariably lead to a deeper interest in the subject and many reader owe to these poem a introduction to the delight of poetry they be a excellent beginning therefore for young reader since they be almost certain to hold the attention and to lead indirectly to a interest in other and better poem aside from this scott 's poetry be mark by vigor and youthful abandon its interest lie in its vivid picture its heroic character and especially in its rapid action and succession of adventure which hold and delight we still as they hold and delight the first wonder reader and one find here and there terse description or snatch of song and ballad like the boat song and lochinvar which be among the best know in we literature in he novel scott plainly write too rapidly and too much while a genius of the first magnitude the definition of genius as the infinite capacity for take pain hardly belong to he for detail of life and history for finely draw character and for trace the logical consequence of human action he have usually no inclination he sketch a character roughly plunge he into the midst of stir incident and the action of the story carry we on breathlessly to the end so he story be largely adventure story at the best and it be this element of adventure and glorious action rather than the study of character which make scott a perennial favorite of the young the same element of excitement be what cause mature reader to turn from scott to better novelist who have more power to delineate human character and to create or discover a romantic interest in the incident of everyday life rather than in stir adventure -lrb- 225 -rrb- notwithstanding these limitation it be well -- especially in these day when we hear that scott be outgrow -- to emphasize four noteworthy thing that he accomplish -lrb- 1 -rrb- he create the historical novel -lrb- 226 -rrb- and all novelist of the last century who draw upon history for they character and event be follower of scott and acknowledge he mastery -lrb- 2 -rrb- he novel be on a vast scale cover a very wide range of action and be concern with public rather than with private interest so with the exception of _ the bride of lammermoor _ the love story in he novel be generally pale and feeble but the strife and passion of big party be magnificently portray a glance over even the title of he novel show how the heroic side of history for over six hundred year find expression in he page and all the party of these six century -- crusader covenanter cavalier roundhead papist jew gypsy rebel -- start into life again and fight or give a reason for the faith that be in they no other novelist in england and only balzac in france approach scott in the scope of he narrative -lrb- 3 -rrb- scott be the first novelist in any language to make the scene a essential element in the action he know scotland and love it and there be hardly a event in any of he scottish novel in which we do not breathe the very atmosphere of the place and feel the presence of its moor and mountain the place morever be usually so well choose and describe that the action seem almost to be the result of natural environment perhaps the most striking illustration of this harmony between scene and incident be find in _ old mortality _ where morton approach the cave of the old covenanter and where the spiritual terror inspire by the fanatic 's struggle with imaginary fiend be parallel by the physical terror of a gulf and a roar flood span by a slippery tree trunk a second illustration of the same harmony of scene and incident be find in the meeting of the arm and ideal of the east and west when the two champion fight in the burning desert and then eat bread together in the cool shade of the oasis as describe in the opening chapter of _ the talisman _ a third illustration be find in that fascinating love scene where ivanhoe lie wounded rage at he helplessness while the gentle rebecca alternately hide and reveal she love as she describe the terrific assault on the castle which go on beneath she window he thought be all on the fight hers on the man she love and both be natural and both be exactly what we expect under the circumstance these be but striking example of the fact that in all he work scott try to preserve perfect harmony between the scene and the action -lrb- 4 -rrb- scott 's chief claim to greatness lie in the fact that he be the first novelist to recreate the past that he change we whole conception of history by make it to be not a record of dry fact but a stage on which living man and woman play they part carlyle 's criticism be here most pertinent : these historical novel have teach this truth unknown to writer of history : that the bygone age of the world be actually fill by live man not by protocol state papers controversy and abstraction of man not only the page of history but all the hill and vale of he beloved scotland be fill with live character -- lord and lady soldier pirate gypsy preacher schoolmaster clansman bailiff dependent -- all scotland be here before we eye in the reality of life itself it be astonishing with he large number of character that scott never repeat himself naturally he be most at home in scotland and with humble people scott 's own romantic interest in feudalism cause he to make he lord altogether too lordly he aristocratic maiden be usually bloodless conventional exasperating creature who talk like book and pose like figure in a old tapestry but when he describe character like jeanie dean in _ the heart of midlothian _ and the old clansman evan dhu in _ waverley _ we know the very soul of scotch womanhood and manhood perhaps one thing more should be say or rather repeat of scott 's enduring work he be always sane wholesome manly inspiring we know the essential nobility of human life better and we be better man and woman ourselves because of what he have write george gordon lord byron -lrb- 1788-1824 -rrb- there be two distinct side to byron and he poetry one good the other bad and those who write about he generally describe one side or the other in superlative thus one critic speak of he splendid and imperishable excellence of sincerity and strength another of he gaudy charlatanry blare of brass and big bow-wowishness as both critic be fundamentally right we shall not here attempt to reconcile they difference which arise from view one side of the man 's nature and poetry to the exclusion of the other before he exile from england in 1816 the general impression make by byron be that of a man who lead a irregular life pose as a romantic hero make himself out much worse than he really be and take delight in shocking not only the convention but the ideal of english society he poetry of this first period be generally though not always shallow and insincere in thought and declamatory or bombastic in expression after he exile and he meeting with shelley in italy we note a gradual improvement due partly to shelley 's influence and partly to he own mature thought and experience we have the impression now of a disillusioned man who recognize he true character and who though cynical and pessimistic be at least honest in he unhappy outlook on society he poetry of this period be generally less shallow and rhetorical and though he still parade he feeling in public he often surprise we by be manly and sincere thus in the third canto of _ childe harold _ write just after he exile he say : in my youth 's summer i do sing of one the wander outlaw of he own dark mind and as we read on to the end of the splendid fourth canto -- with its poetic feeling for nature and its stir rhythm that grip and hold the reader like martial music -- we lay down the book with profound regret that this gifted man should have devote so much of he talent to describe trivial or unwholesome intrigue and pose as the hero of he own verse the real tragedy of byron 's life be that he die just as he be begin to find himself life byron be bear in london in 1788 the year precede the french revolution we shall understand he better and judge he more charitably if we remember the tainted stock from which he spring he father be a dissipate spendthrift of unspeakable moral he mother be a scotch heiress passionate and unbalanced the father desert he wife after squander she fortune and the boy be bring up by the mother who alternately pet and abuse he in he eleventh year the death of a granduncle leave he heir to newstead abbey and to the baronial title of one of the oldest house in england he be singularly handsome and a lameness result from a deform foot lend a suggestion of pathos to he make-up all this with he social position he pseudo-heroic poetry and he dissipate life -- over which he contrived to throw a veil of romantic secrecy -- make he a magnet of attraction to many thoughtless young man and foolish woman who make the downhill path both easy and rapid to one whose inclination lead he in that direction naturally he be generous and easily lead by affection he be therefore largely a victim of he own weakness and of unfortunate surroundings at school at harrow and in the university at cambridge byron lead a unbalanced life and be more give to certain sport from which he be not debar by lameness than to book and study he school life like he infancy be sadly mark by vanity violence and rebellion against every form of authority yet it be not without its hour of nobility and generosity scott describe he as a man of real goodness of heart and the kindest and best feeling miserably throw away by he foolish contempt of public opinion while at cambridge byron publish he first volume of poem _ hour of idleness _ in 1807 a severe criticism of the volume in the _ edinburgh review _ wound byron 's vanity and throw he into a violent passion the result of which be the now famous satire call _ english bard and scotch reviewer _ in which not only he enemy but also scott wordsworth and nearly all the literary man of he day be satirize in heroic couplet after the manner of pope 's _ dunciad _ it be only just to say that he afterwards make friend with scott and with other whom he have abuse without provocation and it be interesting to note in view of he own romantic poetry that he denounce all master of romance and accept the artificial standard of pope and dryden he two favorite book be the old testament and a volume of pope 's poetry of the latter he say he be the greatest name in poetry all the rest be barbarian in 1809 byron when only twenty-one year of age start on a tour of europe and the orient the poetic result of this trip be the first two canto of _ childe harold 's pilgrimage _ with they famous description of romantic scenery the work make he instantly popular and he fame overshadow scott 's completely as he say himself i awake one morning to find myself famous and presently he style himself the grand napoleon of the realm of rhyme the worst element in byron at this time be he insincerity he continual pose as the hero of he poetry he best work be translate and he fame spread almost as rapidly on the continent as in england even goethe be deceive and declare that a man so wonderful in character have never before appear in literature and would never appear again now that the tinsel have wear off and we can judge the man and he work dispassionately we see how easily even the critic of the age be govern by romantic impulse the adulation of byron last only a few year in england in 1815 he marry miss milbanke a english heiress who abruptly leave he a year later with womanly reserve she keep silence but the public be not slow to imagine plenty of reason for the separation this together with the fact that man have begin to penetrate the veil of romantic secrecy with which byron surround himself and find a rather brassy idol beneath turn the tide of public opinion against he he leave england under a cloud of distrust and disappointment in 1816 and never return eight year be spend abroad largely in italy where he be associate with shelley until the latter 's tragic death in 1822 he house be ever the meeting place for revolutionist and malcontent call themselves patriot whom he trust too greatly and with whom he share he money most generously curiously enough while he trust man too easily he have no faith in human society or government and write in 1817 : i have simplify my politics to a utter detestation of all exist government during he exile he finish _ childe harold the prisoner of chillon _ he drama _ cain _ and _ manfr _ and numerous other work in some of which as in _ don juan _ he delight in reveng himself upon he countryman by hold up to ridicule all that they hold most sacred in 1824 byron go to greece to give himself and a large part of he fortune to help that country in its struggle for liberty against the turk how far he be lead by he desire for pose as a hero and how far by a certain vigorous viking spirit that be certainly in he will never be know the greek welcome he and make he a leader and for a few month he find himself in the midst of a wretched squabble of lie selfishness insincerity cowardice and intrigue instead of the heroic struggle for liberty which he have anticipate he die of fever in missolonghus in 1824 one of he last poem write there on he thirty-sixth birthday a few month before he die express he own view of he disappointing life : my day be in the yellow leaf the flower and fruit of love be go : the worm the canker and the grief be mine alone work of byron in read byron it be well to remember that he be a disappointed and embittered man not only in he personal life but also in he expectation of a general transformation of human society as he pour out he own feeling chiefly in he poetry he be the most expressive writer of he age in voice the discontent of a multitude of european who be disappoint at the failure of the french revolution to produce a entirely new form of government and society one who wish to understand the whole scope of byron 's genius and poetry will do well to begin with he first work _ hour of idleness _ write when he be a young man at the university there be very little poetry in the volume only a striking facility in rime brighten by the devil-may - care spirit of the cavalier poet but as a revelation of the man himself it be remarkable in a vain and sophomoric preface he declare that poetry be to he a idle experiment and that this be he first and last attempt to amuse himself in that line curiously enough as he start for greece on he last fatal journey he again ridicule literature and say that the poet be a mere babbler it be this despising of the art which alone make he famous that occasion we deepest disappointment even in he magnificent passage in a glowing description of nature or of a hindoo woman 's exquisite love he work be frequently mar by a wretched pun or by some cheap buffoonery which ruin we first splendid impression of he poetry byron 's later volume _ manfr _ and _ cain _ the one a curious and perhaps unconscious parody of _ faust _ the other of _ paradise lose _ be he two best know dramatic work aside from the question of they poetic value they be interesting as voice byron 's excessive individualism and he rebellion against society the best know and the most readable of byron 's work _ mazeppa the prisoner of chillon _ and _ childe harold 's pilgrimage _ the first two canto of _ childe harold _ -lrb- 1812 -rrb- be perhaps more frequently read than any other work of the same author partly because of they melodious verse partly because of they description of place along the line of european travel but the last two canto -lrb- 1816-1818 -rrb- write after he exile from england have more sincerity and be in every way better expression of byron 's mature genius scatter through all he work one find magnificent description of natural scenery and exquisite lyric of love and despair but they be mix with such a deal of bombast and rhetoric together with much that be unwholesome that the beginner will do well to confine himself to a small volume of well-chosen selection -lrb- 227 -rrb- byron be often compare with scott as have give to we europe and the orient just as scott give we scotland and its people but while there be a certain resemblance in the swing and dash of the verse the resemblance be all on the surface and the underlie difference between the two poet be as great as that between thackeray and bulwer-lytton scott know he country well -- its hill and valley which be interesting as the abode of living and lovable man and woman byron pretend to know the secret unwholesome side of europe which generally hide itself in the dark but instead of give we a variety of live man he never get away from he own unbalanced and egotistical self all he character in _ cain manfr the corsair the giaour childe harold don juan _ be tiresome repetition of himself -- a vain disappointed cynical man who find no good in life or love or anything naturally with such a disposition he be entirely incapable of portray a true woman to nature alone especially in she magnificent mood byron remain faithful and he portrayal of the night and the storm and the ocean in _ childe harold _ be unsurpassed in we language percy bysshe shelley -lrb- 1792-1822 -rrb- make I thy lyre even as the forest be : what if my leaf be fall like its own the tumult of thy mighty harmony will take from both a deep autumnal tone sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce my spirit be thou I impetuous one in this fragment from the ode to the west wind we have a suggestion of shelley 's own spirit as reflect in all he poetry the very spirit of nature which appeal to we in the wind and the cloud the sunset and the moonrise seem to have possess he at time and make he a choose instrument of melody at such time he be a true poet and he work be unrivaled at other time unfortunately shelley join with byron in voice a vain rebellion against society he poetry like he life divide itself into two distinct mood in one he be the violent reformer seek to overthrow we present institution and to hurry the millennium out of its slow walk into a gallop out of this mood come most of he longer poem like _ queen mab revolt of islam hella _ and _ the witch of atla _ which be somewhat violent diatribe against government priest marriage religion even god as man suppose he to be in a different mood which find expression _ alastor adonai _ and he wonderful lyric shelley be like a wanderer follow a vague beautiful vision forever sad and forever unsatisfied in the latter mood he appeal profoundly to all man who have know what it be to follow after a unattainable ideal shelley 's life there be three class of man who see vision and all three be represent in we literature the first be the mere dreamer like blake who stumble through a world of reality without notice it and be happy in he vision the second be the seer the prophet like langland or wyclif who see a vision and quietly go to work in way that man understand to make the present world a little more like the ideal one which he see in he vision the third who appear in many form -- as visionary enthusiast radical anarchist revolutionary call he what you will -- see a vision and straightway begin to tear down all human institution which have be build up by the slow toil of century simply because they seem to stand in the way of he dream to the latter class belong shelley a man perpetually at war with the present world a martyr and exile simply because of he inability to sympathize with man and society as they be and because of he own mistaken judgment as to the value and purpose of a vision shelley be bear in field place near horsham sussex in 1792 on both he father 's and he mother 's side he be descend from noble old family famous in the political and literary history of england from childhood he live like blake in a world of fancy so real that certain imaginary dragon and headless creature of the neighbor wood keep he and he sister in a state of fearful expectancy he learn rapidly absorb the classic as if by intuition and dissatisfied with ordinary process of learn seem to have seek like faustus the acquaintance of spirit as show in he hymn to intellectual beauty : while yet a boy i seek for ghost and speed through many a listen chamber cave and ruin and starlight wood with fearful step pursue hope of high talk with the depart dead shelley 's first public school keep by a hard-headed scotch master with its flogging and its general brutality seem to he like a combination of hell and prison and he active rebellion against exist institution be well under way when at twelve year of age he enter the famous preparatory school at eton he be a delicate nervous marvelously sensitive boy of great physical beauty and like cowper he suffer torment at the hand of he rough schoolfellow unlike cowper he be positive resentful and brave to the point of rashness soul and body rise up against tyranny and he promptly organize a rebellion against the brutal fagging system mad shelley the boy call he and they chivy he like dog around a little coon that fight and cry defiance to the end one find what he seek in this world and it be not strange that shelley after he eton experience find cause for rebellion in all exist form of human society and that he leave school to war among mankind as he say of himself in the _ revolt of islam _ he university day be but a repetition of he earlier experience while a student at oxford he read some scrap of hume 's philosophy and immediately publish a pamphlet call the necessity of atheism it be a crude foolish piece of work and shelley distribute it by post to every one to whom it might give offense naturally this bring on a conflict with the authority but shelley would not listen to reason or make any explanation and be expel from the university in 1811 shelley 's marriage be even more unfortunate while live in london on a generous sister 's pocket money a certain young schoolgirl harriet westbrook be attract by shelley 's crude revolutionary doctrine she promptly leave school as she own personal part in the general rebellion and refuse to return or even to listen to she parent upon the subject have be teach by shelley she throw herself upon he protection and this unbalanced couple be presently marry as they say in deference to anarch custom the two infant have already proclaim a rebellion against the institution of marriage for which they propose to substitute the doctrine of elective affinity for two year they wander about england ireland and wale live on a small allowance from shelley 's father who have disinherit he son because of he ill-considered marriage the pair soon separated and two year later shelley have form a strong friendship with one godwin -- a leader of young enthusiast and a preacher of anarchy -- presently show he belief in godwin 's theory by elope with he daughter mary it be a sad story and the detail be perhaps better forget we should remember that in shelley we be deal with a tragic blend of high-mindedness and light-headedness byron write of he the most gentle the most amiable and the least worldly-minded person i ever meet lead partly by the general hostility against he and partly by he own delicate health shelley go to italy in 1818 and never return to england after wander over italy he finally settle in pisa beloved of so many english poet -- beautiful sleepy pisa where one look out of he window on the main street at the busiest hour of the day and the only living thing in sight be a donkey doze lazily with he head in the shade and he body in the sunshine here he best poetry be write and here he find comfort in the friendship of byron hunt and trelawney who be forever associate with shelley 's italian life he still remain hostile to english social institution but life be a good teacher and that shelley dimly recognize the error of he rebellion be show in the increase sadness of he later poem : o world o life o time on whose last step i climb tremble at that where i have stand before when will return the glory of you prime no more -- oh never more out of the day and night a joy have take flight fresh spring and summer and winter hoar move my faint heart with grief but with delight no more -- oh never more in 1822 when only thirty year of age shelley be drown while sailing in a small boat off the italian coast he body be wash ashore several day later and be cremate near viareggio by he friend byron hunt and trelawney he ash might with all reverence have be give to the wind that he love and that be a symbol of he restless spirit instead they find a rest place near the grave of keat in the english cemetery at rome one rarely visit the spot now without find english and american visitor stand in silence before the significant inscription _ cor cordium _ work of shelley as a lyric poet shelley be one of the supreme genius of we literature and the reader will do well to begin with the poem which show he at he very best the cloud to a skylark ode to the west wind to night -- poem like these must surely set the reader to search among shelley 's miscellaneous work to find for himself the thing worthy to be remember in read shelley 's longer poem one must remember that there be in this poet two distinct man : one the wanderer seek ideal beauty and forever unsatisfy the other the unbalanced reformer seek the overthrow of present institution and the establishment of universal happiness _ alastor or the spirit of solitude _ -lrb- 1816 -rrb- be by far the best expression of shelley 's greater mood here we see he wander restlessly through the vast silence of nature in search of a loved dream-maiden who shall satisfy he love of beauty here shelley be the poet of the moonrise and of the tender exquisite fancy that can never be express the charm of the poem lie in its succession of dreamlike picture but it give absolutely no impression of reality it be write when shelley after he long struggle have begin to realize that the world be too strong for he _ alastor _ be therefore the poet 's confession not simply of failure but of undying hope in some better thing that be to come _ prometheus unbound _ -lrb- 1818-1820 -rrb- a lyrical drama be the best work of shelley 's revolutionary enthusiasm and the most characteristic of all he poem shelley 's philosophy -lrb- if one may dignify a hopeless dream by such a name -rrb- be a curious aftergrowth of the french revolution namely that it be only the exist tyranny of state church and society which keep man from growth into perfect happiness naturally shelley forget like many other enthusiast that church and state and social law be not impose upon man from without but be create by himself to minister to he necessity in shelley 's poem the hero prometheus represent mankind itself -- a just and noble humanity chained and tortured by jove who be here the personification of human institution -lrb- 228 -rrb- in due time demogorgon -lrb- which be shelley 's name for necessity -rrb- overthrow the tyrant jove and release prometheus -lrb- mankind -rrb- who be presently unite to asia the spirit of love and goodness in nature while the earth and the moon join in a wedding song and everything give promise that they shall live together happy ever afterwards shelley here look forward not back to the golden age and be the prophet of science and evolution if we compare he titan with similar character in _ faust _ and _ cain _ we shall find this interesting difference -- that while goethe 's titan be culture and self-reliant and byron 's stoic and hopeless shelley 's hero be patient under torture see help and hope beyond he suffering and he marry love that the earth may be people with superior being who shall substitute brotherly love for the present law and convention of society such be he philosophy but the beginner will read this poem not chiefly for its thought but for its youthful enthusiasm for its marvelous imagery and especially for its ethereal music perhaps we should add here that _ prometheus _ be and probably always will be a poem for the choose few who can appreciate its peculiar spiritlike beauty in its purely pagan conception of the world it suggest by contrast milton 's christian philosophy in _ paradise regain _ shelley 's revolutionary work _ queen mab _ -lrb- 1813 -rrb- _ the revolt of islam _ -lrb- 1818 -rrb- _ hella _ -lrb- 1821 -rrb- and _ the witch of atlas _ -lrb- 1820 -rrb- be to be judge in much the same way as be _ prometheus unbound _ they be largely invective against religion marriage kingcraft and priestcraft most impractical when consider as scheme for reform but abound in passage of exquisite beauty for which alone they be worth reading in the drama call _ the cencus _ -lrb- 1819 -rrb- which be found upon a morbid italian story shelley for the first and only time descend to reality the heroine beatrice drive to desperation by the monstrous wickedness of she father kill he and suffer the death penalty in consequence she be the only one of shelley 's character who seem to we entirely human far different in character be _ epipsychidion _ -lrb- 1821 -rrb- a rhapsody celebrate platonic love the most impalpable and so one of the most characteristic of all shelley 's work it be inspire by a beautiful italian girl emilium vivianus who be put into a cloister against she will and in whom shelley imagine he find he long-sought ideal of womanhood with this should be read _ adonais _ -lrb- 1821 -rrb- the best know of all shelley 's longer poem _ adonais _ be a wonderful threnody or a song of grief over the death of the poet keat even in he grief shelley still preserve a sense of unreality and call in many shadowy allegorical figure -- sad spring weep hour gloom splendor destiny -- all unite in bewail the loss of a loved one the whole poem be a succession of dream picture exquisitely beautiful such as only shelley could imagine and it hold its place with milton 's _ lycida _ and tennyson 's _ in memoriam _ as one of the three greatest elegy in we language in he interpretation of nature shelley suggest wordsworth both by resemblance and by contrast to both poet all natural object be symbol of truth both regard nature as permeate by the great spiritual life which animate all thing but while wordsworth find a spirit of thought and so of communion between nature and the soul of man shelley find a spirit of love which exist chiefly for its own delight and so the cloud the skylark and the west wind three of the most beautiful poem in we language have no definite message for humanity in he hymn to intellectual beauty shelley be most like wordsworth but in he sensitive plant with its fine symbolism and imagery he be like nobody in the world but himself comparison be sometimes a excellent thing and if we compare shelley 's exquisite lament begin o world o life o time with wordsworth 's intimation of immortality we shall perhaps understand both poet better both poem recall many happy memory of youth both express a very real mood of a moment but while the beauty of one merely sadden and dishearten we the beauty of the other inspire we with something of the poet 's own faith and hopefulness in a word wordsworth find and shelley lose himself in nature john keat -lrb- 1795-1821 -rrb- keat be not only the last but also the most perfect of the romanticist while scott be merely tell story and wordsworth reform poetry or uphold the moral law and shelley advocate impossible reform and byron voice he own egoism and the political discontent of the time keat live apart from man and from all political measure worship beauty like a devotee perfectly content to write what be in he own heart or to reflect some splendor of the natural world as he see or dream it to be he have moreover the novel idea that poetry exist for its own sake and suffer loss by be devote to philosophy or politics or indeed to any cause however great or small as he say in lamium : do not all charm fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy there be a awful rainbow once in heaven : we know she woof she texture she be give in the dull catalogue of common thing philosophy will clip a angel 's wing conquer all mystery by rule and line empty the haunt air and gnomed mine -- unweave a rainbow as it erewhile make the tender-person would lamia melt into a shade partly because of this high ideal of poetry partly because he study and unconsciously imitate the greek classic and the best work of the elizabethan keat 's last little volume of poetry be unequaled by the work of any of he contemporary when we remember that all he work be publish in three short year from 1817 to 1820 and that he die when only twenty-five year old we must judge he to be the most promising figure of the early nineteenth century and one of the most remarkable in the history of literature life keat 's life of devotion to beauty and to poetry be all the more remarkable in view of he lowly origin he be the son of a hostler and stable keeper and be bear in the stable of the swan and hoop inn london in 1795 one have only to read the rough stable scene from we first novelist or even from dickens to understand how little there be in such a atmosphere to develop poetic gift before keat be fifteen year old both parent die and he be place with he brother and sister in charge of guardian they first act seem to have be to take keat from school at enfield and to bind he as a apprentice to a surgeon at edmonton for five year he serve he apprenticeship and for two year more he be surgeon 's helper in the hospital but though skillful enough to win approval he dislike he work and he thought be on other thing the other day during a lecture he say to a friend there come a sunbeam into the room and with it a whole troop of creature float in the ray and i be off with they to oberon and fairyland a copy of spenser 's _ faery queen _ which have be give he by charle cowden clark be the prime cause of he abstraction he abandon he profession in 1817 and early in the same year publish he first volume of _ poem _ it be modest enough in spirit as be also he second volume _ endymion _ -lrb- 1818 -rrb- but that do not prevent brutal attack upon the author and he work by the self-constituted critic of _ blackwood 's magazine _ and the _ quarterly _ it be often allege that the poet 's spirit and ambition be break by these attack -lrb- 229 -rrb- but keat be a man of strong character and instead of quarrel with he reviewer or be crush by they criticism he go quietly to work with the idea of produce poetry that should live forever as matthew arnold say keat have flint and iron in he and in he next volume he accomplish he own purpose and silence unfriendly criticism for the three year during which keat write he poetry he live chiefly in london and in hampstead but wander at time over england and scotland living for brief space in the isle of wight in devonshire and in the lake district seek to recover he own health and especially to restore that of he brother he illness begin with a severe cold but soon develop into consumption and add to this sorrow be another -- he love for fannie brawne to whom he be engage but whom he could not marry on account of he poverty and grow illness when we remember all this personal grief and the harsh criticism of literary man the last small volume _ lamium isabellum the eve of st agne and other poem _ -lrb- 1820 -rrb- be most significant as show not only keat 's wonderful poetic gift but also he beautiful and indomitable spirit shelley strike by the beauty and promise of hyperion send a generous invitation to the author to come to pisa and live with he but keat refuse have little sympathy with shelley 's revolt against society the invitation have this effect however that it turn keat 's thought to italy whither he soon go in the effort to save he life he settle in rome with he friend severn the artist but die soon after he arrival in February 1821 he grave in the protestant cemetery at rome be still a object of pilgrimage to thousand of tourist for among all we poet there be hardly another whose heroic life and tragic death have so appeal to the heart of poet and young enthusiast the work of keat none but the master shall praise we and none but the master shall blame might well be write on the fly leaf of every volume of keat 's poetry for never be there a poet more devoted to he ideal entirely independent of success or failure in strong contrast with he contemporary byron who profess to despise the art that make he famous keat live for poetry alone and as lowell point out a virtue go out of he into everything he write in all he work we have the impression of this intense loyalty to he art we have the impression also of a profound dissatisfaction that the deed fall so far short of the splendid dream thus after read chapman 's translation of homer he write : much have i travel in the realm of gold and many goodly state and kingdom see round many western island have i be which bard in fealty to apollo hold oft of one wide expanse have i be tell that deep-browed homer rule as he demesne yet do i never breathe its pure serene till i hear chapman speak out loud and bold : then feel i like some watcher of the sky when a new planet swim into he ken or like stout cortez when with eagle eye he stare at the pacific -- and all he man look at each other with a wild surmise -- silent upon a peak in darien in this striking sonnet we have a suggestion of keat 's high ideal and of he sadness because of he own ignorance when he publish he first little volume of poem in 1817 he know no greek yet greek literature absorb and fascinate he as he see its broken and imperfect reflection in a english translation like shakespeare who also be but poorly educate in the school he have a marvelous faculty of discerning the real spirit of the classic -- a faculty deny to many great scholar and to most of the classic writer of the preceding century -- and so he set himself to the task of reflect in modern english the spirit of the old greek the imperfect result of this attempt be see in he next volume _ endymion _ which be the story of a young shepherd beloved by a moon goddess the poem begin with the striking line : a thing of beauty be a joy forever its loveliness increase it will never pass into nothingness but still will keep a bower quiet for we and a sleep full of sweet dream and health and quiet breathing which well illustrate the spirit of keat 's later work with its perfect finish and melody it have many quotable line and passage and its hymn to pan should be read in connection with wordsworth 's famous sonnet begin the world be too much with we the poem give splendid promise but as a whole it be rather chaotic with too much ornament and too little design like a modern house that keat feel this defect strongly be evident from he modest preface wherein he speak of _ endymion _ not as a deed accomplish but only as a unsuccessful attempt to suggest the underlie beauty of greek mythology keat 's third and last volume _ lamium isabellum the eve of st agne and other poem _ -lrb- 1820 -rrb- be the one with which the reader should begin he acquaintance with this master of english verse it have only two subject greek mythology and mediæval romance hyperion be a magnificent fragment suggest the first arch of a cathedral that be never finish its theme be the overthrow of the titan by the young sun-god apollo realize he own immaturity and lack of knowledge keat lay aside this work and only the pleading of he publisher induce he to print the fragment with he complete poem throughout this last volume and especially in hyperion the influence of milton be apparent while spenser be more frequently suggest in read _ endymion _ of the longer poem in the volume lamium be the most suggestive it be the story of a beautiful enchantress who turn from a serpent into a glorious woman and fill every human sense with delight until as a result of the foolish philosophy of old apollonius she vanish forever from she lover 's sight the eve of st agne the most perfect of keat 's mediæval poem be not a story after the manner of the metrical romance but rather a vivid painting of a romantic mood such as come to all man at time to glorify a workaday world like all the work of keat and shelley it have a element of unreality and when we read at the end and they be go aye age long ago these lover flee away into the storm it be as if we be wake from a dream -- which be the only possible end to all of keat 's greek and mediæval fancy we be to remember however that no beautiful thing though it be intangible as a dream can enter a man 's life and leave he quite the same afterwards keat 's own word be here suggestive the imagination he say may be liken to adam 's dream he awake and find it true it be by he short poem that keat be know to the majority of present-day reader among these exquisite shorter poem we mention only the four ode on a grecian urn to a nightingale to autumn and to psyche these be like a invitation to a feast one who read they will hardly be satisfy until he know more of such delightful poetry those who study only the ode to a nightingale may find four thing -- a love of sensuous beauty a touch of pessimism a purely pagan conception of nature and a strong individualism -- which be characteristic of this last of the romantic poet as wordsworth 's work be too often mar by the moralizer and byron 's by the demagogue and shelley 's by the reformer so keat 's work suffer by the opposite extreme of aloofness from every human interest so much so that he be often accuse of be indifferent to humanity he work be also criticise as be too effeminate for ordinary reader three thing should be remember in this connection first that keat seek to express beauty for its own sake that beauty be as essential to normal humanity as be government or law and that the higher man climb in civilization the more imperative become he need of beauty as a reward for he labor second that keat 's letter be as much a indication of the man as be he poetry and in he letter with they human sympathy they eager interest in social problem they humor and they keen insight into life there be no trace of effeminacy but rather every indication of a strong and noble manhood the third thing to remember be that all keat 's work be do in three or four year with small preparation and that die at twenty-five he leave we a body of poetry which will always be one of we most cherish possession he be often compare with the marvelous boy chatterton whom he greatly admire and to whose memory he dedicate he _ endymion _ but though both die young chatterton be but a child while keat be in all respects a man it be idle to prophesy what he might have do have he be grant a tennyson 's long life and scholarly training at twenty five he work be as mature as be tennyson 's at fifty though the maturity suggest the too rapid growth of a tropical plant which under the warm rain and the flood of sunlight leap into life grow bloom in a day and die as we have state keat 's work be bitterly and unjustly condemn by the critic of he day he belong to what be derisively call the cockney school of poetry of which leigh hunt be chief and proctor and beddo be fellow-workmen not even from wordsworth and byron who be ready enough to recommend far less gifted writer do keat receive the slightest encouragement like young lochinvar he ride all unarmed and he ride all alone shelley with he sincerity and generosity be the first to recognize the young genius and in he noble _ adonai _ -- write alas like most of we tribute when the subject of we praise be dead -- he speak the first true word of appreciation and place keat where he unquestionably belong among we greatest poet the fame deny he in he sad life be grant freely after he death most fitly do he close the list of poet of the romantic revival because in many respects he be the best workman of they all he seem to have study word more carefully than do he contemporary and so he poetic expression or the harmony of word and thought be generally more perfect than theirs more than any other he live for poetry as the noblest of the art more than any other he emphasize beauty because to he as show by he grecian urn beauty and truth be one and inseparable and he enrich the whole romantic movement by add to its interest in common life the spirit rather than the letter of the classic and of elizabethan poetry for these reason keat be like spenser a poet 's poet he work profoundly influence tennyson and indeed most of the poet of the present era ii prose writer of the romantic period aside from the splendid work of the novel writer -- walter scott whom we have consider and jane austen to whom we shall presently return -- the early nineteenth century be remarkable for the development of a new and valuable type of critical prose write if we except the isolate work of dryden and of addison it be safe to say that literary criticism in its modern sense be hardly know in england until about the year 1825 such criticism as exist seem to we now to have be largely the result of personal opinion or prejudice indeed we could hardly expect anything else before some systematic study of we literature as a whole have be attempt in one age a poem be call good or bad accord as it follow or run counter to so-called classic rule in another we have the dogmatism of dr johnson in a third the personal judgment of lockhart and the editor of the _ edinburgh review _ and the _ quarterly _ who so violently abused keat and the lake poet in the name of criticism early in the nineteenth century there arise a new school of criticism which be guide by knowledge of literature on the one hand and by what one might call the fear of god on the other the latter element show itself in a profound human sympathy -- the essence of the romantic movement -- and its importance be sum up by de quincey when he say not to sympathize be not to understand these new critic with abundant reverence for past master could still lay aside the dogmatism and prejudice which mark johnson and the magazine editor and read sympathetically the work of a new author with the sole idea of find what he have contribute or try to contribute to the magnificent total of we literature coleridge hunt hazlitt lamb and de quincey be the leader in this new and immensely important development and we must not forget the importance of the new periodical like the _ londen magazine _ found in 1820 in which lamb de quincey and carlyle find they first real encouragement of coleridge 's _ biographica literarium _ and he _ lecture on shakespeare _ we have already speak leigh hunt -lrb- 1784-1859 -rrb- write continuously for more than thirty year as editor and essayist and he chief object seem to have be to make good literature know and appreciate william hazlitt -lrb- 1778-1830 -rrb- in a long series of lecture and essay treat all reading as a kind of romantic journey into new and pleasant country to he work largely with that of lamb be due the new interest in elizabethan literature which so strongly influence keat 's last and best volume of poetry for those interested in the art of criticism and in the appreciation of literature both hunt and hazlitt will well repay study but we must pass over they work to consider the larger literary interest of lamb and de quincey who be not simply critic of other man 's labor but who also produce some delightful work of they own which the world have carefully put away among the thing worthy to be remembered charle lamb -lrb- 1775-1834 -rrb- in lamb and wordsworth we have two widely different view of the romantic movement one show the influence of nature and solitude the other of society lamb be a lifelong friend of coleridge and a admirer and defender of the poetic creed of wordsworth but while the latter live apart from man content with nature and with read a occasional moral lesson to society lamb be bear and live in the midst of the london street the city crowd with its pleasure and occupation its endless little comedy and tragedy alone interested he accord to he own account when he pause in the crowded street tear would spring to he eye -- tear of pure pleasure at the abundance of so much good life and when he write he simply interpret that crowded human life of joy and sorrow as wordsworth interpret the wood and water without any desire to change or to reform they he have give we the best picture we possess of coleridge hazlitt landor hood cowden clarke and many more of the interesting man and woman of he age and it be due to he insight and sympathy that the life of those far-off day seem almost as real to we as if we ourselves remember it of all we english essayist he be the most lovable partly because of he delicate old-fashioned style and humor but more because of that cheery and heroic struggle against misfortune which shine like a subdue light in all he writings life in the very heart of london there be a curious old-fashioned place know as the temple -- a enormous rambling apparently forget structure dusty and still in the midst of the endless roar of the city street originally it be a chapter house of the knight templar and so suggest to we the spirit of the crusade and of the middle age but now the building be give over almost entirely to the office and lodgings of london lawyer it be this queer old place which more than all other be associate with the name of charle lamb i be bear he say and pass the first seven year of my life in the temple its garden its hall its fountain its river these be my oldest recollection he be the son of a poor clerk or rather servant of one of the barrister and be the youngest of seven child only three of whom survive infancy of these three john the elder be apparently a selfish creature who take no part in the heroic struggle of he brother and sister at seven year charle be send to the famous bluecoat charity school of christ 's hospital here he remain seven year and here he form he lifelong friendship for another poor neglect boy whom the world remember as coleridge -lrb- 230 -rrb- when only fourteen year old lamb leave the charity school and be soon at work as a clerk in the south sea house two year later he become a clerk in the famous indium house where he work steadily for thirty-three year with the exception of six week in the winter of 1795-1796 spend within the wall of a asylum in 1796 lamb 's sister mary who be as talented and remarkable as lamb himself go violently insane and kill she own mother for a long time after this appalling tragedy she be in a asylum at hoxton then lamb in 1797 bring she to he own little house and for the remainder of he life care for she with a tenderness and devotion which furnish one of the most beautiful page in we literary history at time the malady would return to mary give sure warning of its terrible approach and then brother and sister might be see walk silently hand in hand to the gate of the asylum they cheek wet with tear one must remember this as well as lamb 's humble lodgings and the drudgery of he daily work in the-big commercial house if he would appreciate the pathos of the old familiar face or the heroism which shine through the most human and the most delightful essay in we language when lamb be fifty year of age the east indium company lead partly by he literary fame follow he first _ essay of elium _ and partly by he thirty-three year of faithful service grant he a comfortable pension and happy as a boy turn loose from school he leave indium house forever to give himself up to literary work -lrb- 231 -rrb- he write to wordsworth in April 1825 i come home _ forever _ on Tuesday of last week -- it be like pass from life into eternity curiously enough lamb seem to lose power after he release from drudgery and he last essay publish in 1833 lack something of the grace and charm of he earlier work he die at edmonton in 1834 and he gifted sister mary sink rapidly into the gulf from which he strength and gentleness have so long hold she back no literary man be ever more loved and honor by a rare circle of friend and all who know he bear witness to the simplicity and goodness which any reader may find for himself between the line of he essay work the work of lamb divide themselves naturally into three period first there be he early literary effort include the poem sign c l in coleridge 's _ poem on various subject _ -lrb- 1796 -rrb- he romance _ rosamund gray _ -lrb- 1798 -rrb- he poetical drama _ john woodvil _ -lrb- 1802 -rrb- and various other immature work in prose and poetry this period come to a end in 1803 when he give up he newspaper work especially the contribution of six joke pun and squib daily to the _ morning post _ at sixpence apiece the second period be give largely to literary criticism and the _ tale from shakespeare _ -lrb- 1807 -rrb- -- write by charle and mary lamb the former reproduce the tragedy and the latter the comedy -- may be regard as he first successful literary venture the book be write primarily for child but so thoroughly have brother and sister steep themselves in the literature of the elizabethan period that young and old alike be delighted with this new version of shakespeare 's story and the _ tale _ be still regard as the best of they kind in we literature in 1808 appear he _ specimen of english dramatic poet contemporary with shakespeare _ this carry out the splendid critical work of coleridge and be the most noticeable influence in develop the poetic quality of keat as show in he last volume the third period include lamb 's criticism of life which be gather together in he _ essay of elium _ -lrb- 1823 -rrb- and he _ last essay of elia _ which be publish ten year later these famous essay begin in 1820 with the appearance of the new _ london magazine _ -lrb- 232 -rrb- and be continue for many year such subject as the dissertation on roast pig old china praise of chimney sweeper imperfect sympathy a chapter on ear mr battle 's opinion on whist mackery end grace before meat dream child and many other be choose apparently at random but all lead to a delightful interpretation of the life of london as it appear to a quiet little man who walk unnoticed through its crowded street in the first and last essay which we have mention dissertation on roast pig and dream child we have the extreme of lamb 's humor and pathos the style of all these essay be gentle old-fashioned irresistibly attractive lamb be especially fond of old writer and borrow unconsciously from the style of burton 's _ anatomy of melancholy _ and from browne 's _ religio medicus _ and from the early english dramatist but this style have become a part of lamb by long reading and he be apparently unable to express he new thought without use they old quaint expression though these essay be all criticism or appreciation of the life of he age they be all intensely personal in other word they be a excellent picture of lamb and of humanity without a trace of vanity or self-assertion lamb begin with himself with some purely personal mood or experience and from this he lead the reader to see life and literature as he see it it be this wonderful combination of personal and universal interest together with lamb 's rare old style and quaint humor which make the essay remarkable they continue the best tradition of addison and steele we first great essayist but they sympathy be broader and deeper and they humor more delicious than any which precede they thomas de quincy -lrb- 1785-1859 -rrb- in de quincey the romantic element be even more strongly develop than in lamb not only in he critical work but also in he erratic and imaginative life he be profoundly educate even more so than coleridge and be one of the keenest intellect of the age yet he wonderful intellect seem always subordinate to he passion for dream like lamb he be a friend and associate of the lake poet make he headquarters in wordsworth 's old cottage at grasmere for nearly twenty year here the resemblance cease and a marked contrast begin as a man lamb be the most human and lovable of all we essayist while de quincey be the most uncanny and incomprehensible lamb 's modest work breathe the two essential quality of sympathy and humor the greater number of de quincey 's essay while possess more or less of both these quality be characterize chiefly by they brilliant style life as see through de quincey 's eye be nebulous and chaotic and there be a suspicion of the fabulous in all that he write even in _ the revolt of the tartar _ the romantic element be uppermost and in much of de quincey 's prose the element of unreality be more noticeable than in shelley 's poetry of he subject-matter he fact idea and criticism we be generally suspicious but of he style sometimes stately and sometimes headlong now gorgeous as a oriental dream now musical as keat 's _ endymion _ and always even in the most violent contrast show a harmony between the idea and the expression such as no other english writer with the possible exception of newman have ever rival -- say what you will of the marvelous brilliancy of de quincey 's style you have still only half express the truth it be the style alone which make these essay immortal life de quincey be bear in manchester in 1785 in neither he father who be a prosperous merchant nor he mother who be a quiet unsympathetic woman do we see any suggestion of the son 's almost uncanny genius as a child he be give to dream more vivid and intense but less beautiful than those of the young blake to whom he bear a strong resemblance in the grammar school at bath he display astonishing ability and acquire greek and latin with a rapidity that frighten he slow tutor at fifteen he not only read greek but speak it fluently and one of he astounded teacher remark that boy could harangue a athenian mob better than you or i could address a english one from the grammar school at manchester whither he be send in 1800 he soon run away find the instruction far below he ability and the rough life absolutely intolerable to he sensitive nature a uncle just home from indium intercede for the boy lest he be send back to the school which he hate and with a allowance of a guinea a week he start a career of vagrancy much like that of goldsmith living on the open hill in the hut of shepherd and charcoal burner in the tent of gypsy wherever fancy lead he he fear of the manchester school finally lead he to run away to london where without money or friend he life be even more extraordinary than he gypsy wanderings the detail of this vagrancy be best learn in he _ confession of a english opium-eater _ where we meet not simply the fact of he life but also the confusion of dream and fancy in the midst of which he wander like a man lose on the mountain with storm cloud under he foot hide the familiar earth after a year of vagrancy and starvation he be find by he family and allow to go to oxford where he career be mark by the most brilliant and erratic scholarship when ready for a degree in 1807 he pass he write test successfully but feel a sudden terror at the thought of the oral examination and disappear from the university never to return it be in oxford that de quincey begin the use of opium to relieve the pain of neuralgia and the habit increase until he be a almost hopeless slave to the drug only he extraordinary will power enable he to break away from the habit after some thirty year of misery some peculiarity of he delicate constitution enable de quincey to take enormous quantity of opium enough to kill several ordinary man and it be largely opium work upon a sensitive imagination which produce he gorgeous dream break by interval of weakness and profound depression for twenty year he reside at grasmere in the companionship of the lake poet and here lead by the loss of he small fortune he begin to write with the idea of support he family in 1821 he publish he first famous work the _ confession of a english opium-eater _ and for nearly forty year afterwards he write industriously contribute to various magazine a astonishing number of essay on a great variety of subject without thought of literary fame he contribute these article anonymously but fortunately in 1853 he begin to collect he own work and the last of fourteen volume be publish just after he death in 1830 lead by he connection with _ blackwood 's magazine _ to which he be the chief contributor de quincey remove with he family to edinburgh where he erratic genius and he singularly childlike way produce enough amusing anecdote to fill a volume he would take a room in some place unknown to he friend and family would live in it for a few year until he have fill it even to the bath tub with book and with he own chaotic manuscript allow no one to enter or disturb he den and then when the place become too crowd he would lock the door and go away and take another lodging where he repeat the same extraordinary performance he die in edinburgh in 1859 like lamb he be a small boyish figure gentle and elaborately courteous though excessively shy and escape as often as possible to solitude he be nevertheless fond of society and he wide knowledge and vivid imagination make he conversation almost as prize as those of he friend coleridge work de quincey 's work may be divide into two general class the first include he numerous critical article and the second he autobiographical sketch all he work it must be remember be contribute to various magazine and be hastily collect just before he death hence the general impression of chaos which we get from read they from a literary view point the most illuminating of de quincey 's critical work be he _ literary reminiscence _ this contain brilliant appreciation of wordsworth coleridge lamb shelley keat hazlitt and landor as well as some interesting study of the literary figure of the age precede among the best of he brilliant critical essay be _ on the knock at the gate in macbeth _ -lrb- 1823 -rrb- which be admirably suit to show the man 's critical genius and _ murder consider as one of the fine art _ -lrb- 1827 -rrb- which reveal he grotesque humor other suggestive critical work if one must choose among such a multitude be he _ letter to a young man _ -lrb- 1823 -rrb- _ joan of arc _ -lrb- 1847 -rrb- _ the revolt of the tartar _ -lrb- 1840 -rrb- and _ the english mail-coach _ -lrb- 1849 -rrb- in the last-named essay the dream fugue be one of the most imaginative of all he curious work of de quincey 's autobiographical sketch the best know be he _ confession of a english opium-eater _ -lrb- 1821 -rrb- this be only partly a record of opium dream and its chief interest lie in glimpse it give we of de quincey 's own life and wanderings this should be follow by _ suspiria de profundis _ -lrb- 1845 -rrb- which be chiefly a record of gloomy and terrible dream produce by opiate the most interesting part of he _ suspirium _ show de quincey 's marvelous insight into dream be those in which we be bring face to face with the strange feminine creation levana madonna we lady of sigh and we lady of darkness a series of nearly thirty article which he collect in 1853 call _ autobiographic sketch _ complete the revelation of the author 's own life among he miscellaneous work may be mention in order to show he wide range of subject _ klosterheim _ a novel _ logic of political economy _ the _ essay on style and rhetoric philosophy of herodotus _ and he article on goethe pope schiller and shakespeare which he contribute to the _ encyclopedia britannica _ de quincey 's style be a revelation of the beauty of the english language and it profoundly influence ruskin and other prose writer of the victorian age it have two chief fault -- diffuseness which continually lead de quincey away from he object and triviality which often make he halt in the midst of a marvelous paragraph to make some light jest or witticism that have some humor but no mirth in it notwithstanding these fault de quincey 's prose be still among the few supreme example of style in we language though he be profoundly influence by the seventeenth - century writer he attempt definitely to create a new style which should combine the best element of prose and poetry in consequence he prose work be often like those of milton more imaginative and melodious than much of we poetry he have be well call the psychologist of style and as such he work will never be popular but to the few who can appreciate he he will always be a inspiration to better write one have a deeper respect for we english language and literature after read he secondary writer of romanticism one have only to glance back over the author we have be study -- wordsworth coleridge southey byron shelley keat scott lamb de quincey -- to realize the great change which sweep over the life and literature of england in a single half century under two influence which we now know as the french revolution in history and the romantic movement in literature in life man have rebel against the too strict authority of state and society in literature they rebel even more vigorously against the bond of classicism which have sternly repress a writer 's ambition to follow he own ideal and to express they in he own way naturally such a age of revolution be essentially poetic -- only the elizabethan age surpass it in this respect -- and it produce a large number of minor writer who follow more or less closely the example of its great leader among novelist we have jane austen france burney marium edgeworth jane porter and susan ferrier -- all woman be it note among the poet campbell moore hogg -lrb- the ettrick shepherd -rrb- mr heman heber keble hood and ingoldsby -lrb- richard barham -rrb- and among miscellaneous writer sidney smith christopher north -lrb- john wilson -rrb- chalmer lockhart leigh hunt hazlitt hallam and landor here be a astonishing variety of writer and to consider all they claim to remembrance would of itself require a volume though these be generally class as secondary writer much of they work have claim to popularity and some of it to permanence moore 's _ irish melody _ campbell 's lyric keble 's _ christian year _ and jane porter 's _ thaddeus of warsaw _ and _ scottish chief _ have still a multitude of reader where keat lamb and de quincey be prize only by the culture few and hallam 's historical and critical work be perhaps better know than those of gibbon who nevertheless occupy a larger place in we literature among all these writer we choose only two jane austen and walter savage landor whose work indicate a period of transition from the romantic to the victorian age jane austen -lrb- 1775-1817 -rrb- we have so lately rediscover the charm and genius of this gifted young woman that she seem to be a novelist of yesterday rather than the contemporary of wordsworth and coleridge and few even of she reader realize that she do for the english novel precisely what the lake poet do for english poetry -- she refine and simplify it make it a true reflection of english life like the lake poet she meet with scanty encouragement in she own generation she greatest novel _ pride and prejudice _ be finish in 1797 a year before the appearance of the famous _ lyrical ballad _ of wordsworth and coleridge but while the latter book be publish and find a few appreciative reader the manuscript of this wonderful novel go beg for sixteen year before it find a publisher as wordsworth begin with the deliberate purpose of make poetry natural and truthful so miss austen appear to have begin write with the idea of present the life of english country society exactly as it be in opposition to the romantic extravagance of mr radcliffe and she school but there be this difference -- that miss austen have in large measure the saving gift of humor which wordsworth sadly lack marium edgeworth at the same time set a sane and excellent example in she tale of irish life _ the absentee _ and _ castle rackrent _ and miss austen follow up the advantage with at least six work which have grow steadily in value until we place they gladly in the first rank of we novel of common life it be not simply for she exquisite charm therefore that we admire she but also for she influence in bring we novel back to they true place as a expression of human life it be due partly at least to she influence that a multitude of reader be ready to appreciate mr gaskell 's _ cranford _ and the powerful and enduring work of george eliot life jane austen 's life give little opportunity for the biographer unless perchance he have something of she own power to show the beauty and charm of commonplace thing she be the seventh child of rev george austen rector of steventon and be bear in the parsonage of the village in 1775 with she sister she be educate at home and pass she life very quietly cheerfully in the do of small domestic duty to which love lend the magic lamp that make all thing beautiful she begin to write at a early age and seem to have do she work on a little table in the family sit room in the midst of the family life when a visitor enter she would throw a paper or a piece of sewing over she work and she modestly refuse to be know as the author of novel which we now count among we treasured possession with the publisher she have little success _ pride and prejudice _ go beg as we have say for sixteen year and _ northanger abbey _ -lrb- 1798 -rrb- be sell for a trivial sum to a publisher who lay it aside and forget it until the appearance and moderate success of _ sense and sensibility _ in 1811 then after keep the manuscript some fifteen year he sell it back to the family who find another publisher a anonymous article in the _ quarterly review _ follow the appearance of _ emma _ in 1815 full of generous appreciation of the charm of the new writer be the beginning of jane austen 's fame and it be only within a few year that we have learn that the friendly and discerning critic be walter scott he continue to be she admirer until she early death but these two the greatest writer of fiction in they age be never bring together both be home-loving people and miss austen especially be averse to publicity and popularity she die quietly as she have live at winchester in 1817 and be bury in the cathedral she be a bright attractive little woman whose sunny quality be unconsciously reflect in all she book work very few english writer ever have so narrow a field of work as jane austen like the french novelist whose success seem to lie in choose the tiny field that they know best she work have a exquisite perfection that be lack in most of we writer of fiction with the exception of a occasional visit to the watering place of bath she whole life be spend in small country parish whose simple country people become the character of she novel she brother be in the navy and so naval officer furnish the only exciting element in she story but even these allege hero lay aside they impose martial way and act like themselves and other people such be she literary field in which the chief duty be of the household the chief pleasure in country gathering and the chief interest in matrimony life with its mighty interest its passion ambition and tragic struggle sweep by like a great river while the secluded interest of a country parish go round and round quietly like a eddy behind a shelter rock we can easily understand therefore the limitation of jane austen but within she own field she be unequaled she character be absolutely true to life and all she work have the perfection of a delicate miniature painting the most widely read of she novel be _ pride and prejudice _ but three other _ sense and sensibility emma _ and _ mansfield park _ have slowly win they way to the front rank of fiction from a literary view point _ northanger abbey _ be perhaps the best for in it we find that touch of humor and delicate satire with which this gentle little woman combate the grotesque popular novel of the _ udolpho _ type read any of these work one be incline to accept the hearty indorsement of sir walter scott : that young lady have a talent for describe the involvement and feeling and character of ordinary life which be to I the most wonderful i ever meet with the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now go but the exquisite touch which render ordinary commonplace thing and character interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment be deny to I what a pity such a gifted creature die so early walter savage landor -lrb- 1775-1864 -rrb- while hazlitt lamb de quincey and other romantic critic go back to early english literature for they inspiration landor show a reaction from the prevail romanticism by he imitation of the ancient classic writer he life be a extraordinary one and like he work abound in sharp contrast on the one hand there be he egoism he unncontrollable anger he perpetual lawsuit and the last sad tragedy with he child which suggest _ king lear _ and he daughter on the other hand there be he steady devotion to the classic and to the cultivation of the deep wisdom of the ancient which suggest pindar and cicero in he work we find the wild extravagance of _ gebir _ follow by the superb classic style and charm of _ pericle and aspasium _ such be landor a man of high ideal perpetually at war with himself and the world life lander 's stormy life cover the whole period from wordsworth 's childhood to the middle of the victorian era he be the son of a physician and be bear at warwick in 1775 from he mother he inherit a fortune but it be soon scatter by large expenditure and law quarrel and in he old age refuse help by he own child only brown 's generosity keep landor from actual want at rugby and at oxford he extreme republicanism bring he into constant trouble and he fitting out a band of volunteer to assist the spaniard against napoleon in 1808 ally he with byron and he quixotic follower the resemblance to byron be even more strikingly show in the poem _ gebir _ publish in 1798 a year make famous by the _ lyrical ballad _ of wordsworth and coleridge a remarkable change in lander 's life be noticeable in 1821 when at forty-six year of age after have lose he magnificent estate of llanthony abbey in glamorganshire and after a stormy experience in como he settle down for a time at fiesole near florence to this period of calm after storm we owe the classical prose work for which he be famous the calm like that at the center of a whirlwind last but a short time and landor leave he family in great anger return to bath where he live alone for more than twenty year then in order to escape a libel suit the choleric old man flee back to italy he die at florence in 1864 the spirit of he whole life may be infer from the defiant farewell which he fling to it : i strove with none for none be worth my strife nature i loved and next to nature art i warm both hand before the fire of life it sink and i be ready to depart work landor 's reaction from romanticism be all the more remarkable in view of he early effort such as _ gebir _ a wildly romantic poem which rival any work of byron or shelley in its extravagance notwithstanding its occasional beautiful and suggestive line the work be not and never have be successful and the same may be say of all he poetical work he first collection of poem be publish in 1795 he last a full half century later in 1846 in the latter volume _ the hellenic _ -- which include some translation of he earlier latin poem call _ idyllia heroica -- _ one have only to read the hamadryad and compare it with the lyric of the first volume in order to realize the astonishing literary vigor of a man who publish two volume a half century apart without any appreciable diminution of poetical feeling in all these poem one be impress by the striking and original figure of speech which landor use to emphasize he mean it be by he prose work largely that landor have win a place in we literature partly because of they intrinsic worth they penetrate thought and severe classic style and partly because of they profound influence upon the writer of the present age the most note of he prose work be he six volume of _ imaginary conversation _ -lrb- 1824-1846 -rrb- for these conversation landor bring together sometimes in group sometimes in couple well-known character or rather shadow from the four corner of the earth and from the remotest age of recorded history thus diogene talk with plato æsop with a young slave girl in egypt henry viii with anne boleyn in prison dante with beatrice leofric with lady godiva -- all these and many other from epictetus to cromwell be bring together and speak of life and love and death each from he own view point occasionally as in the meeting of henry and anne boleyn the situation be tense and dramatic but as a rule the character simply meet and converse in the same quiet strain which become after much reading somewhat monotonous on the other hand one who read the _ imaginary conversation _ be lift at once into a calm and noble atmosphere which brace and inspire he make he forget petty thing like a view from a hilltop by its combination of lofty thought and severely classic style the book have win and deserve a very high place among we literary record the same criticism apply to _ pericle and aspasium _ which be a series of imaginary letter tell the experience of aspasium a young lady from asia minor who visit athen at the summit of its fame and glory in the great age of pericle this be in we judgment the best worth reading of all landor 's work one get from it not only landor 's classic style but -- what be well worth while -- a better picture of greece in the day of its greatness than can be obtain from many historical volume summary of the age of romanticism this period extend from the war with the colony follow the declaration of independence in 1776 to the accession of victorium in 1837 both limit be very indefinite as will be see by a glance at the chronology follow during the first part of the period especially england be in a continual turmoil produce by political and economic agitation at home and by the long war that cover two continent and the wide sea between they the mighty change result from these two cause have give this period the name of the age of revolution the storm center of all the turmoil at home and abroad be the french revolution which have a profound influence on the life and literature of all europe on the continent the overthrow of napoleon at waterloo -lrb- 1815 -rrb- apparently check the progress of liberty which have start with the french revolution -lrb- 233 -rrb- but in england the case be reverse the agitation for popular liberty which at one time threaten a revolution go steadily forward till it result in the final triumph of democracy in the reform bill of 1832 and in a number of exceedingly important reform such as the extension of manhood suffrage the removal of the last unjust restriction against catholic the establishment of a national system of school follow by a rapid increase in popular education and the abolition of slavery in all english colony -lrb- 1833 -rrb- to this we must add the change produce by the discovery of steam and the invention of machinery which rapidly change england from a agricultural to a manufacturing nation introduce the factory system and cause this period to be know as the age of industrial revolution the literature of the age be largely poetical in form and almost entirely romantic in spirit for as we have note the triumph of democracy in government be generally accompany by the triumph of romanticism in literature at first the literature as show especially in the early work of wordsworth byron and shelley reflect the turmoil of the age and the wild hope of a ideal democracy occasion by the french revolution later the extravagant enthusiasm subside and english writer produce so much excellent literature that the age be often call the second creative period the first be the age of elizabeth the six chief characteristic of the age be : the prevalence of romantic poetry the creation of the historical novel by scott the first appearance of woman novelist such as mr anne radcliffe jane porter marium edgeworth and jane austen the development of literary criticism in the work of lamb de quincey coleridge and hazlitt the practical and economic bent of

chapter xi the victorian age -lrb- 1850-1900 -rrb- the modern period of progress and unrest when victorium become queen in 1837 english literature seem to have enter upon a period of lean year in marked contrast with the poetic fruitfulness of the romantic age which we have just study coleridge shelley keat byron and scott have pass away and it seem as if there be no writer in england to fill they place wordsworth have write in 1835 like cloud that rake the mountain summit or wave that own no curb hand how fast have brother follow brother from sunshine to the sunless land in these line be reflect the sorrowful spirit of a literary man of the early nineteenth century who remember the glory that have pass away from the earth but the leanness of these first year be more apparent than real keat and shelley be dead it be true but already there have appear three disciple of these poet who be destine to be far more widely read than be they master tennyson have be publish poetry since 1827 he first poem appear almost simultaneously with the last work of byron shelley and keat but it be not until 1842 with the publication of he collect poem in two volume that england recognize in he one of she great literary leader so also elizabeth barrett have be write since 1820 but not till twenty year later do she poem become deservedly popular and browning have publish he _ pauline _ in 1833 but it be not until 1846 when he publish the last of the series call _ bell and pomegranate _ that the read public begin to appreciate he power and originality moreover even as romanticism seem pass away a group of great prose writer -- dickens thackeray carlyle and ruskin -- have already begin to proclaim the literary glory of a new age which now seem to rank only just below the elizabethan and the romantic period historical summary amid the multitude of social and political force of this great age four thing stand out clearly first the long struggle of the anglo-saxon for personal liberty be definitely settle and democracy become the established order of the day the king who appear in a age of popular weakness and ignorance and the peer who come with the norman in triumph be both strip of they power and leave as figurehead of a past civilization the last vestige of personal government and of the divine right of ruler disappear the house of common become the ruling power in england and a series of new reform bill rapidly extend the suffrage until the whole body of english people choose for themselves the man who shall represent they second because it be a age of democracy it be a age of popular education of religious tolerance of grow brotherhood and of profound social unrest the slave have be free in 1833 but in the middle of the century england awake to the fact that slave be not necessarily negro steal in africa to be sell like cattle in the market place but that multitude of man woman and little child in the mine and factory be victim of a more terrible industrial and social slavery to free these slave also the unwilling victim of we unnatural competitive method have be the grow purpose of the victorian age until the present day third because it be a age of democracy and education it be a age of comparative peace england begin to think less of the pomp and false glitter of fight and more of its moral evil as the nation realize that it be the common people who bear the burden and the sorrow and the poverty of war while the privileged class reap most of the financial and political reward moreover with the growth of trade and of friendly foreign relation it become evident that the social equality for which england be contend at home belong to the whole race of man that brotherhood be universal not insular that a question of justice be never settle by fight and that war be generally unmitigated horror and barbarism tennyson who come of age when the great reform bill occupy attention express the ideal of the liberal of he day who propose to spread the gospel of peace till the war-drum throbb would no longer and the battle-flag be furl in the parliament of man the federation of the world fourth the victorian age be especially remarkable because of its rapid progress in all the art and science and in mechanical invention a glance at any record of the industrial achievement of the nineteenth century will show how vast they be and it be unnecessary to repeat here the list of the invention from spin loom to steamboat and from match to electric light all these material thing as well as the growth of education have they influence upon the life of a people and it be inevitable that they should react upon its prose and poetry though as yet we be too much absorb in we science and mechanic to determine accurately they influence upon literature when these new thing shall by long use have become familiar as country road or have be replace by newer and better thing then they also will have they association and memory and a poem on the railroad may be as suggestive as wordsworth 's sonnet on westminster bridge and the busy practical workingman who to-day throng we street and factory may seem to a future and greater age as quaint and poetical as to we seem the slow toiler of the middle age literary characteristic when one be interested enough to trace the genealogy of victorium he find to he surprise that in she vein flow the blood both of william the conqueror and of cerdic the first saxon king of england and this seem to be symbolic of the literature of she age which embrace the whole realm of saxon and norman life -- the strength and ideal of the one and the culture and refinement of the other the romantic revival have do its work and england enter upon a new free period in which every form of literature from pure romance to gross realism struggle for expression at this day it be obviously impossible to judge the age as a whole but we be get far enough away from the early half of it to notice certain definite characteristic first though the age produce many poet and two who deserve to rank among the greatest nevertheless this be emphatically a age of prose and since the number of reader have increase a thousandfold with the spread of popular education it be the age of the newspaper the magazine and the modern novel -- the first two be the story of the world 's daily life and the last we pleasantest form of literary entertainment as well as we most successful method of present modern problem and modern ideal the novel in this age fill a place which the drama hold in the day of elizabeth and never before in any age or language have the novel appear in such number and in such perfection -lrb- moral purpose -rrb- the second marked characteristic of the age be that literature both in prose and in poetry seem to depart from the purely artistic standard of art for art 's sake and to be actuate by a definite moral purpose tennyson brown carlyle ruskin -- who and what be these man if not the teacher of england not vaguely but definitely with superb faith in they message and with the conscious moral purpose to uplift and to instruct even the novel break away from scott 's romantic influence and first study life as it be and then point out what life may and ought to be whether we read the fun and sentiment of dickens the social miniature of thackeray or the psychological study of george eliot we find in almost every case a definite purpose to sweep away error and to reveal the underlie truth of human life so the novel seek to do for society in this age precisely what lyell and darwin seek to do for science that be to find the truth and to show how it might be use to uplift humanity perhaps for this reason the victorian age be emphatically a age of realism rather than of romance -- not the realism of zolum and ibsen but a deeper realism which strive to tell the whole truth show moral and physical disease as they be but hold up health and hope as the normal condition of humanity it be somewhat customary to speak of this age as a age of doubt and pessimism follow the new conception of man and of the universe which be formulate by science under the name of involution it be speak of also as a prosaic age lack in great ideal both these criticism seem to be the result of judge a large thing when we be too close to it to get its true proportion just as cologne cathedral one of the world 's most perfect structure seem to be a shapeless pile of stone when we stand too close beneath its mighty wall and buttress tennyson 's immature work like that of the minor poet be sometimes in a doubtful or despairing strain but he _ in memoriam _ be like the rainbow after storm and browning seem better to express the spirit of he age in the strong manly faith of rabbi ben ezra and in the courageous optimism of all he poetry stedman 's _ victorian anthology _ be on the whole a most inspiring book of poetry it would be hard to collect more varied cheer from any age and the great essayist like macaulay carlyle ruskin and the great novelist like dickens thackeray george eliot generally leave we with a larger charity and with a deeper faith in we humanity so also the judgment that this age be too practical for great ideal may be only a description of the husk that hide a very full ear of corn it be well to remember that spenser and sidney judge they own age -lrb- which we now consider to be the greatest in we literary history -rrb- to be altogether give over to materialism and to be incapable of literary greatness just as time have make we smile at they blindness so the next century may correct we judgment of this as a material age and look upon the enormous growth of charity and brotherhood among we and at the literature which express we faith in man may judge the victorian age to be on the whole the noblest and most inspiring in the history of the world i the poet of the victorian age alfr tennyson -lrb- 1809-1892 -rrb- o young mariner you from the haven under the sea-cliff you that be watch the gray magician with eye of wonder _ i _ be merlin and _ i _ be die _ i _ be merlin who follow the gleam o young mariner down to the haven call you companion launch you vessel and crowd you canvas and ere it vanish over the margin after it follow it follow the gleam one who read this haunting poem of merlin and the gleam find in it a suggestion of the spirit of the poet 's whole life -- he devotion to the ideal as express in poetry he early romantic impression he struggle doubt triumph and he thrilling message to he race throughout the entire victorian period tennyson stand at the summit of poetry in england not in vain be he appoint laureate at the death of wordsworth in 1850 for almost alone among those who have hold the office he feel the importance of he place and fill and honor it for nearly half a century tennyson be not only a man and a poet he be a voice the voice of a whole people express in exquisite melody they doubt and they faith they grief and they triumph in the wonderful variety of he verse he suggest all the quality of england 's greatest poet the dreaminess of spenser the majesty of milton the natural simplicity of wordsworth the fantasy of blake and coleridge the melody of keat and shelley the narrative vigor of scott and byron -- all these striking quality be evident on successive page of tennyson 's poetry the only thing lack be the dramatic power of the elizabethan in reflect the restless spirit of this progressive age tennyson be as remarkable as pope be in voice the artificiality of the early eighteenth century as a poet therefore who express not so much a personal as a national spirit he be probably the most representative literary man of the victorian era life tennyson 's life be a remarkable one in this respect that from begin to end he seem to have be dominate by a single impulse the impulse of poetry he have no large or remarkable experience no wild oats to sow no great success or reverse no business care or public office for sixty-six year from the appearance of the _ poem by two brother _ in 1827 until he death in 1892 he study and practice he art continually and exclusively only brown he fellow-worker resemble he in this but the difference in the two man be world-wide tennyson be naturally shy retire indifferent to man hate noise and publicity loving to be alone with nature like wordsworth browning be sociable delight in applause in society in travel in the noise and bustle of the big world tennyson be bear in the rectory of somersby lincolnshire in 1809 the sweet influence of he early natural surroundings can be better understand from he early poem than from any biography he be one of the twelve child of the rev george clayton tennyson a scholarly clergyman and he wife elizabeth fytche a gentle lovable woman not learn save in gracious household way to whom the poet pay a son 's loyal tribute near the close of _ the princess _ it be interesting to note that most of these child be poetically inclined and that two of the brother charle and frederick give far greater promise than do alfr when seven year old the boy go to he grandmother 's house at louth in order to attend a famous grammar school at that place not even a man 's memory which generally make light of hardship and glorify early experience could ever soften tennyson 's hatred of school life he complaint be not so much at the roughness of the boy which have so frightened cowper as at the brutality of the teacher who put over the school door a wretched latin inscription translate solomon 's barbarous advice about the rod and the child in these psychologic day when the child be more important than the curriculum and when we teach girl and boy rather than latin and arithmetic we read with wonder carlyle 's description of he own schoolmaster evidently a type of he kind who know of the human soul thus much that it have a faculty call memory and could be act on through the muscular integument by appliance of birch rod after four year of most unsatisfactory school life tennyson return home and be fit for the university by he scholarly father with he brother he write many verse and he first effort appear in a little volume call _ poem by two brother _ in 1827 the next year he enter trinity college cambridge where he become the center of a brilliant circle of friend chief of whom be the young poet arthur henry hallam at the university tennyson soon become know for he poetical ability and two year after he entrance he gain the prize of the chancellor 's medal for a poem call timbuctoo the subject needless to say be choose by the chancellor soon after win this honor tennyson publish he first sign work call _ poem chiefly lyrical _ -lrb- 1830 -rrb- which though it seem somewhat crude and disappointing to we now nevertheless contain the germ of all he later poetry one of the most noticeable thing in this volume be the influence which byron evidently exert over the poet in he early day and it be perhaps due largely to the same romantic influence that tennyson and he friend hallam presently sail away to spain with the idea of join the army of insurgent against king ferdinand consider purely as a revolutionary venture this be something of a fiasco suggest the noble duke of york and he ten thousand man -- he march they up a hill one day and he march they down again from a literary view point however the experience be not without its value the deep impression which the wild beauty of the pyrenee make upon the young poet 's mind be reflect clearly in the poem oenone in 1831 tennyson leave the university without take he degree the reason for this step be not clear but the family be poor and poverty may have play a large part in he determination he father die a few month later but by a generous arrangement with the new rector the family retain the rectory at somersby and here for nearly six year tennyson live in a retirement which strongly suggest milton at horton he read and study widely cultivate a intimate acquaintance with nature think deeply on the problem suggest by the reform bill which be then agitating england and during he leisure hour write poetry the first fruit of this retirement appear late in 1832 in a wonderful little volume bear the simple name _ poem _ as the work of a youth only twenty-three this book be remarkable for the variety and melody of its verse among its treasure we still read with delight the loto eater palace of art a dream of fair woman the miller 's daughter oenone and the lady of shalott but the critic of the _ quarterly _ who have brutally condemn he earlier work be again unmercifully severe the effect of this harsh criticism upon a sensitive nature be most unfortunate and when he friend hallam die in 1833 tennyson be plunge into a period of gloom and sorrow the sorrow may be read in the exquisite little poem begin break break break on thy cold gray stone o sea which be he first publish elegy for he friend and the depressing influence of the harsh and unjust criticism be suggest in merlin and the gleam which the reader will understand only after he have read tennyson 's biography for nearly ten year after hallam 's death tennyson publish nothing and he movement be hard to trace as the family go here and there seek peace and a home in various part of england but though silent he continue to write poetry and it be in these sad wander day that he begin he immortal _ in memoriam _ and he _ idyll of the king _ in 1842 he friend persuade he to give he work to the world and with some hesitation he publish he _ poem _ the success of this work be almost instantaneous and we can appreciate the favor with which it be receive when we read the noble blank verse of ulyss and morte d'arthur the perfect little song of grief for hallam which we have already mention and the exquisite idyl like dora and the gardener 's daughter which arouse even wordsworth 's enthusiasm and bring from he a letter say that he have be try all he life to write such a english pastoral as dora and have fail from this time forward tennyson with increase confidence in himself and he message steadily maintain he place as the best know and best loved poet in england the year 1850 be a happy one for tennyson he be appoint poet laureate to succeed wordsworth and he marry emily sellwood she whose gentle will have change my fate and make my life a perfumed altar flame whom he have love for thirteen year but whom he poverty have prevent he from marry the year be make further remarkable by the publication of _ in memoriam _ probably the most enduring of he poem upon which he have work at interval for sixteen year three year later with the money that he work now bring he he lease the house farringford in the isle of wight and settle in the first permanent home he have know since he leave the rectory at somersby for the remain forty year of he life he live like wordsworth in the stillness of a great peace write steadily and enjoy the friendship of a large number of people some distinguish some obscure from the kindly and sympathetic victorium to the servant on he own farm all of these he call with equal sincerity he friend and to each one he be the same man simple strong kindly and noble carlyle describe he as a fine large-featured dim-eyed bronze-colored shaggy-headed man most restful brotherly solid-hearted loving solitude and hate publicity as he do the numerous tourist from both side of the ocean who seek he out in he retreat and insist upon see he make he life at time intolerable influence partly by the desire to escape such popularity he buy land and build for himself a new house aldworth in surrey though he make he home in farringford for the greater part of the year he labor during these year and he marvelous freshness and youthfulness of feeling be best understand by a glance at the contents of he complete work inferior poem like _ the princess _ which be write in the first flush of he success and he drama which be write against the advice of he best friend may easily be criticise but the bulk of he verse show a astonishing originality and vigor to the very end he die very quietly at aldworth with he family about he in the moonlight and beside he a volume of shakespeare open at the dirge in _ cymbeline : _ fear no more the heat o ' the sun nor the furious winter 's rage thou thy worldly task hast do home art go and ta'en thy wages the strong and noble spirit of he life be reflect in one of he best know poem cross the bar which be write in he eighty-first year and which he desire should be place at the end of he collect work : sunset and evening star and one clear call for I and may there be no moaning of the bar when i put out to sea but such a tide as move seem asleep too full for sound and foam when that which draw from out the boundless deep turn again home twilight and evening bell and after that the dark and may there be no sadness of farewell when i embark for tho ' from out we bourne of time and place the flood may bear I far i hope to see my pilot face to face when i have crost the bar work at the outset of we study of tennyson 's work it may be well to record two thing by way of suggestion first tennyson 's poetry be not so much to be study as to be read and appreciate he be a poet to have open on one 's table and to enjoy as one enjoy he daily exercise and second we should by all means begin to get acquaint with tennyson in the day of we youth unlike browning who be generally appreciate by more mature mind tennyson be for enjoyment for inspiration rather than for instruction only youth can fully appreciate he and youth unfortunately except in a few rare beautiful case be something which do not dwell with we long after we school day the secret of poetry especially of tennyson 's poetry be to be eternally young and like adam in paradise to find every morning a new world fresh wonderful inspiring as if just from the hand of god except by the student eager to understand the whoje range of poetry in this age tennyson 's earlier poem and he later drama may well be omit opinion vary about both but the general judgment seem to be that the earlier poem show too much of byron 's influence and they crudeness suffer by comparison with the exquisitely finish work of tennyson 's middle life of dramatic work he write seven he great ambition be to present a large part of the history of england in a series of drama _ becket _ be one of the best of these work and meet with considerable favor on the stage but like all the other it indicate that tennyson lack the dramatic power and the humor necessary for a successful playwright among the remain poem there be such a wide variety that every reader must be leave largely to follow he own delightful choice -lrb- 235 -rrb- of the _ poem _ of 1842 we have already mention those best worth read _ the princess a medley _ -lrb- 1847 -rrb- a long poem of over three thousand line of blank verse be tennyson 's answer to the question of woman 's rights and woman 's sphere which be then as in we own day strongly agitate the public mind in this poem a baby finally solve the problem which philosopher have ponder ever since man begin to think connectedly about human society a few exquisite song like tear idle tear bugle song and sweet and low form the most delightful part of this poem which in general be hardly up to the standard of the poet 's later work _ maud _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- be what be call in literature a monodrama tell the story of a lover who pass from morbidness to ecstasy then to anger and murder follow by insanity and recovery this be tennyson 's favorite and among he friend he read aloud from it more than from any other poem perhaps if we could hear tennyson read it we should appreciate it better but on the whole it seem overwrought and melodramatic even its lyric like come into the garden maud which make this work a favorite with young lover be characterize by prettiness rather than by beauty or strength perhaps the most love of all tennyson 's work be _ in memoriam _ which on account of both its theme and its exquisite workmanship be one of the few immortal name that be not bear to die the immediate occasion of this remarkable poem be tennyson 's profound personal grief at the death of he friend hallam as he write lyric after lyric inspire by this sad subject the poet 's grief become less personal and the greater grief of humanity mourning for its dead and question its immortality take possession of he gradually the poem become a expression first of universal doubt and then of universal faith a faith which rest ultimately not on reason or philosophy but on the soul 's instinct for immortality the immortality of human love be the theme of the poem which be make up of over one hundred different lyric the movement take we through three year rise slowly from poignant sorrow and doubt to a calm peace and hope and end with a noble hymn of courage and faith -- a modest courage and a humble faith love-inspired -- which will be a favorite as long as saddened man turn to literature for consolation though darwin 's greatest book have not yet be write science have already overturn many old conception of life and tennyson who live apart and think deeply on all the problem of he day give this poem to the world as he own answer to the doubt and questioning of man this universal human interest together with its exquisite form and melody make the poem in popular favor at least the supreme threnody or elegiac poem of we literature though milton 's _ lycida _ be from the critical view point undoubtedly a more artistic work _ the idyll of the king _ rank among the greatest of tennyson 's later work its general subject be the celtic legend of king arthur and he knight of the round table and the chief source of its material be malory 's _ morte d'arthur _ here in this mass of beautiful legend be certainly the subject of a great national epic yet after four hundred year during which many poet have use the material the great epic be still unwritten milton and spenser as we have already note consider this material carefully and milton alone of all english writer have perhaps the power to use it in a great epic tennyson begin to use these legend in he _ morte d'arthur _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- but the epic idea probably occur to he later in 1856 when he begin geraint and enid and he add the story of vivien elaine guinevere and other hero and heroine at interval until balin the last of the _ idyll _ appear in 1885 later these work be gather together and arrange with a attempt at unity the result be in no sense a epic poem but rather a series of single poem loosely connect by a thread of interest in arthur the central personage and in he unsuccessful attempt to find a ideal kingdom entirely different in spirit be another collection of poem call _ english idyl _ -lrb- 236 -rrb- which begin in the _ poem _ of 1842 and which tennyson intend should reflect the ideal of widely different type of english life of these varied poem dora the gardener 's daughter ulyss locksley hall and sir galahad be the best but all be worthy of study one of the most famous of this series be enoch arden -lrb- 1864 -rrb- in which tennyson turn from mediæval knight from lord hero and fair lady to find the material for true poetry among the lowly people that make up the bulk of english life its rare melody its sympathy for common life and its revelation of the beauty and heroism which hide in humble man and woman everywhere make this work a instant favorite judge by its sale alone it be the most popular of he work during the poet 's lifetime tennyson 's later volume like the _ ballad _ -lrb- 1880 -rrb- and _ demeter _ -lrb- 1889 -rrb- should not be overlook since they contain some of he best work the former contain stir war song like the defense of lucknow and picture of wild passionate grief like rizpah the latter be notable for romney 's remorse a wonderful piece of work merlin and the gleam which express the poet 's lifelong ideal and several exquisite little song like the throstle and the oak which show how marvelously the aged poet retain he youthful freshness and inspiration here certainly be variety enough to give we long year of literary enjoyment and we need hardly mention miscellaneous poem like the brook and the charge of the light brigade which be know to every schoolboy and wages and the higher pantheism which should be read by every man who think about the old old problem of life and death characteristic of tennyson 's poetry if we attempt to sum up the quality of tennyson as show in all these work the task be a difficult one but three thing stand out more or less plainly first tennyson be essentially the artist no other in he age study the art of poetry so constantly or with such singleness of purpose and only swinburne rival he in melody and the perfect finish of he verse second like all the great writer of he age he be emphatically a teacher often a leader in the precede age as the result of the turmoil produce by the french revolution lawlessness be more or less common and individuality be the rule in literature tennyson 's theme so characteristic of he age be the reign of order -- of law in the physical world produce evolution and of law in the spiritual world work out the perfect man _ in memoriam idyll of the king the princess _ - here be three widely different poem yet the theme of each so far as poetry be a kind of spiritual philosophy and weigh its word before it utter they be the orderly development of law in the natural and in the spiritual world this certainly be a new doctrine in poetry but the message do not end here law imply a source a method a object tennyson after face he doubt honestly and manfully find law even in the sorrow and loss of humanity he give this law a infinite and personal source and find the supreme purpose of all law to be a revelation of divine love all earthly love therefore become a image of the heavenly what first perhaps attract reader to tennyson as to shakespeare be the character of he woman -- pure gentle refined being whom we must revere as we anglo - saxon forefather revere the woman they love like brown the poet have love one good woman supremely and she love make clear the meaning of all life the message go one step farther because law and love be in the world faith be the only reasonable attitude toward life and death even though we understand they not such in a few word seem to be tennyson 's whole message and philosophy if we attempt now to fix tennyson 's permanent place in literature as the result of he life and work we must apply to he the same test that we apply to milton and wordsworth and indeed to all we great poet and ask with the german critic what new thing have he say to the world or even to he own country the answer be frankly that we do not yet know surely that we be still too near tennyson to judge he impersonally this much however be clear in a marvelously complex age and amid a hundred great man he be regard as a leader for a full half century he be the voice of england loved and honor as a man and a poet not simply by a few discerning critic but by a whole people that do not easily give they allegiance to any one man and that for the present be tennyson 's sufficient eulogy robert browning -lrb- 1812-1889 -rrb- how good be man 's life the mere living how fit to employ all the heart and the soul and the sens for ever in joy in this new song of david from browning 's _ saul _ we have a suggestion of the astonishing vigor and hope that characterize all the work of brown the one poet of the age who after thirty year of continuous work be finally recognize and place beside tennyson and whom future age may judge to be a greater poet -- perhaps even the greatest in we literature since shakespeare the chief difficulty in read browning be the obscurity of he style which the critic of half a century ago hold up to ridicule they attitude towards the poet 's early work may be infer from tennyson 's humorous criticism of _ sordello _ it may be remember that the first line of this obscure poem be who will may hear sordello 's story tell and that the last line be who would have hear sordello 's story tell tennyson remark that these be the only line in the whole poem that he understand and that they be evidently both lie if we attempt to explain this obscurity which puzzle tennyson and many less friendly critic we find that it have many source first the poet 's thought be often obscure or else so extremely subtle that language express it imperfectly -- thought hardly to be pack into a narrow act fancy that break through language and escape second browning be lead from one thing to another by he own mental association and forget that the reader 's association may be of a entirely different kind third browning be careless in he english and frequently clip he speech give we a series of ejaculation as we do not quite understand he process of thought we must stop between the ejaculation to trace out the connection fourth browning 's allusion be often far-fetched refer to some odd scrap of information which he have pick up in he wide reading and the ordinary reader find it difficult to trace and understand they finally brown write too much and revise too little the time which he should have give to make one think clear be use in express other thought that flit through he head like a flock of swallow he field be the individual soul never exactly alike in any two man and he seek to express the hidden motive and principle which govern individual action in this field he be like a miner delving underground send up mass of mingled earth and ore and the reader must sift all this material to separate the gold from the dross here certainly be sufficient reason for browning 's obscurity and we must add the word that the fault seem unpardonable for the simple reason that browning show himself capable at time of write directly melodiously and with noble simplicity so much for the fault which must be face and overlook before one find the treasure that be hide in browning 's poetry of all the poet in we literature no other be so completely so consciously so magnificently a teacher of man he feel he mission of faith and courage in a world of doubt and timidity for thirty year he face indifference or ridicule work bravely and cheerfully the while until he make the world recognize and follow he the spirit of he whole life be well express in he _ paracelsus _ write when he be only twenty-two year old : i see my way as bird they trackless way i shall arrive -- what time what circuit first i ask not but unless god send he hail or blind fire-ball sleet or stifle snow in some time he good time i shall arrive he guide I and the bird in he good time he be not like so many other a entertaining poet one can not read he after dinner or when settle in a comfortable easy-chair one must sit up and think and be alert when he read brown if we accept these condition we shall probably find that browning be the most stimulating poet in we language he influence upon we life be positive and tremendous he strength he joy of life he robust faith and he invincible optimism enter into we make we different and better man after read he and perhaps the best thing he can say of browning be that he thought be slowly but surely take possession of all well-educated man and woman life browning 's father be outwardly a business man a clerk for fifty year in the bank of england inwardly he be a interesting combination of the scholar and the artist with the best taste of both he mother be a sensitive musical woman evidently very lovely in character the daughter of a german shipowner and merchant who have settle in scotland she be of celtic descent and carlyle describe she as the true type of a scottish gentlewoman from he neck down browning be the typical briton -- short stocky large-chested robust but even in the lifeless portrait he face change as we view it from different angle now it be like a english business man now like a german scientist and now it have a curious suggestion of uncle remus -- these be no doubt so many different reflection of he mixed and unremembered ancestor he be bear in camberwell on the outskirts of london in 1812 from he home and from he first school at peckham he could see london and the city light by night and the smoky chimney by day have the same powerful fascination for the child that the wood and field and the beautiful country have for he friend tennyson he schooling be short and desultory he education be attend to by private tutor and by he father who leave the boy largely to follow he own inclination like the young milton browning be fond of music and in many of he poem especially in abt vogler and a toccata of galuppus 's he interpret the musical temperament better perhaps than any other writer in we literature but unlike milton through whose poetry there run a great melody music seem to have have no consistent effect upon he verse which be often so jarring that one must wonder how a musical ear could have endure it like tennyson this boy find he work very early and for fifty year hardly a week pass that he do not write poetry he begin at six to produce verse in imitation of byron but fortunately this early work have be lose then he fall under the influence of shelley and he first known work _ pauline _ -lrb- 1833 -rrb- must be consider as a tribute to shelley and he poetry tennyson 's earliest work _ poem by two brother _ have be publish and well pay for five year before but brown could find no publisher who would even consider _ pauline _ and the work be publish by means of money furnish by a indulgent relative this poem receive scant notice from the reviewer who have pounce like hawk on a dovecote upon tennyson 's first two modest volume two year later appear _ paracelsus _ and then he tragedy _ strafford _ be put upon the stage but not till _ sordello _ be publish in 1840 do he attract attention enough to be denounce for the obscurity and vagary of he style six year later in 1846 he suddenly become famous not because he finish in that year he _ bell and pomegranate _ -lrb- which be browning 's symbolic name for poetry and think or singing and sermonizing -rrb- but because he elope with the best know literary woman in england elizabeth barrett whose fame be for many year both before and after she marriage much greater than browning 's and who be at first consider superior to tennyson thereafter until he own work compel attention he be know chiefly as the man who marry elizabeth barrett for year this lady have be a almost helpless invalid and it seem a quixotic thing when brown have fail to gain she family 's consent to the marriage carry she off romantically love and italy prove better than she physician and for fifteen year brown and he wife live a ideally happy life in pisa and in florence the exquisite romance of they love be preserve in mr brown 's _ sonnet from the portuguese _ and in the volume of _ letter _ recently publish -- wonderful letter but so tender and intimate that it seem almost a sacrilege for inquisitive eye to read they mr brown die in florence in 1861 the loss seem at first too much to bear and brown flee with he son to england for the remainder of he life he live alternately in london and in various part of italy especially at the palazzo rezzonico in venice which be now a object of pilgrimage to almost every tourist who visit the beautiful city wherever he go he mingle with man and woman sociable well dress courteous loving crowd and popular applause the very reverse of he friend tennyson he earlier work have be much better appreciate in america than in england but with the publication of _ the ring and the book _ in 1868 he be at last recognize by he countryman as one of the greatest of english poet he die in venice on December 12 1889 the same day that see the publication of he last work _ asolando _ though italy offer he a honor rest place england claim he for she own and he lie bury beside tennyson in westminster abbey the spirit of he whole life be magnificently express in he own line in the epilogue of he last book : one who never turn he back but march breast forward never doubt cloud would break never dream tho ' right be worst wrong would triumph hold we fall to rise be baffle to fight better sleep to wake work a glance at even the title which brown give to he best know volume -- _ dramatic lyric _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- _ dramatic romance and lyric _ -lrb- 1845 -rrb- _ man and woman _ -lrb- 1853 -rrb- _ dramati persona _ -lrb- 1864 -rrb- -- will suggest how strong the dramatic element be in all he work indeed all he poem may be divide into three class -- pure drama like _ strafford _ and _ a blot in the ` scutcheon _ dramatic narrative like _ pippa pass _ which be dramatic in form but be not mean to be act and dramatic lyric like _ the last ride together _ which be short poem express some strong personal emotion or describe some dramatic episode in human life and in which the hero himself generally tell the story though browning be often compare with shakespeare the reader will understand that he have very little of shakespeare 's dramatic talent he can not bring a group of people together and let the action and word of he character show we the comedy and tragedy of human life neither can the author be disinterested satisfied as shakespeare be with life itself without draw any moral conclusion browning have always a moral ready and insist upon give we he own view of life which shakespeare never do he dramatic power lie in depict what he himself call the history of a soul sometimes as in _ paracelsus _ he endeavor to trace the progress of the human spirit more often he take some dramatic moment in life some crisis in the ceaseless struggle between good and evil and describe with wonderful insight the hero 's own thought and feeling but he almost invariably tell we how at such and such a point the good or the evil in he hero must inevitably have triumph and generally as in my last duchess the speaker add a word here and there aside from the story which unconsciously show the kind of man he be it be this power of reveal the soul from within that cause browning to fascinate those who study he long enough he range be enormous and bring all sort and condition of man under analysis the musician in abt vogler the artist in andrea del sarto the early christian in a death in the desert the arab horseman in muteykeh the sailor in herve kiel the mediæval knight in childe roland the hebrew in saul the greek in balaustion 's adventure the monster in caliban the immortal dead in karshish -- all these and a hundred more history of the soul show browning 's marvelous versatility it be this great range of sympathy with many different type of life that constitute browning 's chief likeness to shakespeare though otherwise there be no comparison between the two man if we separate all these dramatic poem into three main period -- the early from 1833 to 1841 the middle from 1841 to 1868 and the late from 1868 to 1889 -- the work of the beginner will be much more easily designate of he early soul study _ pauline _ -lrb- 1833 -rrb- _ paracelsus _ -lrb- 1835 -rrb- and _ sordello _ -lrb- 1840 -rrb- little need be say here except perhaps this : that if we begin with these work we shall probably never read anything else by brown and that be a pity it be better to leave these obscure work until he better poem have so attract we to brown that we will cheerfully endure he worst fault for the sake of he undoubted virtue the same criticism apply though in less degree to he first drama _ strafford _ -lrb- 1837 -rrb- which belong to the early period of he work the merciless criticism which greet _ sordello _ have a wholesome effect on browning as be show in the better work of he second period moreover he new power be develop rapidly as may be see by compare the eight number of he famous _ bell and pomegranate _ series -lrb- 1841-1846 -rrb- with he earlier work thus the first number of this wonderful series publish in 1841 contain _ pippa pass _ which be on the whole the most perfect of he longer poem and another number contain _ a blot in the ` scutcheon _ which be the most readable of he drama even a beginner must be thrill by the beauty and the power of these two work two other noteworthy drama of the period be _ colombe 's birthday _ -lrb- 1844 -rrb- and _ in a balcony _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- which however meet with scant appreciation on the stage have too much subtle analysis and too little action to satisfy the public nearly all he best lyric drama and dramatic poem belong to this middle period of labor and when _ the ring and the book _ appear in 1868 he have give to the world the noblest expression of he poetic genius in the third period begin when brown be nearly sixty year old he write even more industriously than before and publish on a average nearly a volume of poetry a year such volume as _ fifine at the fair red cotton night-cap country the inn album jocoserium _ and many other show how browning gain steadily in the power of reveal the hidden spring of human action but he often ramble most tiresomely and in general he work lose in sustained interest it be perhaps significant that most of he best work be do under mr brown 's influence what to read of the short miscellaneous poem there be such a unusual variety that one must hesitate a little in suggest this or that to the beginner 's attention my star evelyn hope want be -- what home thought from abroad meet at night one word more -lrb- a exquisite tribute to he dead wife -rrb- prospice -lrb- look forward -rrb- song from _ pippa pass _ various love poem like by the fireside and the last ride together the inimitable pied piper and the ballad like hervé riel and how they bring the good news -- these be a mere suggestion express only the writer 's personal preference but a glance at the contents of browning 's volume will reveal score of other poem which another writer might recommend as be better in themselves or more characteristic of browning -lrb- 237 -rrb- among browning 's dramatic soul study there be also a very wide choice andrea del sarto be one of the best reveal as it do the strength and the weakness of the perfect painter whose love for a soulless woman with a pretty face sadden he life and hamper he best work next in importance to andrea stand a epistle recite the experience of karshish a arab physician which be one of the best example of browning 's peculiar method of present the truth the half-scoffing half-earnest and wholly bewildered state of this oriental scientist 's mind be clearly indicate between the line of he letter to he old master he description of lazarus whom he meet by chance and of the state of mind of one who have see the glory of immortality must live again in the midst of the jumble of trivial and stupendous thing which constitute we life form one of the most original and suggestive poem in we literature my last duchess be a short but very keen analysis of the soul of a selfish man who reveal he character unconsciously by he word of praise concern he dead wife 's picture in the bishop order he tomb we have another extraordinarily interesting revelation of the mind of a vain and worldly man this time a churchman whose word tell you far more than he dream about he own character abt vogler undoubtedly one of browning 's finest poem be the study of a musician 's soul muléykeh give we the soul of a arab vain and proud of he fast horse which be never beat in a race a rival steal the horse and ride away upon she back but use as she be to she master 's touch she will not show she best pace to the stranger muléykeh ride up furiously but instead of strike the thief from he saddle he boast about he peerless mare say that if a certain spot on she neck be touch with the rein she could never be overtake instantly the robber touch the spot and the mare answer with a burst of speed that make pursuit hopeless muléykeh have lose he mare but he have keep he pride in the unbeaten one and be satisfied rabbi ben ezra which refuse analysis and which must be read entire to be appreciate be perhaps the most quote of all browning 's work and contain the best expression of he own faith in life both here and hereafter all these wonderful poem be again merely a suggestion they indicate simply the work to which one reader turn when he feel mentally vigorous enough to pick up brown another list of soul study cite a toccata of galuppus 's a grammarian 's funeral fra lippo lippus saul cleon a death in the desert and soliloquy of the spanish cloister might in another 's judgment be more interesting and suggestive -lrb- pippa pass -rrb- among browning 's longer poem there be two at least that well deserve we study _ pippa pass _ aside from its rare poetical quality be a study of unconscious influence the idea of the poem be suggest to brown while listen to a gypsy girl singing in the wood near he home but he transfer the scene of the action to the little mountain town of asolo in italy pippa be a little silk weaver who go out in the morning to enjoy she one holiday of the whole year as she think of she own happiness she be vaguely wish that she might share it and do some good then with she childish imagination she begin to weave a little romance in which she share in the happiness of the four greatest and happiest people in asolo it never occur to she that perhaps there be more of misery than of happiness in the four great one of whom she dream and so she go on she way sing the year 's at the spring and day 's at the morn morning 's at seven the hillside 's dew-pearled the lark 's on the wing the snail 's on the thorn : god 's in he heaven -- all 's right with the world fate will it that the word and music of she little song should come to the ear of four different group of people at the moment when they be face the greatest crisis of they life and turn the scale from evil to good but pippa know nothing of this she enjoy she holiday and go to bed still sing entirely ignorant of the good she have do in the world with one exception it be the most perfect of all browning 's work at best it be not easy nor merely entertaining reading but it richly repay whatever hour we spend in study it _ the ring and the book _ be brown 's masterpiece it be a immense poem twice as long as _ paradise lose _ and longer by some two thousand line than the _ iliad _ and before we begin the undoubted task of read it we must understand that there be no interesting story or dramatic development to carry we along in the beginning we have a outline of the story such as it be -- a horrible story of count guido 's murder of he beautiful young wife and browning tell we in detail just when and how he find a book contain the record of the crime and the trial there the story element end and the symbolism of the book begin the title of the poem be explain by the habit of the old etruscan goldsmith who in make one of they elaborately chase ring would mix the pure gold with a alloy in order to harden it when the ring be finished acid be pour upon it and the acid eat out the alloy leave the beautiful design in pure gold browning purpose to follow the same plan with he literary material which consist simply of the evidence give at the trial of guido in rome in 1698 he intend to mix a poet 's fancy with the crude fact and create a beautiful and artistic work the result of browning 's purpose be a series of monologue in which the same story be retell nine different time by the different actor in the drama the count the young wife the suspect priest the lawyer the pope who preside at the trial -- each tell the story and each unconsciously reveal the depths of he own nature in the recital the most interesting of the character be guido the husband who change from bold defiance to abject fear caponsacchus the young priest who aid the wife in she flight from she brutal husband and be unjustly accuse of false motive pompilia the young wife one of the noblest character in literature fit in all respects to rank with shakespeare 's great heroine and the pope a splendid figure the strongest of all browning 's masculine character when we have read the story as tell by these four different actor we have the best of the poet 's work and of the most original poem in we language browning 's place and message browning 's place in we literature will be better appreciate by comparison with he friend tennyson whom we have just study in one respect at least these poet be in perfect accord each find in love the supreme purpose and meaning of life in other respects especially in they method of approach the truth the two man be the exact opposite tennyson be first the artist and then the teacher but with brown the message be always the important thing and he be careless too careless of the form in which it be express again tennyson be under the influence of the romantic revival and choose he subject daintily but all 's fish that come to browning 's net he take comely and ugly subject with equal pleasure and aim to show that truth lie hide in both the evil and the good this contrast be all the more striking when we remember that browning 's essentially scientific attitude be take by a man who refuse to study science tennyson whose work be always artistic never study art but be devote to the science while brown whose work be seldom artistic in form think that art be the most suitable subject for a man 's study the two poet differ even more widely in they respective message tennyson 's message reflect the grow order of the age and be sum up in the word law in he view the individual will must be suppress the self must always be subordinate he resignation be at time almost oriental in its fatalism and occasionally it suggest schopenhauer in its mixture of fate and pessimism browning 's message on the other hand be the triumph of the individual will over all obstacle the self be not subordinate but supreme there be nothing oriental nothing doubtful nothing pessimistic in the whole range of he poetry he be the voice of the anglo-saxon standing up in the face of all obstacle and say i can and i will he be therefore far more radically english than be tennyson and it may be for this reason that he be the more study and that while youth delight in tennyson manhood be better satisfy with browning because of he invincible will and optimism browning be at present regard as the poet who have speak the strongest word of faith to a age of doubt he energy he cheerful courage he faith in life and in the development that await we beyond the portal of death be like a bugle-call to good living this sum up he present influence upon the mind of those who have learn to appreciate he of the future we can only say that both at home and abroad he seem to be gain steadily in appreciation as the year go by minor poet of the vistorian age elizabeth barrett among the minor poet of the past century elizabeth barrett -lrb- mr brown -rrb- occupy perhaps the highest place in popular favor she be bear at coxhoe hall near durham in 1806 but she childhood and early youth be spend in herefordshire among the malvern hill make famous by _ pier plowman _ in 1835 the barrett family move to london where elizabeth gain a literary reputation by the publication of _ the seraph and other poem _ -lrb- 1838 -rrb- then illness and the shock cause by the tragic death of she brother in 1840 place she frail life in danger and for six year she be confine to she own room the innate strength and beauty of she spirit here show itself strongly in she daily study she poetry and especially in she interest in the social problem which sooner or later occupy all the victorian writer my mind to I a kingdom be might well have be write over the door of the room where this delicate invalid work and suffer in loneliness and in silence in 1844 miss barrett publish she _ poem _ which though somewhat impulsive and overwrought meet with remarkable public favor such poem as the cry of the child which voice the protest of humanity against child labor appeal tremendously to the reader of the age and this young woman 's fame as a poet temporarily overshadow that of tennyson and browning indeed as late as 1850 when wordsworth die she be seriously consider for the position of poet laureate which be finally give to tennyson a reference to browning in lady geraldine 's courtship be suppose to have first lead the poet to write to miss barrett in 1845 soon afterwards he visit the invalid they fall in love almost at first sight and the following year against the wish of she father -- who be evidently a selfish old tyrant -- brown carry she off and married she the exquisite romance of they love be reflect in mr brown 's _ sonnet from the portuguese _ -lrb- 1850 -rrb- this be a noble and inspiring book of love poem and stedman regard the opening sonnet i think once how theocritus have sing as equal to any in we language for fifteen year the browning live a ideally happy life at pisa and at casa guidi florence share the same poetical ambition and love be the greatest thing in the world -- how do i love thee let I count the way i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feel out of sight for the end of be and ideal grace i love thee to the level of everyday 's most quiet need by sun and candlelight i love thee freely as man strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old grief and with my childhood 's faith i love thee with a love i seem to lose with my lose saint -- i love thee with the breath smile tear of all my life -- and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death mr brown enter with whole-souled enthusiasm into the aspiration of italy in its struggle against the tyranny of austrium and she _ casa guidi window _ -lrb- 1851 -rrb- be a combination of poetry and politics both it must be confess a little too emotional in 1856 she publish _ aurora leigh _ a novel in verse have for its hero a young social reformer and for its heroine a young woman poetical and enthusiastic who strongly suggest elizabeth barrett herself it emphasize in verse precisely the same moral and social ideal which dickens and george eliot be proclaim in all they novel she last two volume be _ poem before congress _ -lrb- 1860 -rrb- and _ last poem _ publish after she death she die suddenly in 1861 and be bury in florence browning 's famous line o lyric love half angel and half bird may well apply to she frail life and aerial spirit rossettus dante gabriel rossettus -lrb- 1828-1882 -rrb- the son of a exile italian painter and scholar be distinguish both as a painter and as a poet he be a leader in the pre-raphaelite movement -lrb- 238 -rrb- and publish in the first number of _ the germ _ he hand and soul a delicate prose study and he famous the bless damozel begin the bless damozel lean out from the gold bar of heaven she eye be deeper than the depth of water still at even she have three lily in she hand and the star in she hair be seven these two early work especially the bless damozel with its simplicity and exquisite spiritual quality be characteristic of the ideal of the pre-raphaelite in 1860 after a long engagement rossettus marry elizabeth siddal a delicate beautiful english girl whom he have immortalize both in he picture and in he poetry she die two year later and rossettus never entirely recover from the shock at she burial he place in she coffin the manuscript of all he unpublished poem and only at the persistent demand of he friend do he allow they to be exhume and print in 1870 the publication of this volume of love poem create a sensation in literary circle and rossettus be hail as one of the greatest of live poet in 1881 he publish he _ ballad and sonnet _ a remarkable volume contain among other poem the confession model after brown the ballad of sister helen found on a mediæval superstition the king 's tragedy a masterpiece of dramatic narrative and the house of life a collection of one hundred and one sonnet reflect the poet 's love and loss this last collection deserve to rank with mr brown 's _ sonnet from the portuguese _ and with shakespeare 's _ sonnet _ as one of the three great cycle of love poem in we language it have be well say that both rossettus and morri paint picture as well in they poem as on they canvas and this pictorial quality of they verse be its chief characteristic morri william morris -lrb- 1834-1896 -rrb- be a most interesting combination of literary man and artist in the latter capacity as architect designer and manufacturer of furniture carpet and wall paper and as founder of the kelmscott press for artistic printing and bookbinding he have lay we all under a immense debt of gratitude from boyhood he have steep himself in the legend and ideal of the middle age and he best literary work be wholly mediæval in spirit _ the earthly paradise _ -lrb- 1868-1870 -rrb- be generally regard as he masterpiece this delightful collection of story in verse tell of a roving band of viking who be wreck on the fabled island of atlanti and who discover there a superior race of man have the characteristic of ideal greek the viking remain for a year tell story of they own northland and listen to the classic and oriental tale of they host morri 's interest in icelandic literature be further show by he _ sigurd the volsung _ a epic found upon one of the old saga and by he prose romance _ the house of the wolfing the story of the glitter plain _ and _ the root of the mountain _ later in life he become deeply interested in socialism and two other romance _ the dream of john ball _ and _ news from nowhere _ be interesting as modern attempt at depict a ideal society govern by the principle of more 's _ utopia _ swinburne algernon charle swinburne -lrb- 1837-1909 -rrb- be chronologically the last of the victorian poet as a artist in technique -- have perfect command of all old english verse form and a remarkable faculty for invent new -- he seem at the present time to rank among the best in we literature indeed as stedman say before he advent we do not realize the full scope of english verse this refer to the melodious and constantly change form rather than to the content of swinburne 's poetry at the death of tennyson in 1892 he be undoubtedly the greatest living poet and only he liberal opinion he scorn of royalty and of convention and the prejudice arouse by the pagan spirit of he early work prevent he appointment as poet laureate he have write a very large number of poem drama and essay in literary criticism but we be still too near to judge of the permanence of he work or of he place in literature those who would read and estimate he work for themselves will do well to begin with a volume of select poem especially those which show he love of the sea and he exquisite appreciation of child life he _ atalanta in calydon _ -lrb- 1864 -rrb- a beautiful lyric drama model on the greek tragedy be generally regard as he masterpiece in all he work swinburne carry tennyson 's love of melody to a extreme and often sacrifice sense to sound he poetry be always musical and like music appeal almost exclusively to the emotion \* \* \* \* \* we have choose somewhat arbitrarily these four writer -- mr brown d g rossettus morri and swinburne -- as representative of the minor poet of the age but there be many other who be worthy of study -- arthur hugh clough and matthew arnold -lrb- 239 -rrb- who be often call the poet of skepticism but who in reality represent a reverent seek for truth through reason and human experience frederick william faber the catholic mystic author of some exquisite hymn and the scholarly john keble author of _ the christian year _ we best know book of devotional verse and among the woman poet adelaide procter jean ingelow and christina rossettus each of whom have a large admiring circle of reader it would be a hopeless task at the present time to inquire into the relative merit of all these minor poet we note only they careful workmanship and exquisite melody they wide range of thought and feel they eager search for truth each in he own way and especially the note of freshness and vitality which they have give to english poetry ii the novelist of the victorian age charle dickens -lrb- 1812-1870 -rrb- when we consider dickens 's life and work in comparison with that of the two great poet we have be study the contrast be startling while tennyson and browning be be educate for the life of literature and shield most tenderly from the hardship of the world dicken a poor obscure and suffer child be help to support a shiftless family by paste label on black bottle sleep under a counter like a homeless cat and once a week timidly approach the big prison where he father be confine for debt in 1836 he _ pickwick _ be publish and life be change as if a magician have wave he wand over he while the two great poet be slowly struggle for recognition dickens with plenty of money and too much fame be the acknowledged literary hero of england the idol of immense audience which gather to applaud he wherever he appear and there be also this striking contrast between the novelist and the poet -- that while the whole tendency of the age be toward realism away from the extreme of the romanticist and from the oddity and absurdity of the early novel writer it be precisely by emphasize oddity and absurdity by make caricature rather than character that dicken first achieve he popularity life in dickens 's early life we see a stern but unrecognized preparation for the work that he be to do never be there a better illustration of the fact that a boy 's early hardship and suffering be sometimes only divine messenger disguise and that circumstance which seem only evil be often the source of a man 's strength and of the influence which he be to wield in the world he be the second of eight poor child and be bear at landport in 1812 he father who be suppose to be the original of mr micawber be a clerk in a navy office he could never make both end meet and after struggle with debt in he native town for many year move to london when dickens be nine year old the debt still pursue he and after two year of grandiloquent misfortune he be throw into the poor-debtor ' prison he wife the original of mr micawber then set up the famous board establishment for young lady but in dickens 's word no young lady ever come the only visitor be creditor and they be quite ferocious in the picture of the micawber family with its tear and smile and general shiftlessness we have a suggestion of dickens 's own family life at eleven year of age the boy be take out of school and go to work in the cellar of a black factory at this time he be in he own word a queer small boy who suffer as he work and we can appreciate the boy and the suffer more when we find both reflect in the character of david copperfield it be a heart-rending picture this sensitive child work from dawn till dark for a few penny and associate with tough and waif in he brief interval of labor but we can see in it the source of that intimate knowledge of the heart of the poor and outcast which be soon to be reflect in literature and to startle all england by its appeal for sympathy a small legacy end this wretchedness bring the father from the prison and send the boy to wellington house academy -- a worthless and brutal school evidently whose head master be in dickens 's word a most ignorant fellow and a tyrant he learn little at this place be interested chiefly in story and in act out the heroic part which appeal to he imagination but again he personal experience be of immense value and result in he famous picture of dotheboy hall in _ nichola nickleby _ which help largely to mitigate the evil of private school in england wherever he go dickens be a marvelously keen observer with a active imagination which make story out of incident and character that ordinary man would have hardly notice moreover he be a bear actor and be at one time the lead spirit of a band of amateur who give entertainment for charity all over england these three thing he keen observation he active imagination and the actor 's spirit which animated he furnish a key to he life and writings when only fifteen year old he leave the school and again go to work this time as clerk in a lawyer 's office by night he study shorthand in order to fit himself to be a reporter -- this in imitation of he father who be now engage by a newspaper to report the speech in parliament everything that dicken attempt seem to have be do with vigor and intensity and within two year we find he report important speech and write out he note as the heavy coach lurch and roll through the mud of country road on its dark way to london town it be largely during this period that he gain he extraordinary knowledge of inn and stable and horsey person which be reflect in he novel he also grow ambitious and begin to write on he own account at the age of twenty-one he drop he first little sketch stealthily with fear and tremble into a dark letter-box in a dark office up a dark court in fleet street the name of this first sketch be mr minn and he cousin and it appear with other story in he first book _ sketch by boz _ in 1835 one who read these sketch now with they intimate knowledge of the hidden life of london can understand dickens 's first newspaper success perfectly he best know work _ pickwick _ be publish serially in 1836-1837 and dickens 's fame and fortune be make never before have a novel appear so full of vitality and merriment though crude in design a mere jumble of exaggerated character and incident it fairly bubble over with the kind of humor in which the british public delight and it still remain after three quarter of a century one of we most care-dispelling book the remainder of dickens 's life be largely a record of personal triumph _ pickwick _ be follow rapidly by _ oliver twist nichola nickleby old curiosity shop _ and by many other work which seem to indicate that there be no limit to the new author 's invention of odd grotesque uproarious and sentimental character in the interval of he novel write he attempt several time to edit a weekly paper but he power lay in other direction and with the exception of _ household word _ he journalistic venture be not a marked success again the actor come to the surface and after manage a company of amateur actor successfully dickens begin to give dramatic reading from he own work as he be already the most popular writer in the english language these reading be very successful crowd throng to hear he and he journey become a continuous ovation money pour into he pocket from he novel and from he reading and he buy for himself a home gadshill place which he have always desire and which be forever associate with he memory though he spend the greater part of he time and strength in travel at this period nothing be more characteristic of the man than the intense energy with which he turn from he lecture to he novel and then for relaxation give himself up to what he call the magic lantern of the london street in 1842 while still a young man dickens be invite to visit the united state and canada where he work be even better known than in england and where he be receive as the guest of the nation and treat with every mark of honor and appreciation at this time america be to most european a kind of huge fairyland where money spring out of the earth and life be happy as a long holiday dickens evidently share this rosy view and he romantic expectation be naturally disappoint the crude unfinished look of the big country seem to have rouse a strong prejudice in he mind which be not overcome at the time of he second visit twenty-five year later and which bring forth the harsh criticism of he _ american note _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- and of _ martin chuzzlewit _ -lrb- 1843-1844 -rrb- these two unkind book strike a false note and dickens begin to lose something of he great popularity in addition he have spend money beyond he income he domestic life which have be at first very happy become more and more irritating until he separate from he wife in 1858 to get inspiration which seem for a time to have fail he journey to italy but be disappointed then he turn back to the london street and in the five year from 1848 to 1853 appear _ dombey and son david copperfield _ and _ bleak house _ -- three remarkable novel which indicate that he have rediscover he own power and genius later he resume the public reading with they public triumph and applause which soon come to be a necessity to one who crave popularity as a hungry man crave bread these excitement exhaust dickens physically and spiritually and death be the inevitable result he die in 1870 over he unfinished _ edwin drood _ and be bury in westminster abbey dickens 's work in view of he life a glance through even this unsatisfactory biography give we certain illuminating suggestion in regard to all of dickens 's work first as a child poor and lonely longing for love and for society he lay the foundation for those heartrending picture of child which have move so many reader to unaccustomed tear second as clerk in a lawyer 's office and in the court he gain he knowledge of a entirely different side of human life here he learn to understand both the enemy and the victim of society between whom the harsh law of that day frequently make no distinction third as a reporter and afterwards as manager of various newspaper he learn the trick of racy writing and of know to a nicety what would suit the popular taste fourth as a actor always a actor in spirit he seize upon every dramatic possibility every tense situation every peculiarity of voice and gesture in the people whom he meet and reproduce these thing in he novel exaggerate they in the way that most pleased he audience when we turn from he outward training to he inner disposition we find two strongly marked element the first be he excessive imagination which make good story out of incident that ordinarily pass unnoticed and which describe the commonest thing -- a street a shop a fog a lamp-post a stagecoach -- with a wealth of detail and of romantic suggestion that make many of he description like lyric poem the second element be he extreme sensibility which find relief only in laughter and tear like shadow and sunshine these follow one another closely throughout all he book remember these two thing he training and disposition we can easily foresee the kind of novel he must produce he will be sentimental especially over child and outcast he will excuse the individual in view of the fault of society he will be dramatic or melodramatic and he sensibility will keep he always close to the public study its taste and play with its smile and tear if please the public be in itself a art then dickens be one of we greatest artist and it be well to remember that in please he public there be nothing of the hypocrite or demagogue in he make-up he be essentially a part of the great drift panoramic crowd that he love he sympathetic soul make all they joy and grief he own he fight against injustice he champion the weak against the strong he give courage to the faint and hope to the weary in heart and in the love which the public give he in return he find he best reward here be the secret of dickens 's unprecedented popular success and we may note here a very significant parallel with shakespeare the great different in the genius and work of the two man do not change the fact that each win success largely because he study and please he public general plan of dickens 's novel a interesting suggestion come to we from a study of the condition which lead to dickens 's first three novel _ pickwick _ be write at the suggestion of a editor for serial publication each chapter be to be accompany by a cartoon by seymor -lrb- a comic artist of the day -rrb- and the object be to amuse the public and incidentally to sell the paper the result be a series of character and scene and incident which for vigor and boundless fun have never be equal in we language thereafter no matter what he write dickin be lbele a humorist like a certain american writer of we own generation everything he say whether for a feast or a funeral be sppose to contain a laugh in a word he be the victim of he own book dickens be keen enough to understand he danger and he next novel _ oliver twist _ have the serious purpose of mitigate the evil under which the poor be suffer its hero be a poor child the unfortunate victim of society and in order to draw attention to the real need dickens exaggerate the woeful condition of the poor and fill he page with sentiment which easily slip over into sentimentality this also be a popular success and in he third novel _ nichola nickleby _ and indeed in most of he remain work dickens combine the principle of he first two book give we mirth on the one hand injustice and suffering on the other mingle humor and pathos tear and laughter as we find they in life itself and in order to increase the light and shadow in he scene and to give greater dramatic effect to he narrative he introduce odious and lothsome character and make vice more hateful by contrast it with innocence and virtue we find therefore in most of dickens 's novel three or four widely different type of character : first the innocent little child like oliver joe paul tiny tim and little nell appeal powerfully to the child love in every human heart scond the horrible or grotesque foil like sqeer fagin quilp uriah heep and bill syke third the grandiloquent or broadly humorous fellow the fun maker like micawber and sam weller and fourth a tenderly or powerfully draw figure like lady deadlock of _ bleak house _ and sydney carton of _ a tale of two city _ which rise to the dignity of true character we note also that most of dickens 's novel belong decidely to the class of purpose or problem novel thus _ bleak house _ attack the law 's delay _ little dorrit _ the injustice which persecute poor debtor _ nichola nickleby _ the abuse of charity school and brutal schoolmaster and _ oliver twist _ the unnecessary degradation and suffering of the poor in english workhouse dickens 's serious purpose be to make the novel the instrument of morality and justice and whatver we may think of the exaggeration of he character it be certain that he story do more to correct the general selfishness and injustice of society toward the poor than all the work of other literary man of he age combine the limitation of dickens any severe criticism of dickens as a novelist must seem at first glance unkind a unnecessary in almost every house he be a welcome guest a personal friend who have beguile many a hour with he story and who have furnish we much good laughter and a few good tear moreover he have always a cheery message he emphasize the fact that this be a excellant world that some error have creep into it due largely to thoughtlessness but that they can be easily remedy by a little human sympathy that be a most welcome creed to a age overburdened with social problem and to criticise we cheery companion seem as discourteous as to speak unkindly of a guest who have just leave we home but we must consider dickens not merely as a friend but as a novelist and apply to he work the same standard of art which we apply to other writer and when we do this we be sometimes a little disappointed we must confess that he novel while they contain many realistic detail seldom give the impression of reality he character though we laugh or weep or shudder at they be sometimes only caricature each one a exaggeration of some peculiarity which suggest ben jonson 's _ every man in he humor _ it be dickens 's art to give he hero sufficient reality to make they suggest certain type of man and woman whom we know but in read he we find ourselves often in the mental state of a man who be watch through a microscope the swarm life of a water drop here be lively bustling extraordinary creature some beautiful some grotesque but all far apart from the life that we know in daily experience it be certainly not the reality of these character but rather the genius of the author in manage they which interest we and hold we attention notwithstanding this criticism which we would gladly have omit dickens be excellent reading and he novel will continue to be popular just so long as man enjoy a wholesome and absorb story what to read aside from the reform in school and prison and workhouse which dickens accomplish he have lay we all rich and poor alike under a debt of gratitude after the year 1843 the one literary work which he never neglect be to furnish a christmas story for he reader and it be due in some measure to the help of these story brim over with good cheer that christma have become in all english-speaking country a season of gladness of gift give at home and of remember those less fortunate than ourselves who be still member of a common brotherhood if we read nothing else of dickens once a year at christmas time we should remember he and renew we youth by read one of he holiday story -- _ the cricket on the hearth the chime _ and above all the unrivaled _ christmas carol _ the latter especially will be read and love as long as man be move by the spirit of christmas of the novel _ david copperfield _ be regard by many as dickens 's masterpiece it be well to begin with this novel not simply for the unusual interest of the story but also for the glimpse it give we of the author 's own boyhood and family for pure fun and hilarity _ pickwick _ will always be a favorite but for artistic finish and for the portrayal of one great character sydney carton nothing else that dickens write be comparable to _ a tale of two city _ here be a absorb story with a carefully construct plot and the action move swiftly to its thrilling inevitable conclusion usually dicken introduce several pathetic or grotesque or laughable character besides the main actor and record various unnecessary dramatic episode for they own sake but in _ a tale of two city _ everything have its place in the development of the main story there be as usual many character -- sydney carton the outcast who lay down he life for the happiness of one whom he love charle darnay a exile young french noble dr manette who have be recall to life from a frightful imprisonment and he gentle daughter lucie the heroine jarvi lorry a lovable old-fashioned clerk in the big banking house the terrible madame defarge knit calmly at the door of she wine shop and recording with the ferocity of a tiger lick its chop the name of all those who be mark for vengeance and a dozen other each well draw who play minor part in the tragedy the scene be lay in london and paris at the time of the french revolution and though careless of historical detail dickens reproduce the spirit of the reign of terror so well that _ a tale of two city _ be a excellent supplement to the history of the period it be write in dickens 's usual picturesque style and reveal he usual imaginative outlook on life and he fondness for fine sentiment and dramatic episode indeed all he quality be here show not brilliantly or garishly as in other novel but subdue and soften like a shaded light for artistic effect those who be interested in dickens 's growth and method can hardly do better than to read in succession he first three novel _ pickwick oliver twist _ and _ nichola nickleby _ which as we have indicate show clearly how he pass from fun to serious purpose and which furnish in combination the general plan of all he later work for the rest we can only indicate those which in we personal judgment seem best worth reading -- _ bleak house dombey and son we mutual friend _ and _ old curiosity shop _ -- but we be not yet far enough away from the first popular success of these work to determine they permanent value and influence william makepeace thackeray -lrb- 1811-1863 -rrb- as the two most successful novelist of they day it be natural for we as it be for they personal friend and admirer to compare dickens and thackeray with respect to they life and work and they attitude toward the world in which they live dickens after a desperately hard struggle in he boyhood without friend or higher education come into manhood cheery self-confident energetic fill with the joy of he work and in the world which have at first treat he so harshly he find good everywhere even in the jail and in the slum simply because he be look for it thackeray after a boyhood spend in the best of english school with money friend and comfort of every kind face life timidly distrustfully and dislike the literary work which make he famous he have a gracious and lovable personality be kind of heart and revere all that be pure and good in life yet he be almost cynical toward the world which use he so well and find sham deception vanity everywhere because he look for they one find what one seek in this world but it be perhaps significant that dickens seek he golden fleece among plain people and thackeray in high society the chief difference between the two novelist however be not one of environment but of temperament put thackeray in a workhouse and he will still find material for another _ book of snob _ put dickens in society and he can not help find undreamed-of possibility among bewigged and bepowdered high lord and lady for dickens be romantic and emotional and interpret the world largely through he imagination thackeray be the realist and moralist who judge solely by observation and reflection he aim to give we a true picture of the society of he day and as he find it pervade by intrigue and snobbery he proceed to satirize it and point out its moral evil in he novel he be influence by swift and fielding but he be entirely free from the bitterness of the one and the coarseness of the other and he satire be generally soften by a noble tenderness take together the novel of dickens and thackeray give we a remarkable picture of all class of english society in the middle of the nineteenth century life thackeray be bear in 1811 in calcutta where he father hold a civil position under the indian government when the boy be five year old he father die and the mother return with she child to england presently she marry again and thackeray be send to the famous charterhouse school of which he have give we a vivid picture in _ the newcome _ such a school would have be a veritable heaven to dickens who at this time be toss about between poverty and ambition but thackeray detest it for its rude manners and occasionally refer to it as the slaughterhouse write to he mother he say : there be three hundred and seventy boy in the school i wish there be only three hundred and sixty-nine in 1829 thackeray enter trinity college cambridge but leave after less than two year without take a degree and go to germany and france where he study with the idea of become a artist when he become of age in 1832 he come into possession of a comfortable fortune return to england and settle down in the temple to study law soon he begin to dislike the profession intensely and we have in _ pendenni _ a reflection of he mental attitude toward the law and the young man who study it he soon lose he fortune partly by gamble and speculation partly by unsuccessful attempt at run a newspaper and at twenty-two begin for the first time to earn he own living as a artist and illustrator a interesting meeting between thackeray and dickens at this time -lrb- 1836 -rrb- suggest the relative importance of the two writer seymor who be illustrate the _ pickwick papers _ have just die and thackeray call upon dickens with a few drawing and ask to be allow to continue the illustration dickens be at this time at the beginning of he great popularity the better literary artist whose drawing be refuse be almost unknown and have to work hard for more than ten year before he receive recognition disappoint by he failure as a illustrator he begin he literary career by write satire on society for _ fraser 's magazine _ this be the beginning of he success but though the _ yellowplush papers the great hoggarty diamond catherine the fitz boodler the book of snob barry lyndon _ and various other immature work make he know to a few reader of _ punch _ and of _ fraser 's magazine _ it be not till the publication of _ vanity fair _ -lrb- 1847-1848 -rrb- that he begin to be recognize as one of the great novelist of he day all he earlier work be satire some upon society other upon the popular novelist -- bulwer disraelus and especially dickens -- with whose sentimental hero and heroine he have no patience whatever he have marry meanwhile in 1836 and for a few year be very happy in he home then disease and insanity fasten upon he young wife and she be place in a asylum the whole after life of we novelist be darken by this loss worse than death he become a man of the club rather than of he own home and though he wit and kindness make he the most welcome of clubman there be a undercurrent of sadness in all that he write long afterwards he say that though he marriage end in shipwreck he would do it over again for behold love be the crown and completion of all earthly good after the moderate success of _ vanity fair _ thackeray write the three novel of he middle life upon which he fame chiefly rest -- _ pendenni _ in 1850 _ henry esmond _ in 1852 and _ the newcome _ in 1855 dickens 's great popular success as a lecturer and dramatic reader have lead to a general desire on the part of the public to see and to hear literary man and thackeray to increase he income give two remarkable course of lecture the first be _ english humorist of the eighteenth century _ and the second _ the four george _ -- both course be deliver with gratifying success in england and especially in america dickens as we have see be disappoint in america and vent he displeasure in outrageous criticism but thackeray with he usual good breeding see only the best side of he generous entertainer and in both he public and private utterance emphasize the virtue of the new land whose restless energy seem to fascinate he unlike dickens he have no confidence in himself when he face a audience and like most literary man he dislike lecture and soon give it up in 1860 he become editor of the _ cornhill magazine _ which prosper in he hand and with a comfortable income he seem just ready to do he best work for the world -lrb- which have always believe that he be capable of even better thing than he ever write -rrb- when he die suddenly in 1863 he body lie bury in kensal green and only a bust do honor to he memory in westminster abbey work of thackeray the beginner will do well to omit the earlier satire of thackeray write while he be struggle to earn a living from the magazine and open _ henry esmond _ -lrb- 1852 -rrb- he most perfect novel though not the most widely known and read the fine historical and literary flavor of this story be one of its most marked characteristic and only one who know something of the history and literature of the eighteenth century can appreciate its value the hero colonel esmond relate he own story carry the reader through the court and camp of queen anne 's reign and give the most complete and accurate picture of a past age that have ever appear in a novel thackeray be as we have say a realist and he begin he story by adopt the style and manner of a scholarly gentleman of the period he be describe he have a extraordinary knowledge of eighteenth-century literature and he reproduce its style in detail go so far as to insert in he narrative a alleged essay from the _ tatler _ and so perfectly be it do that it be impossible to say wherein it differ from the style of addison and steele in he matter also thackeray be realistic reflect not the pride and pomp of war which be largely delusion but its brutality and barbarism which be all too real painting general and leader not as the newspaper hero to whom we be accustomed but as move by intrigue petty jealousy and selfish ambition show we the great duke of marlborough not as the military hero the idol of war-crazed multitude but as without personal honor and govern by despicable avarice in a word thackeray give we the back stair view of war which be as a rule totally neglect in we history when he deal with the literary man of the period he use the same frank realism show we steele and addison and other leader not with halo about they head as popular author but in slipper and dress gown smoke a pipe in they own room or else grow tipsy and hilarious in the tavern -- just as they appear in daily life both in style and in matter therefore _ esmond _ deserve to rank as probably the best historical novel in we language the plot of the story be like most of thackeray 's plot very slight but perfectly suit to the novelist 's purpose the plan of he character fail they ideal grow dim there be a general disappearance of youthful ambition there be a love story at the center but the element of romance which furnish the light and music and fragrance of love be inconspicuous the hero after ten year of devotion to a young woman a paragon of beauty finally marry she mother and end with a few pious observation concern heaven 's mercy and he own happy lot such a end seem disappointing almost bizarre in view of the romantic novel to which we be accustomed but we must remember that thackeray 's purpose be to paint life as he see it and that in life man and thing often take a different way from that describe in romance as we grow acquaint with thackeray 's character we realize that no other end be possible to he story and conclude that he plot like he style be perhaps as near perfection as a realistic novelist can ever come _ vanity fair _ -lrb- 1847 -- 1848 -rrb- be the best know of thackeray 's novel it be he first great work and be intend to express he own view of the social life about he and to protest against the overdrawn hero of popular novel he take for he subject that vanity fair to which christian and faithful be conduct on they way to the heavenly city as record in _ pilgrim 's progress _ in this fair there be many different booth give over to the sale of all sort of vanity and as we go from one to another we come in contact with juggling cheat game play fool ape knave rogue and that of every kind evidently this be a picture of one side of social life but the difference between bunyan and thackeray be simply this -- that bunyan make vanity fair a small incident in a long journey a place through which most of we pass on we way to better thing while thackeray describe high society in he own day make it a place of long sojourn wherein he character spend the greater part of they life thackeray style this work a novel without a hero the whole action of the story which be without plot or development revolve about two woman -- amelia a meek creature of the milk-and-water type and becky sharp a keen unprincipled intriguer who let nothing stand in the way of she selfish desire to get the most out of the fool who largely constitute society on the whole it be the most powerful but not the most wholesome of thackeray 's work in he second important novel _ pendenni _ -lrb- 1849-1850 -rrb- we have a continuation of the satire on society begin in _ vanity fair _ this novel which the beginner should read after _ esmond _ be interesting to we for two reason -- because it reflect more of the detail of thackeray 's life than all he other writings and because it contain one powerfully draw character who be a perpetual reminder of the danger of selfishness the hero be neither angel nor imp in thackeray 's word but the typical young man of society whom he know thoroughly and whom he paint exactly as he be -- a careless good-natured but essentially selfish person who go through life intent on he own interest _ pendenni _ be a profound moral study and the most powerful arraignment of well-meaning selfishness in we literature not even except george eliot 's _ romolum _ which it suggest two other novel _ the newcome _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- and _ the virginian _ -lrb- 1859 -rrb- complete the list of thackeray 's great work of fiction the former be a sequel to _ pendenni _ and the latter to _ henry esmond _ and both share the general fate of sequel in not be quite equal in power or interest to they predecessor _ the newcome _ however deserve a very high place -- some critic indeed place it at the head of the author 's work like all thackeray 's novel it be a story of human frailty but here the author 's innate gentleness and kindness be see at they best and the hero be perhaps the most genuine and lovable of all he character thackeray be know in english literature as a essayist as well as a novelist he _ english humorist _ and _ the four george _ be among the finest essay of the nineteenth century in the former especially thackeray show not only a wide knowledge but a extraordinary understanding of he subject apparently this nineteenth-century writer know addison fielding swift smollett and other great writer of the past century almost as intimately as one know he nearest friend and he give we the fine flavor of they humor in a way which no other writer save perhaps larnb have ever rival -lrb- 240 -rrb- _ the four george _ be in a vein of delicate satire and present a rather unflattering picture of four of england 's ruler and of the court in which they move both these work be remarkable for they exquisite style they gentle humor they keen literary criticism and for the intimate knowledge and sympathy which make the ' people of a past age live once more in the write page general characteristic in treat of thackeray 's view of life as reflect in he novel critic vary greatly and the follow summary must be take not as a positive judgment but only as a attempt to express the general impression of he work on a uncritical reader he be first of a realist who paint life as he see it as he say himself i have no brain above my eye i describe what i see he picture of certain type notably the weak and vicious element of society be accurate and true to life but they seem to play too large a part in he book and have perhaps too greatly influence he general judgment of humanity a excessive sensibility or the capacity for fine feeling and emotion be a marked characteristic of thackeray as it be of dickens and carlyle he be easily offend as they be by the sham of society but he can not find a outlet as dickens do in laughter and tear and he be too gentle to follow carlyle in violent denunciation and prophecy he turn to satire -- influence doubtless by eighteenth-century literature which he know so well and in which satire play too large a part -lrb- 241 -rrb- he satire be never personal like pope 's or brutal like swift 's and be temper by kindness and humor but it be use too freely and generally lay too much emphasis on fault and foible to be consider a true picture of any large class of english society besides be a realist and satirist thackeray be essentially a moralist like addison aim definitely in all he work at produce a moral impression so much do he revere goodness and so determine be he that he pendenni or he becky sharp shall be judge at they true value that he be not content like shakespeare to be simply a artist to tell a artistic tale and let it speak its own message he must explain and emphasize the moral significance of he work there be no need to consult we own conscience over the action of thackeray 's character the beauty of virtue and the ugliness of vice be evident on every page whatever we may think of thackeray 's matter there be one point in which critic be agree -- that he be master of a pure and simple english style whether he thought be sad or humorous commonplace or profound he express it perfectly without effort or affectation in all he work there be a subtle charm impossible to describe which give the impression that we be listen to a gentleman and it be the ease the refinement the exquisite naturalness of thackeray 's style that furnish a large part of we pleasure in read he mary ann evan george eliot -lrb- 1819-1880 -rrb- in nearly all the writer of the victorian age we note on the one hand a strong intellectual tendency to analyze the problem of life and on the other a tendency to teach that be to explain to man the method by which these problem may be solve the novel especially seem to lose sight of the purely artistic ideal of write and to aim definitely at moral instruction in george eliot both these tendency reach a climax she be more obviously more consciously a preacher and moralizer than any of she great contemporary though profoundly religious at heart she be largely occupy by the scientific spirit of the age and finding no religious creed or political system satisfactory she fall back upon duty as the supreme law of life all she novel aim first to show in individual the play of universal moral force and second to establish the moral law as the basis of human society aside from this moral teaching we look to george eliot for the reflection of country life in england just as we look to dickens for picture of the city street and to thackeray for the vanity of society of all the woman writer 's who have help and be still help to place we english novel at the head of the world 's fiction she hold at present unquestionably the highest rank life mary ann -lrb- or marian -rrb- evan know to we by she pen name of george eliot begin to write late in life when nearly forty year of age and attain the lead position among live english novelist in the ten year between 1870 and 1880 after thackeray and dickens have pass away she be bear at arbury farm warwickshire some twenty mile from stratford-on-avon in 1819 she parent be plain honest folk of the farmer class who bring she up in the somewhat strict religious manner of those day she father seem to have be a man of sterling integrity and of practical english sense -- one of those essentially noble character who do the world 's work silently and well and who by they solid worth obtain a position of influence among they fellow-man a few month after george eliot 's birth the family move to another home in the parish of griff where she childhood be largely pass the scenery of the midland county and many detail of she own family life be reflect in she earlier novel thus we find she and she brother as maggie and tom tulliver in _ the mill on the floss _ she aunt as dinah morri and she mother as mr poyser in _ adam bede _ we have a suggestion of she father in the hero of the latter novel but the picture be more fully draw as caleb garth in _ middlemarch _ for a few year she study at two private school for young lady at nuneaton and coventry but the death of she mother call she at seventeen year of age to take entire charge of the household thereafter she education be gain wholly by miscellaneous reading we have a suggestion of she method in one of she early letter in which she say : my mind present a assemblage of disjointed specimen of history ancient and modern scrap of poetry pick up from shakespeare cowper wordsworth and milton newspaper topic morsel of addison and bacon latin verb geometry entomology and chemistry review and metaphysics all arrest and petrified and smother by the fast-thickening everyday accession of actual event relative anxiety and household care and vexation when mary be twenty-one year old the family again move this time to foleshill road near coventry here she become acquaint with the family of charle bray a prosperous ribbon manufacturer whose house be a gathering place for the freethinker of the neighborhood the effect of this liberal atmosphere upon miss evan bring up in a narrow way with no knowledge of the world be to unsettle many of she youthful conviction from a narrow intense dogmatism she go to the other extreme of radicalism then -lrb- about 1860 -rrb- she lose all sympathy with the freethinker and be instinctively religious seem to be grope after a definite faith while follow the ideal of duty this spiritual struggle which suggest that of carlyle be undoubtedly the cause of that gloom and depression which hang like a english fog over much of she work though she biographer cross tell we that she be not by any mean a sad or gloomy woman in 1849 miss evan 's father die and the bray take she abroad for a tour of the continent on she return to england she write several liberal article for the _ westminster review _ and presently be make assistant editor of that magazine she residence in london at this time mark a turn point in she career and the real beginning of she literary life she make strong friendship with spencer mill and other scientist of the day and through spencer meet george henry lewe a miscellaneous writer whom she afterwards marry under he sympathetic influence she begin to write fiction for the magazine she first story be amo barton -lrb- 1857 -rrb- which be later include in the _ scene of clerical life _ -lrb- 1858 -rrb- she first long novel _ adam bede _ appear early in 1859 and meet with such popular favor that to the end of she life she despair of ever again repeat she triumph but the unexpected success prove to be a inspiration and she complete _ the mill on the floss _ and begin _ silas marner _ during the following year not until the great success of these work lead to a insistent demand to know the author do the english public learn that it be a woman and not a english clergyman as they suppose who have suddenly jump to the front rank of live writer up to this point george eliot have confine herself to english country life but now she suddenly abandon the scene and the people with whom she be most familiar in order to write a historical novel it be in 1860 while travel in italy that she form the great project of _ romolum _ -- a mingling of fiction and moral philosophy against the background of the mighty renaissance movement in this she be write of thing of which she have no personal knowledge and the book cost she many month of hard and depressing labor she say herself that she be a young woman when she begin the work and a old woman when she finish it _ romolum _ -lrb- 1862 -- 1863 -rrb- be not successful with the public and the same may be say of _ felix holt the radical _ -lrb- 1866 -rrb- and _ the spanish gypsy _ -lrb- 1868 -rrb- the last-named work be the result of the author 's ambition to write a dramatic poem which should duplicate the lesson of _ romolum _ and for the purpose of gathering material she visit spain which she have decide upon as the scene of she poetical effort with the publication of _ middlemarch _ -lrb- 1871-1872 -rrb- george eliot come back again into popular favor though this work be less spontaneous and more labored and pedantic than she earlier novel the fault of too much analysis and moralizing be even more conspicuous in _ daniei deronda _ -lrb- 1876 -rrb- which she regard as she greatest book she life during all this time be singularly uneventful and the chief milestone along the road mark the publication of she successive novel during all the year of she literary success she husband lewe have be a most sympathetic friend and critic and when he die in 1878 the loss seem to be more than she could bear she letter of this period be touch in they loneliness and they craving for sympathy later she astonish everybody by marry john walter cross much younger than herself who be know as she biographer deep down below there be a river of sadness but i be able to enjoy my newly re-opened life write this woman of sixty who ever since she be the girl whom we know as maggie tulliver must always have some one to love and to depend upon she new interest in life last but a few month for she die in December of the same year -lrb- 1880 -rrb- one of the best indication of she strength and she limitation be she portrait with its strong masculine feature suggest both by resemblance and by contrast that wonderful portrait of savonarolum which hang over he old desk in the monastery at florence work of george eliot these be conveniently divide into three group correspond to the three period of she life the first group include all she early essay and miscellaneous work from she translation of strauss 's _ leben jesu _ in 1846 to she union with lewe in 1854 the second group include _ scene of clerical life adam bede mill on the floss _ and _ sila marner _ all publish between 1858 and 1861 these four novel of the middle period be found on the author 's own life and experience they scene be lay in the country and they character be take from the stolid people of the midland with whom george eliot have be familiar since childhood they be probably the author 's most enduring work they have a naturalness a spontaneity at time a flash of real humor which be lack in she later novel and they show a rapid development of literary power which reach a climax in _ sila marner _ the novel of italian life _ romolum _ -lrb- 1862-1863 -rrb- mark a transition to the third group which include three more novel -- _ felix holt _ -lrb- 1866 -rrb- _ middlemarch _ -lrb- 1871-1872 -rrb- _ daniel deronda _ -lrb- 1876 -rrb- the ambitious dramatic poem _ the spanish gypsy _ -lrb- 1868 -rrb- and a collection of miscellaneous essay call _ the impression of theophrastus such _ -lrb- 1879 -rrb- the general impression of these work be not so favorable as that produce by the novel of the middle period they be more labored and less interesting they contain much deep reflection and analysis of character but less observation less delight in picture country life as it be and very little of what we call inspiration we must add however that this do not express a unanimous literary judgment for critic be not want who assert that _ daniel deronda _ be the highest expression of the author 's genius the general character of all these novel may be describe in the author 's own term as psychologic realism this mean that george eliot seek to do in she novel what browning attempt in he poetry that be to represent the inner struggle of a soul and to reveal the motive impulse and hereditary influence which govern human action brown generally stop when he tell he story and either let you draw you own conclusion or else give you he in a few striking line but george eliot be not content until she have minutely explain the motive of she character and the moral lesson to be learn from they moreover it be the development of a soul the slow growth or decline of moral power which chiefly interest she she hero and heroine differ radically from those of dickens and thackeray in this respect -- that when we meet the man and woman of the latter novelist they character be already form and we be reasonably sure what they will do under give circumstance in george eliot 's novel the character develop gradually as we come to know they they go from weakness to strength or from strength to weakness accord to the work that they do and the thought that they cherish in _ romolum _ for instance tito as we first meet he may be either good or bad and we know not whether he will finally turn to the right hand or to the leave as time pass we see he degenerate steadily because he follow he selfish impulse while romolum whose character be at first only faintly indicate grow into beauty and strength with every act of self-renunciation in these two character tito and romolum we have a epitome of we author 's moral teaching the principle of law be in the air during the victorian era and we have already note how deeply tennyson be influence by it with george eliot law be like fate it overwhelm personal freedom and inclination moral law be to she as inevitable as automatic as gravitation tito 's degeneration and the sad failure of dorothea and lydgate in _ middlemarch _ may be explain as simply as the fall of a apple or as a bruise knee when a man lose he balance a certain act produce a definite moral effect on the individual and character be the add sum of all the act of a man 's life -- just as the weight of a body be the sum of the weight of many different atom which constitute it the matter of reward and punishment therefore need no final judge or judgment since these thing take care of themselves automatically in a world of inviolable moral law perhaps one thing more should be add to the general characteristic of george eliot 's novel -- they be all rather depress the gladsomeness of life the sunshine of smile and laughter be deny she it be say that once when she husband remark that she novel be all essentially sad she weep and answer that she must describe life as she have find it what to read george eliot 's first story be in some respects she best though she literary power increase during she second period culminate in _ sila marner _ and she psychological analysis be more evident in _ daniel deronda _ on the whole it be a excellent way to begin with the freshness and inspiration of the _ scene of clerical life _ and read she book in the order in which they be write in the first group of novel _ adam bede _ be the most natural and probably interest more reader than all the other combine _ the mill on the floss _ have a larger personal interest because it reflect much of george eliot 's history and the scene and the friend of she early life the lack of proportion in this story which give rather too much space to the girl-and-boy experience be naturally explain by the tendency in every man and woman to linger over early memory _ sila marner _ be artistically the most perfect of george eliot 's novel and we venture to analyze it as typical of she ideal and method we note first the style which be heavy and a little self-conscious lack the vigor and picturesqueness of dickens and the grace and naturalness of thackeray the character be the common people of the midland the hero be a linen weaver a lonely outcast who hoard and gloat over he hard-earned money be rob throw into utter despair and bring back to life and happiness by the come of a abandon child to he fire in the development of she story the author show herself first a realist by the naturalness of she character and the minute accuracy with which she reproduce they way and even the accent of they speech second a psychologist by the continual analysis and explanation of motive third a moralist by show in each individual the action and reaction of universal moral force and especially by make every evil act bring inevitable punishment to the man who do it tragedy therefore play a large part in the story for accord to george eliot tragedy and suffer walk close behind we or lurk at every turn in the road of life like all she novel _ sila marner _ be depress we turn away from even the wedding of eppie -- which be just as it should be -- with a sense of sadness and incompleteness finally as we close the book we be conscious of a powerful and enduring impression of reality sila the poor weaver godfrey cass the well-meaning selfish man mr macey the garrulous and observant parish clerk dolly winthrop the kind-hearted countrywoman who can not understand the mystery of religion and so interpret god in term of human love -- these be real people whom have once meet we can never forget _ romolum _ have the same general moral theme as the english novel but the scene be entirely different and opinion be divide as to the comparative merit of the work it be a study a very profound study of moral development in one character and of moral degeneracy in another its character and its scene be both italian and the action take place during a critical period of the renaissance movement when savonarolum be at the height of he power in florence here be a magnificent theme and a superb background for a great novel and george eliot read and study till she feel sure that she understand the place the time and the people of she story _ romolum _ be therefore interesting reading in many respects the most interesting of she work it have be call one of we greatest historical novel but as such it have one grievous fault it be not quite true to the people or even to the locality which it endeavor to represent one who read it here in a new and different land think only of the story and of the novelist 's power but one who read it on the spot which it describe and amidst the life which it picture be continually haunt by the suggestion that george eliot understand neither italy nor the italian it be this lack of harmony with italian life itself which cause morri and rossettus and even brown with all he admiration for the author to lay aside the book unable to read it with pleasure or profit in a word _ romolum _ be a great moral study and a very interesting book but the character be not italian and the novel as a whole lack the strong reality which mark george eliot 's english study minor novelist of the victorian age in the three great novelist just consider we have a epitome of the fiction of the age dickens use the novel to solve social problem thackeray to paint the life of society as he see it and george eliot to teach the fundamental principle of morality the influence of these three writer be reflect in all the minor novelist of the victorian age thus dickens be reflect in charle reade thackeray in anthony trollope and the brontë sister and george eliot 's psychology find artistic expression in george meredith to these social and moral and realistic study we should add the element of romance from which few of we modern novelist 's can long escape the nineteenth century which begin with the romanticism of walter scott return to its first love like a man glad to be home in its delight over blackmore 's _ lorna doone _ and the romance of robert loui stevenson charle reade in he fondness for stage effect for picture the romantic side of common life and for use the novel as the instrument of social reform there be a strong suggestion of dickens in the work of charle reade -lrb- 1814-1884 -rrb- thus he _ peg woffington _ be a study of stage life from behind the scene _ a terrible temptation _ be a study of social reform and reformer and _ put yourself in he place _ be the picture of a workingman who struggle against the injustice of the trade union he masterpiece _ the cloister and the hearth _ -lrb- 1861 -rrb- one of we best historical novel be a somewhat laborious study of student and vagabond life in europe in the day of the german renaissance it have small resemblance to george eliot 's _ romolum _ whose scene be lay in italy during the same period but the two work may well be read in succession as the effort of two very different novelist of the same period to restore the life of a age long past anthony trollope in he realism and especially in he conception of the novel as the entertainment of a idle hour trollope -lrb- 1815-1882 -rrb- be a reflection of thackeray it would be hard to find a better duplicate of becky sharp the heroine of _ vanity fair _ for instance than be find in lizzie eustace the heroine of _ the eustace diamond _ trollope be the most industrious and systematic of modern novelist write a definite amount each day and the wide range of he character suggest the _ human comedy _ of balzac he masterpiece be _ barchester tower _ -lrb- 1857 -rrb- this be a study of life in a cathedral town and be remarkable for its minute picture of bishop and clergyman with they family and dependent it would be well to read this novel in connection with _ the warden _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- _ the last chronicle of barset _ -lrb- 1867 -rrb- and other novel of the same series since the scene and character be the same in all these book and they be undoubtedly the best expression of the author 's genius hawthorne say of he novel : they precisely suit my taste -- solid and substantial and just as real as if some giant have hew a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case with all the inhabitant go about they daily business and not suspect that they be be make a show of charlotte brontë we have another suggestion of thackeray in the work of charlotte brontë -lrb- 1816-1855 -rrb- she aim to make she novel a realistic picture of society but she add to thackeray 's realism the element of passionate and somewhat unbalanced romanticism the latter element be partly the expression of miss brontë 's own nature and partly the result of she lonely and grief-stricken life which be darken by a succession of family tragedy it will help we to understand she work if we remember that both charlotte brontë and she sister emily -lrb- 242 -rrb- turn to literature because they find they work as governess and teacher unendurable and seek to relieve the loneliness and sadness of they own lot by create a new world of the imagination in this new world however the sadness of the old remains and all the brontë novel have behind they a ache heart charlotte brontë 's best know work be _ jane eyre _ -lrb- 1847 -rrb- which with all its fault be a powerful and fascinating study of elemental love and hate remind we vaguely of one of marlowe 's tragedy this work win instant favor with the public and the author be place in the front rank of live novelist aside from its value as a novel it be interesting in many of its early passage as the reflection of the author 's own life and experience _ shirley _ -lrb- 1849 -rrb- and _ villette _ -lrb- 1853 -rrb- make up the trio of novel by which this gifted woman be generally remembered bulwer lytton edward bulwer lytton -lrb- 1803-1873 -rrb- be a extremely versatile writer who try almost every kind of novel know to the nineteenth century in he early life he write poem and drama under the influence of byron but he first notable work _ pelham _ -lrb- 1828 -rrb- one of the best of he novel be a kind of burlesque on the byronic type of gentleman as a study of contemporary manners in high society _ pelham _ have a suggestion of thackeray and the resemblance be more noticeable in other novel of the same type such as _ ernest maltraver _ -lrb- 1837 -rrb- _ the caxton _ -lrb- 1848-1849 -rrb- _ my novel _ -lrb- 1853 -rrb- and _ kenelm chillingly _ -lrb- 1873 -rrb- we have a suggestion of dickens in at least two of lytton 's novel _ paul clifford _ and _ eugene aram _ the hero of which be criminal picture as the victim rather than as the oppressor of society lytton essay also with considerable popular success the romantic novel in _ the pilgrim of the rhine _ and _ zanonus _ and try the ghost story in _ the haunt and the haunter _ he fame at the present day rest largely upon he historical novel in imitation of walter scott _ the last day of pompeius _ -lrb- 1834 -rrb- _ riettza _ -lrb- 1835 -rrb- and _ harold _ -lrb- 1848 -rrb- the last be he most ambitious attempt to make the novel the supplement of history in all he novel lytton be incline to sentimentalism and sensationalism and he work though generally interesting seem hardly worthy of a high place in the history of fiction kingsley entirely different in spirit be the novel of the scholarly clergyman charle kingsley -lrb- 1819-1875 -rrb- he work naturally divide themselves into three class in the first be he social study and problem novel such as _ alton locke _ -lrb- 1850 -rrb- have for its hero a london tailor and poet and _ yeast _ -lrb- 1848 -rrb- which deal with the problem of the agricultural laborer in the second class be he historical novel _ hereward the wake hypatium _ and _ westward ho hypatium _ be a dramatic story of christianity in contact with paganism have its scene lay in alexandrium at the beginning of the fifth century _ westward ho _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- he best know work be a stir tale of english conquest by land and sea in the day of elizabeth in the third class be he various miscellaneous work not the least of which be _ water-baby _ a fascinating story of a chimney sweep which mother read to they child at bedtime -- to the great delight of the round-eyed little listener under the counterpane mr gaskell mr elizabeth gaskell -lrb- 1810-1865 -rrb- begin like kingsley with the idea of make the novel the instrument of social reform as the wife of a clergyman in manchester she have come in close contact with the struggle and ideal of the industrial poor of a great city and she reflect she sympathy as well as she observation in _ mary barton _ -lrb- 1848 -rrb- and in _ north and south _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- between these two problem novel she publish she masterpiece _ cranford _ in 1853 the original of this country village which be give over to spinster be undoubtedly knutsford in cheshire where mr gaskell have spend she childhood the sympathy the keen observation and the gentle humor with which the small affair of a country village be describe make _ cranford _ one of the most delightful story in the english language we be indebted to mr gaskell also for the _ life of charlotte brontë _ which be one of we best biography blackmore richard doddridge blackrhore -lrb- 1825 -- 1900 -rrb- be a prolific writer but he owe he fame almost entirely to one splendid novel _ lorna doone _ which be publish in 1869 the scene of this fascinating romance be lay in exmoor in the seventeenth century the story abound in romantic scene and incident its description of natural scenery be unsurpassed the rhythmic language be at time almost equal to poetry and the whole tone of the book be wholesome and refreshing altogether it would be hard to find a more delightful romance in any language and it well deserve the place it have win as one of the classic of we literature other work of blackmore which will repay the reader be _ clara vaughan _ -lrb- 1864 -rrb- he first novel _ the maid of sker _ -lrb- 1872 -rrb- _ springhaven _ -lrb- 1887 -rrb- _ perlycross _ -lrb- 1894 -rrb- and _ tale from the tell house _ -lrb- 1896 -rrb- but none of these though he count they he best work have meet with the same favor as _ lorna doone _ meredith so much do george meredith -lrb- 1828-1909 -rrb- belong to we own day that it be difficult to think of he as one of the victorian novelist he first notable work _ the ordeal of richard feverel _ be publish in 1859 the same year as george eliot 's _ adam bede _ but it be not till the publication of _ diana of the crossway _ in 1885 that he power as a novelist be widely recognize he resemble brown not only in he condensed style pack with thought but also in this respect -- that he labor for year in obscurity and after much of he best work be publish and apparently forget he slowly win the lead place in english fiction we be still too near he to speak of the permanence of he work but a casual reading of any of he novel suggest a comparison and a contrast with george eliot like she he be a realist and a psychologist but while george eliot use tragedy to teach a moral lesson meredith depend more upon comedy make vice not terrible but ridiculous for the hero or heroine of she novel george eliot invariably take a individual and show in each one the play of universal moral force meredith construct a type-man as a hero and make this type express he purpose and meaning so he character seldom speak naturally as george eliot 's do they be more like browning 's character in pack a whole paragraph into a single sentence or a exclamation on account of he enigmatic style and he psychology meredith will never be popular but by thoughtful man and woman he will probably be rank among we greatest writer of fiction the simplest and easiest of he novel for a beginner be _ the adventure of henry richmond _ -lrb- 1871 -rrb- among the best of he work besides the two mention above be _ beauchamp 's career _ -lrb- 1876 -rrb- and _ the egoist _ -lrb- 1879 -rrb- the latter be in we personal judgment one of the strongest and most convincing novel of the victorian age hardy thoma hardy -lrb- 1840 - -rrb- seem like meredith to belong to the present rather than to a past age and a interesting comparison may be draw between these two novelist in style meredith be obscure and difficult while hardy be direct and simple aim at realism in all thing meredith make man the most important phenomenon in the universe and the struggle of man be brighten by the hope of victory hardy make man a insignificant part of the world struggle against power greater than himself -- sometimes against system which he can not reach or influence sometimes against a kind of grim world-spirit who delight in make human affair go wrong he be therefore hardly a realist but rather a man blind by pessimism and he novel though generally powerful and sometimes fascinating be not pleasant or wholesome reading from the reader 's view point some of he earlier work like the idyllic love story _ under the greenwood tree _ -lrb- 1872 -rrb- and _ a pair of blue eye _ -lrb- 1873 -rrb- be the most interesting hardy become note however when he publish _ far from the madding crowd _ a book which when it appear anonymously in the _ cornhill magazine _ -lrb- 1874 -rrb- be generally attribute to george eliot for the simple reason that no other novelist be suppose to be capable of write it _ the return of the native _ -lrb- 1878 -rrb- and _ the woodlander _ be generally regard as hardy 's masterpiece but two novel of we own day _ tess of the d'uberville _ -lrb- 1891 -rrb- and _ jude the obscure _ -lrb- 1895 -rrb- be better expression of hardy 's literary art and of he gloomy philosophy stevenson in please contrast with hardy be robert loui stevenson -lrb- 1850-1894 -rrb- a brave cheery wholesome spirit who have make we all braver and cheerier by what he have write aside from they intrinsic value stevenson 's novel be interesting in this respect -- that they mark a return to the pure romanticism of walter scott the novel of the nineteenth century have as we have show a very definite purpose it aim not only to represent life but to correct it and to offer a solution to press moral and social problem at the end of the century hardy 's gloom in the face of modern social condition become oppressive and stevenson break away from it into that land of delightful romance in which youth find a answer to all its question problem differ but youth be ever the same and therefore stevenson will probably be regard by future generation as one of we most enduring writer to he life with its heroically happy struggle first against poverty then against physical illness it be impossible to do justice in a short article even a longer biography be inadequate for stevenson 's spirit not the incident of he life be the important thing and the spirit have no biographer though he have write much better work earlier he first gain fame by he _ treasure island _ -lrb- 1883 -rrb- a absorb story of pirate and of a hunt for bury gold _ dr jekyll and mr hyde _ -lrb- 1886 -rrb- be a profound ethical parable in which however stevenson leave the psychology and the minute analysis of character to he reader and make the story the chief thing in he novel _ kidnap _ -lrb- 1886 -rrb- _ the master of ballantrae _ -lrb- 1889 -rrb- and _ david balfor _ -lrb- 1893 -rrb- be novel of adventure give we vivid picture of scotch life two romance leave unfinished by he early death in samoa be _ the weir of hermiston _ and _ st ive _ the latter be finish by quiller-couch in 1897 the former be happily just as stevenson leave it and though unfinished be generally regard as he masterpiece in addition to these novel stevenson write a large number of essay the best of which be collect in _ virginibus puerisque familiar study of man and book _ and _ memory and portrait _ delightful sketch of he travels be find in _ a inland voyage _ -lrb- 1878 -rrb- _ travel with a donkey _ -lrb- 1879 -rrb- _ across the plain _ -lrb- 1892 -rrb- and _ the amateur emigrant _ -lrb- 1894 -rrb- _ underwood _ -lrb- 1887 -rrb- be a exquisite little volume of poetry and _ a child 's garden of verse _ be one of the book that mother will always keep to read to they child in all he book stevenson give the impression of a man at play rather than at work and the reader soon share in the happy spirit of the author because of he beautiful personality and because of the love and admiration he awaken for himself in multitude of reader we be naturally incline to exaggerate he importance as a writer however that may be a study of he work show he to be a consummate literary artist he style be always simple often perfect and both in he manner and in he matter he exercise a profound influence on the writer of the present generation iii essayist of the victorian age thoma babington macaulay -lrb- 1800-1859 -rrb- macaulay be one of the most typical figure of the nineteenth century though not a great writer if we compare he with browning or thackeray he be more closely associate than any of he literary contemporary with the social and political struggle of the age while carlyle be proclaim the gospel of labor and dickens write novel to better the condition of the poor macaulay go vigorously to work on what he think to be the most important task of the hour and by he brilliant speech do perhaps more than any other single man to force the passage of the famous reform bill like many of the elizabethan he be a practical man of affair rather than a literary man and though we miss in he writings the imagination and the spiritual insight which stamp the literary genius we have the impression always of a keen practical honest mind which look at present problem in the light of past experience moreover the man himself with he marvelous mind he happy spirit and he absolute integrity of character be a inspiration to better live life macaulay be bear at rothley temple leicestershire in 1800 he father of scotch descent be at one time governor of the sierra leone colony for liberated negro and devote a large part of he life to the abolition of the slave trade he mother of quaker parentage be a brilliant sensitive woman whose character be reflect in that of she son the influence of these two and the son 's loyal devotion to he family can best be read in trevelyan 's interesting biography as a child macaulay be strongly suggestive of coleridge at three year of age he begin to read eagerly at five he talk like a book at ten he have write a compendium of universal history besides various hymn verse romance argument for christianity and one ambitious epic poem the habit of rapid reading begin in childhood continue throughout he life and the number and varus ety of book which he read be almost incredible he memory be phenomenal he could repeat long poem and essay after a single reading he could quote not only passage but the greater part of many book include _ pilgrim 's progress paradise lose _ and various novel like _ clarissa _ once to test he memory he recite two newspaper poem which he have read in a coffeehouse forty year before and which he have never think of in the interval at twelve year of age this remarkable boy be send to a private school at little shelford and at eighteen he eqger trinity college cambridge here he make a reputation as a classical scholar and a brilliant talker but make a failure of he mathematics in a letter to he mother he write : oh for word to express my abomination of that science discipline of the mind say rather starvation confinement torture annihilation we quote this as a commentary on macaulay 's later writings which be frequently lack in the exactness and the logical sequence of the science which he detest after he college course macaulay study law be admit to the bar devoted himself largely to politics enter parliament in 1830 and almost immediately win a reputation as the best debater and the most eloquent speaker of the liberal or whig party gladstone say of he : whenever he arise to speak it be a summons like a trumpet call to fill the bench at the time of he election he be poor and the loss of he father 's property throw upon he the support of he brother and sister but he take up the burden with cheerful courage and by he own effort soon place himself and he family in comfort he political progress be rapid and be due not to favoritism or intrigue but to he ability he hard work and he sterling character he be several time elect to parliament be legal adviser to the supreme council of indium be a member of the cabinet and decline many office for which other man labor a lifetime in 1857 he great ability and service to he country be recognize by he be raise to the peerage with the title of baron macaulay of rothley macaulay 's literary work begin in college with the contribution of various ballad and essay to the magazine in he later life practical affair claim the greater part of he time and he brilliant essay be write in the early morning or late at night he famous _ essay on milton _ appear in the _ edinburgh review _ in 1825 it create a sensation and macaulay have gain the ear of the public never once lose it during the twenty year in which he be a contributor to the magazine he _ lay of ancient rome _ appear in 1842 and in the following year three volume of he collect _ essay _ in 1847 he lose he seat in parliament temporarily through he zealous effort in behalf of religious toleration and the loss be most fortunate since it give he opportunity to begin he _ history of england _ -- a monumental work which he have be plan for many year the first two volume appear in 1848 and they success can be compare only to that of the most popular novel the third and fourth volume of the _ history _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- be even more successful and macaulay be hard at work on the remain volume when he die quite suddenly in 1859 he be bury near addison in the poet ' corner of westminster abbey a paragraph from one of he letter write at the height of he fame and influence may give we a insight into he life and work : i can truly say that i have not for many year be so happy as i be at present i be free i be independent i be in parliament as honorably seat as man can be my family be comfortably off i have leisure for literature yet i be not reduce to the necessity of write for money if i have to choose a lot from all that there be in human life i be not sure that i should prefer any to that which have fall to I i be sincerely and thoroughly contented work of macaulay macaulay be famous in literature for he essay for he martial ballad and for he _ history of england _ he first important work the _ essay on milton _ -lrb- 1825 -rrb- be worthy of study not only for itself as a critical estimate of the puritan poet but as a key to all macaulay 's writings here first of all be a interesting work which however much we differ from the author 's opinion hold we attention and generally make we regret that the end come so soon the second thing to note be the historical flavor of the essay we study not only milton but also the time in which he live and the great movement of which he be a part history and literature properly belong together and macaulay be one of the first writer to explain the historical condition which partly account for a writer 's work and influence the third thing to note be macaulay 's enthusiasm for he subject -- a enthusiasm which be often partisan but which we gladly share for the moment as we follow the breathless narrative macaulay generally make a hero of he man show he battle against odds and the heroic side of we own nature awaken and respond to the author 's plea the fourth and perhaps most characteristic thing in the essay be the style which be remarkably clear forceful and convincing jeffrey the editor of the _ edinburgh review _ write enthusiastically when he receive the manuscript the more i think the less i can conceive where you pick up that style we still share in the editor 's wonder but the more we think the less we conceive that such a style could be pick up it be partly the result of a well-stored mind partly of unconscious imitation of other writer and partly of that natural talent for clear speaking and write which be manifest in all macaulay 's work in the remain essay we find the same general quality which characterize macaulay 's first attempt they cover a wide range of subject but they may be divide into two general class the literary or critical and the historical of the literary essay the best be those on milton addison goldsmith byron dryden leigh hunt bunyan bacon and johnson among the best know of the historical essay be those on lord clive chatham warren hasting hallam 's constitutional history von ranke 's history of the papacy frederick the great horace walpole william pitt sir william temple machiavellus and mirabeau most of these be produce in the vigor of young manhood between 1825 and 1845 while the writer be busy with practical affair of state they be often one-sided and inaccurate but always interesting and from they a large number of busy people have derive they first knowledge of history and literature the best of macaulay 's poetical work be find in the _ lay of ancient rome _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- a collection of ballad in the style of scott which sing of the old heroic day of the rome roman republic the ballad do not require much thought or emotion it demand clearness vigor enthusiasm action and it suit macaulay 's genius perfectly he be however much more careful than other ballad writer in make he narrative true to tradition the stir martial spirit of these ballad they fine workmanship and they appeal to courage and patriotism make they instantly popular even to-day after more than fifty year such ballad as those on virginius and horatius at the bridge be favorite piece in many school reader the _ history of england _ macaulay 's masterpiece be still one of the most popular historical work in the english language originally it be intend to cover the period from the accession of jame ii in 1685 to the death of george iv in 1830 only five volume of the work be finish and so thoroughly do macaulay go into detail that these five volume cover only sixteen year it have be estimate that to complete the work on the same scale would require some fifty volume and the labor of one man for over a century in he historical method macaulay suggest gibbon he own knowledge of history be very great but before write he read numberless page consult original document and visit the scene which he intend to describe thackeray 's remark that macaulay read twenty book to write a sentence and travel one hundred mile to make a line of description be in view of he industry a well-warranted exaggeration as in he literary essay he be fond of make hero and he throw himself so heartily into the spirit of the scene he be describe that he word picture almost startle we by they vivid reality the story of monmouth 's rebellion for instance or the trial of the seven bishop be as fascinating as the best chapter of scott 's historical novel while macaulay 's search for original source of information suggest the scientific historian he use of he material be much more like that of a novelist or playwright in he essay on machiavellus he write : the best portrait be perhaps those in which there be a slight mixture of caricature and we be not certain that the best history be not those in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative be judiciously employ something be lose in accuracy but much be gain in effect -lrb- 243 -rrb- whether this estimate of historical write be true or false macaulay employ it in he own work and make he narrative as absorb as a novel to all he character he give the reality of flesh and blood and in he own word he show we over they house and seat we at they table all that be excellent but it have its disadvantage in he admiration for heroism macaulay make some of he character too good and other too bad in he zeal for detail he miss the importance of great movement and of great leader who be accustom to ignore detail and in he joy of describe event he often lose sight of underlie cause in a word he be without historical insight and he work though fascinating be seldom place among the reliable history of england general characteristic to the reader who study macaulay 's brilliant essay and a few choose chapter of he _ history _ three thing soon become manifest first macaulay 's art be that of a public speaker rather than that of a literary man he have a wonderful command of language and he make he meaning clear by striking phrase vigorous antithesis anecdote and illustration he style be so clear that he who run may read and from begin to end he never lose the attention of he reader second macaulay 's good spirit and enthusiasm be contagious as he say himself he write out of a full head chiefly for he own pleasure or recreation and one who write joyously generally awaken a sense of pleasure in he reader third macaulay have the defect of he quality he read and remember so much that he have no time to think or to form settle opinion as gladstone say macaulay be always converse or recollect or read or compose but reflect never so he write he brilliant _ essay on milton _ which take all england by storm and say of it afterward that it contain scarcely a paragraph which he mature judgment approve whether he speak or write he have always before he a eager audience and he feel within he the bear orator 's power to hold and fascinate so he give loose rein to he enthusiasm quote from a hundred book and in he delight at entertaining we forget that the first quality of a critical or historical work be to be accurate and the second to be interesting thoma carlyle -lrb- 1795-1881 -rrb- in marked contrast with macaulay the brilliant and cheerful essayist be thomas carlyle the prophet and censor of the nineteenth century macaulay be the practical man of affair help and rejoice in the progress of he beloved england carlyle live apart from all practical interest look with distrust on the progress of he age and tell man that truth justice and immortality be the only worthy object of human endeavor macaulay be delighted with material comfort he be most at home in brilliant and fashionable company and he write even when ill and suffer with unfailing hopefulness and good nature carlyle be like a hebrew prophet just in from the desert and the burden of he message be woe to they that be at ease in zion both man be in different way typical of the century and somewhere between the two extreme -- the practical helpful activity of macaulay and the spiritual agony and conflict of carlyle -- we shall find the measure of a age which have leave the deepest impress upon we own life of carlyle carlyle be bear at ecclefechan dumfriesshire in 1795 a few month before burn 's death and before scott have publish he first work like burn he come of peasant stock -- strong simple god-fearing folk whose influence in carlyle 's later life be beyond calculation of he mother he say she be too mild and peaceful for the planet she live in and of he father a stone mason he write could i write my book as he build he house walk my way so manfully through this shadow world and leave it with so little blame it be more than all my hope of carlyle 's early school life we have some interesting glimpse in _ sartor resartus _ at nine year he enter the annan grammar school where he be bully by the older boy who nickname he tom the tearful for the teacher of those day he have only ridicule call they hide-bound pedant and he call the school by the suggestive german name of _ hinterschlag gymnasium _ at the wish of he parent who intend carlyle for the ministry he endure this hateful school life till 1809 when he enter edinburgh university there he spend five miserable year of which he own record be : i be without friend experience or connection in the sphere of human business be of sly humor proud enough and to spare and have begin my long curriculum of dyspepsia this nagging illness be the cause of much of that irritability of temper which frequently lead he to scold the public and for which he have be harshly handle by unfriendly critic the period follow he university course be one of storm and stress for carlyle much to the grief of the father whom he love he have give up the idea of enter the ministry wherever he turn doubt like a thick fog surround he -- doubt of god of he fellow-man of human progress of himself he be poor and to earn a honest living be he first problem he try successively teach school tutor the study of law and write miscellaneous article for the _ edinburgh encyclopedia _ all the while he be fight he doubt live as he say in a continual indefinite pining fear after six or seven year of mental agony which have at time a suggestion of bunyan 's spiritual struggle the crisis come in 1821 when carlyle suddenly shake off he doubt and find himself all at once he say in _ sartor _ there arise a think in I and i ask myself : ` what _ art _ thou afraid of wherefore like a coward dost thou forever pip and whimper and go cower and tremble despicable biped what be the sum total of the worst that lie before thee death well death and say the pang of tophet too and all that the devil and man may will or can do against thee hast thou not a heart canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be and as a child of freedom though outcast trample tophet itself under thy foot while it consume thee let it come then i will meet it and defy it ' and as i so think there rush like a stream of fire over my whole soul and i shake base fear away from I forever this struggle between fear and faith and the triumph of the latter be record in two remarkable chapter the everlasting no and the everlasting yea of _ sartor resartus _ carlyle now definitely resolve on a literary life and begin with any work that offer a bare livelihood he translate legendre 's _ geometry _ from the french write numerous essay for the magazine and continue he study of german while make translation from that language he translation of goethe 's _ wilhelm meister _ appear in 1824 he _ life of schiller _ in 1825 and he _ specimen of german romance _ in 1827 he begin at this time a correspondence with goethe he literary hero which last till the german poet 's death in 1832 while still busy with hack work carlyle in 1826 married jane welsh a brilliant and beautiful woman whose literary genius almost equal that of she husband soon afterwards influence chiefly by poverty the carlyle retire to a farm at craigen - puttoch -lrb- hawk ' hill -rrb- a dreary and lonely spot far from friend and even neighbor they remain here six year during which time carlyle write many of he best essay and _ sartor resartus _ he most original work the latter go beg among publisher for two year and be finally publish serially in _ fraser 's magazine _ in 1833-1834 by this time carlyle have begin to attract attention as a writer and think that one who make he living by the magazine should be in close touch with the editor take he wife 's advice and move to london to seek work and bread he settle in cheyne row chelsea -- a place make famous by more erasmus bolingbroke smollett leigh hunt and many lesser light of literature -- and begin to enjoy the first real peace he have know since childhood in 1837 appear _ the french revolution _ which first make carlyle famous and in the same year lead by the necessity of earn money he begin the series of lecture -- _ german literature _ -lrb- 1837 -rrb- _ period of european culture _ -lrb- 1838 -rrb- _ revolution of modern europe _ -lrb- 1839 -rrb- _ hero and hero worship _ -lrb- 1841 -rrb- -- which create a sensation in london it be say leigh hunt as if some puritan have come to life again liberalize by german philosophy and he own intense reflection and experience though carlyle set himself against the spirit of he age call the famous reform bill a progress into darkness and democracy the rule of the worst rather than the best he rough sincerity be unquestioned and he remark be more quote than those of any other live man he be support moreover by a rare circle of friend -- edward irving southey sterling landor leigh hunt dickens mill tennyson browning and most helpful of all emerson who have visit carlyle at craigenputtoch in 1833 it be due largely to emerson 's influence that carlyle 's work be better appreciate and bring better financial reward in america than in england carlyle 's fame reach its climax in the monumental _ history of frederick the great _ -lrb- 1858-1865 -rrb- publish after thirteen year of solitary toil which in he own word make entire devastation of home life and happiness the proudest moment of he life be when he be elect to succeed gladstone as lord rector of edinburgh university in 1865 the year in which _ frederick the great _ be finish in the midst of he triumph and while he be in scotland to deliver he inaugural address he happiness be suddenly destroy by the death of he wife -- a terrible blow from which he never recover he live on for fifteen year shear of he strength and interest in life and he closing hour be like the dull sunset of a November day only as we remember he grief and remorse at the death of the companion who have share he toil but not he triumph can we understand the sorrow that pervade the page of he _ reminiscence _ he die in 1881 and at he own wish be bury not in westminster abbey but among he humble kinsfolk in ecclefechan however much we may differ from he philosophy or regret the harshness of he minor work we shall probably all agree in this sentiment from one of he own letter -- that the object of all he struggle and writing be that man should find out and believe the truth and match they life to it work of carlyle there be two widely different judgment of carlyle as a man and a writer the first which be found largely on he minor writings like _ chartism latter-day pamphlet _ and _ shooting niagara _ declare that he be a misanthrope and dyspeptic with a barbarous style of write that he denounce progress democracy science america darwin -- everybody and everything that he do not understand that he literary opinion be largely prejudice that he begin as a prophet and end as a scold and that in denounce sham of every sort he be something of a sham himself since he practice be not in accord with he own preach the second judgment which be found upon _ hero and hero worship cromwell _ and _ sartor resartus _ declare that these work be the supreme manifestation of genius that they rugged picturesque style make other look feeble or colorless by comparison and that the author be the greatest teacher leader and prophet of the nineteenth century somewhere between these two extreme will be find the truth about carlyle we only note here that while there be some grounds for the first unfavorable criticism we be to judge a author by he best rather than by he worst work and that a man 's aim as well as he accomplishment must be take into consideration as it be write whereas it be in thine heart to build a house unto my name thou didst well that it be in thine heart whatever the defect of carlyle and he work in he heart he be always plan a house or temple to the god of truth and justice carlyle 's important work may be divide into three general class -- critical and literary essay historical work and _ sartor resartus _ the last be in a class by itself since there be nothing like it in literature to these should be add a biography the admirable _ life of john sterling _ and carlyle 's _ letter _ and _ reminiscence _ which be more interesting and suggestive than some of he better known work we omit here all consideration of translation and he intemperate denunciation of man and institution in _ chartism latter-day pamphlet _ and other essay which add nothing to the author 's fame or influence of the essay which be all characterize by carlyle 's zeal to get at the heart of thing and to reveal the soul rather than the work of a writer the best be those on burn scott novalis goethe characteristic sign of the time and boswell 's life of johnson -lrb- 244 -rrb- in the famous _ essay on burn _ which be generally select for special study we note four significant thing : -lrb- 1 -rrb- carlyle be peculiarly well fit for he task have many point in common with he hero -lrb- 2 -rrb- in most of he work carlyle by he style and mannerism and positive opinion generally attract we attention away from he subject but in this essay he show himself capable of forget himself for a moment to a unusual extent he stick to he subject and make we think of burn rather than of carlyle the style though unpolished be fairly simple and readable and be free from the break crudity ejaculation and general nodulosity which disfigure much of he work -lrb- 3 -rrb- carlyle have a original and interesting theory of biography and criticism the object of criticism be to show the man himself he aim ideal and outlook on the universe the object of biography be to show what and how produce be the effect of society upon he what and how produce be he effect on society -lrb- 4 -rrb- carlyle be often severe even harsh in he estimate of other man but in this case the tragedy of burn 's life of fragment attract and soften he he grow enthusiastic and -- a rare thing for carlyle -- apologize for he enthusiasm in the striking sentence we love burn and we pity he and love and pity be prone to magnify so he give we the most tender and appreciative of he essay and one of the most illuminating criticism of burn that have appear in we language the central idea of carlyle 's historical work be find in he _ hero and hero worship _ -lrb- 1841 -rrb- he most widely read book universal history he say be at bottom the history of the great man who have work here to get at the truth of history we must study not movement but man and read not state papers but the biography of hero he summary of history as present in this work have six division : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the hero as divinity have for its general subject odin the type norseman who carlyle think be some old heroic chief afterwards deify by he countryman -lrb- 2 -rrb- the hero as prophet treat of mahomet and the rise of islam -lrb- 3 -rrb- the hero as poet in which dante and shakespeare be take as type -lrb- 4 -rrb- the hero as priest or religious leader in which luther appear as the hero of the reformation and knox as the hero of puritanism -lrb- 5 -rrb- the hero as man of letter in which we have the curious choice of johnson rousseau and burn -lrb- 6 -rrb- the hero as king in which cromwell and napoleon appear as the hero of reform by revolution it be needless to say that _ hero _ be not a book of history neither be it scientifically write in the manner of gibbon with science in any form carlyle have no patience and he miscalculate the value of that patient search for fact and evidence which science undertake before build any theory either of king or cabbage the book therefore abound in error but they be the error of carelessness and be perhaps of small consequence he misconception of history however be more serious with the modern idea of history as the growth of freedom among all class he have no sympathy the progress of democracy be to he a evil thing a turning of the face towards darkness and anarchy at certain period accord to carlyle god send we genius sometimes as priest or poet sometimes as soldier or statesman but in whatever guise they appear these be we real ruler he show moreover that whenever such man appear multitude follow they and that a man 's following be a sure index of he heroism and kingship whether we agree with carlyle or not we must accept for the moment he peculiar view of history else _ hero _ can never open its treasure to we the book abound in startling idea express with originality and power and be pervade throughout by a atmosphere of intense moral earnestness the more we read it the more we find to admire and to remember carlyle 's _ french revolution _ -lrb- 1837 -rrb- be to be take more seriously as a historical work but here again he hero worship come to the front and he book be a series of flashlight throw upon man in dramatic situation rather than a trace of cause to they consequence the very title of he chapter -- astraea redux windbag broglie the war god -- do violence to we conception of history and be more suggestive of carlyle 's individualism than of french history he be here the preacher rather than the historian he text be the eternal justice and he message be that all wrongdoing be inevitably follow by vengeance he method be intensely dramatic from a mass of historical detail he select a few picturesque incident and striking figure and he vivid picture of the storm of the bastille the rush of the mob to versaille the death of loui xvi and the reign of terror seem like the work of a eyewitness describe some terrible catastrophe at time as it portray danton robespierre and the great character of the tragedy carlyle 's work be suggestive of a historical play of shakespeare and again as it describe the rush and riot of man lead by elemental passion it be more like a great prose epic though not a reliable history in any sense it be one of the most dramatic and stir narrative in we language two other historical work deserve at least a pass notice the _ history of frederick the great _ -lrb- 1858-1865 -rrb- in six volume be a colossal picture of the life and time of the hero of the prussian empire _ oliver cromwell 's letter and speech _ be in we personal judgment carlyle 's best historical work he idea be to present the very soul of the great puritan leader he give we as of first importance cromwell 's own word and connect they by a commentary in which other man and event be describe with vigor and vividness cromwell be one of carlyle 's greatest hero and in this case he be most careful to present the fact which occasion he own enthusiasm the result be on the whole the most lifelike picture of a great historical character that we possess other historian have heap calumny upon cromwell till the english public regard he with prejudice and horror and it be a indication of carlyle 's power that by a single book he revolutionize england 's opinion of one of she greatest man carlyle 's _ sartor resartus _ -lrb- 1834 -rrb- he only creative work be a mixture of philosophy and romance of wisdom and nonsense -- a chaotic jumble of the author 's thought feeling and experience during the first thirty-five year of he life the title which mean the tailor patched-up be take from a old scotch song the hero be diogenes teufelsdroeckh a german professor at the university of weissnichtwo -lrb- do not know where -rrb- the narrative concern this queer professor 's life and opinion and the central thought of the book be the philosophy of clothes which be consider symbolically as the outward expression of spirit thus man 's body be the outward garment of he soul and the universe be the visible garment of the invisible god the arrangement of _ sartor _ be clumsy and hard to follow in order to leave himself free to bring in everything he think about carlyle assume the position of one who be translate and editing the old professor 's manuscript which be suppose to consist of numerous sheet stuff into twelve paper bag each label with a sign of the zodiac the editor pretend to make order out of this chaos but he be free to jump from one subject to another and to state the most startling opinion by simply use quotation mark and add a note that he be not responsible for teufelsdroeckh 's crazy notion -- which be in reality carlyle 's own dream and ideal partly because of the matter which be sometimes incoherent partly because of the style which though picturesque be sometimes confuse and ungrammatical _ sartor _ be not easy reading but it amply repay whatever time and study we give to it many of its passage be more like poetry than prose and one can not read such chapter as the everlasting no the everlasting yea reminiscence and natural supernaturalism and be quite the same man afterwards for carlyle 's thought have enter into he and he walk henceforth more gently more reverently through the world as in the presence of the eternal general characteristic concern carlyle 's style there be almost as many opinion as there be reader this be partly because he impress different people in widely different way and partly because he expression vary greatly at time he be calm persuasive grimly humorous as if converse at other time wildly exclamatory as if he be shout and wave he arm at the reader we have speak of macaulay 's style as that of the finish orator and we might reasonably speak of carlyle 's as that of the exhorter who care little for method so long as he make a strong impression on he hearer every sentence be alive to its finger tip write a modern critic and though carlyle often violate the rule of grammar and rhetoric we can well afford to let a original genius express he own intense conviction in he own vivid and picturesque way carlyle 's message may be sum up in two imperative -- labor and be sincere he lecture and write chiefly for the upper class who have begin to think somewhat sentimentally of the condition of the labor man of the world and he demand for the latter not charity or pity but justice and honor all labor whether of head or hand be divine and labor alone justify a man as a son of earth and heaven to society which carlyle think to be occupy wholly with conventional affair he come with the stamp of sincerity call upon man to lay aside hypocrisy and to think and speak and live the truth he have none of addison 's delicate satire and humor and in he fury at what he think be false he be generally unsympathetic and often harsh but we must not forget that thackeray -- who know society much better than do carlyle -- give a very unflattering picture of it in _ vanity fair _ and _ the book of snob _ apparently the age need plain speaking and carlyle furnish it in scripture measure harriet martineau who know the world for which carlyle write sum up he influence when she say that he have infuse into the mind of the english nation sincerity earnestness healthfulness and courage if we add to the above message carlyle 's conception of the world as govern by a god of justice who never forget and of human history as a inarticulate bible slowly reveal the divine purpose we shall understand better the force of he ethical appeal and the profound influence he exercise on the moral and intellectual life of the past century john ruskin -lrb- 1819-1900 -rrb- in approach the study of ruskin we be to remember first of all that we be deal with a great and good man who be himself more inspiring than any of he book in some respects he be like he friend carlyle whose disciple he acknowledge himself to be but he be broader in he sympathy and in every way more hopeful helpful and humane thus in the face of the drudgery and poverty of the competitive system carlyle propose with the grim satire of swift 's modest proposal to organize a annual hunt in which successful people should shoot the unfortunate and to use the game for the support of the army and navy ruskin face the same problem write : i will endure it no longer quietly but henceforward with any few or many who will help do my best to abate this misery then leave the field of art criticism where he be the acknowledged leader he begin to write of labor and justice give he fortune in charity in establish school and library and found he st george 's guild of workingman to put in practice the principle of brotherhood and cooperation for which he and carlyle contend though he style mark he as one of the master of english prose he be generally study not as a literary man but as a ethical teacher and we shall hardly appreciate he work unless we see behind every book the figure of the heroically sincere man who write it life ruskin be bear in london in 1819 he father be a prosperous wine merchant who gain a fortune in trade and who spend he leisure hour in the company of good book and picture on he tombstone one may still read this inscription write by ruskin : he be a entirely honest merchant and he memory be to all who keep it dear and helpful he son whom he love to the uttermost and teach to speak truth say this of he ruskin 's mother a devout and somewhat austere woman bring she son up with puritanical strictness not forget solomon 's injunction that the rod and reproof give wisdom of ruskin 's early year at herne hill on the outskirts of london it be better to read he own interesting record in _ praeterita _ it be in some respects a cramped and lonely childhood but certain thing which strongly mold he character be worthy of mention first he be teach by word and example in all thing to speak the truth and he never forget the lesson second he have few toy and spend much time in study the leave the flower the grass the cloud even the figure and color of the carpet and so lay the foundation for that minute and accurate observation which be manifest in all he writings third he be educate first by he mother then by private tutor and so miss the discipline of the public school the influence of this lonely training be evident in all he work like carlyle he be often too positive and dogmatic -- the result of fail to test he work by the standard of other man of he age fourth he be oblige to read the bible every day and to learn long passage verbatim the result of this training be he say to make every word of the scripture familiar to my ear in habitual music we can hardly read a page of he later work without find some reflection of the noble simplicity or vivid imagery of the sacred record fifth he travel much with he father and mother and he innate love of nature be intensify by what he see on he leisurely journey through the most beautiful part of england and the continent ruskin enter christ church college oxford in 1836 when only seventeen year old he be at this time a shy sensitive boy a lover of nature and of every art which reflect nature but almost entirely ignorant of the way of boy and man a attack of consumption with which he have long be threaten cause he to leave oxford in 1840 and for nearly two year he wander over italy search for health and cheerfulness and gathering material for the first volume of _ modern painter _ the book that make he famous ruskin 's literary work begin in childhood when he be encourage to write freely in prose and poetry a volume of poem illustrate by he own drawing be publish in 1859 after he have win fame as a prose writer but save for the drawing it be of small importance the first volume of _ modern painter _ -lrb- 1843 -rrb- be begin as a heated defense of the artist turner but it develop into a essay on art as a true picture of nature not only in she outward aspect but in she inward spirit the work which be sign simply oxford graduate arouse a storm of mingled approval and protest but however much critic war over its theory of art all be agree that the unknown author be a master of descriptive prose ruskin now make frequent trip to the art gallery of the continent and produce four more volume of _ modern painter _ during the next seventeen year meanwhile he write other book -- _ seven lamp of architecture _ -lrb- 1849 -rrb- _ stone of venice _ -lrb- 1851-1853 -rrb- _ pre-raphaelitism _ and numerous lecture and essay which give he a place in the world of art similar to that hold by matthew arnold in the world of letter in 1869 he be appoint professor of art at oxford a position which greatly increase he prestige and influence not only among student but among a great variety of people who hear he lecture and read he publish work _ lecture on art aratra pentelicus _ -lrb- lecture on sculpture -rrb- _ ariadne florentina _ -lrb- lecture on engraving -rrb- _ michael angelum and tintoret the art of england val d'arno _ -lrb- lecture on tuscan art -rrb- _ st mark 's rest _ -lrb- a history of venice -rrb- _ morning in florence _ -lrb- study in christian art now much use as a guidebook to the picture gallery of florence -rrb- _ the law of fiesole _ -lrb- a treatise on drawing and painting for school -rrb- _ academy of fine art in venice pleasure of england _ -- all these work on art show ruskin 's literary industry and we must also record _ love 's meinie _ -lrb- a study of bird -rrb- _ proserpina _ -lrb- a study of flower -rrb- _ deucalion _ -lrb- a study of wave and stone -rrb- besides various essay on political economy which indicate that ruskin like arnold have begin to consider the practical problem of he age at the height of he fame in 1860 ruskin turn for a time from art to consider question of wealth and labor -- term which be use glibly by the economist of the age without much thought for they fundamental meaning there be no wealth but life announce ruskin -- life include all its power of love of joy and of admiration that country be the richest which nourish the greatest number of noble and happy human being such a doctrine proclaim by goldsmith in he _ desert village _ be regard as a pretty sentiment but come from one of the greatest leader and teacher of england it be like a bombshell ruskin write four essay establish this doctrine and plead for a more socialistic form of government in which reform might be possible the essay be publish in the _ cornhill magazine _ of which thackeray be editor and they arouse such a storm that the publication be discontinue ruskin then publish the essay in book form with the title _ unto this last _ in 1862 _ munera pulveri _ -lrb- 1862 -rrb- be another work in which the principle of capital and labor and the evil of the competitive system be discuss in such a way that the author be denounce as a visionary or a madman other work of this practical period be _ time and tide for clavigera sesame and lily _ and the _ crown of wild olive _ the latter part of ruskin 's life be a time of increase sadness due partly to the failure of he plan and partly to public attack upon he motive or upon he sanity he grow bitter at first as he critic ridicule or denounce he principle and at time he voice be as querulous as that of carlyle we be to remember however the condition under which he struggle he health have be shatter by successive attack of disease he have be disappoint in love he marriage be unhappy and he work seem a failure he have give nearly all he fortune in charity and the poor be more numerous than ever before he famous st george 's guild be not successful and the tyranny of the competitive system seem too deeply root to be overthrow on the death of he mother he leave london and in 1879 retire to brantwood on coniston lake in the beautiful region beloved of wordsworth here he pass the last quiet year of he life under the care of he cousin mr severn the angel of the house and write at professor norton 's suggestion _ praeterita _ one of he most interesting book in which he describe the event of he youth from he own view point he die quietly in 1900 and be bury as he wish without funeral pomp or public ceremony in the little churchyard at coniston work of ruskin there be three little book which in popular favor stand first on the list of ruskin 's numerous work -- _ ethics-of-the-dust _ a series of lecture to little housewife which appeal most to woman _ crown of wild olive _ three lecture on work traffic and war which appeal to thoughtful man face the problem of work and duty and _ sesame and lily _ which appeal to man and woman alike the last be the most widely know of ruskin 's work and the best with which to begin we read the first thing we notice in _ sesame and lily _ be the symbolical title sesame take from the story of the robber ' cave in the _ arabian night _ mean a secret word or talisman which unlock a treasure house it be intend no doubt to introduce the first part of the work call of king ' treasury which treat of book and read lily take from isaiah as a symbol of beauty purity and peace introduce the second lecture of queen ' garden which be a exquisite study of woman 's life and education these two lecture properly constitute the book but a third be add on the mystery of life the last begin in a monologue upon he own failure in life and be pervade by a atmosphere of sadness sometimes of pessimism quite different from the spirit of the other two lecture though the theme of the first lecture be book ruskin manage to present to he audience he whole philosophy of life he give we with a wealth of detail a description of what constitute a real book he look into the meaning of word and teach we how to read use a selection from milton 's _ lycida _ as a illustration this study of word give we the key with which we be to unlock king ' treasury that be the book which contain the precious thought of the kingly mind of all age he show the real meaning and end of education the value of labor and of a purpose in life he treat of nature science art literature religion he define the purpose of government show that soul-life not money or trade be the measure of national greatness and he criticise the general injustice of he age quote a heartrending story of toil and suffer from the newspaper to show how close he theory be to daily need here be a astonishing variety in a small compass but there be no confusion ruskin 's mind be wonderfully analytical and one subject develop naturally from the other in the second lecture of queen ' garden he consider the question of woman 's place and education which tennyson have attempt to answer in _ the princess _ ruskin 's theory be that the purpose of all education be to acquire power to bless and to redeem human society and that in this noble work woman must always play the lead part he search all literature for illustration and he description of literary heroine especially of shakespeare 's perfect woman be unrivaled ruskin be always at he best in writing of woman or for woman and the lofty idealism of this essay together with its rare beauty of expression make it on the whole the most delightful and inspiring of he work among ruskin 's practical work the reader will find in _ for clavigera _ a series of letter to workingman and _ unto this last _ four essay on the principle of political economy the substance of he economic teaching in the latter work start with the proposition that we present competitive system center about the idea of wealth ruskin try to find out what wealth be and the pith of he teaching be this -- that man be of more account than money that a man 's real wealth be find in he soul not in he pocket and that the prime object of life and labor be the producing of as many as possible full-breathed bright-eyed and happy - heart human creature to make this ideal practical ruskin make four suggestion : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that training school be establish to teach young man and woman three thing -- the law and practice of health habit of gentleness and justice and the trade or call by which they be to live -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the government establish farm and workshop for the production of all the necessaries of life where only good and honest work shall be tolerate and where a standard of work and wages shall be maintain -lrb- 3 -rrb- that any person out of employment shall be receive at the nearest government school : if ignorant he shall be educate and if competent to do any work he shall have the opportunity to do it -lrb- 4 -rrb- that comfortable home be provide for the sick and for the aged and that this be do in justice not in charity a laborer serve he country as truly as do a soldier or a statesman and a pension should be no more disgraceful in one case than in the other among ruskin 's numerous book treat of art we recommend the _ seven lamp of architecture _ -lrb- 1849 -rrb- _ stone of venice _ -lrb- 1851-1853 -rrb- and the first two volume of _ modern painter _ -lrb- 1843-1846 -rrb- with ruskin 's art theory which as sydney smith prophesy work a complete revolution in the world of taste we need not concern ourselves here we simply point out four principle that be manifest in all he work : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the object of art as of every other human endeavor be to find and to express the truth -lrb- 2 -rrb- that art in order to be true must break away from conventionality and copy nature -lrb- 3 -rrb- that morality be closely ally with art and that a careful study of any art reveal the moral strength or weakness of the people that produce it -lrb- 4 -rrb- that the main purpose of art be not to delight a few culture people but to serve the daily use of common life the give brightness to picture be much he say but the give brightness to life be more in this attempt to make art serve the practical end of life ruskin be ally with all the great writer of the period who use literature as the instrument of human progress general characteristic one who read ruskin be in a state of mind analogous to that of a man who go through a picture gallery pause now to admire a face or a landscape for its own sake and again to marvel at the technical skill of the artist without regard to he subject for ruskin be a great literary artist and a great ethical teacher and we admire one page for its style and the next for its message to humanity the best of he prose which one may find in the descriptive passage of _ præterita _ and _ modern painter _ be write in a richly ornate style with a wealth of figure and allusion and at time a rhythmic melodious quality which make it almost equal to poetry ruskin have a rare sensitiveness to beauty in every form and more perhaps than any other writer in we language he have help we to see and appreciate the beauty of the world around we as for ruskin 's ethical teaching it appear in so many form and in so many different work that any summary must appear inadequate for a full half century he be the apostle of beauty in england and the beauty for which he plead be never sensuous or pagan as in the renaissance but always spiritual appeal to the soul of man rather than to he eye lead to better work and better living in he economic essay ruskin be even more directly and positively ethical to mitigate the evil of the unreasonable competitive system under which we labor and sorrow to bring master and man together in mutual trust and helpfulness to seek beauty truth goodness as the chief end of life and have find they to make we character correspond to share the best treasure of art and literature with rich and poor alike to labor always and whether we work with hand or head to do we work in praise of something that we love -- this sum up ruskin 's purpose and message and the best of it be that like chaucer 's country parson he practice he doctrine before he preach it matthew arnold -lrb- 1822-1888 -rrb- in the world of literature arnold have occupy for many year a authoritative position as critic and teacher similar to that hold by ruskin in the world of art in he literary work two very different mood be manifest in he poetry he reflect the doubt of a age which witness the conflict between science and reveal religion apparently he never pass through any such decisive personal struggle as be record in _ sartor resartus _ and he have no positive conviction such as be voice in the everlasting yea he be beset by doubt which he never settle and he poem generally express sorrow or regret or resignation in he prose he show the cavalier spirit -- aggressive light-hearted self-confident like carlyle he dislike sham and protest against what he call the barbarism of society but he write with a light touch use satire and banter as the better part of he argument carlyle denounce with the zeal of a hebrew prophet and let you know that you be hopelessly lose if you reject he message arnold be more like the cultivate greek he voice be soft he speech suave but he leave the impression if you happen to differ with he that you must be deficient in culture both these man so different in spirit and method confront the same problem seek the same end and be dominate by the same moral sincerity life arnold be bear in laleham in the valley of the thame in 1822 he father be dr thoma arnold head master of rugby with whom many of we have grow familiar by read _ tom brown 's school day _ after fitting for the university at winchester and at rugby arnold enter balliol college oxford where he be distinguish by win prize in poetry and by general excellence in the classic more than any other poet arnold reflect the spirit of he university the scholar-gipsy and thyrsis contain many reference to oxford and the surrounding country but they be more noticeable for they spirit of aloofness -- as if oxford man be too much occupy with classic dream and ideal to concern themselves with the practical affair of life after leave the university arnold first teach the classic at rugby then in 1847 he become private secretary to lord lansdowne who appoint the young poet to the position of inspector of school under the government in this position arnold work patiently for the next thirty - five year travel about the country examine teacher and correct endless examination papers for ten year -lrb- 1857-1867 -rrb- he be professor of poetry at oxford where he famous lecture _ on translate homer _ be give he make numerous report on english and foreign school and be three time send abroad to study educational method on the continent from this it will be see that arnold lead a busy often a laborious life and we can appreciate he statement that all he best literary work be do late at night after a day of drudgery it be well to remember that while carlyle be preach about labor arnold labor daily that he work be cheerfully and patiently do and that after the day 's work he hurry away like lamb to the elysian field of literature he be happily marry love he home and especially love child be free from all bitterness and envy and notwithstanding he cold manner be at heart sincere generous and true we shall appreciate he work better if we can see the man himself behind all that he have write arnold 's literary work divide itself into three period which we may call the poetical the critical and the practical he have write poetry since he school day and he first volume _ the strayed reveller and other poem _ appear anonymously in 1849 three year later he publish _ empedocle on etna and other poem _ but only a few copy of these volume be sell and presently both be withdraw from circulation in 1853-1855 he publish he sign _ poem _ and twelve year later appear he last volume of poetry compare with the early work of tennyson these work meet with little favor and arnold practically abandon poetry in favor of critical write the chief work of he critical period be the lecture _ on translate homer _ -lrb- 1861 -rrb- and the two volume of _ essay in criticism _ -lrb- 1865-1888 -rrb- which make arnold one of the best know literary man in england then like ruskin he turn to practical question and he _ friendship 's garland _ -lrb- 1871 -rrb- be intend to satirize and perhaps reform the great middle class of england whom he call the philistine _ culture and anarchy _ the most characteristic work of he practical period appear in 1869 these be follow by four book on religious subject -- _ st paul and protestantism _ -lrb- 1870 -rrb- _ literature and dogma _ -lrb- 1873 -rrb- _ god and the bible _ -lrb- 1875 -rrb- and _ last essay on church and religion _ -lrb- 1877 -rrb- the _ discourse in america _ -lrb- 1885 -rrb- complete the list of he important work at the height of he fame and influence he die suddenly in 1888 and be bury in the churchyard at laleham the spirit of he whole life be well express in a few line of one of he own early sonnet : one lesson nature let I learn of thee one lesson which in every wind be blow one lesson of two duty keep at one though the loud world proclaim they enmity -- of toil unsever would from tranquillity of labor that in lasting fruit outgrow far noisier scheme accomplish would in repose too great for haste too high for rivalry work of matthew arnold we shall better appreciate arnold 's poetry if we remember two thing : first he have be teach in he home a simple and devout faith in reveal religion and in college he be throw into a world of doubt and question he face these doubt honestly reverently -- in he heart longing to accept the faith of he father but in he head demand proof and scientific exactness the same struggle between head and heart between reason and intuition go on to-day and that be one reason why arnold 's poetry which waver on the borderland between doubt and faith be a favorite with many reader second arnold as show in he essay on _ the study of poetry _ regard poetry as a criticism of life under the condition fix for such criticism by the law of poetic truth and poetic beauty naturally one who regard poetry as a criticism will write very differently from one who regard poetry as the natural language of the soul he will write for the head rather than for the heart and will be cold and critical rather than enthusiastic accord to arnold each poem should be a unit and he protest against the tendency of english poet to use brilliant phrase and figure of speech which only detract attention from the poem as a whole for he model he go to greek poetry which he regard as the only sure guidance to what be sound and true in poetical art arnold be however more indebted than he think to english master especially to wordsworth and milton whose influence be noticeable in a large part of he poetry of arnold 's narrative poem the two best know be _ balder dead _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- a incursion into the field of norse mythology which be suggestive of gray and _ sohrab and rustum _ -lrb- 1853 -rrb- which take we into the field of legendary persian history the theme of the latter poem be take from the _ shah - namah _ -lrb- book of king -rrb- of the persian poet firdausus who live and write in the eleventh century briefly the story be of one rustem or rustum a persian achille who fall asleep one day when he have grow weary of hunting while he sleep a band of robber steal he favorite horse ruksh in trail the robber rustum come to the palace of the king of samengan where he be royally welcome and where he fall in love with the king 's daughter temineh and marry she but he be of a rove adventurous disposition and soon go back to fight among he own people the persian while he be go he son sohrab be bear grow to manhood and become the hero of the turan army war arise between the two people and two hostile army be encamp by the oxus each army choose a champion and rustum and sohrab find themselves match in mortal combat between the line at this point sohrab whose chief interest in life be to find he father demand to know if he enemy be not rustum but the latter be disguise and deny he identity on the first day of the fight rustum be overcome but he life be spare by a trick and by the generosity of sohrab on the second day rustum prevail and mortally wound he antagonist then he recognize he own son by a gold bracelet which he have long ago give to he wife temineh the two army rush into battle be stop by the sight of father and son weep in each other 's arm sohrab die the war cease and rustum go home to a life of sorrow and remorse use this interesting material arnold produce a poem which have the rare and difficult combination of classic reserve and romantic feeling it be write in blank verse and one have only to read the first few line to see that the poet be not a master of he instrument the line be seldom harmonious and we must frequently change the accent of common word or lay stress on unimportant particle to show the rhythm arnold frequently copy milton especially in he repetition of idea and phrase but the poem as a whole be lack in milton 's wonderful melody the classic influence on _ sohrab and rustum _ be especially noticeable in arnold 's use of material fight be short grief be long therefore the poet give few line to the combat but linger over the son 's joy at find he father and the father 's quenchless sorrow at the death of he son the last line especially with they passionate grief set to solemn music make this poem one of the best on the whole that arnold have write and the exquisite end where the oxus unmindful of the trivial strife of man flow on sedately to join he luminous home of water be most suggestive of the poet 's conception of the orderly life of nature in contrast with the doubt and restlessness of human life next in importance to the narrative poem be the elegy thyrsis the scholar-gipsy memorial verse a southern night obermann stanza from the grande chartreuse and rugby chapel all these be worthy of careful reading but the best be thyrsis a lament for the poet clough which be sometimes class with milton 's _ lycida _ and shelley 's _ adonai _ among the minor poem the reader will find the best expression of arnold 's ideal and method in dover beach the love lyric entitle switzerland requiescat shakespeare the future kensington garden philomela human life callicle 's song morality and geist 's grave -- the last be a exquisite tribute to a little dog which like all he kind have repay we scant crumb of affection with a whole life 's devotion the first place among arnold 's prose work must be give to the _ essay in criticism _ which raise the author to the front rank of live critic he fundamental idea of criticism appeal to we strongly the business of criticism he say be neither to find fault nor to display the critic 's own learning or influence it be to know the best which have be think and say in the world and by use this knowledge to create a current of fresh and free thought if a choice must be make among these essay which be all worthy of study we would suggest the study of poetry wordsworth byron and emerson the last-named essay which be find in the _ discourse in america _ be hardly a satisfactory estimate of emerson but its singular charm of manner and its atmosphere of intellectual culture make it perhaps the most characteristic of arnold 's prose writings among the work of arnold 's practical period there be two which may be take as typical of all the rest _ literature and dogma _ -lrb- 1873 -rrb- be in general a plea for liberality in religion arnold would have we read the bible for instance as we would read any other great work and apply to it the ordinary standard of literary criticism _ culture and anarchy _ -lrb- 1869 -rrb- contain most of the term -- culture sweetness and light barbarian philistine hebraism and many other -- which be now associate with arnold 's work and influence the term barbarian refer to the aristocratic class whom arnold think to be essentially crude in soul notwithstanding they good clothes and superficial grace philistine refer to the middle class -- narrow-minded and self-satisfied people accord to arnold whom he satirize with the idea of open they mind to new idea hebraism be arnold 's term for moral education carlyle have emphasize the hebraic or moral element in life and arnold undertake to preach the hellenic or intellectual element which welcome new idea and delight in the art that reflect the beauty of the world the uppermost idea with hellenism he say be to see thing as they be the uppermost idea with hebraism be conduct and obedience with great clearness sometimes with great force and always with a play of humor and raillery aim at the philistine arnold plead for both these element in life which together aim at culture that be at moral and intellectual perfection general characteristic arnold 's influence in we literature may be sum up in a word as intellectual rather than inspirational one can not be enthusiastic over he poetry for the simple reason that he himself lack enthusiasm he be however a true reflection of a very real mood of the past century the mood of doubt and sorrow and a future generation may give he a higher place than he now hold as a poet though mark by the elemental note of sadness all arnold 's poem be distinguish by clearness simplicity and the restrained emotion of he classic model as a prose writer the cold intellectual quality which mar he poetry by restrain romantic feeling be of first importance since it lead he to approach literature with a open mind and with the single desire to find the best which have be think and say in the world we can not yet speak with confidence of he rank in literature but by he crystal-clear style he scientific spirit of inquiry and comparison illumine here and there by the play of humor and especially by he broad sympathy and intellectual culture he seem destine to occupy a very high place among the master of literary criticism john henry newman -lrb- 1801-1890 -rrb- any record of the prose literature of the victorian era which include the historical essay of macaulay and the art criticism of ruskin should contain also some notice of its spiritual leader for there be never a time when the religious ideal that inspire the race be keep more constantly before man 's mind through the medium of literature among the religious writer of the age the first place belong unquestionably to cardinal newman whether we consider he as a man with he powerful yet gracious personality or as a religious reformer who do much to break down old religious prejudice by show the underlie beauty and consistency of the roman church or as a prose writer whose style be as near perfection as we have ever reach newman be one of the most interesting figure of the whole nineteenth century life three thing stand out clearly in newman 's life : first he unshaken faith in the divine companionship and guidance second he desire to find and to teach the truth of reveal religion third he quest of a authoritative standard of faith which should remain steadfast through the change century and amid all sort and condition of man the first lead to that rare and beautiful spiritual quality which shine in all he work the second to he frequent doctrinal and controversial essay the third to he conversion to the catholic church which he serve as priest and teacher for the last forty-five year of he life perhaps we should add one more characteristic -- the practical bent of he religion for he be never so busy with study or controversy that he neglect to give a large part of he time to gentle ministration among the poor and needy he be bear in london in 1801 he father be a english banker he mother a member of a french huguenot family be a thoughtful devout woman who bring up she son in a way which suggest the mother of ruskin of he early training he reading of doctrinal and argumentative work and of he isolation from material thing in the thought that there be two and only two absolute and luminously self-evident being in the world himself and he creator it be better to read he own record in the _ apologium _ which be a kind of spiritual biography at the age of fifteen newman have begin he profound study of theological subject for science literature art nature -- all the broad interest which attract other literary man of he age -- he care little he mind be wholly occupy with the history and doctrine of the christian church to which he have already devote he life he be educate first at the school in ealing then at oxford take he degree in the latter place in 1820 though he college career be not more brilliant than that of many unknown man he unusual ability be recognize and he be make a fellow of oriel college retain the fellowship and lead a scholarly life for over twenty year in 1824 he be ordain in the anglican church and four year later be choose vicar of st mary 's at oxford where he sermon make a deep impression on the cultivate audience that gather from far and near to hear he a change be noticeable in newman 's life after he trip to the mediterranean in 1832 he have begin he life as a calvinist but while in oxford then the center of religious unrest he describe himself as drift in the direction of liberalism then study and bereavement and a innate mysticism lead he to a profound sympathy with the mediæval church he have from the beginning oppose catholicism but during he visit to italy where he see the roman church at the center of its power and splendor many of he prejudice be overcome in this enlargement of he spiritual horizon newman be greatly influence by he friend hurrell froude with whom he make the first part of the journey he poem of this period -lrb- afterwards collect in the _ lyra apostolica _ -rrb- among which be the famous lead kindly light be noticeable for they radiant spirituality but one who read they carefully see the beginning of that mental struggle which end in he leave the church in which he be bear thus he write of the catholic church whose service he have attend as one who in a foreign land receive the gift of a good samaritan : o that thy creed be sound for thou dost soothe the heart thou church of rome by thy unwearied watch and vary round of service in thy savior 's holy home i can not walk the city 's sultry street but the wide porch invite to still retreat where passion 's thirst be calm and care 's unthankful gloom on he return to england in 1833 he enter into the religious struggle know as the oxford or tractarian movement -lrb- 245 -rrb- and speedily become its acknowledged leader those who wish to follow this attempt at religious reform which profoundly affect the life of the whole english church will find it record in the _ tract for the time _ twenty-nine of which be write by newman and in he _ parochial and plain sermon _ -lrb- 1837 - 1843 -rrb- after nine year of spiritual conflict newman retire to littlemore where with a few follower he lead a life of almost monastic seclusion still strive to reconcile he change belief with the doctrine of he own church two year later he resign he charge at st mary 's and leave the anglican communion -- not bitterly but with a deep and tender regret he last sermon at littlemore on the parting of friend still move we profoundly like the cry of a prophet tear by personal anguish in the face of duty in 1845 he be receive into the catholic church and the following year at rome he join the community of st philip neri the saint of gentleness and kindness as newman describe he and be ordain to the roman priesthood by he preach and write newman have exercise a strong influence over he cultivate english hearer and the effect of he conversion be tremendous into the theological controversy of the next twenty year we have no mind to enter through it all newman retain he serenity and though a master of irony and satire keep he literary power always subordinate to he chief aim which be to establish the truth as he see it whether or not we agree with he conclusion we must all admire the spirit of the man which be above praise or criticism he most widely read work _ apologium pro vita sua _ -lrb- 1864 -rrb- be write in answer to a unfortunate attack by charle kingsley which would long since have be forget have it not lead to this remarkable book in 1854 newman be appoint rector of the catholic university in dublin but after four year return to england and found a catholic school at edgbaston in 1879 he be make cardinal by pope leo xiii the grace and dignity of he life quite as much as the sincerity of he _ apologium _ have long since disarm criticism and at he death in 1890 the thought of all england might well be express by he own line in the dream of gerontius : i have a dream yes some one softly say he be go and then a sigh go round the room and then i surely hear a priestly voice cry _ subvenite _ and they kneel in prayer work of newman reader approach newman from so many different motive some for doctrine some for argument some for a pure prose style that it be difficult to recommend the best work for the beginner 's use as a expression of newman 's spiritual struggle the _ apologium pro vita sua _ be perhaps the most significant this book be not light reading and one who open it should understand clearly the reason for which it be write newman have be accuse of insincerity not only by kingsley but by many other man in the public press he retirement to solitude and meditation at littlemore have be outrageously misunderstand and it be openly charge that he conversion be a cunningly devise plot to win a large number of he follower to the catholic church this charge involve other and it be to defend they as well as to vindicate himself that newman write the _ apologium _ the perfect sincerity with which he trace he religious history show that he conversion be only the final step in a course he have be follow since boyhood silence he critic and revolutionize public opinion concern himself and the church which he have join as the revelation of a soul 's history and as a model of pure simple unaffected english this book entirely apart from its doctrinal teaching deserve a high place in we prose literature in newman 's doctrinal work the _ via media _ the _ grammar of assent _ and in numerous controversial essay the student of literature will have little interest much more significant be he sermon the unconscious reflection of a rare spiritual nature of which professor shairp say : he power show itself clearly in the new and unlooked-for way in which he touch into life old truth moral or spiritual and as he speak how the old truth become new and how it come home with a meaning never feel before he lay he finger how gently yet how powerfully on some inner place in the hearer 's heart and tell he thing about himself he have never know till then subtlest truth which would have take philosopher page of circumlocution and big word to state be drop out by the way in a sentence or two of the most transparent saxon of greater interest to the general reader be _ the idea of a university _ discourse deliver at dublin and he two work of fiction _ loss and gain _ treat of a man 's conversion to catholicism and _ callista _ which be in he own word a attempt to express the feeling and mutual relation of christian and heathen in the middle of the third century the latter be in we judgment the most readable and interesting of newman 's work the character of callista a beautiful greek sculptor of idol be powerfully delineate the style be clear and transparent as air and the story of the heroine 's conversion and death make one of the most fascinating chapter in fiction though it be not the story so much as the author 's unconscious revelation of himself that charm we it would be well to read this novel in connection with kingsley 's _ hypatium _ which attempt to reconstruct the life and ideal of the same period newman 's poem be not so well know as he prose but the reader who examine the _ lyra apostolica _ and _ verse on various occasion _ will find many short poem that stir a religious nature profoundly by they pure and lofty imagination and future generation may pronounce one of these poem the dream of gerontius to be newman 's most enduring work this poem aim to reproduce the thought and feeling of a man whose soul be just quit the body and who be just begin a new and greater life both in style and in think the dream be a powerful and original poem and be worthy of attention not only for itself but as a modern critic suggest as a revelation of that high spiritual purpose which animated newman 's life from begin to end of newman 's style it be as difficult to write as it would be to describe the dress of a gentleman we have meet who be so perfectly dress that we pay no attention to he clothes he style be call transparent because at first we be not conscious of he manner and unobtrusive because we never think of newman himself but only of the subject he be discuss he be like the best french prose writer in express he thought with such naturalness and apparent ease that without thinking of style we receive exactly the impression which he mean to convey in he sermon and essay he be wonderfully simple and direct in he controversial writings gently ironical and satiric and the satire be pervade by a delicate humor but when he feeling be arouse he speak with poetic image and symbol and he eloquence be like that of the old testament prophet like ruskin 's he style be model largely on that of the bible but not even ruskin equal he in the poetic beauty and melody of he sentence on the whole he come nearer than any other of he age to we ideal of a perfect prose writer other essayist of the victorian age we have select the above five essayist macaulay carlyle arnold newman and ruskin as representative writer of the victorian age but there be many other who well repay we study notable among these be john addington symond author of _ the renaissance in italy _ undoubtedly he greatest work and of many critical essay walter pater whose _ appreciation _ and numerous other work mark he as one of we best literary critic and leslie stephen famous for he work on the monumental _ dictionary of national biography _ and for he _ hour in a library _ a series of impartial and excellent criticism brighten by the play of a original and delightful humor among the most famous writer of the age be the scientist lyell darwin huxley spencer tyndall and wallace -- a wonderful group of man whose work though they hardly belong to we present study have exercise a incalculable influence on we life and literature darwin 's _ origin of species _ -lrb- 1859 -rrb- which apparently establish the theory of evolution be a epoch-making book it revolutionize not only we conception of natural history but also we method of think on all the problem of human society those who would read a summary of the greatest scientific discovery of the age will find it in wallace 's _ darwinism _ -- a most interesting book write by the man who claim with darwin the honor of first announce the principle of evolution and from a multitude of scientific work we recommend also to the general reader huxley 's _ autobiography _ and he _ lay sermon address and review _ partly because they be excellent expression of the spirit and method of science and partly because huxley as a writer be perhaps the clearest and the most readable of the scientist the spirit of modern literature as we reflect on the varied work of the victorian writer three marked characteristic invite we attention first we great literary man no less than we great scientist have make truth the supreme object of human endeavor all these eager poet novelist and essayist quest over so many different way be equally intent on discover the truth of life man as far apart as darwin and newman be strangely alike in spirit one seek truth in the natural the other in the spiritual history of the race second literature have become the mirror of truth and the first requirement of every serious novel or essay be to be true to the life or the fact which it represent third literature have become animated by a definite moral purpose it be not enough for the victorian writer to create or attempt a artistic work for its own sake the work must have a definite lesson for humanity the poet be not only singer but leader they hold up a ideal and they compel man to recognize and follow it the novelist tell a story which picture human life and at the same time call we to the work of social reform or drive home a moral lesson the essayist be nearly all prophet or teacher and use literature as the chief instrument of progress and education among they all we find comparatively little of the exuberant fancy the romantic ardor and the boyish gladness of the elizabethan they write book not primarily to delight the artistic sense but to give bread to the hungry and water to the thirsty in soul milton 's famous sentence a good book be the precious life-blood of a master spirit might be write across the whole victorian era we be still too near these writer to judge how far they work suffer artistically from they practical purpose but this much be certain -- that whether or not they create immortal work they book have make the present world a better and a happier place to live in and that be perhaps the best that can be say of the work of any artist or artisan summary of the victorian age the year 1830 be generally place at the beginning of this period but its limit be very indefinite in general we may think of it as cover the reign of victorium -lrb- 1837-1901 -rrb- historically the age be remarkable for the growth of democracy follow the reform bill of 1832 for the spread of education among all class for the rapid development of the art and science for important mechanical invention and for the enormous extension of the bound of human knowledge by the discovery of science at the accession of victorium the romantic movement have spend its force wordsworth have write he best work the other romantic poet coleridge shelley keat and byron have pass away and for a time no new development be apparent in english poetry though the victorian age produce two great poet tennyson and brown the age as a whole be remarkable for the variety and excellence of its prose a study of all the great writer of the period reveal four general characteristic : -lrb- 1 -rrb- literature in this age have come very close to daily life reflect its practical problem and interest and be a powerful instrument of human progress -lrb- 2 -rrb- the tendency of literature be strongly ethical all the great poet novelist and essayist of the age be moral teacher -lrb- 3 -rrb- science in this age exercise a incalculable influence on the one hand it emphasize truth as the sole object of human endeavor it have establish the principle of law throughout the universe and it have give we a entirely new view of life as sum up in the word evolution that be the principle of growth or development from simple to complex form on the other hand its first effect seem to be to discourage work of the imagination though the age produce a incredible number of book very few of they belong among the great creative work of literature -lrb- 4 -rrb- though the age be generally characterize as practical and materialistic it be significant that nearly all the writer whom the nation delight to honor vigorously attack materialism and exalt a purely ideal conception of life on the whole we be incline to call this a idealistic age fundamentally since love truth justice brotherhood -- all great ideal -- be emphasize as the chief end of life not only by its poet but also by its novelist and essayist in we study we have consider : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the poet the life and work of tennyson and browning and the chief characteristic of the minor poet elizabeth barrett -lrb- mr brown -rrb- rossettus morri and swinburne -lrb- 2 -rrb- the novelist the life and work of dickens thackeray and george eliot and the chief work of charle reade
