from the baltic to the atlantic cover a area of nearly three hundred thousand square mile be next to russia the largest territorial division of europe surround by sea on all side but one which give it a unparalleled seaboard of over two thousand mile it hang on the continent by its frontier line with russium in lapland down the middle of this seabound continent divide it into two nearly equal part run a chain of mountain not inappropriately call kölen or keel the name suggest the image which the aspect of the land call to mind that of a huge ship float keel upward on the face of the ocean this keel form the frontier line between the kingdom of norway and sweden : sweden to the east sloping gently from the hill to the baltic norway to the west run more abruptly down from they watershed to the atlantic norway -lrb- in the old norse language _ noregr _ or _ nord-vegr ie _ the north way -rrb- accord to archaeological exploration appear to have be inhabit long before historical time the antiquarian maintain that three population have inhabit the north : a mongolian race and a celtic race type of which be to be find in the finn and the laplander in the far north and finally a caucasian race which immigrate from the south and drive out the celtic and laplandic race and from which the present inhabitant be descend the norwegian or northman -lrb- norseman -rrb- belong to a north-germanic branch of the indo-european race they nearest kindred be the swede the dane and the goth the original home of the race be suppose to have be the mountain region of balkh in western asia whence from time to time family and tribe migrate in different direction it be not know when the ancestor of the scandinavian people leave the original home in asia but it be probable that they earliest settlement in norway be make in the second century before the christian era the scandinavian people although comprise the oldest and most unmixed race in europe do not realize until very late the value of write chronicle or review of historic event thus the name of hero and king of the remotest past be helplessly forget save as they come to we in legend and folk-song much of which we must conclude be imaginary beautiful as it be but mother earth have reveal to we at the spade of the archaeologist trustworthy and irrefutable account of the age and the various degree of civilization of the race which inhabit the scandinavian peninsula in prehistoric time splendid specimen now extant in numerous museum prove that scandinavium like most other country have have a stone age a bronze age and a iron age and that each of these period reach a much higher development than in other country the scandinavian country be for the first time mention by the historian of antiquity in a account of a journey which pytea from massilium -lrb- the present marseille -rrb- make throughout northern europe about 300 bc he visit britain and there hear of a great country thule situate six day ' journey to the north and verge on the arctic sea the inhabitant in thule be a agricultural people who gather they harvest into big house for thresh on account of the very few sunny day and the plentiful rain in they region from corn and honey they prepare a beverage -lrb- probably mead -rrb- pliny the elder who himself visit the shore of the baltic in the first century after christ be the first to mention plainly the name of scandinavium he say that he have receive advice of immense island recently discover from germany the most famous of these island be scandinavium of as yet unexplored size the known part be inhabit by a people call _ hillevione _ who give it the name of another world he mention scandium nerigon the largest of they all and thule scandium and scandinavium be only different form of the same name denote the southernmost part of the peninsula and still preserve in the name of the province of scanium in sweden nerigon stand for norway the northern part of which be mention as a island by the name of thule the classical writer be ignorant of the fact that scandinavium be one great peninsula because the northern part be as yet uninhabited and they physical connection with finland and russium unknown that the roman be later acquaint with the scandinavian country be evidence from the fact that great number of roman coin have be find in excavate also vessel of bronze and glass weapon etc as well as work of art all turn out of the workshop in rome or its province there no doubt exist a regular traffic over the baltic through germany between the scandinavian country and the roman province the first settler probably know little of agriculture but make they living by fishing and hunting in time however they commence to clear away the timber that cover the land in the valley and on the side of the mountain and to till the ground at the earliest time of which the historical tale or _ saga _ tell we anything with regard to the social condition the land be divide among the free peasant-proprietor or _ bonde class _ bonde in english translation be usually call peasant but this be not a equivalent for with the word peasant we associate the idea of inferior social condition to the land aristocracy of the country while these peasant or bonde be themselves the highest class in the country the land own by a peasant be call he _ udal _ by udal-right the land be keep in the family and it could not be alienate or forfeit from the kindred who be udal-born to it the free peasant might own many thrall or slave who be unfree man these be mostly prisoner capture by the viking on they expedition to foreign shore the owner could trade they away or sell they or even kill they without pay any fine or _ man-bote _ to the king as in the case of kill a free man as a rule however the slave be not badly treat and they be sometimes make free and give the right to acquire land in early day norway consist of a great number of small state call _ fylki _ each a little kingdom by itself the free peasant in a fylkus hold general assembly call _ thing _ where law be make and justice administer no public act be undertake without the deliberation of a _ thing _ the _ thing _ be sacred and a breach of peace at the _ thing-place _ be consider a great crime at the _ thing _ there be also a hallowed place for the judge or lag-man who expound and administer the law make by the _ thing _ almost every crime could be expiate by the payment of fine even if the accuse have kill a person but if a man kill another secretly he be declare a assassin and a outlaw be deprive of all he property and could be kill by any one who wish to do so the fine or man-bote be heavier the higher the rank of the person kill the _ thing _ or _ fylkis thing _ be not make up of representative elect by the people but be rather a primary assembly of the free udal-born peasant-proprietor of the district there be lead man in the _ fylkus _ and each _ fylkus _ have one or more chief but they have to plead at the _ thing _ like other free man when there be several chief they usually have the title of _ herse _ but when the free man have agree upon one chief he be call _ jarl _ -lrb- earl -rrb- or king the king be the commander in war and usually perform the judicial function but he support himself upon he own estate and the free peasant pay no tax the dignity of the king be usually inherit by he son but if the heir be not to the liking of the people they choose another no man however clear he right of succession would think of assume the title or power of a king except by the vote of the _ thing _ there he be present to the people by a free peasant and he right must be confirm by the _ thing _ before he could exert any act of kingly power the king have a number of free man in he service who have swear allegiance to he in war and in peace they be arm man keep in pay and be call _ hird-men _ or court-man because they be member of the king 's hird or court if they be brave and faithful they be often give high position of trust some be make _ lendermen _ -lrb- liegeman -rrb- or manager of the king 's estate it be but natural that the ancient norwegian should become warlike and brave man since they firm religious belief be that those who die of sickness or old age would sink down into the dark abode of hel -lrb- helheim -rrb- and that only the brave man who fall in battle would be invite to the feast in odin 's hall sometimes the earl or king would make war on they neighbor either for conquest or revenge but the time come when the country of the north with they poorly develop resource become overpopulated and the warrior have to seek other field abroad the vike cruise commence and for a long time the norwegian continue to harry the coast of europe at first the vike expedition be nothing but piracy carry on for a livelihood the name viking be suppose to be derive from the word _ vik _ a cove or inlet on the coast in which they would harbor they ship and lie in wait for merchant sail by soon these expedition assume a wider range and a wilder character and historian of the time paint the horror spread by the viking in dark color in the english church they have a day of prayer each week to invoke the aid of heaven against the harry northman in france the follow formulum be insert in the church prayer : _ a furore normannorum libera no o domine _ -lrb- free we o lord from the fury of the northman -rrb- gradually the vike life assume a nobler form there appear to have be three stage or period in the viking age in the first one the viking make casual visit with single ship to the shore of england ireland france or flander and when they have plunder a town or a convent they return to they ship and sail away in the second period they cruise assume a more regular character and indicate some definite plan as they take possession of certain point where they winter and from where they command the surrounding country during the third period they no longer confine themselves to seek booty but act as real conqueror take possession of the conquer territory and rule it as to the influence of the northman on the development of the country visit in this last period the eminent english writer samuel lae the translator of the _ heimskringlum _ or the saga of the norse king say : all that man hope for of good government and future improvement in they physical and moral condition -- all that civilized man enjoy at this day of civil religious and political liberty -- the british constitution representative legislation the trial by jury security of property freedom of mind and person the influence of public opinion over the conduct of public affair the reformation the liberty of the press the spirit of the age -- all that be or have be of value to man in modern time as a member of society either in europe or in the new world may be trace to the spark left burning upon we shore by these northern barbarian the authentic history begin with halfdan the swarthy who reign from the year 821 to 860 the icelander snorre sturlason who in the twelfth century write the _ heimskringlum _ or saga of the norse king give a long line of precede king of the yngling race the royal family to which halfdan the swarthy belong but that part of the saga belong to mythology rather than to history accord to tradition the yngling family be descendant of fiolner the son of the god frey one of the surname of the god be yngve from which the family derive the name yngling king halfdan be a wise man a lover of truth and justice he make good law which he observe himself and compel other to observe he fix certain penalty for all crime commit he code of law call the eidsiva law be adopt at a common _ thing _ at eidsvol where about a thousand year later the present constitution of norway be adopt one day in the spring of 860 when halfdan the swarthy be drive home from a feast across the randsfjord he break through the ice and be drown he be so popular that when he body be find the lead man in each _ fylkus _ demand to have he bury with they believe that it would bring prosperity to the district they at last agree to divide the body into four part which be bury in four different district the trunk of the body be bury in a mound at stien ringerike where a little hill be still call halfdan 's mound and this halfdan become the ancestor of the royal race of norway halfdan 's son harald the fairhair at the age of ten year succeed he father on the throne of norway or it afterward prove to be the throne of unite norway when he become old enough to marry he send he man to a girl name gyda a daughter of king erik of hordaland who be bring up a foster-child in the house of a rich _ bonde _ in valder harald have hear of she as a very beautiful though proud girl when the man deliver they message she answer that she would not marry a king who have no greater kingdom than a few _ fylki _ -lrb- district -rrb- and she add that she think it strange that no king here in norway will make the whole country subject to he in the same way that gorm the old do in denmark or erik at upsalum when the messenger return to the king they advise he to punish she for she haughty word but harald say she have speak well and he make the solemn vow not to cut or comb he hair until he have subdue the whole of norway which he do and become sole king of norway the decisive battle be a naval one in the hafrsfjord near the present city of stavanger after this battle which occur in 872 when he have be declare king of unite norway he attend a feast and the earl of more cut he hair which have not be cut or comb for ten year and give he the name of fairhaired harald shortly afterward marry gyda from this time on the history of norway for nearly three hundred year consist mainly in internecine warfare among the various claimant of the throne and the result of all this warfare be not only to exhaust the material resource of the people but to drive a large proportion of the population to make vike excursion to win land elsewhere and also to make peaceable settlement in other country iceland be settle by the lead man of norway in harald the fairhaired 's reign because they would not submit to he rule and therefore emigrate to a land where they could rule in 912 duke rollo with a large follow conquer normandy and settle there with many of he countryman as the result of over three century of foreign and domestic war norway and she people and she industry be prostrate when in 1389 queen margaret of denmark claim the succession to the throne of norway for she son eric of pomeranium the council of norway and the people be willing to accept a union with a more populous country under a powerful sovereign in order to obtain peace and reestablish order and prosperity norway have not be conquer by denmark and the union be suppose to be equal the danish sovereign however without directly interfere with the local law and usage of the people of norway fill all the executive and administrative office in norway with dane the important command in the army be also give exclusively to they the result be that the interpretation and execution of the law of the land be in the hand of foreigner and norway become and remain for four hundred year a province of denmark and unable to throw off the yoke because she army be in the control and command of she oppressor and she material resource inadequate to wage successful war against he like norway the most that we know of prehistoric time in sweden we gather from the early saga which be more or less faulty in they statement romantic and tragic though they be like the norwegian the early swede be report to have migrate from asia under the leadership of a chief who call himself odin and for century under different king and queen the romantic and tragic story of sweden go on to form at last she authentic history in this brief survey we can not go into detail and its history be very much the same as that of norway except that sweden be oftener she own mistress and at longer interval the source of swedish history during the first two century of the middle age be very meager this be a deplorable fact for during that period sweden pass through a great and thorough development the various stage of which consequently be not easily trace before the year 1060 sweden be a old teutonic state certainly of later form and larger compass than the earliest of such but with its democracy and its elective kingdom preserve the older sweden be in regard to its constitution a rudimentary union of state the realm have come into existence through the cunning and violence of the king of the sviar who make way with the king of the respective land make they community pay homage to he no change in the interior affair of the different land be thereby effect they lose they outward political independence but remain mutually on term of perfect equality they be unite only through the king who be the only center for the government of the union no province have constitutionally more importance than the rest no supremacy by one over the other exist on this historic basis the swedish realm be build and rest firmly until the commencement of the middle age in the old swedish state-organism the various part thus possess a high degree of individualized and pulsating life the empire as a whole be also powerful although the royal dignity be its only institution the king be the outward tie which bind the province together besides he there be no power of state which embrace the whole realm the affair of state be decide upon by the king alone as regard to war or he have to gather the opinion of the thing in each province as any imperial representation do not exist and be entirely unknown both in the modern sense and in the form of one provincial or sectional assembly decide for all the other in society there exist no class it be a democracy of free man the slave and free man enjoy no rights the first century of the middle age be one continue process of regeneration the swedish people be carry into the european circle of cultural development and make a communicant of christianity with the commencement of the thirteenth century sweden come out of this process as a medieval state in aspect entirely different to she past the democratic equality among free man have turn into a aristocracy with aristocratic institution the hereditary kingdom into a elective kingdom while the provincial particularism and independence have give way to the constitution of a centralized monopolistic state no change could be more fundamental the old provincial law of sweden be a great and important inheritance which this period have accumulate from heathen time the law be write down in the thirteenth and fourteenth century but they bear every evidence of high antiquity many strophe be find in they of the same meter as those on the tombstone of the viking age and those in which the song of the edda be chiefly write in other instance the text consist of alliterative prose which prove its earlier metrical form the expression have in place remain heathen although use by christian who be ignorant of they true meaning as for instance in the follow formulum of a oath in the west gothic law : _ sva se mer gud hull _ -lrb- so help I the god -rrb- in lieu of a missing literature of saga and poetry these provincial law give a good insight into the character moral custom and culture of the heathen and early christian time of sweden from the point of philology they be also of great value besides form the solid basis of later swedish law how the law could pass from one generation to another without any codification depend upon the fact that they be recite from memory by the justice -lrb- _ lag-man _ or _ domare _ -rrb- and that this dignity generally be inherit for century be carry by the descendant of one and the same family -lrb- a -rrb- chapter ii norway in the nineteenth century as early as 1790 negotiation take place between count armfeldt on behalf of gustavus iii of sweden and various patriotic and influential norwegian with a view to effect a union between norway and sweden on equal term but the norwegian negotiator express themselves unwilling to accept for norway the government prevail in sweden a minority of the patriot think that the danish yoke could only be break by means of a union with sweden while a majority aim at nothing less than absolute independence at any cost such be the condition of norway when by the treaty of kiel -lrb- jan 14 1814 -rrb- the ally compel the king of denmark to cede norway to sweden and make charle john bernadotte crown prince of sweden and norway the norwegian deny the right of denmark to norway refuse to recognize the treaty of kiel as have any binding force on they as they be not party to it and invite prince christian frederick of denmark to accept the norwegian throne from its people and to govern pursuant to a constitution adopt at eidsvold may 17 1814 among the provision of this instrument be the following : that norway should be a limited hereditary monarchy independent and indivisible whose ruler should be call a king that all legislative power should reside in and be exercise by the people through they representative that all tax should be levy by the legislative authority that the legislative and judicial authority should be distinct department that the right of free press should be maintain that no personal or hereditary distinction shall hereafter be grant to any one the election of a king and adoption of a independent constitution in disregard of the treaty of kiel be tatamount to a declaration of war against sweden and as such it be take after the treaty of pari and the abdication of napoleon the power agree to force norway to accept the treaty of kiel and representative of the ally power come to norway and demand its compliance on penalty of war with the ally the norwegian remain obdurate the swede under bernadotte march across the frontier and take the fortress fredricksteen another division of the swedish army be beat by the norwegian and drive back over the frontier several other engagement be fight and it become evident that norway could not be subdue without serious war sweden be exhaust by the war of the ally against napoleon and could ill endure more warfare on aug 14 1814 a armstice be declare and it be provide that a extraordinary storthing should be call to settle the term of permanent peace by the term finally agree upon bernadotte be elect king of norway under the title of charle xiii and he accept the norwegian constitution adopt at eidsvold may 17 1814 and agree to govern under and subject to its provision at the same time the supreme court of norway be establish in christianium the bank of norway be establish at thronedjem in 1816 at the death of charle xiii in 1818 charle john ascend the throne of both country as charle xiv john on several occasion there be friction between the king and the norwegian storthing at the treaty of kiel the king have promise that norway would assume a part of the norwegian-danish public debt but as the norwegian have never acknowledge this treaty they hold that it be not they duty to pay any part of the debt and declare besides that norway be not able to do so but as the power have agree to help denmark to enforce she claim a compromise be effect in 1821 by which the storthing agree to pay three million dollar the king relinquish he civil list for a certain number of year the same storthing adopt the law abolish the nobility in norway this step also be strongly oppose by charle john but as it have be adopt by three successive storthing the act under the constitution become a law in spite of any veto for a number of year there exist a want of confidence between the king and the norwegian people the king do not like the democratic spirit of the norwegian and the reactionary tendency of he european ally have quite a influence upon he action in 1821 he propose ten amendment to the constitution look to a increase of the royal power among which be one give the king a absolute instead of a suspensive veto another give he the right to appoint the president of the storthing and a third authorize he to dissolve the storthing at any time but these amendment meet the most ardent opposition in the storthing and be unanimously reject when the norwegian commence to celebrate the anniversary of the adoption of the constitution -lrb- may 17 -rrb- the king think he see in this a sign of a disloyal spirit because they do not rather celebrate the day of they union with sweden and he forbid the public celebration of the day the result of this be that independence day be celebrate with so much greater eagerness the student at the university especially take a active part under the leadership of that champion of liberty the poet henrik wergeland who die in 1845 the unwise prohibition be the cause of the market-place battle in christianium may 17 1829 when the troops be call out and general wedel disperse the crowd that have assemble in the market-place there be also dissatisfaction in norway because a swedish viceroy -lrb- statholder -rrb- be place at the head of the government and because they ship have to sail under the swedish flag the french July revolution of 1830 which start the liberal movement throughout europe also have its influence in norway liberal newspaper be establish at the capital and the democratic character of the storthing become more pronounced especially after 1833 when the farmer commence to take a active part in the election prominent among they be ole gabriel ueland the king be so displeased with the majority in the storthing of 1836 that he suddenly dissolve it but the storthing answer this action by impeach the minister of state lövenskiold for not have dissuade the king from take such a step lövenskiold be sentence to pay a fine the king then yield and reconvene the storthing he also take a step toward conciliate the norwegian by appoint they countryman count wedel-jarlsberg as viceroy this action be much appreciate in norway during the last year of this reign there exist the best of understanding between the king and the people charle john 's great benevolence tend to increase the affection of the people and he be sincerely mourn at he death march 8 1844 at the age of eighty year charle john be succeed by he son oscar i who very soon win the love of the norwegian one of he first act be to give norway she own commercial flag and other outward sign of she equality with sweden he father have always sign himself king of sweden and norway but king oscar adopt the rule to sign all document pertain to the government of norway as king of norway and sweden during the war between germany and denmark king oscar gather a swedish-norwegian army in scanium and succeed in arrange the armstice of malmoe in 1848 the war break out anew however the following year and he then occupy northern schleswig with norwegian and swedish troops pend the negotiation for peace between germany and denmark during the crimean war king oscar make a treaty with england and france -lrb- 1855 -rrb- by which the latter power promise to help sweden and norway in case of any attack from russium general contentment prevail during the happy reign of king oscar and the prosperity commerce and population of the country increase steadily these satisfactory condition do not however result in weaken the national feeling and the storthing in 1857 decline to promote a plan prepare by a joint swedish and norwegian commission look to a strengthening of the union after a sickness of two year during which he son crown prince charle have charge of the government as prince-regent king oscar i die in July 1859 at the age of sixty year he be marry to josephine of leuchtenberg daughter of napoleon 's stepson eugene beauharnai charle xv be thirty-three year old when he ascend the throne the progress in the material welfare of the country continue during he reign and like he father he be very popular with the norwegian numerous road and railroad be start all part of the country be connect by telegraph and the merchant marine grow to be one of the largest in the world in 1869 a law be pass provide for annual session of the storthing instead of triennial as heretofore charle xv die sept 18 1872 and have no son be succeed by he younger brother oscar ii the late ruler of sweden the storthing appropriate the necessary fund for the expense of the coronation at throndhjem -lrb- July 18 1873 -rrb- while the king sanction the bill abolish the office of statholder but soon difference between the storthing and the ministry bring on sharp conflict long before norway depose king oscar ii -lrb- June 7 1905 -rrb- disruption and war would doubtless have occur have it not be for the wisdom and tact of the king the last straw that break the camel 's back in this instance be the refusal of separate consular representation for norway the basis of this last demand be not mainly the commercial value to norway of have its distinct consul though this be a element but the right of norway as a nation entirely independent of sweden to be represent as such in its commercial relation with foreign nation sweden and norway be now not only two distinct nation but be competitor in trade and commerce norway 's shipping and carry trade far exceed that of sweden the norwegian have always be a seafaring people and norwegian sailor and marine be find in large number in the commercial marine and navy of all europe and america from the standpoint of norway common justice demand that norwegian merchant and sailor should like every other nation have they own consul to represent and protect they in foreign country not be able to secure the approval of the king for separate consular representation the storthing on June 7 1905 pass resolution declare the dissolution of the union between norway and sweden and that king oscar have cease to be the ruler of norway in the place of the king the storthing appoint the member of the norway council of state to act as a temporary government for the nation the storthing further declare that norway have no ill feeling against king oscar or he dynasty of sweden and ask the king to cooperate in select one of he own house to be king of norway the riksdag of sweden meet in extraordinary session June 21 1905 at the call of king oscar to consider the action of the norwegian storthing in declare the dissolution of the union between the two country the opening of the session be mark by the usual ceremonial pomp but also by a gravity and solemnity befitting the unusual occasion the emotional feeling be intense and repress with difficulty by both speaker and audience the king in he address to the riksdag maintain with dignity that he have act within he constitutional rights and that norway have not the power to dissolve the union which legally could be effect only by mutual consent nevertheless it be with great sadness that he now urge negotiation for the severance of the tie between the two nation believe that the union be not worth the sacrifice which act of coercion would entail the bill prepare by the government be immediately present to the riksdag it be of the same tenor as the king 's address and ask for authorization to negotiate with the norwegian storthing for the establishment of a common basis for the settlement of the question involve in the separation of the two kingdom the bill encounter strong opposition both in and out of the riksdag in the senate it be refer to a committee of nine anti-government member while in the lower house the composition of the corresponding committee be equally divide between the two oppose party with the addition of two independent member the riksdag authorize the government to negotiate a loan of $ 25000000 for work of defense and declare the harbor of stockholm karlskrona gothenburg and farosund to be war port from which all foreign naval vessel be to be exclude norway 's army be also mobilize and bring near the swedish boundary notwithstanding these warlike aspect a peaceful dissolution of the union between sweden and norway be finally effect the conference at karlstad between the representative of the two nation on sept 23 1905 draw up a protocol which become a treaty when subsequently ratify by the riksdag and the storthing on the ninth of the follow October thereupon sweden cancel the charter of 1815 which govern the union of the two country and king oscar declare norway to be again separate and independent thus be sever the political relation between two country which during a period of ninety year have lead to ever-increasing discord king oscar ii of sweden steadfastly refuse however to allow any prince of he house to be choose as the new king of norway and the choice finally fall upon prince charle of denmark who be elect by a overwhelming majority at the plebiscite hold throughout norway on nov 12 1905 he accept the throne offer he and be crown June 22 1906 the idea be prevalent that there be ill will between the norwegian and swedish people this be a popular misconception the norwegian and swedish people be racially very similar in character and habit and mutually respect each other king oscar be as beloved and honor in norway as he be in sweden and deservedly so the norwegian feel proud of he character life and statesmanship they appreciate he wisdom and moderation and give he full credit for he earnest conviction that he be right in he difference with the norwegian government and yet the dissolution be a blessing to both country concern so long as norway and sweden be unite under one king there would have be friction in like manner the long union between norway and denmark be a continuous source of irritation but after the dissolution they be the best of friend it have be suggest that russium have long have she eye on the ice-free harbor of the norwegian coast and have covet they that she have build she railroad across finland close up to the norwegian frontier and that there be trouble ahead for norway because she have isolate herself from sweden she natural protector but we see in the division a greater scandinavium there be now the three great scandinavian nation norway sweden denmark and it can be imagine that so close of kin any one of they would rush to arm in defense of the other a united norway and sweden under one king bring constant bickering a separate norway and sweden can be of mutual

have work with great activity they have take part in shape the first act of union of the north in June 1319 and from oslo in norway hasten to have magnus elect at the stone of mora where the swedish king since time immemorial be nominate the act of union stipulate that the two kingdom be to remain perfectly independent the king to sojourn a equally long part of the year in each with no official of either country to accompany he further than the frontier in they foreign relation the country be to be independent but to support each other in case of war the king be the only tie to bind they together there be another magnus whose candidacy be spoil by this union he be the son of king birger already as a child choose king of sweden in succession to he father magnus birgersson a prisoner at stockholm be behead in 1320 to make safe the reign of he more fortunate cousin king magnus be only three year old and drotsete mattias kettilmundsson preside over the government during he minority the noble of the state council have great power and influence both in sweden and norway the nobility have by this time attain a supremacy which be oppressive both to the king and the people not so much through they privilege as through the liberty they take they continual feud between themselves disturb the peace of the country in 1332 king magnus take charge of the government he be a ruler of benign and good disposition toward the common people whose interest he always further but he lack strength of character and be not able to control the obnoxious noble the province of scanium and

difficulty arise a unsuccessful crusade be attempt the black death come from england to norway in 1350 and spread with great rapidity and several other thing convene to fill the people with discontent so that the union with norway do not prove a happy one a separation be bring about in 1844 when haakon the younger son of magnus be make king of norway magnus remain in power until haakon come of age and he older son eric be choose king or heir-apparent of sweden it seem that this division have be preconceive by king magnus when he give this older son the swedish name of eric and to the younger the norwegian name of haakon both equally characteristic of the royal line of the respective country it be during the folkung period that there flourish one of the most remarkable and renowned of swedish woman st birgitta at the swedish court she be the highest functionary of queen blanche where she gather deep and strong indignation against the mighty and powerful world by some she be consider a reformer before luther because she insist on direct communication between the communicant and god without the mediation of priest or saint yet there be a difference between birgitta and luther because the latter seek to reform institution while the former would reform the upholder of the institution after the reign of magnus and he son there come for a brief season albrecht of

heroism and patriotism and bring into prominence those splendid warrior gustavus vas gustavus adolphus charle xii and other and the memorable battle of pultowa and other lesser engagement after this come a period of political grandeur under various ruler notably queen christine follow by what have be call the period of liberty or the aristocratic republic under queen ulrica eleonore when literature and the art and science flourish and swedenborg linnaeus dahlin tegnér and many other come into prominence one of the most love ruler of this period be gustavus iii by he influence a revolution similar to that in france be put down for which at a mask ball in the royal opera he be assassinate by conspiritor it be true historian tell we that he be superficial that he violate the law have no regard for a constitutional government and lead the people into adventurous and expensive war yet he noble patriotism frank heroism brilliant genius and great generosity compel the love of he countryman in this mixture of patriotism and universal cosmopolitanism true genius and superficiality earnestness and recklessness in the character of gustavus iii the swede recognize peculiarity of they own national temperament for which they love he dearly and tegnér have voice this love in a few line of he eulogy : there rest o'er gustav 's day a golden shimmer fantastic foreign frivolous if you please but why complain when sunshine cause the glamour where stand we now if it be not for these all culture on a unfree ground be build and barbarous once the base of patriotism true but wit be plant iron-hard language weld the song be raise life more enjoy and shield and what gustavian be be therefore swedish too on he death-bed gustavus iii appoint he brother charle and charle gustavus armfelt member of the government during the minority of he son gustavus iv adolphus be declare of age and take charge of the government when eighteen -lrb- in 1796 -rrb- he guardian retire and the new

but through lack of mental and physical strength he good quality be misdirect he father 's tragic fate have a sinister effect upon he mind the equilibrium of which be also shake by the outrage of the revolutionist in france of a morbid sensibility and without inclination to confide in any one he religious mysticism lead he into a state close to insanity he imagine himself to be the reincarnation of charle xii while in napoleon he recognize the monster of the apocalypse which he himself be send to fight and conquer he refuse any alliance with russium and denmark and stubbornly resist the friendship france wish to bestow by he imbecility he lose finland to the kingdom and be compel to abdicate in 1808 this lunatic monarch as he be call be escort out of the country with he family never to return and die in st gallin in 1837 under these condition we find sweden at the beginning of the nineteenth century when charle xiii be choose to succeed he nephew the abdicate gustavus iv adolphus charle xiii be one of the most unsympathetic of swedish king but he reign mark a new period in swedish history commence the era of constitutional government the new constitution to which the king

great day in sweden or at least in stockholm be the celebration on the 26th of July of the anniversary of the birth more than a century and a half ago of the national poet bellman he song be as household word throughout the land to the stockholm bear they speak of they daily life and surroundings of the green isle and shady bank of the malar the flowery wood of haga the smile park of dijurgarden burlesque scene of the life of the people street tragedy drink bout and country junketing broad humor and nature 's philosophy lively fancy and exquisite landscape painting -- such be the theme of he song which from one generation to another have hold the heart of the people spellbound every man woman and child know he favorite ditty by heart have sing or hum they in moment of joy or sorrow for he song be both joyful and sad he joy be the joy of the simple heart he gladness a dionysian gladness the very enjoyment of existence he sadness that of sympathy with suffer humanity of anguish at the evanescence of life and happiness he fancy oscillate between constant extreme and ever-recurring contrast it make of he song as tegnér have so aptly define it a sorrow deck in rose bright gay enraptured full of sunshine and glamour like the summer day around stockholm it be traverse by a strain of melancholy like a smile through tear the laugh which conceal a sob there be symbolism and there be parody in he rustic figure but they be so live so real they appeal so strongly to the innermost feeling that they seem the embodiment of one 's thought he picture be like those of the dutch painter : every trait in the rustic scene tell the life-story of some humble existence it be this characteristic which have make the poet appeal so powerfully to the mind of the people he seem to see with they eye and feel with they heart and to have experience all the vicissitude of they own life and yet he eminently reflect he own time the gay the light-hearted gustavian era with its classical fancy and rococo taste venus and bacchus the nymph and the dryad hebe and amor be mix up incongruously with the homely scene of scandinavian life he dutch picture assume then a watteau-like coloring of extraordinary effect as fancy and contrast enhance the sharp outline of he figure and give they vitality still greater relief they be so lifelike and so various that the whole of the every-day life of sweden and more especially of stockholm of the eighteenth century be unrolled before we eye it be say that if every other book descriptive of the period be to fail he verse would suffice to inform we how the middle class then live thought and feel around the poet 's monument -- he bust in bronze on a white marble column -- there gather on the anniversary of he birth the crowd who love he and love he song every heart beat high as the bellman choir burst forth in turn into the well-known melody compose or adapt by the poet himself to he word and sing by he to the accompaniment of he lute and song alternate with enthusiastic oration address to the crowd by improvise orator teem with quotation of well-known line it be a orgy of bellman 's verse such as the stockholmer specially delight in bellman 's song generally form a sequence a continuous chain of lyrical romance he _ fredman 's epistle _ be a sort of epic cycle of lyric this be a form often adopt by swedish poet we find it in tegnér 's _ frithiof 's saga _ in runeberg 's _ saying of sergeant stal _ and in the work of other poet it be a question however whether even by these master singer in they more elaborate conception and genial flight of poetry bellman have ever be surpass in lyric power and vivid realism he popular ditty be unrivaled the next to incarnate the genius of the scandinavian race be tegnér he love of brave deed and reckless adventure and he exaltation of the man of action above the man of thought be typical he hero fair-haired and blue-eyed stalwart and vigorous rely on strength and longing for adventure tender-hearted and contemplative when not arouse to violent action and bent on deed of valor personify the national ideal he whole vision of life be scandinavian bright and vivid with a tinge of melancholy tegnér be with geijer and ling the first to adopt national subject to use the scandinavian myth and folk-lore in they poetry in opposition to the classical theme and the hellenic mythology until then exclusively in vogue in the poetical field geijer be a romantic by nature in politics as well as in literature but he be above all a ardent scandinavian oppose to exotic and passionately devote to the great tradition of the past a hero-worshiper a enthusiast and a _ goth _ the goth be member of a society form to revive the old national manners and custom the freedom of the age of the viking and the ardor of the hero of walhallum they organ be the _ idun _ a exclusively literary publication in a letter write by geijer from stockholm

name and live in the past and anna-lisa he future wife write to a friend say : my _ fiancee _ have become a goth instead of loving I he be in love with valkyry and shield-bearing maiden drink out of vike horn and carry out vike expedition -- to the nearest tavern he write poem which must not be read in the dark they be so full of murder and deed of slaughter ling who also belong to this society be a fervent admirer of the edda and saga of the scandinavian myth and folk-lore tegnér despite he classical education and hellenic turn of mind be a ardent norseman in feeling and instinct go to greece for beauty of form he would say but to the north for depth of feeling and think he scorn alike the metaphysical subtlety of french philosophy and the moonshine heroics of german romanticism but he be at one with geijer and ling in the desire to make scandinavian hero and myth the subject of poetry the result of the movement be _ frithiof 's saga _ by tegnér geiger 's _ vike _ and ling 's heavy epic of walhallum warrior but geijer and ling alone have follow out the theory in all its consequence they hero be simply _ eddic _ of they time in spirit and in think ling 's realism go so far that he northern god and warrior everlastingly kill but to revive again be deem pork-eating and mead-drinking yokel they be soon forget and ling himself be best know as the inventor of gymnastic exercise on scientific principle a art now practice all the world over as swedish gymnastics geijer whose _ vike _ give a pure and true picture of vike life see in its own light be himself disappointed he abandon poetry and take to history though tegnér say of he that if he have devote himself to poetry he would have surpass all he contemporary as historian he rise to the highest rank and he be perhaps the greatest historian sweden have ever produce tegnér have modernize he hero and heroine in _ frithiof 's saga _ he give they vike garb and surroundings but modern thought and sentiment by the more copious development of the inner life and by place woman on a equality with man love have receive a higher meaning and he poetry unfold inspiration unknown to the ancient world such as melancholy and the love of nature he do no more than tennyson do later in making of king arthur the type of a english gentleman frithiof and ingeborg be representative of the national ideal the success of he poem be immense it have a lyrical intensity which set the scandinavian mind vibrate unmindful of the anachronism youth glory in the noble disinterestedness of frithiof in he generosity to he rival he melancholy philosophising and he high-minded love as well as in he daring and he love of adventure manly breast heave in sympathy with he and woman 's tear flow at the story of ingeborg 's love as the poet snolisky have say -- from the highest to the lowest throughout the land the poet have create a bond of union in every home within every school door he verse be read and con and love and sweden 's youth feel its cheek glow at frithiof 's courage and manly mood while ingeborg 's love to the maiden 's dream give life and thought to she weave and sew in he _ child of the lord 's supper _ so beautifully translate for we by longfellow tegnér convey a true image of sweden 's religious life the scene in the country church deck out with flower and evergreen for the solemn ceremony the rustic boy and girl bow and curtsey as they make they response before the assemble congregation and the attitude and word of the patriarchal pastor be all true to life the somewhat declamatory tone of the oration be not less consistent with the character of the rural parson the trend of swedish religious thought and the solemnity associate with these occasion it be in he patriotic war-song however that tegnér rouse the greatest enthusiasm he _ svea _ he dithryambic declamation _ king charle _ and he _ scanean reserve _ send a thrill through young and old when _ svea _ be read at the swedish academy which award the poem its gold medal the friend and opponent of tegnér alike be move to undisguised admiration in breadth and intrinsic power and in the beauty of its rythm which seem to echo the clash of arm and the march of mass this poem be unequalled in swedish literature tegnér 's name soon become known far beyond the limit of the land where he language be understand he work be translate into almost all modern tongue so that some fifty different translation of the whole or part of he poem now exist in eleven european language a new feature be introduce into swedish poetry by runeberg although bear of swedish parent he be bring up in finland he mind be nurture in the tradition and the mixed racial influence of he new fatherland thus he breathe a new spirit and a new inspiration draw from the reality of life into poetical fiction he be a realist in the best sense of that much-misused word he seek he ideal _ in _ life instead of outside of it and above it in imaginary creation he see nature such as it be with all its fault and sublimity and love it with a true poet 's devotion he paint it simply and faithfully without aim at ennoble it but seek and find what there be of native dignity in its humblest expression in he lyrical poem _ the saying of sergeant stal _ he portray incident of the war of finland fighting by the side of sweden in 1809 when the country be conquer by russium it be a series of war picture a collection of hero type paint in live color and breathe the most ardent patriotism -- simple tale tell by a sergeant of he recollection of the war they deal with real personage most of they draw from the humblest station in life describe just as they really live and speak and act yet throughout the story of they simple act and thought there sweep a breeze which kindle the blood rouse the emotion and fire the patriotic feeling of runeberg 's contemporary in poetic depth and beauty of language as in style and conception and in they departure from all the prevail idea and method of romanticism these lyric tale be a revelation they class they author at once as in the line of true-born poet the work of runeberg although properly belong to the literature of a country politically no longer one with sweden have from the nature of they subject and the identity of language always be look upon in sweden as common property and they have certainly exercise a powerful influence on swedish thought and letter some of he song set to music be to this day sing as national anthem the last champion of die romanticism be a sort of universal genius eccentric _ bizarre _ unequal a spirit out of harmony with itself but gifted with the most wonderful imagination and power kjl almquist he life be as checquered as he writings be various in turn a clergyman a schoolmaster a journalist and a exile he have write volume on almost every conceivable subject from fiction poetry and history to lexicography pedagogy and mathematics he story publish in two series under the common title of _ the book of the hedgerose _ show power of conception imagination and description such as be only to be

and vent he moral skepticism in bitter sarcasm and cut paradox but two thing be white in this world he would say innocence and arsenic the coupling of the two however nearly prove fatal to he he be involve in a mysterious affair of poisoning in which the victim be a dunning creditor he be suspect of have give he arsenic by way of rid himself of the debt which he could not pay no proof of the fact could be adduce and the crime be never bring home to he but public opinion be against he and fear or distrust the justice of he country he flee from it ere the case be try he wander over europe and america try he hand at everything and die a literary wreck in germany longing and yet not daring to return to he country lately the society of author in stockholm judge that he crime be not prove

thinker and a wonderfully versatile writer the last of the romantic he have be call a realist a psychologist and a symbolist and he be certainly something of all these half a century before the term become battle-cry in literature and come to designate literary school one critic have make he out to have be a sort of forerunner of ibsen while another call he the most modern of classic he genius place he in advance of he age in most thing he be the first in the list of those scandinavian revolutionist who have lay out new landmark in the field of thought and introduce new method in fiction and the drama liberalism which spread like wildfire over europe after its outbreak in the July revolution in france reach sweden soon after it be represent in literature by such man as sturzen-becker wetterbergh and strandberg writing under the name of orvar odd uncle adam and talis-qualis blanche who write stir novel in the style of eugene sue hjerta and the staff of the then newly found _ aftonbladet _ who be revolutionize the press the press be begin to enlist the highest literary capacity of the country gradually become what it now be a purveyor not only of news but of thought and a leader of opinion in literature and art in science and philosophy in poetry liberalism find its echo in the verse of malmström nybom schlstedt in fiction its banner be carry by three woman two of whom -- well know in england and america -- frederica bremer whose novel portray the home life of the middle class emelie carlen who idealized the fisherman and sea-faring folk of the west coast and sophie von knorr who give rather stilted description of life in aristocratic circle all three be very productive and they novel count by dozen yet they fail to sustain the reputation they first work have win for they verner von heidenstam be now foremost among the writer of he country he early work _ endymion han alienus _ and other raise he to this rank and he last two production _ the caroline _ -lrb- the companion of charle xii -rrb- and _ saint brigitt _ have more than confirm it _ han alienus _ be like goethe 's _ faust _ a work of deep philosophical research into the problem of existence the purpose and significance of life set forth in symbolical image and explain by allegory in the _ caroline _ a series of short story connect by the red thread of history which run through they he give a new conception but a wonderfully graphic and striking one of charle xii and he time it be a epic and yet so live and so human a picture of the wild iron-souled quick-tempered hero whose eye fly around like two search bee and whose will be like the steel of he sword who have the heart of a lion and a woman 's hatred for woman but for whom man shed they blood freely who never grieve over a misfortune longer than the darkness last and be best love by those who try to hate he he picture be draw by a master hand and with the intuitive coloring of genius _ saint brigitt _ carry we back to medieval sweden here too the picture be lifelike centered round the struggle of a high-minded woman who make everything bend to she stern rule of holiness she thirst for sanctity as charle xii do to he inexorable policy and thirst for dominion the psychological and the historical novel the latter in its modern conception akin to the former since it be a study of the psychology of historical character and a historical epoch be the form of fiction at present most in vogue it be in this form that such writer as tor hedberg per hallström and axel lundegard have make they reputation tor hedberg 's romance embody profound analysis of the inner workings of the soul of the secret motive which more or less consciously determine a man 's act in this line he venture on the most difficult psychological problem in he _ juda _ a scriptural romance from which he have draw a drama he attempt to solve the darkest psychological enigma that have puzzle humanity viz to analyze the motive which lead juda to betray he master and become the typical traitor the character he draw of he be original and striking and depart entirely from the accept tradition but bold and subtle as the theory be it be far from convince he juda be a dark brooding spirit fierce and inharmonious divide between extatic love and admiration of he master and inward irresistible force of hatred and revolt : a double nature thirst for freedom and love yet predestine to evil and lead by fearful secret impulse to the accomplishment of he destiny and the fulfilment of he mission necessary to the scheme of salvation he rush blindly to he fate while struggle in vain to escape it but in the very act of betrayal while obey the command : what thou doest do quickly he better nature triumph for one instant and he fall on the neck of he master and embrace he it be the juda kiss which betray he lord the last look of jesus however show he that he have be understand and forgive the detestation of humanity to the end of the world will be he expiation but that look of jesus have free he woman represent by writer like ellen key selma lagerlöf sophie elkau alfhild agress hilma stanberg and other hold a high position in swedish letter ellen key be a essayist of virile power and argumentative breadth of superior intellect and unfailing erudition she be a fearless and unfailing champion of free thought individualism and woman 's emancipation as be say of madame de staël she writings be the most masculine production of the faculty of woman selma lagerlöf occupy as a novelist a position of she own she style and she manner in fiction be unique symbolism and allegory be blended in it with the most realistic picture of everyday life she think in parable and describe reality and the reality convey the moral teaching of parable with something of the peculiar power of george eliot in the delineation of character she make each humble life preach some great moral truth she latest book _ jerusalem _ be one of extraordinary fascination create quite a sensation in sweden and place selma lagerlöf quite among the foremost writer of the day it may in general be say of swedish writer that they have a high idea of they call few if any have accept as they sole function the idealization of form they hold mostly that the highest aim of art should be to teach and elevate to destroy prejudice and conventionality and indicate in so far as it be possible the solution of moral problem through the creative faculty of inspired productiveness the wish to inculcate action the energy that be bear of enthusiasm the chivalry that be inspire by high ideal and unselfish motive raise thus from the region of mere chronicle of human passion of woman 's frailty and man 's baseness and exercise themselves with the political social and religious problem of the day these work of imagination have become alongside the press a powerful factor in the development of modern thought -lrb- f -rrb- chapter vii government and politics of norway and sweden only for the past three year have norway have a independent political life and so few change in local government have so far be make under the new king that it will be profitable in this chapter to take up the government and political life as it exist under the unite constitutional monarchy of norway and sweden in fact it be no different than at that time except that each have its separate king in internal rule the two country be always separate except in matter that pertain to the common weal of both thus the swedish minister of foreign affair have charge of the unite kingdom and as previously state this be the rock on which the union finally split the constitution of norway like that of the united state invest all power in the people who be represent by they legislature and they judiciary with the king as a executive to administer the law pass by the one and enforce the decree of the other when the two house of parliament disagree upon a measure they sit in joint session when it require a vote of two-third to enact it and the approval of the king be necessary he be also require to promulgate all the act of the legislature many norwegian statesman assert that the king have no veto power but merely temporary authority to suspend a law pend the action of the people if three successive parliament after three successive election pass a bill in exactly the same term it do not require the sanction of the king when it be pass the fourth time thus the people may exercise they sovereignty all edict of the executive all decision of the court and all resolution of the legislature be proclaim in the king 's name but the ministry be responsible to the legislature for the act of the king and if they be not approve as in england the ministry must resign and a new one be organize in sympathy with a majority of the parliament the king may choose he own minister but they must represent the will of the people they be call counsellor of state be

remain silent be count in the affirmative no matter of business can be determine by the king without the advice of the ministry unless a emergency demand a prompt decision when he must take the responsibility of secure a ratification of he act in the same manner the king may issue edict of a provisional character in matter of commerce finance industrial activity custom due police and military affair during a recess of the parliament subject to its approval within a limited time after reassemble the minister may act in the king 's name in case of emergency or during he absence from the country subject to he approval these condition be adopt in earlier time when the norwegian legislature sit only once in three year and some such power be necessary but now that there be annual and often semi-annual session and they have a king of they own reside always in norway it be very seldom necessary for the executive power to exercise such responsibility the king appoint all the official of the executive part of the government all the officer of the army and navy and all the clergyman in the established church but exercise this power through he minister dissent congregation be not subject to government control and may choose they own clergyman although the latter be require to register a oath of allegiance and a pledge to obey the law of the nation and fulfill they duty with fidelity and conscientiousness the king be the head of the established church which be the lutheran he be also commander-in-chief of the army and navy but can not increase or decrease the military establishment without the approval of the parliament he have the right to declare war and conclude peace but can not expend money for military purpose not even for the national defense without the consent of the legislature the norwegian constitution be silent concern he authority to conclude treaty with foreign power and the question have never be raise he conduct negotiation through he minister and submit the result of they labor for the approval of parliament he have the power to suspend the collection of custom duty temporarily until the parliament can meet to consider the matter but it have very rarely be exercise the parliament be call the storthing and be compose of one hundred and fourteen representative thirty-eight from the town and seventy-six from the rural district it

parish which form a election district assemble at a give place and time and select delegate to a convention which choose they representative in the storthing and when the storthing meet its one hundred and fourteen member select one-fourth of they own member generally the most experienced and distinguished man to constitute a senate or upper chamber call the lagthing which exercise a sort of supervisory power over legislation the storthing sit for about six month every year the member be pay $ 3 a day during the session and they travel expense the preside officer be choose every four week and can not succeed himself without a interval the committee be appoint by a selection committee elect by ballot and each committee choose he own chairman there be a rather novel rule require bill refer to committee to be assign for consideration to the several member in rotation any member may introduce a bill modify the constitution but all other class or measure must proceed from the government and the member of the lower house member of the upper house or lagthing be not permit to propose ordinary legislation on the theory that they should remain unprejudiced so as to exercise a judicial revision thus bill must originate in the odelsthing which have pass they send they to the lagthing for its approval the financial officer of the government and the director of the national bank be elect by the storthing which appoint a committee every six month to revise and audit the account of official who have to do with the disbursement or collection of money when a irregularity or improper expenditure be discover the legislature be ask to decide whether the minister in charge of the department shall repay the sum from he own pocket and repair the damage that have be cause by

ludicrously modern about the creation of norway 's new king not that it be the first time a sovereign have be so to speak custom-made a eligible foreign prince be tender a seat upon a ancient throne the form be old but the spirit how new republican though she be to the backbone norway have elect to be govern by monarchical method fear with she isolate and primitive peasantry to put the machinery of control into the hand of the people themselves she must have a king but he shall be of a new variety in short a republican king she will not even have he address as be the monarch of old by the norwegian equivalent of you majesty he shall be just _ herre konge _ plain mister the king even as the norwegian welcome haakon vii to they shore they take pain to show he clearly he rightful place in he address deliver to the newly arrive sovereign on board the battleship heimdal herr michelsen president of council and for six month virtual president of norway use these significant word : for nearly six century the norwegian people have have no king of they own to-day a king of norway come to make he home in the norwegian capital elect by a free people to occupy conjointly with free man the first place in the land the norwegian people love they liberty they independence and they autonomous government which they themselves have win it will be the glory of the king and he highest pleasure to protect this sentiment find he support in the people themselves this be why the norwegian people hail you to-day with profound joy and cry ` long live the king and queen of norway ' be ever so frank a bargain drive with a king before behold say norway in effect you may sit on a throne but beware how you attempt to king it over we we will give you a salary to transact we official business and act as official figurehead but you must never overlook the fact that it be we who make you and not you yourself be it any wonder that when ask to undertake to govern a people so independent so proud spirited as this prince karl of denmark take time to think or that he ask for a popular vote that he might know how large a proportion of the _ freus _ people of norway really want he for a king this be not the only reason why he hesitate be himself on he mother 's side a bernadotte he could scarcely ascend the norwegian throne without the friendly sanction of sweden moreover he wife princess maud of england be more than reluctant to undertake life in christianium and the duty of queenship lastly prince charle himself run a shrewd risk in assume the crown lest should he relation with norway become difficult he might be force to resign and find himself -- have abandon he naval career for the throne -- in a state of abject poverty all three objection be finally overrule sweden fear lest a empty throne in norway should give impetus to the movement for a republic and that such a movement might afterward spread to she own border be as much in haste to see norwegian affair settle as the norwegian themselves so she swallow she grievance most amicable correspondence pass between prince karl and the crown prince of sweden the latter express himself anxious to be the first to welcome haakon vii into he capital what become of princess maud 's reluctance be not definitely know it be understand that she never find life at the danish court very amusing and probably the prospect of exchange copenhagen for a city of less than half its size do not allure she she must have realize that if she accept a share of the norwegian throne she would be force to abandon she favorite cure for _ ennui _ -- frequent flight to the court of england -- for norway have have quite enough of absentee royalty the english papers assert that king edward use he parental authority to overcome he daughter 's scruple at all event she give in as for prince karl 's reasonable fear of dethronement and penury the norwegian government quiet that by promise a respectable pension in case the king should find it expedient to abdicate so then the affair be comfortably arrange the king have a salary of $ 200000 a crown when he have no hope of ever feel one on he brow and the problem of a court without a nobility and now the world be ask have norway do well for herself certainly she have do well in put a scandinavian prince on the throne no alien would ever understand norway or be understand if report be creditable the kaiser make the most of he friendship with the country in support of the claim of a son of he own have a german secure the throne there would have be sow fresh seed of discord on a peninsula which can raise a sufficient crop of dissension without any aid from the rest of europe for denmark still nurse the rankle grievance of the schleswig-holstein affair detest the thought of everything german king haakon combine the advantage of scandinavian birth with the very positive political asset of blood relationship to half the court of europe grandson of the late king christian of denmark the young monarch be also nephew to king george of greece the dowager empress of russium and alexandrium of england a grand-nephew to the late oscar of sweden son-in-law to king edward vii and cousin to the czar to a relatively defenseless country like norway this mean a good deal in himself the new king be a clean-lived healthy young man of thirty-three in personality quite fit to represent a nation which think well of itself tall though not quite so tall as he uncle prince christian whose mark on the famous old royal measuring-column at roskilde come just under that of the giant peter the great king haakon be slight yet vigorous-looking and splendidly well set up the face while scarcely so handsome as the profile picture lead we to think be a distinguished one and have for norway this charm that it be markedly not of the bernadotte type although he mother be a bernadotte those who know he describe he as a extremely intelligent and sensible young man easy and tolerant without be weak and capable of strenuous devotion to hard work these thing bespeak a industrious efficient and tractable king such as the norwegian who would equally resent either vacillation or tyranny know how to appreciate it have be say in france that king haakon abandon tiller and compass for crown and scepter without one hour 's training in politics or diplomacy the statement appear incontestable in view of the remarkable longevity of the late king of denmark and the excellent health and prospects of the crown prince and he immediate heir this younger son of a royal house be not bring up to look for a crown instead he be destine from the outset for a naval career for all that it be not safe to say that he have have no training in politics or diplomacy one can scarcely grow up in the family of the father-in-law of europe and not learn the principle of the great game of world affair king haakon be no stranger to the queer old palace among the beech at fredensborg where every summer king christian gather together he child and grandchild and great-grandchild from the court of england russium denmark sweden and greece and where conversation take place which if report would vitally interest the whole round world in he lifetime the czar alexander iii be particularly fond of hold long talk at fredensborg with he nephew karl then a lieutenant of the navy whom he find especially intelligent and open-minded it be think in copenhagen that king haakon may even during the last year of he father 's life have have some experience in the government of denmark since he father the crown prince be call upon to perform many of the old king 's duty at least if he do not actually transact royal business he acquire no small acquaintance with the working of government machinery nothing certainly could have be more fitting than that a ruler of vikingland should be educate for the sea nor could anything have be devise better calculate to knock the nonsense out of a princeling than apprenticeship in the danish navy hrolf wisby who mess with prince karl when he be a naval cadet say that the lad be at first little more than a piece of court furniture any one who be familiar with the appalling frankness and unvarnished brusquerie of grown-up dane can judge whether the hazing and horse-play on a danish man-of-war be agreeable and whether it be medicinal in a case of congenital self-esteem prince karl live the life of a ordinary middy scrubbed deck mend he own clothes sleep in a hammock and eat provender which be anything but fit to set before a king it be record of he that he be a expert in polish a certain brass binnacle lantern we wonder if he ever think now of a certain line in pinafore i polish that handle so care-ful-lee that now -- as ensign second lieutenant first lieutenant and finally captain of a frigate the young man acquit himself well earn the reputation of a capital officer hardwork careful no martinet towards he man though by no means to be trifle with in practical seamanship he excel any other prince of he age and can command any kind of naval craft from torpedo boat to battleship and lead in actual battle in form they court king haakon and queen maud be gather about they the literary artistic and musical people of the realm for they be devote to the companionship of gifted folk the queen have herself write play under the pseudonym graham irving and the king paint a little in aquarelle and play the piano almost too well to be term a amateur both be accomplished linguist speak with discrimination french german russian english norwegian swedish and naturally danish there be no barrier of speech in they intercourse with member of the diplomatic corps the little heir apparent alexander rechristen olaf have already do much toward ingratiate himself with the norwegian people although but a half dozen year old on the day when the royal couple enter christianium the boy be but two and a half year old but he be very much interested in the decoration and seem to catch the enthusiasm of the crowd for he wave he little hand spontaneously in count up the merit of the king the promising little heir must by no means be leave out trondhjem cathedral where all the king and queen of norway for century have be crown and where the coronation of king haakon vii and queen maud occur stand on the site of what be undoubtedly the first christian church in the country -- that erect by olaf trygvason in 996 within its confines bubble the spring which spring from the tomb of that later olaf who be the patron saint of norway and somewhere under its wall lie molder the bone of medieval king four of whom accept they consecration before the altar where king haakon receive he crown it be a thousand pity that hammer and chisel should have exorcise the spirit which ought to haunt this venerable shrine it be as if england 's abbey have be scrub and resurface and new nose have be provide for all the crumble stone king and queen trondhjem cathedral have burn down so many time and the work of restoration have be so sweeping that it take a active imagination to invest it with the proper glamour of romance trondhjem itself be a odd place for festivity the people say that it be fear of fire which make they separate they insignificant wooden house by such disproportionately broad street certainly it give to the town a low look anything but impose whatever may be the esthetic shortcoming of king haakon 's coronation city it be amply atone for by the enthusiasm and whole-hearted devotion of he new people the king and queen be in very truth the father and mother of the land even toward the ruler they share with sweden they cherish warm affection until they grievance wax too sore when sophie of nassau be on she way to trondhjem to be crown in 1873 she drive herself in a carriole from the romsdal stop perforce at humble posting-station by the way and everywhere the peasant come with flower greet they queen by the affectionate and familiar du more than once when the press be thick about she and those on the outskirts could not see the queen be urge to mount upon the housetop that the eye of all might be gladden by the sight of the dear land-mother there be a significant demonstration of this sort of heart-loyalty when haakon vii and queen maud enter christianium the crowd which wait in the steadily fall snow and shout themselves hoarse might be account for by curiosity and mob enthusiasm triumphal arch flag and even the rain of flower which descend on the royal pair might be class as perfunctory a essential part of the occasion but at night the spirit of the people show beyond mistake not only be the street arch and border with festoon of color incandescent light not only be the battleship in the harbor string with fiery bead to the topmost spar but every window in every house in the city bear its light fine house have candelabrum behind the glass and the poorest mere taper but everywhere the same fire of welcome burned haakon vii have the privilege of ruling over the most united people on the face of the earth before the plebiscite sweden declare that the desire for separation be confine to a party who be poisoning the mind of the common people when the plebiscite have show that only 164 man out of 368000 could be find to uphold the union sweden protest that the peasant have be intimidate and dare not vote as they think now it be just at this stir time that i be drive through norway or cruise in she fjord and talk with graduate of she university with sea-captain hotel proprietor travel man porter driver serving-maid -- all in short who speak english enough to make themselves clear it be as if all norway speak with one voice from hamerfest to stavanger there be the same complaint of the same wrong the same quiet insistence upon the same remedy nor be it only the subject of king oscar who speak norwegian settle in france in england or in america either hurry home to vote or send they vigorous endorsement of the revolutionary proceedings a window in christianium be completely fill by the mingled flag of norway and the united state cross by a banner bear the word for disunion it be the voice of norway and america it be a modest desire they express in the word of olaf sprachehaug we humble-minded _ skydsgut _ the whole country be say and now i t ` ink we get a king of we own they have they own king now and all the world wish they joy in he -lrb- j -rrb- chapter xi the royal family of sweden the present reign family of sweden be too young to be very numerous and in this brief survey it be well to begin with a bit of information about that grand democratic monarch oscar ii pass away less than two year ago how the bernadotte dynasty be form have already be show in a previous chapter and something of the king who succeed the former field marshal of france have also be relate so that we have in these few page simply to deal with oscar ii the late king and he four son and they family oscar 's grandfather the originator of the bernadotte dynasty be still on the throne when he be bear in 1829 as the third son of crown prince oscar and the beautiful josephine of leuchtenberg he seem far remove from the throne then and thus he find freedom to develop himself more in keep with he individual taste and inclination another factor to be bear in mind be the character of he governor and principal instructor the historian ff carlson who give to he pupil a fondness for scientific exactness as well as a insight into the true cause of civilizatory development find none too frequently in professional thinker and hardly ever in prince the thing that draw he most strongly in those day be the sea and music one of the foremost of swedish composer af lindblad teach he the latter while he fondness for the former be richly satisfy during the year when he work he way through the rank of the swedish navy and he position on board the various man-of-war 's - man in which he travel on many sea be never merely ornamental or even exceptional he take not only the title but also the work of the office he hold from midshipman to admiral it be characteristic of he too that when he marry he do so out of love on a tour through several country in 1856 he be fortunate enough to meet princess sophium of nassau the courtship be brief and ardent within a few month occur the engagement and the wedding follow in less than a year to the last that royal couple remain strongly devote to each other in spite of widely differ taste and temperament she have all she life be intensely religious with a strong lean toward pietism and illness have still further develop this inborn tendency he on the other hand be always gay light-hearted fond of merriment and give to many pleasure and pursuit which he spouse could only look upon as far too worldly duke oscar frederick as he be know in those early day find himself heir to the throne after death have unexpectedly remove the two claimant with rights prior to he own and on the succession of he eldest brother he become the crown prince it be a delicate position which impose on he a reserve foreign to he nature as it contrast sharply with the unceremonious jollity of he brother king charle he come by degree to be regard by those ignorant of he true character with a distrust border on dislike thus when the succession fall to he in 1872 he find himself little understand and less love it take he year to overcome the prejudice perhaps it be he sanction of the impeachment proceedings by the norwegian radical against the retire conservative ministry which in the early ' 80 's first serve to turn the trend of public opinion in he favor both in sweden and norway that act be one of the many by which he show he ability to submit he own inclination to the demand of the people without become a mere tool in the hand of any one political party about the same time he succeed in bring about a deeply need and by himself long-cherished reform of the popular educational system in sweden previously -- it be in fact he first important step after he ascension to the throne -- he have on he own initiative proclaim full freedom of worship for person not belong to the established church a scandinavianism of the purely sentimental kind -- the kind that talk without ever dream of put the talk into deed -- have prevail until then on the peninsula intermix with it be a equally sentimental sympathy with france though himself the grandson of a frenchman and still keenly devote to french literature and art king oscar have the foresightedness to recognize that the interest of the country be more closely bind up with those of germany and one of the most striking feature of he reign be the grow cultural intercourse between the nation in the north and they neighbor south of the baltic and while the king discourage the speech-making empty scandinavianism against which ibsen be fond of launch he most vitriolic invective he foster instead a fellow-feeling between sweden norway and denmark that find its expression in practical co-operation in the equalization of commercial and industrial regulation in the break down of as many as possible of the unnecessary barrier between they as the year pass on and the trend of he labor become understand and appreciate he find a part of he reward in a steadily increase respect for he throughout the civilized world a respect that repeatedly find expression in request that he act as arbiter of international difference he have always be fond of travel and this fondness he continue to indulge up to the last unlike those of some other monarch have a similar taste he coming and going on the continent be always the object of pleasant and welcome comment if gossip have to name king christian of denmark the father-in-law of all europe king oscar be surely the friend of all the world apace with he own fame grow the prosperity of he people on either side of the kjölen he reign mark a era of unprecedented economical social and spiritual progress which not even the internal dissension of the sister nation could interrupt king oscar 's motto be _ brödrafolkens väl _ the brother-people weal the scandinavian peninsula be still populate by brother-people as be indicate at the time of the death of the old king it be the week for the distribution in norway of the nobel prize always attend in christianium with great rejoicing and merry-making on this occasion all demonstration be prohibit and the norwegian capital be almost as much in mourning as be stockholm though entirely devote to the new order of thing the norwegian do not forget nor will they forget the character of the king who rule they for a generation more democratic than the swede they be peculiarly attach personally if not politically to one whom they feel to be really of like democratic instinct with themselves even if he do show himself every inch a king not only as a ruler but as a father king oscar be both wise and fortunate four son come to he through he marriage and these have prove man of he own type the crown prince gustave be bear just one year after the marriage of he parent on June 16th at the castle of drottingholm in the year 1858 prince oscar know as prince bernadotte be bear on nov 15 1859 at stockholm prince carl on feb 27 1861 also at stockholm while the youngest prince eugene like he eldest brother first see the light at the castle of drottingholm on aug 1 1865 as have be previously state the crown prince -lrb- now king -rrb- be marry to the princess victorium of bade granddaughter of emperor william i of germany and great-granddaughter of the exile gustavus iv of sweden the third son prince carl be wed to he cousin the princess ingeborg of denmark which be a source of great satisfaction to king oscar and queen sophie the youngest son prince eugene be devote to art and spend much time out of the country never do king oscar do more to win the approval of he subject and think man and woman everywhere than when he permit the marriage of he second son prince oscar to a young swedish noblewoman fröken ebba munck of fulkilum who be also queen sophie 's maid-of-honor while the prince have to renounce he right of succession and he position as a royal prince of sweden he relation to he father and the other member of the royal family remain the same of this incident in the history of the royal family of sweden the follow story be tell : the queen intercede long and persistently with she husband for permission for she second son to be marry to the woman he love although the munck family have play a very important part in the history of the nation the king be oppose to the _ mésalliance _ it be oscar 's duty to be true to himself and to he love she use to say but the king who be not wont to refuse any of the wish of he consort steadily refuse to sanction the union there be many thing against such a marriage for prince oscar be the second son of the king and the very fact that the reign house of norway and sweden be one of the most youthful of the royal house of europe make it all the more necessary that its scion should intermarry with the member of the ancient reign house about this time the queen be seize with one of she serious attack of illness and she state be such that at one time she life be despair of she physician declare that she only hope of recovery lay in a instant operation which be both dangerous and extremely painful the queen call the king to she bedside and say if i undergo this operation and recover will you allow oscar and ebba to have they way the king be unable to resist such a appeal make at such a time and give he promise a short time afterwards the operation be successfully perform and when the queen be convalescent the king redeem he promise and give he consent to the marriage of he second son it be on christmas eve and the king have come to he wife 's apartment to see she he find ebba munck and he son oscar with she the maid-of-honor be at the time of he entrance singing one of he poem to she majesty which oddly enough be on the subject of the right to love after wait until the song be end the king go up to he son and lead he to the girl lay he hand in hers in this manner signify that he have withdraw he opposition to they plan the marriage have prove a most happy one prince oscar have find perfect content and have be able to follow he career as a philanthropist the wedding take place at bournemouth in the presence of the queen of sweden on march 15 1888 and for some time after it the prince and he wife be know as prince and princess bernadotte but later the uncle of prince oscar the grand duke of luxemburg give he the title of the count of wisborg for himself and he descendant when they child be bear prince oscar and he wife proclaim they as the child of oscar and ebba bernadotte and during they entire married life they have live as quietly and simply as possible and have find they greatest interest in work for the poor and suffer they have a son and a daughter the former count carl oscar have be bear on may 27 1890 and the latter the countess marie on February 28 1889 and three other child and so as the year go by a third generation grow up in the palace at stockholm -- a brood of long-limbed and broad-shouldered son with wholesome taste and bright mind and kindly temperament and at last when the king be seventy-eight year old a great-grandchild be lay in he arm -- the first son of prince gustavus adolphus -lrb- now the crown prince -rrb- and the princess margaret of connaught up to the last king oscar remain active and interested in all public affair though he have experience several brief but rather severe illness of late year the end come without warn after a few day of indisposition on dec 8 1907 a kindly thanks for a small favor render he by a member of he family be the last word hear from he lip previously he have express he wish to the member of he cabinet that no interruption in public or private business be make on account of he death king gustavus v who take the oath of office within a few hour of he father 's death have suffer something resemble he father 's fate as crown prince overshadow by the more brilliant gift and more attractive personality of the parent he be for year speak of in rather a disparage manner in sweden while in norway he harvest outright hatred in return for he determine uphold of the union on frequent occasion during the last decade of he father 's reign he act as vice-regent while he father be sick or travel and in this way he find chance to display quality that gradually change the popular regard of he from one of suspicion to one of hearty respect he near-sightedness he serious-mindedness have militate against he but it seem probable that he will prove the very _ best _ ruler sweden could desire at the present juncture he be slow to make up he mind and will not do so until he have search every phase and detail of the problem before he but once he have come to a conclusion he pursue he path without look to the right or left gustavus be fifty year old tall rather dark quite unassuming and be essentially democratic while seem the opposite whereas oscar be aristocratic although he make much of the people like all other swedish king gustavus adopt a motto when he ascend the throne it be with the people for the fatherland -- not inappropriate in view of he inheritance of a problem clamor for solution the extension of the suffrage and a more direct representation of the people in both the upper and lower house of the riksdag the new king who possess a uncommon amount of energy may probably be depend upon to accomplish this reform there be neither pride of a objectionable type nor any tendency to tyranny nor one strain of arrogance in the new king he may not be able to draw upon such ripe culture or upon such fine talent as the monarch who precede he yet the swede have no fear that he love of truth and justice will not outweigh this deficiency and probably make he a more practical ruler as for the french descent of the swedish royal house neither the present nor the late king have ever be ashamed of they ancestry or forget that the first bernadotte on they throne be one of napoleon 's greatest marshal never will gustavus v be able to give to word or action that brilliantly original and kingly tone for which he late father be so admire everywhere that to the mind of all beholder be to be the drawback of he reign for he be the merest mortal where he father be the luminous angel where oscar would have be finely eloquent gustavus show himself merely sensible oscar 's temper be heat he emotion be forever come to the surface gustave be if more poise less interesting he have always be addict to manly sport and exercise he have often be observe to put up a excellent game of tennis at the club in stockholm but he be without the alert and springy step of the old oscar whose muscle remain taut and elastic almost to he die day gustave lack the literary aptitude of he late father likewise who leave a well-filled book of verse which admirer all over europe do into french german italian danish and even hungarian gustave have not inherit he mother 's musical genius either she be at one time a devotee of wagner a disciple of kant and always a pious evangelical of the german cast from both he parent gustave receive every encouragement to proficiency in music music to the late oscar be both in theory and practice a essential element in the intellectual life gustave be less the artist than the practical king he encourage international congress of every kind to come to sweden he help the university and the cause of education throughout he kingdom he feel he father 's interest in hedin 's travels through central asia but he can give no creative impulse after he father 's grand fashion oscar be the man of idea the vitalizer of project literary musical dramatic and scientific he make stockholm the capital of the whole intellectual world gustave be very courteous affable in a dignified way impressive as he open the riksdag in royal ermine he have commence he reign in simplicity rise at eight breakfast on coffee and roll read the morning papers until ten and review the military with a conscientious assiduity he note be repose both in manner and in speech in striking contrast with the late oscar who be majestic in the very way he have of eat cold meat at supper and whose height of six foot three tower almost without the droop heaviness of age till he seventy-ninth year notwithstanding the adverse comparison with he parent one have but to see gustave 's face with its determination and refinement to feel a certain assurance as to sweden 's future it be a curious fact that there have be such a dearth of girl in the swedish royal family the only princess of the house be the crown princess of denmark a daughter of the late king charle xv the present queen have only son : crown prince gustavus adolphus wed to margaret of connaught prince wilhelm who be recently marry to the russian princess marie palvona and prince erik now about twenty year of age the present crown prince and princess be seemingly perpetuate the tradition as they first child be a lusty little son queen victorium be say to be endow with a instinct for business of every kind far finer and more efficient than that of she husband and it be to be regret that she health be so frail that she be oblige to spend much time outside she husband 's realm and the duty of she royal dignity devolve upon she daughter-in-law the crown princess it be very satisfy to the swedish people that by a strange play of circumstance the claim of the extinct house of vas -- the last direct descendant of which pass away a few day after king oscar in the person of carolum dowager-queen of saxony and daughter of the depose king gustavus adolphus iv of sweden -- be again restore and that the reign house of bernadotte and the ancient house of vas have become join through the present crown prince it be something to consider too that adolphus v be the first of the bernadotte dynasty in whose vein through he mother sophie of nassau there flow royal blood -lrb- k -rrb- chapter xii charitable and benevolent institution this be the age of munificent benefaction in aid of science and

and art collection many institution found in the united state and elsewhere by multi-millionaire for the advancement of knowledge be a sign of the time they foreshadow the abolishment of pauperism and its attendant charity to give place to beneficent institution and norway and sweden be abreast with other country in this movement apart from charitable institution and endowment for the maintenance of hospital and asylum of university scholarship and fellowship which the generosity of former generation have secure the present generation have see noble donation make by private man for more

work so widely read -- all these be undertake as the result of such aid the latest case in point alfr nobel 's foundation of annual prize for the reward of scientific discovery of literary merit and humanitarian endeavor deserve special notice the annual distribution of these prize each of which represent a small fortune -lrb- $ 41500 -rrb- have of late year fix the attention of the learn world on the swedish literary and scientific body and the norwegian parliamentary committee who be entrust by he with the difficult and invidious task of award they alfred nobel the dynamite king as he be style belong to a family of inventor and industrial magnate he father emmanuel nobel be the inventor of nitroglycerine and of fix submarine torpedo or mine he two brother robert and loui nobel found the naptha and petroleum work at bacou one of the largest industrial enterprise of russium alfr himself invent dynamite and dynamite gum and a smokeless powder ballistite which he patent in 1867 1876 and 1889 it be mainly due to the work of the nobel family that sweden have attain the reputation of master producer of explosive chemical research have always be a specialty among swedish man of science and a large number of the known chemical element be discover and make know by swedish scientist in 1876 alfred nobel have perfect he invention of dynamite gum he go to pari with he patented invention and there form a company with a capital of ten million franc for the manufacture of dynamite it prove to be a article of the greatest industrial importance and one destine to revolutionize mining and engineering erelong he have establish extensive work in france scotland germany belgium austrium and the united state he produce over $ 25000000 worth a year he become in fact the world 's purveyor of a article which be now exclusively use in mining and engineering work thanks to it engineer be able to pierce tunnel through the alp miner to sink they shaft into the bowels of the earth and harbor constructor to remove sunken rock out of the way of shipping but thanks to it too the communard be enable to blow up the finest monument of pari in a few hour it be at once a powerful instrument of industrial development and of progress in the conquest of man over inert matter and a terrible engine of devastation in warfare and of massacre and vandalism where homicidal and destructive passion be arouse in mankind it be perhaps this think that in benefit industry he have also make war more destructive which lead alfred nobel who be a most pacific and humane man endow with the kindliness and sympathy of a great mind to make the provision he do in he will he devote all he fortune to the encouragement of scientific discovery and the reward of endeavor to diminish standing army and the chance of war to promote fraternity among nation and the settlement of international dispute by peace congress he will in its very conciseness and unsophisticated simplicity be characteristic of the man it be date nov 27 1895 and he die a year afterwards on dec 10 1896 leave a fortune of $ 10000000 after institute several small legacy the will proceeds : with the residue of my convertible estate i hereby direct my executor to proceed as follow : they shall convert my say residue of property into money which they shall then invest in safe security the capital thus secure shall constitute a fund the interest accrue from which shall be annually award in prize to those person who shall have contribute most materially to benefit mankind during the year immediately precede the say interest shall be divide into five equal amount to be apportion as follow : one share to the person who shall have make the most important discovery or invention in the domain of physics one share to the person who shall have make the most important chemical discovery or improvement one share to the person who shall have make the most important discovery in the domain of physiology or medicine one share to the person who shall have produce in the field of literature the most distinguished work of a idealistic tendency and finally one share to the person who shall have most or best promote the fraternity of nation and the abolition or diminution of stand army and the formation or increase of peace congress the prize for physics and chemistry shall be award by the swedish academy of science in stockholm the one for physiology or medicine by the caroline medical institute in stockholm the prize for literature by the swedish academy in stockholm and that for peace by a committee of five person to be elect by the norwegian storthing i declare it to be my express desire that in award these prize no consideration whatever be pay to the nationality of the candidate that be to say the most deserving be award the prize whether of scandinavian origin or not it be nobel 's object to reward and help the pure man of science too much absorb in he research to think of draw any industrial or pecuniary advantage from he scientific discovery i would not leave anything to a man of action or industrial enterprise he say to a friend with whom he be discuss the project of he will the sudden acquisition of a fortune would probably only damp the energy and weaken the spirit of enterprise of such a man i want to aid the dreamer the scientific enthusiast who forget everything in the pursuit of he idea it seem like drop from the sublime to the ridiculous to follow so ideal a benefaction with a report of so mundane a thing as a soup kitchen but soup be as necessary to humanity at the present period of life as some of the exalted thing of the intellect and as pauperism in norway and sweden be so almost unobservable it be difficult to search out with the keenest vision any charity that be do more than be the steam kitchen of norway and sweden and the keenest vision would hardly observe that these steam kitchen be charitable institution they be call steam kitchen because they be the first institution in the peninsula where steam be use for the cooking of food the one at stockholm institute by prince carl be very similar in detail and operation to the one in christianium but the latter be establish first and be more perfect in its arrangement and method so we will take it for illustration this kitchen at christianium be establish in 1858 by benevolent people to provide wholesome food for the poor at low price the charter grant to the company limit its profit to six per cent of the capital invest with a provision that the balance if any should be pay into the poor fund of the city there be a hard struggle at first to make both end meet and a annual deficit for many year which be make up by the stockholder but at last the kitchen become so popular that it begin to pay dividend and the stock have since be water four time until it now pay what be equivalent to twenty-four per cent annually upon the original investment with a surplus larger than the capital on which it be start it be one of the most profitable enterprise in europe for the amount of money involve but that fact do not diminish the benefit confer upon the public and the generosity of the company to the poor particularly in time of labor trouble and financial depression can not be question hundred of bachelor and single woman take they meal there regularly and hundred of family obtain they entire supply of food wholesome and well cook at nominal cost there be a long official title to the company but nobody ever mention it it occupy a two-story building cover nearly half a ordinary block the location be convenient to the business portion of the city the dock and the market-place there be two large hall one above the other contain five long table seat thirty person each thus accommodate three hundred customer at a sit in the upstairs room it cost eleven cent in we money for a good dinner in the lower room it cost nine cent there be no tablecloth and no napkin but the top of the table have be scour until they shine and everything be spotless the whole institution be a model of neatness it seem remarkable how it can be keep so clean with so many unwashed customer and so much business the window be large and let in plenty of light the wall be cover with bright tint and the waitress wear white cap apron and oversleeve at each place be a knife fork spoon drinking glass cup and saucer and a piece of bread about three inch square dinner be serve from ten in the morning until six in the afternoon to a average of 2500 people daily some of they come twice they take a cup of coffee and eat a piece of cheese and bread at they home early in the morning then at ten or eleven and again at four or five o'clock they go to the kitchen for a square meal thus it cost they not more than twenty-five cent a day all tell for they food in the last ten year they have never serve less than 1500 people in a day the bill of fare vary from day to day but we will take one day Tuesday for example a large dish of barley soup be serve wholesome and nourishing a ball of hashed meat with potato and rice or boil salmon potato and turnip the nine-cent dinner be pretty much the same with the exception of the soup boil potato and rice or boil salmon potato and turnip a plate of soup alone which in itself would be more than a meal for most people be fill with meat and vegetable be serve for three cent the same dinner be furnish to the public to be eat at they home for nine and seven cent respectively and usually contain enough food for two or three woman although norwegian have stalwart appetite the outdoor service be conduct in another part of the building upon another street the patron procure ticket at a office and then form in line -- man woman and child each with a bucket or a basket or both in hand many ticket be give gratuitously but it be impossible to distinguish the pay from the charity customer benevolent people throughout the city purchase bunch of ticket which they give to the poor and sometimes in lieu of wages if you hire a man to clean up the yard you can give he so much cash and so many meal ticket or if a person appeal to you for relief it be always better to give a ticket to the steam kitchen rather than money many customer buy two portion which they take home and warm up at meal time for the whole family in the center of a large room be row of immense caldron with coil of steam pipe embrace they the air be fill with pungent odor from the bubble soup and cloud of steam rise from the other cook-pot on a long table be pyramid of bread cut into cube three or four inch square usually rye or black bread such as the native of norway prefer along the wall be deep cupboard contain the linen the culinary supplies and utensil in a adjoining but detach building be a furnace and boiler-room which furnish the steam and beside it a laundry and dish-washing establishment it require a good many dish to serve three thousand people even in a simple way in a annex the finer quality of beef mutton and other meat be cut off and sell to the public thus utilize all the supplies which be buy in large quantity the beef by the carcass and the vegetable by the carload the sausage of the steam kitchen be say to be the best to be find in christianium all kind of prepared meat be also sell in this annex butcher shop during the fruit season the company run a canning department upstairs preserve all kind of fruit jelly pickle and that sort of thing at the bake department bread be sell to the general public at wholesale or retail and small retail establishment be supply with all kind of grocery as well as meat and other edibles thus the restaurant be only part of this large business from which the company derive its profit there be naturally a good deal of jealousy among the compete small dealer against the steam kitchen but it serve a benevolent purpose and there be no disposition among its customer to question its business method or reduce its profit it have succeed in abolish the cheap restaurant such as be find in all large city at which wretched food generally the scrapings from high-class hotel and eating-house be work over and sell to the poor it be a interesting sight this bucket brigade that stand in line and pass slowly by the serve window which be attend by half a dozen brawny norwegian woman with bare arm and broad good-natured-looking face they wear neat white apron and cap and handle the food with a dexterity that show long experience they seem to know most of the customer and carry on a familiar conversation with they while fall they order when a bucket and a ticket pass up blue for a nine-cent and red for a seven-cent dinner the waitress first plunge a huge ladle into the soup pot and empty its contents into the bucket then pass along the row of kettle she harpoon a piece of meat with a long two-pronged fork scoop up a quart of rice with a wooden shovel and then add a portion of potato slam on the cover and grab a cube of bread pass it over to the purchaser with a joke or a few pleasant word many of the customer be well dress accord to the norway standard but no people in the world seem to care so little for they personal appearance except on sunday when you can scarcely recognize man and woman you have be familiar with during the week on the day i eat at the restaurant my cicerone point out at the dining table two professor of the university faculty a lawyer in good stand a photographer and a sub-editor of one of the daily papers who be he personal acquaintance the remainder of the customer appear to be professional man clerk bookkeeper and a good many laborer many of they come for they dinner without have remove the trace of toil from they face and hand at one of the table be a group of student incline to be boisterous and evidently enjoy themselves the steam kitchen be the favorite eating-place for the undergraduate from four to five hundred be serve every day such a institution as the steam kitchen be especially suitable to a norwegian city where a portion of the population work for very small wages the average income of the wage-earner be less than $ 100 a year -- so small that measure by the american standard it would seem a difficult problem to find food clothing and shelter for a family few norwegian suffer from poverty or privation even through the cold and gloomy winter that be eight month long we own people might die or at least suffer seriously under the same circumstance but the norwegian be a hardy race they have inherit the power of endurance and the ability to survive hunger and thirst and discomfort better than most race there be comparatively few poor in sweden probably fewer than in any other european country except norway and switzerland because of the low cost of live the sparse population and the ability of all man and woman to find work if they be willing to earn they own subsistence able-bodied pauper be compel to work upon poor farm but the aged decrepit and invalid who be dependent upon public charity be kindly take care of by what be call outdoor and indoor relief in the city be asylum and almshouse similar to those in the united state but in the parish as a rule the care of the poor be assign to individual farmer and other who be willing to take care of they under contract subject to the supervision of a board of guardian of which the pastor be the chairman and the elder of the church be member this have long be a practice in sweden but be not universal there be at present 5277 relief establishment of all kind in the kingdom and the total contribution for the benefit of the poor amount to $ 3000000 annually or on a average of 58 cent per capita of the entire population a average of 44 cent in the country and $ 118 in the city this include all poorhouse asylum hospital and other institution for adult and child who can not take care of themselves a large part of the relief work in the city be look after by the salvation army under contract with the municipal authority but there be many institution hospital asylum home for the friendless and aged and for orphan child support by private charity the free hospital for child in stockholm be famous as one of the best equip and manage institution in the world the private charity in stockholm be unite for cooperation in a organization similar to those find in american city and all charitable institution be subject to government supervision -lrb- l -rrb- chapter xiii material condition the chief occupation of the scandinavian peninsula be agriculture employ more man and yield larger monetary return than any other industry in either norway or sweden this may seem strange when it be recall that sixty per cent of the surface of norway be occupy by bare mountain twenty-one per cent by woodland eight per cent by grazing land four per cent by lake and two per cent by ice field leave only seven-tenth of one per cent for meadow and cultivate field and yet the product of the farm equal the combined return from ship lumber and fishery in sweden the proportion of land under cultivation be considerably larger the arable land consist of about twelve per cent of the total area and in sweden as in norway the agricultural product be more than those from shipping lumber and fishery combine nine-tenth of the farm of norway and sweden be own by small proprietor and although the right to dispose of land property be relatively free the law of the country favor the retention of the farm in the family possess they a old allodial right make it possible to redeem at a appraise value a farm that have be sell this right be acquire after the property have belong to the family for twenty year but it be lose after the farm have be in the possession of stranger for three year there be some farm that have be work for a thousand year by the descendant of the same family the best farm be about the bank of the lake and in the narrow river valley and there be many fertile meadow which have never be plow or put under cultivation so that there be great future possibility for tillage and yet these meadow furnish fine hay-crop and every blade of grass represent money in scandinavium in a country extend through thirteen degree of latitude one might naturally expect a wide range of agricultural product in the southeastern part of the peninsula most of the plant and orchard fruit of central europe be find whereas in the northern section it be impossible to grow even the most hardy plant oats barley and rye be the chief cereal but they production scarcely meet the need of the country potato be the only root crop extensively cultivate while the summer be short vegetable and small fruit do excellently during the long sun-lit hour scandinavian however do not seem habituate to a vegetable diet and the cultivation of root plant seem very generally neglect pear cherry apple raspberry gooseberry and currant may be grow under favorable condition but they play a minor role in scandinavian horticulture the cow be a staple of wealth to the people of scandinavium they be diminutive in size dun-colored docile in habit and excellent milk producer it be say when they be well-fed they average from six to nine hundred gallon of milk a year the mountain saeter or dairy as we would call they be the center of the butter and cheese industry during the summer month the peninsula be also supply with a excellent breed of small but hardy horse the cream-colored fjord horse of norway be only sixty inch high they be active hardy and gentle and in the mountainous part of the country they be vastly more serviceable than mule would be the gudbrandsdalen breed find chiefly in the mountain valley be larger than the fjord horse and they be generally brown or black in color good horse bring surprisingly high price work horse cost from $ 200 to $ 350 and the best stallion bring as much as $ 2500 the agricultural interest of norway have suffer unmistakably by the enormous emigration to the united state two-third of the norwegian of the world live in iowa wisconsin minnesota and the dakota nearly every norwegian farmstead have kinsman in we country and the strong and vigorous always emigrate thus leave the farm at home in the hand of the old and infirm america have be greatly benefit by this almost incessant exodus for the norse peasant have without a exception make splendid citizen the best in fact that have come to we from europe comment on the enormous emigration from the norwegian farm william eleroy curti remark : notwithstanding the large emigration of young people for whom the norwegian farm be too small it be apparent that the development of norway be continually progress along the highest line and that the tendency of the people be upward socially and industrially in culture and in wealth the population of the kingdom not only hold its own but show a slight increase which seem remarkable because of the continual drain of young able-bodied man and woman who have remove to we western state in all public movement in all social commercial and industrial activity in art science and literature in wealth and prosperity norway stand abreast of the most advanced nation of europe but its progress be not win without greater effort than any other people put forth and the application of thrift and industry elsewhere unknown but which be require in a climate so bleak and inhospitable and by a soil so wild and rocky none but a race like the norseman could have keep a foothold here norwegian economist recognize the loss to the country through emigration and in recent year the national parliament have attempt to improve the condition of agricultural laborer a fund of $ 135000 have be set aside by the government for the purchase of land loan be grant to municipality -lrb- 1 -rrb- for the purpose of buy large estate to be assign to people without means at the purchase price in plot of not more than twelve acre of tillable soil and -lrb- 2 -rrb- for the purpose of be grant as loan on the security of parcel of the same size which people without means may acquire as freehold property the interest on these loan be from three to four per cent and the time of payment be up to twenty-five year there be also a cultivation fund of $ 270000 from which loan be grant for the purpose of cultivate and drain the soil the interest be two and one-half per cent and the time of repayment be up to twenty year include five year in which no instalment be require such loan be grant -lrb- 1 -rrb- on the security of mortgage and -lrb- 2 -rrb- on the guaranty of the municipality agricultural society -- national and county -- receive government grant for the purpose of hold meeting and issue document that might be of service to farmer there be also a staff of surveyor pay by the state to assist in the public allotment of land and otherwise to render assistance to needy lot-owner considerable attention be also be give to the matter of agricultural education connect with the state agricultural college be a experimental farm where not only farmer but also dairymen gardener and forester receive practical instruction connect with the larger farm of norway and sweden be cotter ' place -- farm laborer who have lease a small part of the farm for a definite period -lrb- often during they natural life -rrb- in some case the cotter lease only a building with a garden attach in other case several acre of ground the cotter be usually require to work on the farm of the owner at certain time of the year for a small wage regulate by contract these cotter correspond to we truck farmer and they plot of ground number about 35000 on the outskirts of the city and village they raise potato and other vegetable and hay enough to feed a horse and several cow in most case the woman and child do the work while the man be engage in other occupation it be no longer permit to establish entail which can not be sell or mortgage and the national government in recent year have seek to further the partition and allotment of the common ownership of land pasture and grazing land be still often hold by the community and similarly mountain pasture but the community farm when the consent of all the part owner and tenant have be secure may now be partition by surveyor appoint by the public authority in the great timber district of the mountain range the tree be fell in winter and the log be drag to the top of the steep mountain side where they be slide down to the river or they be cart on sledge to the river 's edge during the early summer after the ice have go and while the river be yet full of water they be float down the stream to the sawmill but as the log be constantly be drive into corner or lodge against pier floater be employ to keep the log in the current log-floating be both the most dangerous and the most unhealthful occupation in norway man often fall into the stream they be force to sleep on the cold ground in uninhabited part of the country they frequently fall from the roll log into the whirling current and be toss against sharp rock and the marvel be not that the death-rate among floater be so high but that any of they survive the perilous occupation the value of the export of forest product and timber industry reach about eighteen million dollar a year and the combined forest industry furnish employment to a large number of laborer the state forest occupy about 3500 square mile more than half be locate in the northern province of tromsö and finmark the state also have nursery at vossevangen and hamar and three forestry school by means of which widespread interest in tree-planting have be arouse destructive forest fire and the slaughter of the tree by the remarkable development of the wood-pulp industry have emphasize in recent time the need of larger forest reserve and closer government supervision under the most favorable condition the pine require from seventy-five to one hundred year to yield timber twenty-five foot in length and ten inch in diameter at the top spruce will reach the same size in seventy-five to eighty year in the higher altitude of the central part of the country the pine require one hundred and fifty year and rarely exceed one hundred foot in height and it decrease toward the coast and northwards the fishery of norway be among the most important in the world yield the nation more than seven million dollar a year and furnish employment to eighty thousand man the sea-fishery play the chief part in this branch of industry the long coast line and the great ocean depth near the coast combine to give the fishery of norway unusual advantage the abundance of fish be also due to the presence of mass of glutinous matter apparently live protoplasm which furnish nutriment for million of animalcule which again become food for the herr and other fish the fish be mainly of the round sort find in deep water the cod herr and mackerel be the most important the cod yield the largest monetary return this fish migrate to the coast of norway to spawn and in search of food the best cod fishery be in romsdal nordland and tromsö county the lofoten island in tromsö alone furnish employment to more than four thousand man the cod weigh from eight to twenty pound and measure from five to six foot in length some be merely dry after have be clean this be do by hang they by the tail on wooden frame the other be send to the salting station where they be salt and dry on flat rock a fish weigh ten pound will yield two pound of salted cod the loss be due to the removal of the head and entrails and the dry out of the water there be numerous secondary product from the cod the most valuable be the cod liver oil the liver of the fish be expose to a jet of superheated steam which destroy the liver cell and cause the small drop of oil to run together the roe be salt and send to france to be use for bait in the sardine fishery in the matter of the handicraft industry carry on in the home norway have long take high rank as early as the ninth century she artisan be skilled in the manufacture of arm farm implement and boat and she woman in cloth weave and embroidery during recent time the ease and cheapness with which foreign product could be obtain cause a marked decline in home industry but at the present moment a effort be be make to rehabilitate they through a national domestic industry association organize in 1891 which have take up the manufacture of hand-carved article sheath-knife ski sledge and weave and embroider woolen and linen goods after the old norwegian pattern the manufacture of lumber and wooden ware be one of the lead industrial pursuit with the exception of the two most northern county practically every section of the country be represent by sawmill and plane mill ship-building in recent time have attain considerable importance and the manufacture of paper of the chemical wood-pulp variety have become one of the lead industry there be a few cloth rope and jersey mill at bergen and christianium but the textile industry of norway be relatively unimportant on the other hand leather indium rubber glass metal and chemical industry have become important of late year norway be not rich in mineral product the combined mining industry do not yield more than two million dollar a year and they furnish employment to less than four thousand man the kongsberg silver mine have be operate for more than three hundred year but the recent fall in the price of silver have reduce the output the copper mine at rorös have be operate for two hundred and fifty year and there be less important copper mine in nordland telemarken and the hardanger there be iron mine at arendal and elsewhere but the rise in the cost of charcoal due to the scarcity of wood have greatly cripple the iron industry there be important soapstone quarry in the gudbransdal and the trondhjem basin green color slate in the valder and at vossevangen and granite syenite and porphyry in many part of the country measure by population and national wealth the commerce of norway be relatively important due in a large measure to she enormous merchant marine and the efficiency of she hardy seaman relatively to the population of the country norway have the largest merchant fleet in the world and in the matter of steamship and sailing vessel she be surpass only by three country -- great britain germany and the united state not only be she fleet large but she service be efficient norwegian seaman the world over be esteem for ability and honesty inspiring all commercial nation with confidence that goods carry in norse bottom will be carefully and conscientiously treat and she seaman be everywhere seek to man foreign vessel in industry the swede excel in the manufacture of iron to fully appreciate the value of this industry one should visit gefle the most important shipping point on the eastern coast of sweden here there be a fine harbor with dock and warehouse own by the government from this port the ore from the mine of central sweden be ship to all part of the world and handle by brown hoist machinery which be make in cleveland ohio -- the same that you see on the ore dock at south chicago and at cleveland buffalo ashtabulum and other point on the great lake where iron ore and coal be handle at gefle too a annual industrial exposition be hold where you may see on exhibit all the utensil manufacture or use by the people -- all kind of machinery tool and implement recent novelty in patent weave wood-carving and a large part of the exposition building be give up to beautiful article in iron in the manufacture of which we have say the swede excel a little west of gefle be the town of fahlun which be the headquarters of the kopparberg mining company the oldest industrial corporation in the world the building date back to the seventeenth century and the mine be even more ancient a mortgage bond be file upon they in the year 1288 by a german company and the record show that in 1347 the privilege of work they be sell by the king of sweden to a syndicate of lubeck miner but these document which be on file in the archive of the town be comparatively modern because the copper deposit at fahlun be know and work in prehistoric time and from they the viking obtain the sheathing for they ship and the material from which they copper armor implement and utensil be make a immense amount of copper be use and work with great skill in scandinavium even before the christian era and the most of it come from the great deposit at fahlun the iron industry be old in sweden isaac breant a tradesman in stockholm found a company and receive a charter from charle xi in 1685 he build the first blast furnace in sweden and die in 1702 leave the property to he son who die in 1720 the heir sell out in 1722 to a man name grill in whose family the property remain until 1800 when it be purchase by the ancestor of the present owner the famous dannemora mine which produce the best bessemer ore in the world have be work continuously since 1481 it be one of the most valuable and extensive iron deposit in the world and resemble those of lake superior the area of ore already located cover 12500 square meter -lrb- m -rrb- chapter xiv highway railway and waterway since the sixteenth century norway have have a excellent public post system which enable the traveler to go to the most remote part of the country at moderate and fixed rate fast and slow post station be establish by the government along all the national highway at the former horse must be keep in readiness whereas at the latter the horse may be in distant field at work and a couple of hour may elapse before the traveler can proceed upon he journey the rate which be determine by the government be from fast station about seven cent a mile for a horse and two-wheeled conveyance or sledge but from slow station they be scarcely more than half that price when the road be over very steep mountain a extra fare be charge usually double but this be a government regulation and be always understand the post station be for the most part isolate and solitary farm the farmer undertake to provide room and meal as well as driver horse and conveyance station be usually from seven to fifteen mile apart and farmer be require to convey the traveler only as far as the next station two kind of wagon be use the carriole and the stolkjaerre the carriole resemble a american sulky except that it be springless and nearly the entire weight be forward of the axle it be a two-wheeled gig with the body shape like the bowl of a spoon the seat in front of the axletree be fasten by cross-piece to the long slender shaft that project behind and provide a place for light luggage and a seat for the driver the carriole be for one passenger it be fall into disuse and its place be be take by the stolkjaerre a two-wheeled cart that will carry two passenger it also have long shaft which extend under the axletree to make a support for the luggage and a seat for the driver the passenger 's seat be in front perch on two wooden bar stretch obliquely upward and backwards from the front of the vehicle the driver usually man although sometimes girl vary in age from six to sixty year the norwegian horse be stout stubby and spirited little beast they be cream-colored high crested and have black mane and tail the mane be crop except the forelock which be leave to protect the eye from the sun and the tail be very full horse be value in norway by the size and fullness of they tail these little animal be so trustworthy and intelligent that tourist as well as peasant soon get to look upon they as companion in every skyds-station as the post station be call in a conspicuous place be post this inscription : _ vaer god mod hesten _ this mean be good to the horse at every station there be also a book call the _ skydsbog _ in which traveler be request to write they name and any complaint they may have to make regard they treatment at interval these book be examine by government official swedish horse be much larger than those of norway tall heavy with long leg and barrel-shaped body very much like canadian stock they drive well make good speed and will eat anything at the livery stable one can hire outfit by the day or hour -- the legal price be 63 cent a hour or 56 cent to any point within the city limit and there be a excellent cab system with what be know as the taxameter register every cab be equip with a arrangement similar to a gas meter which show on a dial the money due whether you be use it by the hour or by the distance the hackman set he clock at zero at the time of start accord to the number of passenger or whether he be hire by time or distance and it tick away while you ride or while he wait the fare for one or two person be sixty-two cent per hour for three person eighty-seven cent a hour for four person $ 124 and a tip to the driver anywhere from one cent to fifteen cent accord to the time he have be with you the public post system outside of the city be similar to that of norway the national government build the main highway while the cross road be build by the parish the management be in the hand of a bureau in the national department of public work and the maintenance fall upon the people who live in the neighborhood under the supervision of a local inspector every farmer have a piece of road to take care of accord to the amount of land he own and at interval slab of cast iron be erect bear he name and the section of the road he be to keep in order thus every man 's reputation be at stake in the neighborhood and if there be a muddy place or a rut everybody know who be to blame for it and it can not be lay to the county commissioner as be the case in america on the outside of each road be a line of large block of stone set upright which serve as a barrier to prevent wagon from go off into the ditch there be 6500 mile of main highway and 11000 mile of cross-road or a total of 17500 mile of road in norway and the total expenditure upon they by national and local authority will average a million and a half dollar every year the first cost of a road be usually about $ 3000 a mile they first dig a excavation about three foot deep as if they be go to make a canal on the bottom be throw heavy block of stone through which the water can filter and occasionally there be a little drain to carry it off upon this be a layer of smaller stone and then still smaller until the surface be reach which be macadam of pounded slate mix with gravel and stone during the winter the farmer have to keep they several section free from snow but to do this it be necessary for they to co-operate for it would be impossible for one family to handle the heavy plow that be necessary six eight and ten horse be often hitch to they -- all the horse in the neighborhood -- and it be often the work of week instead of day to get the road open up for travel but when it be once do it be as clear and smooth for sleigh as a city boulevard norway have only one mile of railway for every one hundred square mile of land but the mountainous character of the country the heavy snowfall during the long winter and the thin scattered population make railway construction almost prohibitive nevertheless the new kingdom have make a commendable beginning and the state have plan for enormous extension during the next twenty-five year there be now nine railway line in the country with a total mileage of one thousand five hundred and eighty-four but half of which be broad gauge the state railway have be construct partly by subscription take in the district interested in the construction of new line and partly at the expense of the national government the lead railway line radiate from christianium to stockholm goteborg trondhjem gudbransdal telemarken and the valder the longest line -- three hundred and fifty mile -- be from christianium to trondhjem through hamar there be also a relatively long line -- one hundred and ninety mile -- from christianium up the gudbrandsdal by lake mjosen and through lillehammer to otta in 1906 the valder railway connect christianium with fagernae -- a distance of one hundred and thirty-one mile -- be open this connect with the most important of the new road be build the one from christianium to bergen this road will reach entirely across the country from christianium on the swedish frontier to bergen on the atlantic coast thus make connection between the two largest city of norway journey between which be now only possible by steamship and carriage consume from three to six day the new road go through the mountain and present many engineering difficulty two-third of the way the roadbed must be cut out of the mountain side and there be a tunnel three mile long at a height of two thousand eight hundred and twenty foot above the sea level the snow in the winter be so heavy that it will be necessary to cover the track with shed for a distance of nearly sixty mile the construction be not only difficult but expensive and although the distance be but three hundred and ten mile it will be one of the most costly railroad ever build sixty-seven mile of the line between bergen and vose on the western coast be already in operation and it be a favorite journey of tourist for the scenery be superb although the traveler be in a tunnel one-tenth of the entire distance there be forty-eight tunnel in all a shelf have be hew and blast along the side of the mountain that enclose the celebrated sorfjord the norwegians call a railway a _ jernbane _ literally a iron path they car be make on the conventional european pattern and be light and comfortable they be furnish with toilet room and run smoothly and noiselessly most of the train be equip with westinghouse brake steam heat and electric light the train run very slowly economy be study in this respect as in every other there be a certain speed -- say fifteen or eighteen mile a hour -- which can be maintain at a minimum consumption of fuel and the scandinavian railway manager have figure it down to a dot they can haul a longer train a greater distance with a ton of coal than any other engineer and the most scrupulous attention be apply to every feature of management the track the rolling stock the station the crossing the crossing-keeper be usually woman a large number of that sex be employ by the railway the stop at the station seem unnecessarily long to impatient american but the time be utilize by the leisurely passenger in drinking big goblet of beer and by the conductor in parade up and down the platform so that the patron of the road can have a opportunity to admire he radiant uniform and fine shape in scandinavian country the best-looking man seem to have be select for railway conductor and policeman and they deportment be decidedly different from what we be use to in america if you ask a question of a norwegian policeman he will bring he heel together give a military salute and stand in the attitude of attention like a soldier while he answer he usually understand english too and those who can not be remarkably accurate guesser and all take a friendly interest in you inquiry instead of give you a short answer and a cold shoulder like the policeman in we city they will walk to the corner to point out the house in the middle of the next block if that be where you want to go and when you thank they for they attention you get another salute that make you feel as big as a major general or as if you have be mistake for a member of the royal family railway conductor be equally polite and seem to understand that it be a part of they business to protect tender-footed traveler as angel always look after good little boy in southern sweden there be scarcely a parish without a railway and in the northern part of the kingdom where the railway facility be limited post station be maintain by the government similar to those in norway there be a railway run as far north as the 67th parallel of latitude about fifty mile beyond the polar circle into lapland to the famous mine of malmberget with a branch to trondhjem norway the line follow the coast of the gulf of bothnium very closely through a country well cover with small pine timber which be be rapidly strip until the government interfere by pass rigid regulation and appoint forester to enforce they you can see the midnight sun from several place on this railway anywhere above 66 degree and 33 minute of latitude from the 9th of June to the 3d of July and farther north for a longer period at gellivare the midnight sun can be see regularly from June 5 to July 11 and it be a much more convenient and quicker journey than to the north cape and other polar resort in norway during that period a traveler be reasonably certain of see the sun at all hour of the day as long as he care to stay while over in norway that privilege be rare and uncertain owe to the fog and cloud that obscure the horizon sometimes for day at a time but there be nothing else to call the tourist to this part of sweden for the scenery be monotonous and uninteresting and the facility for travel be primitive and the tourist be few everybody who have take the trouble to make the journey of course advise other people to do the same and insist that it be worth the time money and fatigue it cost on the same principle as the fox that lose he tail in a trap want all the other fox to cut off they tail there be one train each way daily but it run very slowly -- about fifteen or eighteen mile a hour -- and stop a long time at the station the car be comfortable the road belong to the government and be build in the ' 90 's for the transportation of ore from the iron mine which be previously haul by cart in summer and reindeer sledge in winter to the port of lulea and allapen a distance of about one hundred and forty mile when it be recall that two-third of the inhabitant of norway live upon the coast and fjord the large part which water traffic play in the economy of the country will be easily understand the coast be well protect by a chain of island the skjaergaard both travel and commerce be carry on by means of small open boat the fjord rowboat as a rule be light and pointed with upright and high prow and they carry a square sail they be light to row and they go capitally before the wind there be a extensive government post system on the coast fjord and inland lake similar to that along the public highway already describe the tariff from fast station for a four-oared boat and sail with two rower be about twelve cent a mile eighteen cent for three rower and a six-oared boat and twenty-four cent a mile for a boat with eight oar and four rower the tariff be decide by the size of the boat and not by the number of passenger the rower be not infrequently girl and woman the large fjord and lake have ample steamboat facility the coast service between bergen and trondhjem being especially good the navigable channel of the fjord represent a coast line of twelve thousand mile and they be so entirely separate from the sea by island and reef and obstruct at they entrance by old moraine that the fresh water from the melting snow and river lie four or five foot deep on the surface small steamer ply on all the larger fjord on which the rate be moderate and the accommodation fair on most of these boat a passenger pay full fare for himself and half fare for the other member of he family include he wife person who want to see the fjord of norway thoroughly should take the regular mail steamer which call at all small port and take a month instead of a week for the voyage the boat be small but clean and comfortable and only occasionally have bad weather -- very seldom in summer they wind in and out of the narrow passage and because of they size can navigate where the larger tourist steamer be not able to go and therefore the passenger on the latter miss some of the finest scenery voyage to the north cape by the tourist steamer be limit to a few week during the midsummer when the sun be suppose to be visible at midnight in the arctic region but steamer run regularly all the year way around the cape to archangel vadsö and horningsvaag the arctic port of russium the fjord never freeze so that navigation be always open and there be more or less travel in midwinter between the civilized portion of the arctic region if you will take you map and examine the north coast of europe within the arctic circle you will find several town east of the north cape on the white sea which be wide open 365 day in the year and do more business in the winter than during the summer month they do not see the sun from December to February at some place it be invisible for a longer period but at hammerfest the street house and business place be light with electric light and similar plant be be introduce into other city of the polar section it be state also that the aurora boreali be so brilliant night after night as to make it easy to read ordinary newspaper print without artificial light and by long experience people be prepare for the peculiar condition that exist there the passenger on the steamer in these water in winter be mostly commercial traveler and man interested in the fishery which be more active from October to march than at any other time of the year there be also two canal in norway that be use for passenger traffic -- the fredrikshald canal connect the femsjöen and skullerud lake and the skien-nordsjö-bandak canal connect the nordsjö lake with the hitterdal and bandak lake between the hitterdal and the nordsjö lake there be a rise of fifty foot which be overcome by two lock at skien and four at loveid and between the nordsjö and the bandak lake there be a rise of one hundred and eighty-seven foot which be overcome by fourteen lock five of which be around a waterfall the vrangfo where the average rise for each lock be about thirteen foot the postal telegraph and telephone system all under government control be both cheaper and more efficient than in the united state where the two latter be private monopoly with the exception of switzerland norway be more abundantly supply with postoffice in proportion to she size than any other country in the international postal union the length of she telegraph line in relation to the population of the country be greater than in any other country there be no place in the world where telephone be so cheap or so numerous as in stockholm there be more telephone in stockholm than in berlin or london and it be contend that there be more than in pari but that be doubtful the total number of instrument in use be nearly 50000 to a population of 300000 you can find a telephone in every shop and in almost every house and in the park and on the street corner on lamp post be little booth similar to those use for police box in the city of the united state they work automatically you drop a little coin worth three cent into the slot and then ring the bell for several year every room in the principal hotel have have its own telephone on the same system that have recently be introduce into the united state and upon some of the steamer sailing from stockholm there be a telephone in every stateroom the long distance ` phone and all the line outside of two or three of the principal city belong to the government and be operate by the postoffice department the rent vary from $ 10 to $ 28 a year the telegraph system be own by the government which charge a uniform rate of fifteen cent for ten word to any part of the country chapter xv the people : they manners and custom because of its geographic isolation the scandinavian peninsula be the home of the purest teutonic ethnic stock the norwegian icelander swede and dane be racially closely related and they belong to the same branch of the aryan family as the german flemish english and anglo-american physically these people be powerfully build and tall of the pure scandinavian type with fair hair and blue eye and they healthy intelligent look strike the traveler in addition to the physical characteristic hold in common by these scandinavian people the norwegian be to be specially note for they long narrow head particularly be this so among the people in the interior of the country here too the stature be the greatest during the civil war in the united state it be find that among the enlist troops the norwegian after the american have the greatest stature and that in breadth of chest they be excel by none it be probably true however that the norwegian who emigrate represent the finest physical type and that they possess a higher average stature than one find in norway to-day if the most northerly province be except the norwegian be a very plain people -- neither pretty nor handsome the woman be strong and square-built and what beauty they have be of the solid and substantial sort of the two sex the man be the better proportion both in the matter of figure and feature they have light complexion -- bar the bronzing of the skin due to constant exposure -- light hair blue eye and reasonably well-formed nose both man and woman have frank and open countenance the most marked mental characteristic be clear insight unconquerable pertinacity dog obstinacy absolute honesty and a sturdy sense of independence björnson have well remark concern he people : opinion be slowly form and tenaciously hold and much independence be develop by the rigorous isolation of farm from farm each on its own freehold ground unannoyed and uncontradicted by any one the way the people work together in the field in the forest and in they large room have give they a characteristic stamp of confidence in each other it be perhaps this isolation that have perpetuate so many of the old custom and superstition for which the norwegian be note william eleroy curti tell of see the funeral of one of these norway farmer : he house be trim with green bough and festoon with rope of flower and ground pine the word _ farvel _ farewell be work in green over the front door the coffin which be carry on a bier by the neighbor to the little cemetery not far away be cover with flower and follow it be a number of woman clothe in somber black with little white shawl tie under they chin each carry a wreath in she hand the minister lead the procession he be dress in a long black gown reach to he heel like the cassock of a catholic priest he hat be of feel with a low crown and a broad brim similar to those worn by the curate of the church of england while around he neck be a linen ruff that look as if it might have be worn in the time of queen elizabeth a grave have be dig in the churchyard the neighbor who have bear the body lower it tenderly to the bottom and when they have lift the cover of the coffin in place each man the oldest first throw in a shovelful of earth all the woman do not use the shovel some of they take up handsful of soil and let it gently filter through they finger into the open vault and finally three child somewhere about ten or eleven year of age follow the example of they elder and add they little share to the brown coverlid of the dead the pastor remove he hat extend he arm and pronounce a benediction then the woman lay they wreath on the newly cover grave and sorrowfully turn homeward independence and frankness characterize all class of society norway have no hereditary aristocracy in 1821 it be provide that those hold title might be allow to retain they during they life but they could not transmit they to they child the norse character have never be mar by the yoke of slavery the feudal system with its serfdom never get a footing in the north the people have always be small landholder which have develop among they a independence of character not find in country where the mass of the inhabitant have no direct property interest there be no class in norway correspond to the country gentleman of england or to the grand seigneur and provincial nobleman of the continent the wealthiest landlord be only a peasant honesty be one of the valuable asset of the norwegian people attempt at extortion be so rare that tourist accustom to the proverbial dishonesty of the latin race find travel in norway and sweden a joy a english traveler relate this typical incident : he have lose he purse shortly after leave vossevangen for stalheim altogether unconscious of he loss he walk on placidly suddenly hear hurry footstep follow he he turn about and face a lad who thrust the pocketbook into the owner 's hand and disappear before the englishman could get a coin from he pocket to reward the boy for he honesty the norwegian boy very properly do not expect a reward for do the only thing open to he mind upon find the purse kindness to animal be another virtue of the norwegian people illustrate this trait we again quote william eleroy curti : there seem to be a close relation between the human kind and they animal the man and woman talk to the horse and cattle as if they be understand we have a _ skydsgut _ or driver one day who hold continuous conversation with he horse every time he would come to a hill he would walk beside they and talk to they all the way up in a gentle caressing sort of way like a child talk to a doll and once when he stop for water and the near horse want to drink more than the driver thought be good for he he scold like a old woman the horse shake he head and rattle he harness impatiently as much as to say ` you get back onto you box and attend to you business and i 'll attend to mine ' that intellectuality be one of the trait of the swede and norwegian alike be evidence in the long list of name that have become famous in the world 's literature in spite of the high intellectual attainment of these people they be fond of the quiet simple life with friend and kinsfolk and home employment and home enjoyment and they be very superstitious too and in spite of they lutheran faith they have never discard the custom that grow from belief in god many and fairy troll gnome and norn without number the forest the mountain and gorge be inhabit by these people still nissen be the good fairy of the farmer he look after the cattle particularly and if he be well treat they be healthy and the cow give lot of milk to propitiate he it be necessary to put a dish of porridge on the threshold of the cow stable on christmas morning whenever the family move this invisible be go along with they and sit on the top of the load in haying time he always ride on the load of hay and the _ bedstemoder _ best mother or grandmother in every farmhouse can tell the child dozen of interesting story about the mischief or the kindness of nissen he be invariably represent in picture of farm life he appear on the illustrated advertisement of farm machinery he figure carve in wood be sell at all the curiosity store and he appear as a prominent character in most of the fairy story that deal with farm life he be represent as a short fat bow-legged man with big whisker and long white hair wear a red hat like those worn by clown in circus he usually appear in he shirt sleeve with a open collar a blue vest and knickerbockers upon he leg which be as slim as those of a brownie he circumference be greater than he height and he head be almost as large as he body noek be the fairy of the waterfall and be a sort of merman you never see more than half he body he be very very old he hair and beard be long and white and he face be always pale and pensive he carry a harp and play to amuse the spirit in the waterfall a statue of ole bull have recently be erect in he native city of bergen he stand upon a pedestal which rise from a fountain and the water flow over the head and shoulder of a noek at the base norway offer a fine field for reformer to study the effect of regulation upon the vice of drunkenness within the limit of the kingdom be all grade of restriction from prohibition to liberal license there be no pretension about the norwegian there be no affectation about they moral and no leniency in the administration of they law the police and the magistrate be merciless and inexorable and crime be punish more severely perhaps than in any other country at the same time the people distinguish a important difference between temperance and total abstinence they give they child beer in unlimited quantity but absolutely prohibit the sale of whisky and send drunken man to prison with burglar and assassin norwegian reformer hold that beer be the great promoter of temperance and encourage its use as a beverage although every saloon in the kingdom be close on sunday on all holiday and Saturday afternoon which be the regular pay day for the work class these be practical regulation devise for the purpose of restrain those who be not capable of control they own appetite and encouraging thrift and economy while the saloon be close on pay day the savings bank be open until midnight it be difficult to become accustomed to the long twilight in norway one can read and write at a window as late as ten o'clock without difficulty and during the month of June July and August few artificial light be use either in the street or in the shop or in the residence a candle be usually keep handy for a emergency but it be light enough to dress and undress at any hour of the night and it seem childish to go to bed before dark the hour for meal be awkward to those accustom to american way breakfast be usually serve from seven till nine o'clock four o'clock be the fashionable dinner hour without luncheon after dinner man return to they business and keep open they shop and office until a nine or ten o'clock supper during the long day no one will ever starve to death in norway american palate may not always crave the food but they can not complain of its abundance the table be usually load with all sort of fish and cold meat both fresh and preserved that foreigner be usually afraid of the norwegian be fond of thing with a pronounced flavor the more pronounced the better and cheese be one of the chief article of diet a norwegian housewife would not consider a meal complete without five or six different kind of cheese of all degree of pungency in taste and odor upon the table at breakfast you be serve sardine anchovy smoke salmon dry herr and five or six other kind of fish and a equal variety of cheese before they think of offer you coffee and meat and potato you get seven or eight kind of bread also but it be all cold the national bread which be make of flour water and a little salt with a sprinkling of caraway seed roll very thin and punctured with hole like a cracker be baked only once or twice a year and then in large quantity as new england woman bake mince pie and put they on the top shelf to season it be call _ grovboröd _ and taste like a water cracker the servant-girl problem have be solve in norway to the satisfaction of all concerned although it be doubtful whether a similar solution would be accept by domestic servant in the united state in large city like bergen and christianium there be a central employment bureau under the direction of the municipal government and twice a year -- one week before new year 's day and one week before st john 's day the 24th of June -- there be a general change of servant by those who be dissatisfy with exist condition and engagement be make for the ensue six month of the year family who want servant fill out blank set forth what be require and the wages they be willing to pay these be file at the employment office and be note in a conspicuous manner upon a blackboard woman or man in search of employment go to this bureau during the week name examine the blackboard and apply to the clerk in charge for further information if they desire to apply for a particular position they submit they recommendation to the clerk and if he be satisfied he give they a card to the lady of the house that card be good for the day only and must be return by the lady of the house before the close of office hour if the girl be engage the blank upon the card be fill out with a general statement as to she duty the term of service and the wages agree upon and the card be file away for reference if necessary if the lady of the house be not satisfy with the applicant she send she away and return the card mark not satisfactory with the request that other applicant be send she if the applicant be satisfactory the lady of the house pay she a bonus of one krone or two krone call hand money -- that be she cross she hand with silver as a evidence of good faith -- and the girl agree to report for duty within one week after new year 's or midsummer 's day as the case may be that be to allow she present employer to fill she place in some of the smaller town the date for change servant be April 14 and October 14 the law protect both the employer and the employ the employer guarantee to give the servant a comfortable room wholesome food take care of she if sick and pay she wages regularly as agree upon during good behavior while the girl agree to perform she duty faithfully during the term for which she be engage if there be any complaint upon either side it must be make to a magistrate who investigate and decide between they a family can not get rid of a servant during she term of employment without official intervention on the other hand the girl 's wages be a first lien upon they property for the entire term although judgment must be render and make a matter of record if a servant run away from she employer she can be arrest and fine cook be pay from $ 4 to $ 7 a month housemaid from $ 3 to $ 6 a month man butler from $ 10 to $ 15 coachman from $ 12 to $ 16 a month scullery maid and man of all work receive corresponding wages nearly all of these domestic custom here related apply to sweden as well as norway and there be many interesting additional one in sweden the state dinner at the palace be always at six o'clock at nearly all the other court of europe it be customary to dine at eight o'clock the king 's dinner be short he guest seldom remain more than a hour at the table after which the lady adjourn to one of the draw room the gentleman to the smoking room and later all be entertain by musician from the opera house or the royal conservatory carriage be usually order at ten o'clock this seem old-fashioned but for people who like to go to bed early and those who be occupy with business all day it be much more sensible than the custom follow in some city where social festivity do not begin until the hour when the king of sweden 's guest be bid he good night but everybody complain that the swede be drift away from old custom and be become modernize the french influence seem to prevail and modern swedish life be become a imitation of that of pari another of the old custom be for people to indicate they business upon they visit card you will receive the card of lawyer jone or banker smith or music professor smith and so on and these title be also use in address they it would seem rather queer for any one in the united state to ask wholesale merchant macveigh will you kindly pass the butter or banker hutchinson will you escort fru board of trade operator jone to the table but that be the custom in sweden and it be observe by child as well as grown people a lisping child will approach a guest make a pretty little bob-courtesy and say good morning chief justice of the supreme court fuller or good night representative in congress boutell it be customary for lady to print they maiden name upon they visit card in smaller type under they married name particularly if they have a pride of family and want people to know they ancestry to see the old swedish custom that have almost entirely disappear from the country one must go to the hill district of dalecarlium where the people be so unlike the rest of the swede in they dress they custom and habit and in many other respects as to almost seem another race the dalecarlian be great dancer and the social gathering at they home during the winter be always accompany by that form of amusement during the summer they dance in the open air on st john 's day the entire population old and young dance around a may-pole erect at some convenient place and at harvest time whenever the last sheaf in a field be pitch upon the cart or the stack it be customary for somebody to produce a musical instrument a violin a nyckleharpa a harmonicum or perhaps only a mouth organ and everybody -- for the boy and girl of the family all work together in the hay and harvest field -- join in a dance before return home the dance be original and often interesting one of the most ancient and popular be the _ däfva vadmal _ -lrb- weave homespun -rrb- whose figure be suppose to imitate the action of the shuttle the beating in of the woof and other motion use in weave at a old-fashioned loom some of the dance resemble those of scotland and one be almost exactly like the virginium reel as dance by old-fashioned people in the united state in another call the garland the dancer wind in and out under they clasped hand in imitation of the weave of a wreath of flower all the dance require violent physical exercise but the swedish man and woman be famous for muscular development some of the dance be accompany by pretty melody sing in unison by both sex the song of the dalecarlian peasant be not lively but rather slow in movement and be usually sing in unison the music be rarely arrange for part dalecarlium have a certain preeminence among the district of sweden because of the part its people have play in the history of the country and however the other province may dispute among themselves about they claim for distinction each will admit that dalecarlium be entitle to special consideration its people represent the highest patriotism and the noblest characteristic of the swedish race and when any one be speak of as a dalecarlian it mean that he be a free and intelligent citizen of independent thought and action and live a life of manly simplicity -lrb- o -rrb- chapter xvi health exercise and amusement perhaps in no other country in the world have health and exercise be unite and form into a national institution as they have be in sweden the true swede believe that exercise will cure everything and that as a preventive of disease there be nothing like it if you go to a swedish physician for advice he will invariably prescribe the movement cure and send you to a gymnasium or a massage establishment instead of to a drug store physical exercise be therefore the national remedy particularly for complaint due to sedentary employment neglect of nature 's law and high live the movement cure for invalid which be practically the same as that we have in the united state be use in all the hospital as well as in private practice it be invent about a century ago by dr ling a patriot a gymnast and a poet who be inspire to revive the ancestral national spirit in the swedish people by the aid of sport and song and to develop once more the great quality of strength courage and endurance which in old time distinguish the scandinavian race after a hard struggle he succeed in 1814 in secure the recognition of the government and found the royal gymnastic central institute where all person desire to teach gymnastics in the public school or in private institution must take a course of training and take a degree the swede be quite as particular about this as they be about the study of medicine no medical practitioner can hang out a sign without a diploma from one of the university and no person can teach gymnastics in that country without a similar certificate of competency from the royal institute every officer of the army be require to undergo a course of instruction not only to develop he physical constitution but to qualify he to teach gymnastics to he soldier the teacher of physical culture in the public school both man and woman be oblige to take a similar course in order to drill they pupil properly for in every schoolroom in the country down to the kindergarten daily physical exercise upon ling 's plan be require to promote the development of the body and improve the health this be require in private as well as public school and the method of instruction be subject to the inspection and approval of the central institute in every town of any size there be gymnastic club and association which be generally guide by instructor educate at the central institute they include woman as well as man in they membership and in many of they fencing and other sword exercise be also teach in common with all the gymnasium be bath-house you will find they in every part of the city of stockholm and in other large town some of they occupy entire building it be the habit of business man to go to they store or office at nine o'clock in the morning and remain there until two or three in the afternoon when they go to they club or gymnasium and take a hour 's exercise and afterward a bath these establishment in the business quarter of stockholm and other city be consider just as important as club restaurant or other place of resort and usually have connect with they read and smoke room where patron can read the daily newspaper and current magazine and sip coffee and smoke while they be cool off it would surprise a visitor in new york or chicago to be inform that he broker or he lawyer or he banker or a contractor with whom he have business have go to a bathhouse or gymnasium at three o'clock in the afternoon but in stockholm it be a common reply to a inquiry during winter afternoon you can usually find anybody you want by go to he favorite gymnasium or bathhouse just as you would look for he at he club in chicago there be a distinctive dress for the exercise the patron take off they street clothing and put on light woolen shirt and trousers and canvas shoe on they bare foot and standing in row go through a series of motion under the command of they instructor to exercise the arm leg neck and every other part of the body gently not violently the idea be movement not exertion and the muscle be restrain the arm be raise slowly with self-resistance no club or dumb-bell be use only a gentle motion like the exercise of the child in the school after twenty minute or half a hour of this the class march in a column still go through the same movement then they run follow they leader do everything that he do until at the end of a hour the body be in a glow the blood be pulsate in every vein the perspiration be ooze from every pore every muscle be limber up and strengthen and every nerve tingle there be regular gymnasium apparatus for those who like more violent exercise then a bath be take follow by a cold plunge and violent rub with massage after which a man be in shape to go home to he dinner with a good appetite in October every year the scandinavian gymnastic instructor ' association meet in stockholm for several week at which lecture be deliver papers be read and discussion be hold upon all branch of they work these meeting be quite as important as annual convention of the bar or medical association and be not only attend by gymnastic instructor but by physician generally for every swedish physician must be well verse in medical gymnastics particularly in what be know as _ kinesitherapym _ or movement cure which embrace active passive and resist movement as well as massage for the latter be the basis of medical gymnastics the swede have accept this treatment as a specific for nearly all disease deformity and weakness of the body for internal complaint for the lung the heart and the digestive organ it remove superfluous tissue and this be the reason you see so few fat man in sweden notwithstanding they beer-drinking propensity and why the woman keep they youthful shape until old age it be a spectacle to witness in some of the gymnastic institute venerable and dignified gentleman go through comical motion and assume ridiculous posture with great activity and zeal keep time to the music of a band in the adjoining café in sweden doctor never send bill to they patient but trust entirely to they generosity each family have a attend physician who expect they to pay he by the year for he service accord to they wealth and the amount of attention they receive ten dollar a year in we money be a good fee one hundred dollar be princely at the beginning of the year you put the amount in a envelope and send it to the doctor by a messenger with you card he send back he card with a acknowledgment of thanks and the compliment of the season it be very bad form to talk about it although grateful patient often write they physician affectionate letter of gratitude for he devotion and the benefit he have bring they it be a good deal like the relation between a minister and he parishioner in other country and the annual contribution for the support of the doctor be just as voluntary as the contribution to the treasury of the church if there be any reason why one should feel grateful to the doctor if you or you child have suffer a severe illness and he have pull you through he expect a present in addition to the annual honorarium just as you would send the

of the deep fjord the somber fir-clad mountain valley and the bleak ice-field do not open they lip so readily for song as the people of southern land where the sun create a eternal spring it be not because they be without lyric power as be clearly apparent from the rich and vary folk-song and the splendid creative work of edvard grieg the norwegian folk-song spring dance halling and wedding march have be well characterize as the outpouring of the inner life of the common people the expression of they dauntless energy they struggle and aspiration the folk-song of norway more than in any other land embody the character and express the tendency of vike life ancient and modern it bear the unmistakable mark of weal and woe of norse life the strongly marked and regularly introduce rythm of the develop and develop national character and while a undercurrent of melancholy run through most of it it be after all the faithful interpreter of the life of isolate and solitary occupant of fjord fjeld and dalen the folk-song of norway be singularly typical of the country and its inhabitant some seem to take we into the dense forest among mock echo from the life outside other show we the troll toboggan down the highest peak of norway in some we feel human soul hover over reef in other memory of the old sun-lit land flit before we but in none do we meet with sentimentalism despondency or disconsolateness but with they weird and minor strain and they odd jump from low tone to high on first acquaintance they strike the hearer as strange and elusive some of the epic song as telemarken be of great antiquity but it be not until the last century that norse tone artist discover the wealth that have long be cherish by the peasant of the fjord and mountain valley lindeman -lrb- 1812-1887

which we find embody in folk-song the lur be a long wooden instrument of the trumpet order and be usually make of birch bark it be much use in the mountain the langeleik or norwegian harp be a long narrow box-like stringed instrument something of the character of the ancient zither it have seven string and sound hole but its tone be weak and monotonous the national dance of norway have bold rythm which at once arrest the attention perhaps the most characteristic be the hail a solo dance in two-four time it be usually dance by young man in country barn and its most striking feature be the kick of the beam of the ceiling in the story of nil the fiddler in he novel _ arne _ björnson have give this account of the hail : the music strike up a deep silence follow and he begin he dash forward along the floor he body incline to one side half aslant keep time to the fiddle crouch down he balance himself now on one foot now on the other fling he leg crosswise under he spring up again and then move on aslant as before the fiddle be handle by skilful finger and more and more fire be throw into the tune nil throw he head back and suddenly he boot heel touch the beam the spring dance be less vigorous but more graceful than the hail it be a round dance in three-quarter time in which two person or group of two participate it be dance with a light spring step and have be compare with the mazurka by liszt like the hail however it be markedly individual in its please combination of tone forestier say of the spring dance of norway : there be a freshness a sparkle and energy a graceful life about it that be invigorating if lindeman be the first to collect folk-song and dance in norway ole bull -lrb- 1810-1880 -rrb- be the first to popularize they he be as grieg once declare a pathbreaker for the young national music at the early age of nineteen he sally forth with he fiddle and wherever he appear in europe and america he play the folk-music and national dance of norway the favor which he find encourage he countryman he brilliant career glorified musical norway give it confidence to assert itself and serve as the inspiration of a long list of creative tone artist -- kjerulf nordraak grieg svendsen winter-hjelm sindling and behren -- to write out and arrange for voice and modern instrument the music that have so long be preserve in the memory of the people the best art-made music of norway have be build upon the folk-song and dance of the common people halfdan kjerulf -lrb- 1815-1868 -rrb- be the first serious composer of the new art school he live during

nordraak -lrb- 1842-1866 -rrb- during he brief career set to music several of björnson 's play and compose some strong pianoforte piece and song he be say siewer a man with a bold fresh way of look at thing strong artistic interest a untiring love of work and deep national feeling he have decide influence upon he friend grieg 's artistic view and he be the connect link between kjerulf and grieg in the chain of norwegian musical art otto winter-hjelm who with grieg attempt to establish a conservatory of music at christianium after they return from germany in the sixty contribute much to the national art of norway by he excellent arrangement of halling and spring dance for piano and violin thoma thellefsen -lrb- 1823-1874 -rrb- a pupil and friend of chopin be distinguish as a national composer as well as a pianist and carl fe neupert -lrb- 1842-1888 -rrb- who live in america six year do much by he concert tour and teach to dignify norse music johan severin svendsen while a norwegian by birth and training have expatriate himself by he long residence in denmark so far as he composition have national flavor they be german johan selmer while a prolific composer will probably be best remember as a conductor christian sinding after grieg be the best-known norwegian composer he production range from symphony and symphonic poem through chamber music to romance he be credit with a wide range of musical idea deep artistic earnestness and bold power of expression but he composition in the larger form be think unduly noisy and restless two woman who have help to make the music history of norway be agatha backer-gröndahl and catharinus elling mr backer-gröndahl be a pupil first of kjerulf and winter-hjelm and later of kullak han von bülow and liszt many of she song and instrumental piece display fine artistic feeling and musical scholarship of no mean order catharinus elling have venture into the larger field of music-form and have produce opera symphony and oratorio as well as chamber music and song she music drama the cossack be she most ambitious work say henry t finck a able american music critic : when i have revel in the music of chopin and wagner liszt and franz to the point of intoxication i fancy that the last word have be say in harmony and melody when lo i come across the song and piano piece of grieg and once more find myself move to tear of delight edvard grieg -lrb- 1843-1907 -rrb- undoubtedly occupy the foremost place among norwegian composer he be the highest representative of the norse element in music the great beating heart of norwegian musical art grieg 's _ genere _ piece represent the pearl of he composition the arrangement of folk-song and dance for the piano in picture of popular life -lrb- opus 19 -rrb- be characterize by consummate lyric skill and ole bull once declare that they be the finest representation of norse life that have be attempt grieg write one hundred and twenty-five song most of which take high rank finck be of the opinion that fewer fall below par than in the list of any other song writer he add : i myself believe that grieg in some of he song equal schubert at he best indeed i think he should and will be rank ultimately as second to schubert only but it be in he later work that he rise to such height not in the earliest one in which he be still a little afraid to rely on he wing when it be recall that grieg be a pianist of exceptional merit the large place occupy by pianoforte piece -- twenty-eight of the seventy-three opus number -- it be easily understand grieg 's piano piece be brief but they be veritable gem the jumbo idea in music still linger with minor professional they shrug they shoulder remark finck and exclaim : yes that hum bird _ be _ very beautiful but of course it can not be rank as high as a ostrich do not you see how small it be grieg compose nine work for the orchestra and here as in lyric art-song and pianoforte piece he reveal himself as a consummate master in painting delicate yet glowing color the music which he set to ibsen 's _ peer gynt _ bring he the largest measure of fame as a orchestral composer indeed it be more cordially receive than the drama as be indicate by this criticism by hanslick : perhaps in a few year ibsen 's _ peer gynt _ will live only through grieg 's music which to my taste have more poetry and artistic intelligence in every number than the whole five-act monstrosity of ibsen among other notable orchestral and chamber music number may be mention a setting of björnson 's _ sigurd the crusader bergliot _ base upon the saga of the norse king a suite compose for the two hundredth anniversary of ludwig holberg and a number of choice chamber music piece it may be remark that edvard grieg have not only give norway a conspicuous place on the map of musical europe but that he have influence unmistakably composer of the rank of tschaikowsky the russian paderewskus the pole eugene d'albert the scotch-english-german richard strauss the german and we own lament edward mcdowell the american from every point of view that interest the music lover say mr finck grieg be one of the most original genius in the musical world of the present or past he song be a mine of melody surpass in wealth only by schubert 's and that only because there be more of schubert 's in originality of harmony and modulation he have only six equal : bach schubert chopin schumann wagner and liszt in rythmic invention and combination he be inexhaustible and as orchestrator he rank among the most fascinating to speak of such a man -- seven-eighths of whose work be still music of the future -- as a writer of ` dialect ' be surely the acme of unintelligence if grieg do stick to the fjord and never get out of it even he german critic ought to thank heaven for it grieg in a fjord be much more picturesque and more interesting to the world than he would have be in the elbe or the spree while norway have neither permanent opera nor permanent orchestra she have produce concert virtuoso of a high order ole bull the so-called violin-king already refer to be unsurpassed in he day among piano artist may be name the talented composer mr agatha backer-gröndahl thoma thellefsen edmund neupert martin knutzen and the great composer edvard grieg the flutist olaf svenssen and the vocal artist thorvald lammer

latter year she organize a woman 's suffrage association deliver a series of lecture on the subject and establish a newspaper call the _ nyloende _ -- mean the new ground miss krog be something over

continue the fight to secure the right of participation in national as well as municipal affair and believe that the woman will have all the political rights of man in norway within the next few year

with man and many woman be take advantage of the opportunity to secure the higher education and if ever like the woman of finland they be allow to sit in parliament they will be amply fit to do so under the present law only woman who pay a certain amount of tax can vote a unmarried woman living at home be deprive of the ballot unless she have a income of she own a married woman can not vote unless either she or she husband have a stated income thus many of the most intelligent and progressive woman of the country be still outside the suffrage line everybody in norway who earn a dollar pay a income tax it may be very small but a certain percentage of each day 's wages of every peasant go into the government treasury every person in norway declare that it be the least objectionable means of raise money for national and municipal expense that have ever be try there and that it stimulate the patriotism of the people who realize that they be contributor to the support of they government and should take a active interest in its management many of the wisest man in norway consider the universal suffrage amendment to the constitution which be pass in 1898 a mistake for this reason -- because it remove a powerful incentive for man to accumulate money the norwegian have a large and natural fund of patriotism he love he country like the swiss nowhere else do man and woman have to work so hard for a living but life be the more precious the harder one have to labor to sustain it we value thing accord to they cost in the tropics where no man need work human life be hold cheaply man die and kill without compunction they excite revolution and overthrow government spare neither themselves nor other but in norway as in switzerland where it be a ceaseless struggle from the cradle to the grave there be more national pride and patriotism than in any land and the privilege of living and work and suffer be esteem as the most precious inheritance of man woman in america who be work for the ballot have only to go to norway to find that have a voice in the making of the law of the country do not remove every obstacle to the progress of the sex that there be still many injustice and that the woman work as hard as the man the norwegian woman usually carry a little more than she share of the load and can support a husband without difficulty if he insist upon it there be nothing so admirable in this world as a useful woman particularly if she be marry to a man incline to leisure and loafing in norway and other country of northern europe the ballad i love to see my dear old mother work be something more than a affectionate sentiment it have a practical significance and be frequently find in husband as well as son of all the labor that the woman of norway engage in especially woman in the rural district be the occupation of care for the _ saeter _ a _ saeter _ be a summer ranch or dairy farm peculiar to norway -- a cabin among the pasture way up in the mountain where the cattle be drive during the summer month and butter and cheese be make almost every large farmer have a _ saeter _ when the spring field work at home have be finish the cattle be

where hay be make and where the younger member of the flock be protect the cattle be call at night by a horn make of birch bark when blow lustily it give a clear note not unlike the cornet and the cattle invariably respond to its sound there be a good deal of romance about _ saeter _ life in book but i should say that there be very little in actual experience many of the charming fairy story in norwegian literature have they scene in those mountain dairy the _ saeter _ girl -lrb- _ saeterjenter _ they be call -rrb- have a peculiar and melodious cattle call know as the _ huldrelok _ which be say to have be inherit from the _ huldre-folk _ a species of fairy that be very pretty but unfortunately have tail usually a young farmer fall in love with one of the girl and when he discover that she have a tail be so shocked and disappointed that he throw himself over a precipice or perhaps the _ huldre-folk _ gobble he up and carry he off into the mountain of the _ josteldalsbra _ and keep he there while the girl he leave behind he grieve herself to death because of he desertion the dairy maid be suppose to have a peculiar costume and photograph be often see of they array in picturesque dress but i never see they worn in all the _ saeter _ i visit the clothes worn be very plain and ordinary and seem to have be select for wear and not for look we visit a _ saeter _ one day and find two young people in charge a boy and a girl neither of they over seventeen we should judge from appearance they herd consist of fifteen cow and they expect to remain in that desolate country two or three month make cheese and butter we little _ saeterjenta _ have the heart of a poet although she brother seem stupid and even liberal present of money do not wake he up or make he interesting i do not suppose that this child have ever be twenty mile from the humble cabin in which she be bear but the wide wide world have be open to she through the book she have study at school she could talk a little english and know a good deal about the united state she have a brother in minnesota and many of the boy and girl in the neighborhood have go across the atlantic and find home on the saeterless
