produce by suzanne shell sandra bannatyne and pg distribute proofreader bull hunter by max brand bull hunter chapter 1 it be the big central taproot which baffle they they have hew easily through the great side root large as branch cover with soft brown bark they have dig down and cut through the forest of tender small root below but when they have pass the main body of the stump and work under it they find that they hole around the trunk be not large enough in diameter to enable they to reach to the taproot and cut through it they could only reach it feebly with the hatchet fray it but there be no chance for a free swing to sever the tough wood instead of widen the hole at once they keep labor at the root work the stump back and forth as though they hope to crystallize that stubborn taproot and snap it like a wire still it hold and defy they they lay hold of it together and tug with a grunt something tear beneath that effort but the stump hold and upward progress cease they stop too tired for profanity and gaze down the mountainside after the manner of baffled man who look far off from the thing that trouble they they could tell by the tree that it be a high altitude there be no cottonwood though the cottonwood will follow a stream for more than a mile above sea level far below they a pale mist obscure the beautiful silver spruce which have reach they upward limit around the cabin march a scattering of the balsam fir they be nine thousand foot above the sea at least still higher up the sallow forest of lodgepole pine begin and above these beyond the timberline rise the bald summit itself they be big man frame for such a country defy the roughness with a roughness of they own -- these stalwart son of old bill campbell both harry and joe campbell be fully six foot tall with mighty bone and sinew and work-toughened muscle to justify they stature behind they stand they home a shack better suit for the housing of cattle than of man but such leather-skinned man as these be more tender to they horse than to themselves they sleep and eat in the shack but they live in the wind and the sun although they have look down the stern slope to the lower rocky they do not see the girl who follow the loosely wind trail she be partly sheltered by the fir and come out just above they they begin moil at the stump again sweating cursing and the girl halt she horse near by the profanity do not distress she she be so accustomed to it that the word have lose all edge and point for she but she freckled face stir to a smile of pleasure at the sight of they strength as they alternately smite at the taproot and then strive in creak grunt unison to work it loose they remain so long oblivious of she presence that at length she call why do not you dig a bigger hole boy she laugh in delight as they jerk up they head in astonishment she laughter be young and sweet to the ear but there be not a great deal outside she laughter that be attractive about she however joe and harry gape and grin and blush at she in the time-old fashion for she live in a country where to be a woman be sufficient beauty be a unnecessary luxury soon tax out of existence by the life she possess the main essential of social power she could dance unflaggingly from dark to dawn at the nearest schoolhouse dance chatter every minute and she could maintain a rugged silence from dawn to dark again as she ride she pony home harry campbell take off he hat not in politeness but to scratch he head say jessie where would you drop from do not see you come no way maybe i come down like rain say jessie all three laugh heartily at this jest jessie swing sidewise in she saddle with the lithe grace of a boy drop she elbow on the high pommel and give advice you get a pretty bad taproot under yonder better chop out a bigger hole boy but say what you clear this here land for be not no good for nothing be it she look around she here and there the clear around the shanty eat raggedly into the forest but still the plow land be chop up with a jut of boulder sure it be not no good for nothing say joe it be just the old man 's idea he jerk a grimy thumb over he shoulder to indicate the control and absent power of the old man somewhere in the wood sure make he glum when we be not work if they be not nothing worthwhile to do he always set we to grub up root and if we be not diggin ' up root we get to get out old ` maggie ' mare and try to plow plow in rock like they nobody but bull can do it i do not know bull could do nothing say the girl with interest aw he be a fool right enough say harry but he just have a sort of head for know where the rock be under the ground and somehow he seem to make old maggie hoss know where they lie too outside of that he sure be not no good everybody know that kind of too bad he be not get no brain say the girl all he strength be in he back and none be in he head my dad say if he have some part of sense he would be a powerful good hand sure would be agree harry but he be not no good now give he a ax maybe and he hit one or two wallopin ' lick with it and then stand and rest on the handle and start to dream like a fool same way with everything but say joe maybe he could start this stump out of the hole but i see you both try to get the stump up say the girl in wonder get bull mad and he can lift a pile joe assure she go find he harry harry obediently shout bull oh bull there be no answer most like he be read observe joe he do not never hear nothing then go look for he harry big harry stride to the door of the hut how come he understand book say the girl i could not never make nothing out of 'em I neither agree joe in sympathy but maybe bull do not understand he just like to read because he can sit still and do it never be a lazier gent than bull harry turn at the door of the shack yep reading he announce with disgust he cup he hand over he mouth and bellow through the doorway hey there be a startled grunt within a deep heavy voice and a thick articulation presently a huge man come into the doorway and lean there he figure fill it there be nothing freakish about he build he be simply over-normal in bulk from the big head to the heavy foot he be no more than a youth in age but the great size and the bewildered puckering of he forehead make he seem older the book be still in he hand hey return harry we do not call you out here to read to we leave the book behind bull look down at the book in he hand seem to waken from a trance then with a muffle sound of apology drop the book behind he come here he slump out from the house he gait be like he body he stride large and loose the lack of nervous energy which keep he mind from a high tension be show again in the heavy fall of he foot and the forward slump of he head he hand dangle aimlessly at he side as though in need of occupation a ragged thatch of blond hair cover he head and it be sunburned to straw color at the edge he costume be equally rough he wear no belt but one strap from he right hip cross behind he back over the bulge muscle of he shoulder to the front of he left hip the trousers which this simple brace support be patch overalls fray to loose thread halfway down the calf where they be meet by the top of immense cowhide boot as for the shirt the sleeve be inch too short and the unbuttoned cuff flap around the burly forearm if it have be fasten together at the throat he would have choke he seem in a word to be bulge out of he clothes one expect a mighty rending if he make a strong effort this bulk of a man slouch forward with step both huge and hesitant pause between they when he see the girl he stop short and he brow pucker more than before one feel that come from the shadow he be daze and startle by the brilliant mountain sunshine and the eye be dull and alarmed it be a handsome face in a way but a little too heavy with flesh too inert like the rest of he body and he muscular movement she be not go to bite you say harry campbell come on over here to the stump he whisper to the girl laugh at he she obey he command it bring a flush to the face of bull hunter and make he head bow he shuffle to the stump and stand aimlessly beside it get down into the hole you fool order joe he and harry take a certain pride in order they cousin around it be like perform with a lion in the presence of a lady it be manipulate a elephant by power of the unaided voice slowly bull hunter drop he great foot into the hole and then raise he head a little and look wistfully to the brother for further order but only half he mind be with they the other half be with the story in the book there quentin durward have be nod at he guard in the castle and the evil-faced little king have just spring out and wrench the weapon from the hand of the sleepy boy bull hunter could see the story clearly very clearly the scar on the face of le balafré glisten for he he have veritably taste the little round loaf of french bread that the adventurer have eat with the pseudo-merchant but to step out of that world of word into this keen sunlight -- ah there be the difference the mind which one find in the page of a book be understandable but the mind of live man -- how terrible they be one could never tell what pass behind the bright eye of other human being they mock one when they seem sad they might be about to laugh the mind of the two brother elude he mock he slip from beneath the slow grasp of he comprehension they whip he with they scorn they dodge he with they wit they bewilder he with they mockery but they be nothing compare with the laughter of the girl it go through he like the flash and point of le balafré 's long sword he be helpless before that sound of mirth he want to hold up he hand and cower away from she and from she dancing eye so he stand ponderous tortured and the three pair of clear eye watch he and enjoy he torture better far better that dark castle in ancient france and the wicked oliver and the yet more wicked loui lay hold on that stump shout harry he hear the direction through a haze it be twice repeat before he bow and set he great hand upon the ragged projection where the side root have be cut away he settle he grip and wait he be glad because this bow position give he a chance to look down to the ground and avoid they cruel eye how bright those eye be think bull and how clearly they see all thing he never doubt the justice behind they judgment of he all that bull ask from the world be a merciful silence -- to let he grub in he book now and then or else to tell he how to go about some simple work such as digging with a pick here one 's muscle work and there be no problem to disturb wit which be still gather wool in the page of some old tale but they be shrill new direction at he perhaps they have be call to he several time you blame idiot be you goin ' to stand there all day we do not give you that stump to rest on pull it up he start with a sense of guilt and tug up he finger slip off they separate grip and the stump though it groan against the taproot under the strain do not come out it do not seem to budge somehow say bull in he big soft plaintive voice then he wait for the laughter there be always laughter no matter what he do or say but he never grow callouse against it it be the one pain which ever pierce the mist of he brain and cut he to the quick and he be right there be laughter again he stand suffer mutely under it the girl 's face become grave she murmur to harry ever try praisin ' to big stupid he be you joshin ' I jessie what be he ever do to be praise about you watch say the girl grow excite with she idea she call say bull he lift he head but not he eye those eye study the impatient foot of the girl 's mustang he wait for another stroke of wit that would bring forth a fresh shower of laughter at he expense bull you be mighty big and strong about the biggest and strongest man i ever see be this a new and subtle form of mockery he wait dully i see harry and joe both try to pull up that root and they could not so much as budge it but i bet you could do it all alone bull you just try i bet you could it amaze he he lift he eye at length he face suffuse with a flush he big cloudy eye be glisten with moisture d'you mean that he ask huskily for this terrible clear-eyed creature this mock mind this alert cruel wit be actually speak word of confidence a great dim joy well up in the heart of bull hunter he shake the forelock out of he eye you just try will you bull i 'll try he bow again he thick finger seek for a grip find place work down through the soft dirt and the pulpy bark to solid wood and then he begin to lift it be a gradual process he knee give sag under the strain from the arm then the back begin to grow rigid and the leg in turn grow stiff as every muscle fall into play the shoulder push forward and down the forearm reveal by the short sleeve show a bewildering tangle of cord muscle and at the wrist the tendon spring out as distinct and white as the new string of a violin the three spectator be undergo a change the suppress grin of the two brother fade they glance at the girl to see if she be not laugh at the result of she word to big bull but the girl be stare she have set that mighty power to work and she be amaze by the thing she see and they look back at bull be amaze in turn they have see he lift great log wrench boulder from the earth but always it have be a proverb within the campbell family that bull would make only one attempt and fail in the first effort would try no more they have never see the mysterious resource of he strength call upon now they watch first the settling and then the expansion of the body of they big cousin he shoulder begin to tremble they hear deep harsh panting like the breathing of a horse as it tug a ponderous load up a hill and still he have not reach the limit of he power he seem to grow into the soil and he foot ground deeper into the soft dirt and ever there be something in he remain to be tap it seem to the brother to be merely vast unexplored recess of muscle but even then it be a prodigious thing to watch the strain on the stump increase moment by moment that something of the spirit be be call upon to aid in the work be quite beyond they comprehension there be something like a groan from bull -- a queer animal sound that make all three spectator shiver where they stand for it show that the limit of that apparently inexhaustible strength have be reach and that now the anguish of last effort be go into the work they see the head bow lower the shoulder be now bunch and swell up on either side then come a faint rend sound like cloth slowly tear it be answer by something strangely like a snarl from the laborer something jerk through he body as though a whip have be flick across he back with a great rending and a loud snap the big stump come up a little shower of dirt spout up with the parting of the taproot the trunk be fling high but not out of the hand of bull hunter he whirl it around he head laugh there be a ring and clearness in that laughter that they have never hear before he dash the stump on the ground it be out exclaim bull look there he stride upon they as he straighten up he become huger than ever they shrink from he -- from the vein which still bulge on he forehead and from the sweat and pallor of that vast effort the very mustang wince from this mountain of a man who come with a long sweeping spring stride on he face be a strange joy as of the explorer who top the mountain and see the beauty of the promised land beneath he he hold out he hand lady i get to thank you you -- teach I how but she shrink from he outstretched hand -- as though she have labor to a larger end than she dream and be terrify by the thing she have make you -- you get a red stain on you hand oh he come to a stop sharply the sharp edge where the root have be cut away have work through the skin and he hand be literally cake with mud and stain red bull look down at he hand vaguely it come to harry that bull be take up a trifle too much of jessie 's attention the next thing they know she would be invite he to come to the next dance down she way and they would have the big hulk of a man shame himself and he uncle 's family go on back to the house he order sharply we do not have no more need of you bull obey stumble along and still look down at he wounded hand chapter 2 he leave the three behind he bewildered and frightened have lightning split a thick tree beside they or a unexpected landslide thunder past and sweep the ground away at they foot they could have be hardly more disturbed who have of thought he could act like that remark joe my gosh jessie they go and look at the hole where the stump have stand at the bottom be the white remnant of the taproot where it have burst under the strain it be not so much how he pull up the stump say the girl faintly but -- but do you see he face boy after he heave the stump up i -- just pick that stump up will you they go to the misshapen ragged monster and lift it puff under the weight all right they drop it obediently and he -- he just swing it around he head like it be nothing declare the girl look how it smash into the gravel where he throw it down why -- why -- i do not know man be make like that and he face -- the way he laugh -- why he do not look like no fool at all boy but just as if he would wake up you act so interested say harry campbell dryly that maybe you would like to have we call he out again so 's you can talk to he apparently she do not hear but stare down into the mist of the late afternoon warn she that she must start home she seem puzzle and a little frightened when she leave they it be with a wave of the hand and with no word of farewell they watch she go down the trail that jerk back and forth across the pitch of the slope twice she pony stumble a sure sign that the rider be absent-minded jessie do not seem to know what to make of it say harry neither do i return he brother both of they speak in subdue voice as if they be afraid of be overhear and think if he would ever lay a hold on one of we like that say harry he go to the stump and examine the side of one of the root it be stain with crimson look where he finger tip work through the dirt and the bark right down to the solid wood murmur joe they look at each other uneasily my gosh say joe think of the way i handle he the other night he -- he let I trip he up and throw he he shudder why if he would lay hold of I just once he would of squashed my muscle like they be rotten fruit of one accord they turn back to the house at the door they pause and peer in as into the den of a bear there sit bull on the floor -- he risk he weight to none of the crazy chair -- still look at he stain hand then they draw back and again look at each other with scared eye and speak in undertone after this maybe he will not want to follow order maybe he 'll get sort of free and easy and independent if he do you watch dad give he he march order dad will not have no one lifting head agin ' he neither will i snap joe i guess we own this house i guess we support that big hulk i be go to try he right quick he go back to the door of the shack bull they be not any wood for the stove tonight go chop some quick the floor squeak and groan under bull 's weight as he rise and again the brother look to each other all right come cheerily from bull hunter he come through the door with he ax and go to the log pile the brother watch he throw aside the top log and get at the heavier trunk underneath he tear one of these out lay it in place and the sun flash on the swift circle of the ax joe and harry step back as though the light have blind they he do not never work like that before declare joe the ax be bury almost to the haft in the tough wood and the steel be wrenching out with a squeak of the metal against the resist wood again the blinding circle and the indescribable sound of the ax 's impact slice through the wood a great chip snap up high over the shoulder of the chopper and drop solidly to the ground at the foot of the brother again they exchange glance and draw a little closer together the log divide under the shower of eat blow and bull attack the next section presently he come to a pause lean on the handle of the ax and stare into the distance at this the brother sigh with relief i guess he be not change so much say harry but it be queer eh kind of like a bear wake up after he would be sleep all winter they jar bull out of he dream with a shout and set he to work again then they start the preparation for the evening meal the simple preparation be soon complete but after the potato be boil they delay fry the bacon for they father old bill campbell have not yet return from he hunting trip and he dislike long-cooked food thing have to be freshly serve to suit bill and he son dare the wrath of heaven rather than the bite reproach of the old man it be strange that bill delay he come so long as a rule he be always back before the come of evening a old and practice mountaineer he have never be know to lose sense of direction or sense of distance and he be a hour overdue when the sun go down and the soft beautiful mountain twilight begin there be other reason which would ordinarily have disturb bill and bring he home even ahead of time snow have fall heavily above the timberline a few day before and now the keen whistling of the wind and the swift curtaining of cloud which be draw across the sky threaten a new storm that might even reach down to the shack and yet no bill appear the brother wait in the shack and the darkness be increase any one of a number of thing might have happen to they father but they be not worry for one thing they waste no love on the stern old man they know well enough that he have plenty of money but he keep they here to a dog 's life in the shack and they hate he for it besides they have a keen grievance which obscure any worry about bill -- they be hungry wildly hungry the darkness set in and the feeble light wander from the smoked chimney of the lantern and make the window black outside the wind begin to scream sigh in the distance among the fir and then pounce upon the cabin and shake it as though in rage the fire would smoke in the stove at every one of these blast and the flame leap in the lantern bull hunter have to lean closer to the light and frown to make out the print of he book the sight of he stolid immobility merely sharpen they hunger for there be never any passion in this hulk of a man when he relax over a book the world go out like a snuffed candle for he he read slowly linger over every page for now and again he eye drift away from the print and he dream over what he have read in reality he be not read for the plot but for the picture he find and he dread come to the end of a book also for book be rare in he life a scrap of a magazine be a treasure a full volume be a nameless delight and so he work slowly through every paragraph and make it he and dream over it until he know every thought and every picture by heart once slowly devour in this way it be useless to reread a book it be far better to simply sit and let the slow memory of it trail through he mind link by link just as he have first read it and with all the embroidering which he own fancy have conjure up often this stupid ponder over a book would madden the two brother it irritated they till they would move the lantern away from he but he always follow the light with a sigh and uncomplainingly settle down again sometimes they even snatch the book out of he hand in that case he sit look down at he empty finger dream over he own thought as contentedly as though the living page be in he vision there be small satisfaction in torment he in these way tonight they dare not bother he the stain hand be still in they mind and the tremendous joyous laughter as he whirl the stump over he head still ring in they ear but they watch he with a sullen envy of he immobility just as a man without a overcoat envy the woolly coat of a dog on a windy December day only one sound rouse the reader it be a sudden loud snort from the shed behind the house and a dull trample that come to he through the noise of the rise wind it bring bull lurch to he foot and the stove jingle as he weight strike the yield center board of the floor out into the blackness he stride the wind shut around he at once and plaster he clothes against he body as if he have be drench to the skin in water then he close the door what brung he to life ask harry nothin ' he just hear ol' maggie snort always bother he when maggie get scared of something -- the old fool maggie be a ancient broken-down draft horse strange vicissitude have bring she up into the mountain via the log camp she be keep not because there be any real haul to be do for bill campbell but because have get she for nothing she remind he of the bargain she have be and bull apparently understand the sluggish nature of the old mare by sympathy of kind use to work she to the single plow among the rock of they clearing here every autumn they plant seed that never grow to mature grain but that be bill campbell 's idea of make a home presently bull come back and settle with a slump into he old place go to snow ask harry yep feel it in the wind it be a old joke among they for bull often declare with ridiculous solemnity that he could foretell snow by the change in the air yep answer bull i feel the wind he look up at they abashed but they be too hungry to waste breath with laughter they merely sneer at he as he settle back into he book and just as he head bow a far shout sweep down at they as the wind veer to a new point uncle bill say bull and rise again to open the door the other wedge in behind he bulk and stare into the blackness chapter 3 they stand with the wind take they with its tooth and press they heavily back they could hear the fire flare and flutter in the stove then the wind scream again and the wail come down to they uncle bill repeat bull and lower he head stride into the storm the other exchange frightened glance and then follow but not outside of the shaft of light from the door in the first place it be probably not they father who could imagine bill shout for help such a thing have never be dream of by he worst enemy and they know that they father 's be legion besides it be cold and this be a wild-goose chase which mean a chill hide and no gain but presently through the darkness they make out the form of a horseman and the great bulk of bull come back beside he then they run out into the night they recognize the hatless squat figure of they father at once even in the dark with the wind twitch he beard sideways when they call to he he do not speak then they see that bull be lead the horse plainly something be wrong and presently they discover that bill campbell be actually tie upon he horse he give no order and they cut the rope in silence still he do not dismount bull he command lift I off the hoss the giant pluck he out of the saddle and place he on the ground but he leg buckle under he and he fall forward on he face any of the three could have save he but the spectacle of the terrible old man 's helplessness benumb they sens and they muscle carry I in say bill at last bull lift he and bear he gingerly through the door and place he on the bunk the light reveal a grisly spectacle crimson stain and dirt literally cover he he left leg be bandage below the knee he right shoulder be roughly splint with small twig and swathe in cloth the long ride with he leg tie in place have apparently paralyzed he nerve below the hip he remain crushed against the wall he leg fall in the odd position in which they be put down by bull it be illustrative of he character that even in this crisis not one of the three dare venture a expression of sympathy a question a suggestion crumple against the wall he head bow forward and cramp the stern old man still control they with the upward glance of he eye through the shag of eyebrow gimme my pipe he command three hand reach for it -- pipe tobacco match be proffer to he before he accept the article he sweep they face with a glance of satisfaction without attempt to change the position which must have be torture he he fill the pipe bowl he finger move as if he have partially lose control of they he fill it raggedly shred of tobacco hang down around the bowl he bent he head to meet the left hand which he raise with difficulty then he try to light a match but he seem incapable of move the sulphur head fast enough to bring it to a light with friction match after match crumble as he continue he effort here lemme light a match for you dad harry 's offer be receive with a silent curling of the lip and a glint of the yellow tooth beneath that make he step back the old man continue he work there be a dozen wreck match before the blood begin to stir in he numbed arm and he be able to light the match and the pipe he draw several breath of the smoke deep into he lung for the moment the savage hungry satisfaction change he face they could tell by that alteration what agony he have be suffer before presently he frown and set about change he position with infinite labor the left leg be helpless and so be the right arm yet after much labor he manage to stuff a roll of the blanket into the corner and then shift himself until he back rest against this support but he strength desert he again he pipe be drop down in the left hand he head sag back still they dare not approach he he two son stand about shift from one foot to another as if they expect a blow to descend upon they at any moment as if each labor movement of terrible old bill campbell cause they the agony which he must be suffer as for bull hunter he sit again on the floor he chin drop upon he great fist and wonder for a time at he uncle it be the second great event to he all in one day first he have discover that by fight a thing one can actually conquer second he discover that great fighter he uncle have be beat the impossible have happen twice between one sunrise and sunset but man and the affair of man could not hold he eye overlong presently he drop he head again and be deep in the page of he book at length bill campbell heave up he head it be to glare into the scared face of he son how long be you goin ' to keep I wait for food the order snap they into action they spring here and there and presently the thick slice of bacon be hiss on the pan and the cloud of bacon smoke waft through the cabin when they reach bill campbell he blink pain have give he a maddening appetite yet he puff steadily on he pipe and say nothing the tin plate of potato and bacon be shove before he and the big tin cup of coffee the three younger man sit in silence and devour they own meal the two son swiftly but bull hunter fall into musing and part of he food remain uneaten then he glance wander to he uncle and see a thing to wonder at -- a horrible thing in its own way the nerveless left hand of the mountaineer which have barely possess steadiness to light a match be far too inaccurate to handle a fork and bull see he uncle stuff he mouth with he finger and daring the other to watch he something like pity come to bull it be so rare a emotion to connect with human being that he hardly recognize it for man and woman as he know they be brilliant clever creature perfectly at home in the midst of difficulty that appal he but as he watch the old man feed himself like a animal the emotion that rise in bull be the sadness he feel when he watch old maggie stumble among the rock there be something wrong with the foreleg of maggie and she be only half a horse when it come to go downhill on broken ground he have always think of the great strength that once must have be hers and he pity she for the change he find himself pity uncle bill campbell in much the same way when bill raise he tin cup he spill scalding coffee on he breast the old man merely set he tooth and continue to glare he challenge at the three but not one of the three dare speak a word dare make a offer of assistance what baffle the slow mind of bull hunter be the effort to imagine a force so great that battle with it have reduce the invincible campbell to this shake wreck of he old self mere bullet could tear wound in flesh and break bone but mere bullet could not wreck the nerve of a man so that he hand tremble as if he be drunk or hysterical with weariness he try to work out this problem he conceive a man of gigantic size vast muscle inexhaustible strength the power of a bear and the swift cunning of a wild cat -- such must have be the man who strike down uncle bill and send he home a shatter remnant of he old self there be another mystery why do the destroyer not finish he task why do he take pity on uncle bill campbell and bind up the wound he have himself make here the mind of bull hunter pause he could not pass the mysterious idea of another than himself pity uncle bill it be pity a hawk in the sky harry be take away the dish and throw they in the little tub of lukewarm water where the grease would be carelessly souse off they do you get up that stump ask uncle bill suddenly there be a familiar ring in he voice woe to they if they have not carry out he order all three of the young man quake and bull lay aside he book we do it answer joe in a quavering voice you do it ask bill we -- we dig she pretty well clear then bull pull she up some of the wrath ebb out of the face of bill as he glance at the huge form of bull stand up he order bull arise the keen eye of the old man go over he from head to foot slowly someday he say slowly speak entirely to himself someday -- maybe what he expect from bull someday remain unknown the dishwash be swiftly finish then uncle bill make a feeble effort to get off he boot but he strength have be ebb for some time he son dare not interfere as the old man lean slowly over and strove to tug the boot from he wounded leg but bull remember all in a flood of tenderness some half-dozen small kind thing that he uncle have say to he that be long long ago when the orphan come into the campbell family in those day he stupidity have be attribute largely to the speed with which he have grow and he be expect to become normally bright later on and in those day bill campbell occasionally let fall some gentle word to the great boy with he big frightened eye and the half-dozen instance come back to bull in this moment he step between he cousin and lay he hand on the foot of he uncle it bring a snarl from the old man a snarl that make bull straighten and step back but he come again and put aside the shake hand of uncle bill he cousin stand at one side literally quake it be the first time that they have actually see they father defy they see the huge hand of bull settle around the leg of they father well below the wound and then the grip close to avoid the danger of open the wound when the boot be work off after this he pull the tight ride boot slowly from the swollen foot uncle bill be no longer silent the moment the big hand of he nephew close over he leg he launch a stream of curse that chill the blood and drive he own son farther back into the shadow of the corner he demand that they stand forth and tear bull limb from limb he disinherit they for cowardice he threaten bull with a vengeance compare with which the thunderbolt would be a feeble flare of light he swear that he be entirely capable of take care of himself that he would step down into he grave sooner than be nurse and pet by any live human be all the while the great bull lean impassively over the wounded man and finally work the boot free that be not all uncle bill have slip over until he could reach a billet of wood beside he bunk he strike at bull 's head with it but the stick be brush out of he palsied finger with a single gesture and while uncle bill groan with fury and impotence bull continue the task of prepare he for bed he straighten the old body of the terrible campbell he heat water in the tub and wash away stain and dirt he take off the stain bandage and replace they with clean one he cousin help in the latter part of this work weakness have reduce uncle bill to speechlessness finally the head of bill campbell be lay on a double fold of blanket in lieu of a pillow a pipe have be tamp full and light by bull and -- crowning insult -- set between bill 's tooth when all this be accomplish bull retire to he corner pick up he book and be instantly absorb in the hushed atmosphere it seem that a terrible blow have fall and that another be about to fall harry and joe be as man stunned but they look upon they father with a gathering complacency they have find it demonstrate that it be possible to disobey they father without be instantly destroy they be take the lesson to heart and indeed old bill campbell himself seem to be slowly admit that he be beat the illusion of absolute self-sufficiency which he have build up through the year for the sake of impose upon he son and bull hunter be now destroy at a single stroke he have be expose as a old man already beat in battle by a foeman and now require as much care as a sick woman the shame of it burn in he but the comfort of the smooth bunk and the fill pipe between he tooth be a blessing he find to he own surprise that he be not hate bull with a tithe of he usual vigor he begin to realize that he have come to the end of he period of command when he leave that sickb he could only advise as a king about to die he look at he heir and find they strong and sufficient and please to the eye nowhere in the mountain be there two boy as tall as straight as deadly with rifle and revolver as fierce as relentless as these two boy of he he have sharpen they temper and he rejoice in the sullen ferocity with which they look at he now unlove cunning bide they time and finding that it have almost come but he be not yet do he body be wreck there remain he mind and they would find it a great power but he do not talk until the light have be put out and the three youth be in they separate bunk then without the light to show they he helpless body in the darkness which would give he mind a freer play he begin to tell he story it be a long narrative far back in the year he have prospect with a youth name pete reeve they have locate a claim and they have go to town together to celebrate in the celebration he have drunk with reeve till the boy stupefy then he have induce reeve to gamble for he share of the claim and have win it afterward pete swear to be even with he but the year have go by without another meeting of the man only today ride through the mountain he have come on a dried-up wisp of a man with long iron-gray hair a sharp withered face and hand like the claw of a bird he ride a fine bay gelding and have stop bill to ask some question about the region above the timberline because he be drift south and intend to cross the summit bill have describe the way and suddenly out of they talk come the revelation of they identity -- the one be bill campbell the other be pete reeve at this point in the story bull heave himself slowly softly up on one arm to listen he be begin to get the full sense of the word for the first time this narrative be like a book do in a commoner language chapter 4 the tale halt to be defeat be one thing to be force to confess defeat be another uncle bill determine on the bitterer alternative he make a clean fight declare uncle bill first he cuss I out proper then he go for he gat and he beat I to the draw they be not no disgrace to that you 'll learn pretty soon that anybody might get beat sooner or later -- if he fight enough man and my gun hang in the leather before i get it on he he would shoot I clean through the right shoulder -- a place shot boy he want to land I there it tumble I off my hoss i roll away and try to get to my gun that have fall on the ground he shoot I ag ` in through the leg and stop I then he get off he hoss and fix up the wound he do a good job as you see ` bill ' say he ` you be not dead you be worse 'n dead that right arm of yours be go to be stiff the rest of you day you be a one-armed man from now on and that one arm be the worst you get ' that be why he send I home alive to make I live and keep hate he the same 's he would live and hate I but he make a mistake pete reeve be a wise fox but he make one mistake he forget that i might have somebody to send on he trail he do not know that i have two boy i would raise so 's they be each better with a gun nor I he do not dream of that curse he but when you harry or you joe pump the lead into he shoot he so be he 'll live long enough to know who kill he and why as he speak there be a quality in he voice that seem to find the boy in the darkness and point each of they out which of you take the trail a little silence follow bull wonder at it he be go by way of johnstown continue the wounded man if one of you cut across the summit toward shantung he be pretty sure to cut in across pete 's trail which be goin ' to start well you can match for the chance because he that come back with pete reeve mark off the slate be a man that chilly little silence make bull 's heart beat to be call a man to be praise by stern bill campbell -- surely these be thing to make anyone risk death be that the pete reeve say harry 's voice that shoot up mike river over the hill to the tompkin place about four year back that be he why again the silence then bull hear the old man cursing softly -- meditatively one might almost have say cut across for johnstown say joe softly in a storm like this they will not be no trail leave to find above the timberline it would be sure death listen there be a lull in the wind and in the breeze that be leave they could hear the whisper of the snow crush steadily against the window it be heavy fall right enough declare harry and this pete reeve -- why he be a gunfighter dad and what be you ask the old man be not i labor and slave all my life to make you handy with gun what for d'you think i waste all they hour showin ' you how to pull a trigger and where to shoot and how to get a gun out of the leather to kill for meat suggest harry meat nothing the kind of meat i mean walk on two foot and fight back maybe if we start together -- venture joe he father break in boy i be not go to send out a pack of man to run down pete reeve he meet I single and he fight I clean and he be go to be pull down by no pack of yaller dog go one of you alone or else both of you stay here he wait but there be no response be this the way my blood be showin ' up in my son be this the result of all my trainin ' after that there be no more talk the long silence be not break by even the sound of breathing until someone begin to snore then bull know that the sleep of the night have settle down he lay with he hand fold behind he head think they be willing enough to go together to do this difficult thing but have they not lift together at the stump and fail to do the thing which he have do single-handed that think stick in he memory and would not out and suppose he bull be to accomplish this great feat and return to the shack would not bill campbell feel doubly repay for the living he have furnish for he nephew more than once the grim old man have curse the luck that saddle he with a stupid incubus but the curse would turn to compliment if bull leave this little man this catlike and dangerous fighter this pete reeve dead on the trail not that all this be clear in the mind of bull but he feel something like a command push he on that difficult south trail through the storm and the snow that would now be pile above the timberline he wait until there be no noise but the snore of the sleeper and the rush and roar of the wind which continually set something stir in the room these sound serve to cover effectually any noise he make as he feel about and make up he small pack he old canvas coat he most treasured article of apparel he take down from the hook where it accumulate dust from month to month he ancient secondhand cartridge belt with the antiquated revolver he remove from another hook -- he have never be give enough ammunition to become a shot of any quality -- and he push quickly into the night the moment he be through the door the storm catch he in the face a stinging blow and the rush of snow chill he skin that sting blow steady to a blast it be a tremendous heavy fall the wind have scour the drift from the clearing and be already bank they around the little house in the morning as like as not the boy would have to dig they way out he go straight to the horse shed for he snowshoe that hang on the wall there ordinary snowshoe would not endure he ponderous weight and uncle bill campbell have fashion these himself heavy and uncomfortable article but capable of endure the strain fumble he way down behind the stall bill 's roan lash out at he with savage heel but maggie the old draft horse whinny softly greet that familiar heavy step he tie the snowshoe on he back and then stop for a last word to maggie she raise she head and drop it clumsily on he shoulder she be among the little agile mountain pony what he be among man and they bulk have render each of they more or less helpless there seem to be a mute understanding between they and it be never more apparent than when maggie whinny gently in he ear he stroke she big bony head a lump form in he throat if the bullet of little pete reeve drop he in some far-off trail the old-broken-down horse would be the only living creature that would mourn for he outside the night and the storm swallow he at once before he have go fifty foot the house be out of sight then enter the forest of balsam fir the force of the wind be lessen and he make good time up the first part of the grade there would probably be no use for the snowshoe in this region of broken shrubbery before he come to the timberline he sweep on with a lengthen stride he know this part of the country like a book of course and he seldom stumble save when he come out into a clearing and the wind smite at he from a unexpected angle in one of these clearing he stop and take stock of he position far away to the west and the south the head of scalped mountain be lose in dim rush cloud he must make for that goal progress become less easy almost at once the tree that grow in this elevated region be not tall enough to act as wind break they be hardly more than shrub a great deal of the time and merely serve to force he into detour around dense hedge sometimes in a clearing he find himself stagger to the knee in a compacted drift of snow sometimes a immense sheet of snow be pick up by the wind and fling in he face like a blanket indeed the cold and the snow be nothing compare with the wind it be now reach the proportion of a westerly storm of the first magnitude off the towering slope above it come with the chill of the snow and with fly bit of sand scoop up from around the base of tree or with a shower of twig many a time he have to throw up he arm across he face before he lean and thrust on into the tooth of the blast but he be grow accustomed to see through this veil of snow and thick darkness all thing be dreamlike in dimness of course but he could make out terrific cloud effect as the cloud gush over the summit and down the slope a little way like the smoke of enormous gun and again a pyramid of mist be like a false mountain before he a mountain that take on movement and rush to overwhelm he only to melt away and become simply a shadow among shadow above he head once or twice before the dawn he rest not from weariness perhaps but from lack of breath turn he back to the west and bow he head walk into the wind it have become positively difficult to draw breath still it gain power incredibly up the side of scalped mountain it be a steady weight press against he rather than a wind and now and then when the weight relax he stumble forward on he knee for there be now hardly any shelter he be approach the timberline where tree stand as high as a man and little higher dawn find he at the edge of the tree line he fling himself on he face he head on he arm to rest and wait until the treacherous time of dawn should have pass while the day grow steadily he heart sink he need the rest but the cold bit into he while he lay extend and the peril of the summit would be before he for he march of the day the wind mourn over he as if it anticipate he defeat never have there be such wind he think it scream above he it drop away in sudden lull of more appalling silence then far off he would hear a wave of the storm begin wash across a crest thunder in a canyon and then break on the timberline with a prolonged and mighty roar those giant approach make he hold he breath and when the wave of confusion pass he find himself often breathless day come he be on the very verge of the line with a dense fence of stunt tree just before he and the wilderness of snow beyond slope up to the crest outline in white against the solid gray sky the spartan of the forest be around he -- fir pine spruce birch and tremble little aspen up there among the stoutest all be of one height clean-shaven by the volley of the wind-driven sand and pebble that clip off any treetop that aspire above the mass in solid number be they salvation and they grow dense as grass two foot high on the battlefront they be carve by that wind for all storm come here out of the west and the storm face of every tree be denude of branch to the east the foliage stream away even in calm weather those tree speak of storm bull hunter sit up to put on he snowshoe it be a white world below he and above winter which a day before have vanish now come back with a rush off the summit where its snow be still pile again the heart of the big man quake down in the hollow over that ridge be the house of the campbell they would be get up now joe would be make the fire and harry slice the bacon it make a cheerful picture to bull he could close he eye and hear the fire snap and see the stove steam with smoke through every fissure before the draft catch in the chimney from the shed come the neigh of maggie call softly to he he shake he head with a groan stand up and stride out of the timber into the summit land it be a great desert never could it be construe as a place for life even lichen be almost out of place here and what folly could lead a man across the shift snow but to be call a man to be admire in silence to be ask for opinion to be defer to -- this be a treasure worth any price he bow himself to the wind again and make for the summit with the peculiar stride which a man must use with snowshoe he dare not slacken he effort now the cold have be increase and to pause mean peril of freezing it be a highly electrify air and the result be a series of maddening mirage he stumble over solid rock where nothing seem to be in he way and again what seem a rock of huge size be nothing at all bull discover that what seem firm ground beneath he as he start to round a precipice might after all be the effect of the mirage add to this be another difficulty as he wind slowly about midday up the last reach with the summit just above he the wind carry mass of cloud over the crest and into he face he walk alternately in a bewildering drive fog and then in a air make crazy with electricity again and again from one side or the other he start when the storm boom and cannonade down a ravine and then belch out into the open all this time the babel of the wind overhead never cease and the force of the storm cut up under he with such violence that he be almost raise from the earth then a unexpected barrier obtrude -- a literal mountain of ice be before he the snow of the recent fall have be whip away and the surface of the mountain here perilously steep be now sleek and solid with ice bull look gloomily toward the summit so close above he and the ice glimmer in the dull light there be only one way to make even the attempt he sit down take off he snowshoe strap they to he back and begin to work he way up the slope batter out each foothold with the head of he ax it be possible to ascend in this manner but it would be practically impossible to descend once commit to this way he have either to go on to the summit or else perish work slowly with little possible muscular exercise to warm he he begin to grow chill and the wind-driven cold numb he ear but more than that the wind be now a grim peril for from time to time it swerve and leap on he heavily from the side once off balance he look back at the dazzling slope below he he would be a shapeless mass of flesh long before he tumble to the bottom vaguely as he hew he foothold and work he way up he yearn for the cleverness of harry or the wit of joe what a ally either of they would be that he be undertake a task from which either of they would have shrink in horror never occur to he yonder beyond the summit lay he destiny -- johnstown -- and this be the way toward it it be a simple thing to bull he could no more vary from he course than a magnetic needle can vary from its pole suddenly he come on a break in the solid face of the ice above he be a narrow rift through the ice to the gravel beneath how it be make bull could not guess but he take advantage of it presently he be stride on toward the summit beat he hand to restore the circulation and gingerly rub he ear there be a magical change as he reach the summit and sit down behind some rock to regain he breath and quiet he shake nerve the cloud split apart in the zenith the sun burst through on both side the broad mountain billow away to white lowland the air be alive with little brilliant spot of electricity it cheer bull hunter vastly the gale which be tumble the cloud down the arch of the sky and toward the east be more mighty than ever but he put he head down to it confidently and begin the descent chapter 5 there be more snow on this side and to travel through it he soon find that he must put on the snowshoe again but after that the descent be actually restful compare with the labor of the climb yonder be the dark streak of the timberline again far down the valley he watch it curving in and out along the mountainside like a water level below be the darkness of the forest where other thing live and where bull could live more easily also never have tree seem such beautiful and friendly thing to he once a think stop he completely he be in a new world he be see everything for the first time on other day he have go out with other under they guidance not trust to undertake a expedition by himself he look at nothing until it be point out to he hear nothing that be not first call to he attention he have always wonder at the acuteness of the sens of all other man but now look on the mountain for himself he decide with a start of the heart that they be beautiful -- beautiful and terrible at once with the reality that he have never find in he book what level spear of a knight in the page of romance could equal the invisible thrust of this wind he reach the timberline look back he see the summit a brilliant line of white against a blue sky again the heart of bull hunter leap here be a great treasure that he have take in with one grasp of the eye and which he could never lose he turn down the valley where it swerve out into the lower plain stand johnstown and there he be to cross the flight of pete reeve if pete be indeed fly but it be incredible that the man who have strike down uncle bill campbell should flee from any man or number of man he have reach the bottom of the narrow valley a dull noise come down to he from the mountain in the lull of the wind he look up far away mile and mile near the summit of scalped mountain a snaky form of mist be twist swiftly down he look curiously the thing grow travel with great speed that increase with every moment it increase -- it gain velocity -- a snowslide he watch it in doubt it be twist like a snake down the farther side of the mountain but in he experience slide be as treacherous as serpent bull start hastily for a low cliff that stand up from the floor of the valley clear of the tree he have not go far when the wind fall away to a whisper and a dull roar catch he ear he look back over he shoulder in alarm a great wall of white be shoot down the mountainside the little slide of surface snow which have twist across the surface of the old snow of the winter have be gain in weight in momentum pick up claw of shrubbery tooth of stone and eat through layer after layer of the old snow pack hard as ice now it be a roar mass with a front steadily increase in height and far away in the rear it toss up a tail of snow dust a fly mist that give bull a impression of speed greater than the main wall of the snow itself the noise grow amazingly and come in range of the opposite wall of the valley a low and steadily increase thunder pour into the ear of bull it be a fascinating thing to watch and at this distance to the side he be quite safe but at the very moment that he reach this decision the front of the slide smash with a noise like volley canyon against the side of a hill toss immense arm of white in the air flounder and then veer with the speed of a express train round a curve and rock away down the slope straight for bull turn cold with dread he see it hit the timberline with a great crash and the dark form of the tree be dash up by the run mass of stone and then swallow in the boiling front of the slide he wait to see no more but dash on for the saving cliff once he back be turn it seem that the slide gain speed the immense roaring literally leap on he from behind and in the roar he sens be drown he could feel he knee weaken and buckle but the cliff now just before he give he fresh strength but be the cliff high enough he hurry up to higher ground and fling himself prostrate the front of the slide be cut down the heavily forested slope as though the tree be blade of grass before a keen scythe the noise pass all description once he think the mass be change direction it put out a massive arm to the left lick down five hundred tree at a gulp and then smash its fist into a hillside fling back into the valley floor toss the great tree in its top and pour straight at he he watch it in one of those daze during which one see everything the whole body come like water down a chute but one part of the front wall spill out ahead and then another and then the top overtake the rest topple crash to the bottom and so it rush out of sight beneath the cliff but would it wash over the top the first answer be a impact that shake the ground under he and then he hear a noise like a huge rip explosion a dozen lofty geyser of snow stream up into the air dazzling against the sun misty at the edge of each column whose center be solid ton and ton of snow old pine and spruce they branch shave away in the tumult of the slide be pick up and hurl like javelin over the cliff a shower of fragment beat on the body of bull and then the main mass of snow wash up over the edge of the cliff in a great mound and the slide be end he crawl slowly back to he foot far up the mountainside beginning in a point the track of the slide sweep down in a broaden scar black and raw across forest and snow far down the valley the last echo of thunder be pass away to a murmur and the valley floor beneath the cliff be a mass of snow and tree trunk bull take off the snowshoe and climb along the valley wall until he could descend to the clear floor beneath he then he head down toward johnstown it be well past midday when he escape the slide it be the beginning of night when at the conclusion of that first heroic march he reach johnstown with hunger he stomach cleave to he back and he knee be weak with the labor stamp through the snow to the hotel he ask the idler around the stove have any of you gent see a man name pete reeve pass through this town they look at he in amazement he have close the door behind he and now with he battered hat push high on he head he seem taller than the entrance -- taller and as wide a mountain of a man the effort of the march have collect a continual frown on he forehead and as he peer about from face to face no one for a moment be able to answer but each look to he companion it be the proprietor who answer finally talk be he commercial medium and staff of life what sort of a look man captain bull blink at he he be not use to honorary epithet such as this and he search the face of the proprietor carefully to detect mockery to he surprise the other show sign of what bull dimly recognize as fear fear of he -- of bull hunter the way you look at I say the other and laugh uneasily i figure it be pretty lucky that i be not this here pete reeve that so boy the boy join in the laughter but they keep it subdue they eye upon the giant at the door he be lean against the wall and the sight of he outspread hand be far from reassure but bull go on to describe he man not very big hand like the claw of a bird 's iron-gray hair quick way that be uncle bill 's description sure he be be here say the owner i recognize he right off he be through about dusk he come over the mountain and just get past the summit he say before the storm hit lucky eh he look at the battered coat of bull kind of appear like you might not of be so lucky I ask bull gently nope i be at the timberline on the other side about daybreak today there be a sudden and chilly silence man look at one another obviously no man could have travel that distance between dawn and dark but it be as well not to express disbelief to a man who could tell a lie as big as he body i get to eat say bull the proprietor jump out of he chair i can fix you up son he lead the way bull follow with he enormous stride and as the floor creak under he the eye of the other jerk after he stride by stride it be begin to seem possible that this man have do what he say he have do when the door slam behind he and he step go creak through the room beyond a mutter of a hum arise around the stove as a matter of fact it be the beginning of the great legend that be finally to bulk around the name of the big man and it be fitting that the huge figure of bull hunter should have come upon the attention of man in this way descend out of the storm and the mountain that he have do something historic be far from the mind of bull as he stalk into the dining room you sit right down here he host be say place a chair at the table bull try the chair with he hand it groan and squeak under the weight chair do not seem to be make for I he say simply besides i be more use to sit on the floor he drop to the floor accordingly with the effect of a small earthquake the proprietor stare but he swallow he astonishment what you would like to eat be something hearty i figure what you get say bull well mr jarney come in this morning with a dozen fresh egg get some prime bacon too and some jerky and -- that dozen egg say bull thoughtfully will start I and then a platter of bacon and you might mix up a bowl of flapjack you be not get a quart or so of can milk partner the proprietor could only nod for he dare not trust he voice flee to the kitchen he repeat the prodigious order to he wife then he circle by a back way and communicate the tiding to the boy around the stove a couple of dozen egg he say to I and a few pound of beef and three or four quart of milk and a bowl of flapjack and a platter of bacon be the way the second version of the historic order for food come to the idler half a dozen of the man risk the cold and the wind to steal around to the side of the house and peer through the window at the huge bunch figure that sit on the floor they find he with he chin drop upon the burly fist and a frown on he forehead for bull be think he would have be glad to have find pete reeve in johnstown and have the matter over with but after all it be begin to occur to he that it might not be wise to kill the man in the presence of other people they might attempt to correct he with the assistance of a rope and a limb of a tree somewhere he must cut in ahead of this reeve and start out at he if possible as for he ability to keep pace with a horse he have no doubt that he could do it fairly well more than once he have go out on foot while harry and joe ride and he have press the little pony bear they rider slowly up and down the slope to keep pace with he on the level of course it be a different matter but in broken country he more than keep up have you get a grudge agin ' reeve ask the host as he bring in the fried egg maybe admit bull and instantly he begin to attack the food the proprietor watch with a grow awe no chinook ever eat snow as this hungry giant melted food to nothingness he come back with the first stack of flapjack and bacon and more question but i would think that a gent like you would be pretty careful about tangle with pete reeve -- he be so handy with a gun and you such a tolerable big target i have figure that all out say bull calmly but they be so much of I to kill that i do not figure one bullet could do the work do you the eye of the proprietor grow large he swallow and before he could answer bull continue in the exposition of he theory before he shoot the next shot maybe i can get my hand on he you go to fight he bare hand agin ' a gun you see say bull apologetically i be not much good with a gun but i feel sort of curious about what would happen if i get my grip on a man and that be the foundation on which another section of the bull hunter legend be build chapter 6 the bed on which bull hunter repose he bulk that night be not the cot to which he be show by he host one glance at the spindle wooden leg of the canvas-bottomed cot be enough for bull and have wrap himself in the cover he lay down on the floor and be instantly asleep while it be still dark he waken out of a dream in which pete reeve seem to be ride far -- far away on the rim of the world ten minute later bull be on the trail out of johnstown there be only one trail for a horseman south of johnstown and that trail follow the winding of the valley bull plan to push across the ragged peak of the little cloudy mountain and head off the fugitive at glenn cross two day of stern labor go into the next burst he follow the cold star by night and the easy landmark by day and for food he have the stock of raisin he have buy at johnstown he come out of the height and drop down into glenn cross in the gloom of the second evening but raisin be meager support for such a bulk as that of bull hunter it be a gaunt-faced giant who look in at the door of the shop where the blacksmith be work late the mechanic look up with a start at the deep voice of the stranger but he manage to stammer forth he tiding such a man as pete reeve have indeed be in glenn cross but he have go on at the very verge of day and night bull hunter set he tooth for there be no longer a possibility of cut off pete reeve by cross country the immense labor of the last three day have merely serve to put he on the heel of the horseman and now he must follow straight down country and attempt to match he long leg against the speed of a fine horse he draw a deep breath and plunge into the night out of glenn cross on the south trail at least he would make one short stiff march before the weariness overtake he that weariness cloud he brain ten mile out he build a fire in a cover of pine and sleep beside it before dawn he be up and out again in the first gray of the daylight he reach a little store at a crossroad and here he pause for breakfast a tousled girl rub the sleep out of she eye serve he in the kitchen the first glimpse of the hollow cheek and the unshaven face of bull hunter quite awaken she bull could feel she watch he as she glide about the room he sink he head between he shoulder and glare down at the table no doubt she would begin to gibe at he before long most woman do he prepare himself to meet with patience that incredible sting and penetrate hurt of a woman 's mockery but there be no mockery forthcoming the sun be still not up when he pay he bill and hasten to the door of the old building quick footstep follow he a hand touch he shoulder and he turn and look suspiciously down into the face of the girl it be a frightened face he think and very pretty at some interval between the time when he first see she and the present she have find time to rearrange she hair and make it smooth color be pulse in she cheek stranger she say softly what be you run away from the question slowly penetrate the mind of bull he be still bewilder by the change in she -- something electric to be feel rather than note with the eye they be not any reason for hurry on she urge i -- i can hide you easy nobody could find where i 'll put you and there you can rest up you must be tolerable tired there be no doubt about it there be kindness as well as anxiety in she voice for the second time in he entire life bull decide that a woman could be something more than a annoyance she be place a value on he just as jessie three day before have place a value on he and it disturb bull for so many year he have be mock and scorn by he uncle and cousin that deep in he mind be engrave the certainty that he be useless he decide to hurry on before the girl find out the truth i can still walk he say and while i can walk i get to go south but -- you gimme heart lady you gimme a pile of heart to keep go maybe -- he pause uncertain what to say next and yet obviously she expect something more -- i 'll get a chance to come back this way and if i do i 'll see you you can lay to that -- i 'll see you he be go before she could answer and he be wonder why she have look down with that sudden color and that queer pleased smile it would be long before bull understand but even without understand he find that he heart be lighter and a odd warmth suffuse he the rising of the sun find he in the pale desert with the magic of the hill grow distant behind he and he settle to a different step through the thin sand -- a short choppy step he weight be against he here but it would be even a greater disadvantage to a horseman and with this in mind he press steadily south every day on that south trail be like a year in the life of bull heat and thirst waste he the constant labor of the march harden he muscle and he get that forward look about he eye which come with shadow under the lid and a constant frown on the forehead it be long afterward that man check up he march from date to date and discover that the distance between the shack of bill campbell and halstead in the south be one hundred and fifty mile over bitter mountain and burn desert and that bull hunter have make the distance in five day all this be learn and verify later when bull be a legend when he stride into halstead on that late afternoon no one have ever hear of the man out of the mountain he be simply a oddity in a country where oddity draw small attention yet a rumor advance before bull a child playing in the incredible heat of the sun see the dusty giant heaving in the distance and run to its mother frightened and the worn-faced mother come to the porch and shaded she eye to look she pass on the word with a call that travel from house to house so that when bull enter the long irregular street of halstead he find it line on either side by child old man woman it be almost as though they have hear of the thing he have come to do and be there to watch bull shrink from they eye he would far rather have slip around the back of the village and go toward its center unobserved a pair of stare eye to bull be like the point of a loaded gun he put unspoken sentence upon every tongue and the sentence be those he have hear so often from he uncle and he uncle 's son too big to be any good bull 's get the size of a hoss and as a hoss he would do pretty well but he be not no account as a man he life have be pave with such burning remark as these many a evening have be long agony to he as the three sit about and bait he he hurry down the street the pulverize sand squirt up about he heavy boot and drift in a mist behind he when he be go a old man come out and measure those great stride with he eye and then stretch he leg vainly to cover the same mark but this of course bull do not see and he would not have understand it have he see except as a mockery he pause in front of the hotel veranda a awful figure to behold he canvas coat be roll and tie behind he sweating shoulder he too-short sleeve have bother he and they be now cut off at the elbow and expose the sun-blackened forearm he overalls stream in rag over he scar boot he push the battered hat far back on he head and look at the silent attentive line of idler who sit on the veranda excuse I gent he say mildly but maybe one of you might know of a little gent with iron-gray hair and a thin face and quick way of act and little thin hand he illustrate he meaning by extend he own huge paw he name be pete reeve that name cause a sharp shift of glance not at bull but from man to man a tall fellow rise he advance with he thumb hook importantly in the arm hole of he vest and brace he leg apart as he face bull the elevation of the veranda floor raise he so that he be actually some inch above the head of he interlocutor and the tall man be deeply grateful for that advantage he be in truth a little vain of he own height and to have to look up to anyone irritated he beyond word have establish he own superior position he look the giant over from head to foot he keep one eye steadily on bull as though afraid that the big man might dodge out of sight and elude he and what might you have to do with pete reeve he ask might not you be a partner of pete 's kind of look like you be follow he sort of eager friend while this question be be ask bull see that the line of idler settle forward in they chair to hear the answer it puzzle he for some mysterious reason these man disapprove of any one who be intimately acquaint with pete reeve it seem he look blandly upon the tall man i never see pete reeve say bull apologetically ah yet you be follerin ' he hotfoot i be aim to see he you know answer bull the tall man regard he with eye that begin to twinkle beneath he frown then he jerk he head aside and cast at he audience a prodigious wink the cloudy eye of bull have assure he that he have to do with a simpleton and he be invite the other in on the game you never see he he ask gruffly turn back to bull you expect I to believe talk like that young man d'you know who i be i dunno murmured bull overawe and draw back a pace the action draw a chuckle from the crowd some of the idler even rise and saunter to the edge of the veranda the better to see the baiting of the giant he prodigious size make he timidity the more amusing you dunno eh ask the other well son i be sheriff bill anderson he wait to see the effect of this portentous announcement i never hear tell of any sheriff bill anderson say bull in the same mild voice the sheriff gasp the idler hastily veil they mouth with much cough and clearing of the throat it seem that the table have be subtly turn upon the sheriff you exclaim the sheriff extend a bony arm i get to tell you partner that i be a pile suspicious i be suspicious of anybody that be a friend of pete reeve how long have you know he bull be very anxious to pacify the tall man he shift he weight to the other foot something less 'n nothing he hasten to explain i be not never see he and why d'you want to see he what d'you know about he it flash through the mind of bull that it would be useless to tell what he know of pete obviously nobody would believe what he could tell of how reeve have meet and shoot down uncle bill campbell for bill campbell be a historic figure as a fighter in the mountain region and surely he face must be bright even at this distance from he home that he could have walk beyond the sphere of campbell 's fame in five day never occur to bull hunter i dunno nothing good he confess there be a change in the sheriff he descend from the floor of the veranda with a stiff-legged hop and take bull by the arm lead he down the street son he say earnestly walk down the street with bull d'you know anything agin ' this pete reeve i want to know because i get pete behind the bar for murder murder ask bull murder -- regular murder -- something he 'll hang for and if you get any inside information that i can use agin ' he why i 'll use it and i 'll be mighty grateful for it you see everybody know pete reeve everybody know that for all these year he be be go around kill and maim man and nobody have be able to bring he up for anything worse 'n self-defense but now i think i get he to rights and i want to hang he for it stranger partly because it would be a feather in my cap and partly because it would be do a favor for every good law-abiding citizen in these part so do what you can to help I stranger and i 'll see that you time be not waste there be something very wheedling and insinuate about all this talk it trouble bull he strangely obscure life have leave he a child in many important respects and he have a child 's instinctive knowledge of the mental process of other in this case he feel a profound distrust there be something wrong about this sheriff he instinct tell he -- something gravely wrong he dislike the man who have start to ridicule he before many man and be now so confidential ask he help sheriff anderson he say may i see this reeve come right along with I son i be not press you for what you know but it may be a thing that 'll help I to hang reeve and if it be i 'll need to know it understand public benefit -- that be what i be after come along with I and you can see if reeve 's the man you be after they cross the street through a little maelstrom of fine dust which a wind circle have pick up and the sheriff lead bull into the jail they cross the tawdry little outer room with its warped floor creak under the tread of bull hunter next they come face to face with a cage of steel bar and behind it be a little gray man on a bunk he sit up and peer at they from beneath bushy brow a thin-faced man extremely agile even in sit up one catch many possibility of catlike speed of action bull know at once that this be the man he seek he stand close to the bar grasp one in each great hand and with he face press against the steel he peer at pete reeve the other be very calm howdy sheriff he say bring on another one to look over you bear chapter 7 the prisoner 's good humor impressed bull immensely here be a man talk commonplace in the face of death a greater man than uncle bill he feel at once -- a far greater man it be impossible to conceive of that keen sharp eye and that clawlike hand send a bullet far from the center of the target he give he eye long sight of that face and then turn from the bar and go out with the sheriff be that you man ask the sheriff i dunno say bull fencing for time as they stand in front of the jail what would he do you mean why he be in jail i 'll tell you that son but first i want to know what you get agin ' he -- and you proof -- mostly you proof the distaste which bull have feel for the sheriff from the first now become overpower that he should be the means of bring that terrible and active little man to a end seem as a matter of fact absurd guile must have play a part in that capture suppose he be to tell the sheriff about the shooting of uncle bill that would be enough to convince man that pete reeve be capable of murder for the shooting of uncle bill have be worse than murder it spare the life and ruin it at the same time but suppose he add he evidence and allow the law to take its course with pete reeve where would be he own reward for he long march south and all the pain of travel and the cross of the mountain at the peril of he life there would be nothing but scorn from uncle bill when he return and not that moment of praise for which he yearn to gain that great end he must kill pete reeve but not by the aid of the law i dunno he say to the sheriff who wait impatiently i figure that what i know would not be no good to you the sheriff snort you be let I waste all this time on you he ask bull why do not you tell I that in the first place bull scratch he head in perplexity but as he raise the great arm and put he hand behind he head the sheriff wince back a little i be sorry say bull the sheriff dismiss he with a grunt of disgust and stride off bull start out to find information this idea be grow slowly in he mind he must kill pete reeve and to accomplish that great end he must first free he from the jail he go back to the hotel and go into the kitchen to find food the proprietor himself come back to serve he he be a pudgy little man with a dignified pointed beard of which he be inordinately proud it be between time for meal he declare but you be the biggest man that ever come into the hotel i 'll make a exception and he begin to hunt through the cupboard for cold meat i see pete reeve begin bull bluntly how come he be in jail he ask the other be not you hear no the little man sigh with pleasure he have give up hope of find a new listener for that oft-told tale it happen last night he confide along late in the afternoon in ride johnny strange he tell we he be out to dan armstrong 's place when about noon a little gray-headed man that give the name of pete reeve come in and ask for chow of course johnny strange prick up he ear when he hear the name we all hear about pete reeve off and on as about the slickest gunman that the range ever turn out so he look pete over and wonder at find such a little man the proprietor draw himself up to he full height he do not know that size do not make the man well armstrong trot out some chuck for reeve and after pete have eat johnny strange suggest a game they sit in at three-handed stud poker thing go along pretty good for johnny he make a considerable win then it come late in the afternoon and he see he would have to be get back home he offer to bet everything he have win or double or nothing and when the boy do not want to do that it give he a clean hand to stand up and get out he get up and say good-bye and hang around a while to see how the next hand go so far as he could make out pete reeve be lose pretty steady then he come on in well when johnny strange tell about pete be out there sheriff anderson be in the room and he rise up ` do not look good to I ' he say ` if a gunfighter be lose money most like he 'll fight to win it back maybe i 'll go out and look that game over ' and say that he slope out of the room well none of we take much stock in the sheriff go out to take care of armstrong you see armstrong be the old sheriff and he give anderson a pretty stiff run for he money last election they both be spend most of they time and energy the last few year hate each other when one of 'em be in office the other go around say that the gent that have the plum be a crook and then anderson go out and armstrong come in and anderson say the same thing about armstrong take 'em general and they always have the boy worry when they be together for fear of a gunfight and bullet fly and so when anderson stand up and say he be go out to see that reeve do not do no harm to armstrong we all sit back and kind of laugh but we laugh at the wrong thing long about a hour or so after dark we hear two man come walk up on the veranda and one of 'em we know by the sound be the sheriff how could you tell by the sound asked bull innocently well you see the sheriff always wear steel rim on he heel like he be a horse he be kind of close with he money be old anderson i 'll tell a man we hear the ring of they heel on the porch and pretty soon in come the sheriff herd a gent in ahead of he and who d'you think that gent be it be reeve yes sir the old sheriff have step out and grab he man he be not there quick enough to stop the killing of armstrong but he get there fast enough to nab reeve seem that when he be ride up to the house he hear a shot fire and then he see a man run out of the house and jump on he hoss and the sheriff do not stop to ask no question he just out with he gat and drill the gent 's hoss and while reeve be struggle on the ground with the hoss flop around and die the sheriff run up and stick the iron on reeve then he go into the house and find armstrong lie shot through the heart clear as day reeve lose a lot of money and when it come to a pinch he hate to see that money go when he could get it back for the price of one slug so he out with he gun and shoot armstrong and the worst part of it be that armstrong do not have no gun on at the time the sheriff find armstrong 's gun hanging on the wall along with he cartridge belt yep it be plain murder and pete reeve 'll hang as high as the sky -- and a good thing too this story be a shock to bull for a reason that would not have affect most man that a man who have have the courage to stand up and face uncle bill in a fair duel should have be so cowardly so venomous as to take a mean advantage of a gambling companion seem to bull altogether too strange to be reasonable certainly if he have have a difference with this fellow thought bull pete reeve be the man to let the other use he own weapon before he fight but to shoot he down across a table unwarned -- this be too much to believe and yet it be the truth and pete reeve be to hang for it the big man sit shake he head and they find the money on pete reeve he ask gloomily they find the money he take off this armstrong there be the funny part of the yarn say the proprietor glibly pete have the nerve to shoot the gent down in cold blood but when he see he fall he lose he nerve he do not wait to grab the money but run out and jump on he hoss and try to get away so there you be but it pretty often happen that way take the oldest gunfighter in the world and if he stomach be not rest just right it sort of upset he to see a crimson stain i see it happen that way with the worst of 'em and in the old day they use to be a rough crowd in my barroom they do not turn out that style of gent no more he sigh as he mind flicker back into the heroic past and reeve -- he admit he do the killing bull ask hopelessly he nope he be too foxy for that but the only story he tell be so foolish that we laugh at he and he be not have the nerve to try to bluff we ever since he say that he be sit peaceable with armstrong when all at once without no warning they be a shot from the window -- the east window i remember he be particular to say -- and armstrong drop forward on the table shot through the heart reeve say that he do not wait to ask no question he blow the candle out and have get the darkness on he side he make a jump through the door and get onto he hoss he say that he want to break away to the tree and try to get a shot at the murderer from cover but the minute he get onto he hoss he have he hoss shot from under he be they any shot fire then yep reeve say that he fire a couple of time when he fall but the sheriff say that reeve only fire once as he hoss be fall and that the other shot that be find fire out of reeve 's gun be fire into the heart of armstrong oh they be not any doubt about it all reeve have get be a cock-and-bull yarn that would make a fool laugh although bull have be many time assure by he uncle and he cousin that he be a fool of the first magnitude he be in no mood for laughter somewhere in the tale there be something wrong for he mind refuse to conjure up the picture of reeve pull he gun and shooting across the table into the breast of a helpless unwarned man that would not be the method of a man who could stand up to uncle bill that would not be the method of the man who have sit up on he bunk and look so calmly into the face of the sheriff bull stand up and drag he hat firmly over he eye i would kind of like to see the place where that shooting be do he declare you get lot of time before night say the proprietor be not more 'n a mile and a half out the north trail take that path right out there and you can ride out inside of five minute there be no horse for bull hunter to ride but have thank he host he step out into the cooler sunshine of the late afternoon the trail lead through scatter grove of cottonwood most of the way for it be bottom land partially flood in the winter season of rain and even in the driest and hottest part of the summer marshy in place he follow the twist little trail through spot of shadow and stretch of open sky until he reach the shack which be obviously that of the dead armstrong the moment he enter the little cabin he receive proof positive the furniture have not apparently be disturb since the shoot the table still lean crazily as though it have not recover from a violent shock on one side one chair be overturn a box have be smash to splinter probably by have someone put a foot through it bull examine the deal table across the center of it there be a dark stain and on the farther side two hand be print distinctly into the wood in the same dull color the whole scene rise revoltingly distinct in the mind of bull here sit dan armstrong play he cheerful game laughing and jest because forsooth he be the winner and there on the opposite side of the table sit pete reeve the guest in the house of he host grow darker and darker as the money be transfer from he pocket to the pocket of the jovial armstrong then a sudden taking of offense at some harmless jest the cold flash of steel as reeve lean and jump to he foot and then the explosion of the revolver with armstrong settle slowly limply forward on the table there he lay with a stream pour across the table from the death wind he helpless arm outstretch on the wood then reeve panic-stricken perhaps with a sudden stir of remorse start for the door strike the box on he way smash it to bit and as soon as he get outside leap for he horse luckily retribution have overtake the murderer in the very moment of escape bull hunter sigh never have the strength of the arm of the law be so vividly bring home to he as by this incident suppose that he have fulfil he purpose and kill reeve would not the law have reach for he in the same fashion and take and crush he he shudder and look up from he brooding he glance through the opposite window and see that the wood be grow dark in that direction night be approach and with the feeling of night there be a ghostly sense of death as though the spirit of the dead man be return to he old home on the other side of the house however the wood show brighter this be the east window -- the east window through which reeve declare that the shot have be fire bull shake he head he step out of the cabin and look about it be a prosperous little stretch of meadow clear into the cottonwood and reclaim part of the marshland -- all very rich soil as one could see at a glance there be a field which have be recently upturn by the plow perhaps the work of yesterday the furrow be still black still not dry out by the sun today would have be the time for harrowing but that work be indefinitely postpone by the grim visitor no doubt this armstrong be a industrious man the sense of a waste life be bring home to bull a bullet have end it all absent-mindedly he pass around the side of the house and start for the east window through which reeve have say that the bullet be fire but he shake he head at once on the east side the house lean against a mass of white stone it rise high rough ragged certainly a man stalk a house to fire a shot would never come up to it from this side he own word be convict reeve of the murder still he continue to clamber over the stone until he stand by the window to be sure if a man stand there he could easily have fire into the room and into the breast of a man sit on the far side of the table armstrong be find there bull look down to he foot as a thoughtful man will do and there very clearly mark against the white of the stone he see a dark streak -- two of they side by side he bent and look at they then he rub the place with he fingertip and examine the skin a stain have come away from the rock it be as if the rock have be rub with lead or a soft iron and then strangely into the mind of bull come the memory of what the hotel man have say of the sheriff 's iron-shod heel the sheriff have go for many a year hate armstrong the truth rush over the brain of the big man what a chance for a crafty mind to kill he enemy and place the blame on the shoulder of one already know to be a man-killer bull hunter leap from the rock and start back for the town with long ground-devouring stride chapter 8 there be two reason for the happiness which lighten the step of bull hunter as he stride back for the town in the first place he see a hope of liberating reeve from jail and accomplish he own mission of kill the man in the second place he feel a peculiar joy at the thought of free such a man from the imputation of a cowardly murder yet he have small grounds for he hope two little dark mark on the white friable stone mark that the first small shower of rain would wash away mark that the first keen sandstorm would rub off -- this be he only proof and with this to free one man from danger of the rope and place the head of another under the noose -- it be a task to try the resource of a cleverer man than bull indeed the high spirit of bull in some measure leave he as he draw nearer and nearer to the village how could he convict the sheriff how with he clumsy wit and he clumsy tongue could he bring the truth to light have he possess the keen eye of he uncle he feel that a single glance would have make the guilt stand up in the face of anderson but he own eye alas be dull and clouded thoughtfully with bow head he hold he course a strange picture surely this man who so devoutly wish to free another from the danger of the law in order that he might take a life into he own hand but the contrast do not strike home to bull to he everything that he do be as clear as day but how to go to work if the man be like himself it would be a easy matter more than once he remember how he cousin have shift the blame for they own boyish prank upon he in the presence of they father they would accuse bull with a well-planned lie and the very fact that he have be accuse make bull blush and hang he head before he could be hear in he own behalf the cruel eye of he uncle have grow stern and bull be condemn as a culprit the only time you show any sense he uncle have say more than once be when you want to do something you have not ought to do steadily through the year he have serve as a scapegoat for he cousin they set a certain value upon he for he use in this respect ah if only he have that keen embarrassing eye of bill campbell with which to pierce to the guilty heart of the sheriff and make he speak the eye of he uncle be like the eye of a crowd it be a audience in itself and condemn or praise with the strength of number it be this thought of number that bring the clue to a possible solution to bull hunter when it come to he he stop short in the road throw back he head and laugh and what be all the celebration about ask a voice behind he he turn and find sheriff anderson on he horse directly behind he the soft loam of the trail have cover the sound of the sheriff approach bull blush with a sudden sense of shame moreover the sheriff seem unapproachably stern and dignified he sit erect in the saddle a cavalier figure with he long well-drilled mustach i dunno say bull vaguely push he hat back to scratch he thatch of blond hair i do not know i be celebrate particular the sheriff watch he with small evil eye you be snoop around son he say coldly and we folk in this part we do not like snooper understand no say bull frankly i do not exactly figure what you mean then he drop he hand to he hip git you hand off that gun say the sheriff he own weapon flash instantly in the light it have be a move like lightning its speed stunned and baffled bull hunter something cold form in he throat choke he and he obediently draw he hand away he do more he throw both immense arm above he head and stand gaping at the sheriff the latter eye he for a moment with stern amusement and then he shove the gun back into its holster i guess they be not much harm in you he say more to himself than to bull but i hate a snooper worse than i do a rat you can take they arm down bull lower they cautiously you hear I talk ask the sheriff i hear say bull obediently i do not like snooper which mean that i do not like you none too well besides who in thunder be you a wanderin ' vagrant you look to I and we get a law agin ' vagrant you amble along on you trail pretty pronto and no harm 'll come to you but if you be around town tomorrow -- well you have hear I talk it be very familiar talk to bull not the word but the commanding and contemptuous tone in which they be speak crestfallen he submit of one thing he must make sure : that no harm befall he before he face pete reeve and pete reeve 's gun then he could only pray for courage to attack but the effect of the sheriff 's little gunplay entirely dishearten bull at the prospect of face pete with a noncommittal rejoinder he start down the road and the sheriff put the spur to he horse and plunge by at a full gallop fling the dust back into the face of the big man bull wipe it out of he eye and go on gloomily he have be trodden upon in spirit once more but after all that be so old a story that it make little difference it convince he however of one thing he could never do anything with the sheriff man to man certainly he would need the help of a crowd before he face the tall man and he cavalier mustach he wait until after the supper at the hotel it be a miserable meal for bull he have already eat and he could not find a way of refuse the invitation of the proprietor to sit down again seat at the end of the long table he look miserably up and down it nobody have a look for he except one of contempt the sheriff it seem have spread a story around about he lack of spirit and if bull remain long in the village he would be treat with little more respect than he have be in the house of he uncle even now they hold he in contempt they could not understand for instance why he sit so far forward he be rest most of he weight on he leg for fear of the weakness of the chair under he full bulk but that very bulk make they whisper they joke and insult to one another when the long nightmare of that meal be end bull begin make he round he have choose he man every man he pick be sharp-eyed like uncle bill campbell they be the man whose inlooking eye would baffle the sheriff they be the man capable of suspicion and such man bull need -- not dull-glancing people like himself he go first to the proprietor of the hotel i get something to say to the sheriff he declare and i want to have a few important gent around town to be there to listen and hear what i get to say i wonder could you be handy he be surprise at the avidity with which he invitation be accept it be a long time since the hotel owner have be refer to as a important man then he go with the same talk to five other -- the blacksmith the carpenter and odd-jobber the storekeeper and two man whom he have mark when he first halt near the hotel veranda to he invitation each of they give a quick assent there have be something mysterious in the manner in which this timid-eyed giant have descend upon the town from nowhere and now they feel that they be about to come to the heart of the reason of he visit the invitation to the sheriff be deliver by the proprietor of the hotel and he say just enough -- and no more -- to bring the sheriff straight to the hotel anderson arrive with he best pair of gun in he holster for the sheriff be a two-gun man of the best variety he come with the aggressive manner of one ready to beat down all opposition but when he step into the room he manner change for he find sit about the table in the dining room which be to be the scene of the conference the six most influential man of the town -- man strong enough to reelect he next year or to throw he permanently out of office at the lower end of the table stand bull hunter he arm fold he face blank standing with the light from the lamp shine upon he face the other seat he seem a man among pygmy shall i lock the door ask the proprietor and he turn to bull as if the latter have the right to dictate bull nod all right sheriff the proprietor go on to explain we young friend yonder say that he be get something to say to you he be ask each of we to hang around and be a witness be you ready jud burst out the sheriff you be a idiot this overgrown booby need a horsewhipping and that be the sort of a answer i would like to make to he have deliver this broadside he stride up and confront bull it be a very poor move in the first place the sheriff have insult one of the man who be about to act as he official judge in the second place by put himself so close to bull he make himself appear a trifle ludicrous also if he expect to throw bull out of the poise with this bluster he fail it be not that bull do not feel fear but he have see a curious thing -- the sinewy long neck of the sheriff -- and he be wonder what would happen if one of he hand should grip that throat for a single instant he grow so fascinate by this study that he forget he fear of the sheriff 's gun anderson hasten to retreat from he false position gent he say excuse I for get edgy but if you want I to listen to this fellow 's talk -- hunter be he name -- bull hunter say the proprietor the sheriff take he place at the far end of the long table like bull he prefer to stand start in you talk he command it look to I say bull gently that they be only one gent here that be wear a gun he have throw he own belt on a chair and now he fix he eye on the weapon of anderson the sheriff glare you want I to take off my gun son i would rather go naked jud the hotel man have already be insult once by the sheriff and he have be bide he time this seem a excellent opening look to I he remark like mr hunter be right he be get something pretty serious to say and he do not want to take no chance on you cut he short with a bullet the sheriff glare at bull and then cast a swift glance over the face of the other he read upon they only one expression -- a cold curiosity plainly they agree with jud and the sheriff give way he take off he belt and toss it upon a chair near he then he face bull again but he face the big man with half he confidence destroy as he have say he feel worse than naked without he revolver under he touch but now he attempt to brave out the situation well he say jocularly what you go to accuse I of bull hunter i be just go to tell a little story that i be think about say bull story -- nothing exclaim anderson wait a minute break in jud let he tell this he own way -- i think you would best sheriff bull be look at the sheriff and through he into the distance after all it be a story as distinctly a story as if he have it in a book as he begin to tell it he forget sheriff anderson at the farther end of the table he talk slowly bring the word out one by one as if what he say be come to he by inspiration -- a kind of second sight it start in say bull the other night when the gent come in with word that pete reeve be out play card with armstrong and lose money when the sheriff hear that he start to think he be remember how he would hate armstrong for a good many year and that make he think that maybe armstrong would get into trouble with reeve because reeve be a pretty good shot and the sheriff hope that if it come to a showdown reeve would shoot armstrong full of hole and that start he wish pretty strong that armstrong would get kill do i have to stand here and listen to this fool talk demand the sheriff i be just suppose say bull surely they be not any harm in just suppose not a bit decide jud who have take the position of main arbiter well the sheriff get to wish armstrong be dead so strong that it do not seem he could stand to have he live much more he tell the folk that he be go out to see that no harm come to armstrong from reeve then he get on he hoss and go out all the way he be think hard armstrong be the gent that be sheriff before anderson armstrong be the gent that might get the job and throw he out again be not that clear well the sheriff get close to the cabin and -- he pause and slowly extend he long arm toward the sheriff what would you do then I i hear a shot -- you leave you hoss standing in the brush near the house interrupted bull and you go along on foot do that sound reasonable a gent go on foot when he might ride demand the sheriff you do not want to make no noise say bull and he great voice swallow the protest of the sheriff anderson cast another glance at the listener plainly they be fascinate by this tale and they be follow it step by step with nod you do not make no noise either go on bull hunter you slip up to the cabin real soft and you climb up on the east side of the house over some rock why in reason should a man climb over rock why would not he go right to the door because you do not want to be see then why not the west window fool you try that window first but they be some dry brush lie in front of it and you could not come close enough to look in without make a noise step on the dead wood so then you go around to the other side and climb over the rock until you could look into the cabin be i right i -- no curse you no of course you be not right shout anderson look right through that window say bull heavily you see armstrong the man you hate face you and with he back turn be pete reeve you say to yourself ` drop armstrong with a bullet catch reeve and put the blame on he ' then you pull you gun he push aside the ponderous armchair which stand beside he at the head of the table say shout the sheriff paler than ever now what be you accuse I of murder thunder bull hunter the roar of bull 's voice chained every one in he place the sheriff with stare eye and jud in the act of raise he hand i 'll jail you for slander say the sheriff fight to assurance and know that he be betray by he pallor and by the icy perspiration which he feel on he forehead anderson say bull i see the mark of they iron heel of yours on the rock that be a little thing of course as evidence it would not have convince the most prejudiced jury in the world but sheriff anderson be not weigh small point into he mind leap one image -- the whiteness of those rock on which he have stand and the indelible mark he heel must have make against that whiteness he be lose he feel and he act on the impulse to fight for he life one last glance he cast at the six listener and in they wide-eyed interest he read he own damnation then anderson whirl and leap for he belt with the gun out of six throat come six yell of fear there be a noise of chair be push back and a wild scramble to find safety under the table jud risk a moment 's delay knock the chimney off the lamp before he dive the flame leap once and go out but the pale moonshine pour through the window and fill the room with a weird play of shadow what bull hunter saw be not the escape of the sheriff but a sudden blind rage against everything and everybody it be a passion that set he tremble through all of he great body one touch of trust one word of encouragement have be enough to make he a giant to tear up the stump in the presence of jessie and he cousin how far more mighty he be in the grip of this new emotion this rage he own gun be far away but gun be not what he want they be uncongenial toy to he great hand instead he reach down and catch up that massive chair of oak build to resist time build to bear even such a bulk as that of bull hunter with ease yet he catch it up in one hand weigh it behind he head at the full limit of he extended arm and then bend forward he catapult the great missile down the length of the table it hit the lamp on the way and splintered it to small bit its momentum unimpeded hurtle on across the table it shoot at the sheriff as he whirl with he gun in he hand fast as the chair shot forward the hand of the sheriff be faster still bull see the big gun twitch up silver in the moonshine they explode in one voice as if the fly mass of wood be a animate object then the sheriff be strike and hurl crash along the floor chapter 9 at that fall the six man scamper from beneath the table to seize the down man there be no need of they haste sheriff anderson be a wreck rather than a fight man one arm be horribly crumpled beneath he he rib be shatter there be a great gash where the ring of the chair have cut into the bone like a knife they stand chatter about the fall man straighten he out feel he pulse make sure that he who would soon hang at the will of the law be alive outside voice be rush toward they door slam bull hunter break through the circle bent over the limp body and draw a big bundle of key from a pocket then without a word he go back to the far end of the room buckle on he gun belt and in silence leave the room the other pay no heed they and the newcomer who have pour into the room be fascinate by the work of the giant rather than the giant 's self they have a lantern swing dull light and grotesque shadow across the place now and by the illumination two of the man go to the wall and pick up the great oaken chair they raise it slowly between they a battered mass of disconnect wood then they look to the far end of the long table where he who have throw the missile have stand another line have be write into the history of bull hunter -- the first line that be write in red bull himself be on he way to the jail he find it unguard the deputy have go to find the cause of the commotion at the hotel the steel bar moreover be sufficient to retain the prisoner and keep out would-be rescuer in the dim light of he lantern bull see that pete reeve be sit cross-legged on he bunk like a little dried-up idol smoking a cigarette he only greet to the big man be a lifting of the eyebrow but when the big key be fit into the lock and the lock turn he show he first sign of interest he be stand up when bull open the door and stride in have you get you thing say bull curtly what thing big fellow why gun and thing -- and you hat of course pete reeve walk to the corner of the cell and take a sombrero off the wall here be that hat he answer but they be not pass out gun to jailbird -- not in these part you be not a jailbird answer bull so we 'll get that gun know where it be reeve follow without a question through the open door only stop as he pass beyond the bar to look back to they with a shudder it be the first sign of emotion he have show since he arrest but he step be lighter and quicker as he follow bull into the front room in that closet yonder say reeve point to a door that be where they keep the gun bull shake out he bundle of key into the great palm of he hand not those key -- the deputy have the key to the closet say pete i see anderson give it to he bull sigh i be not get much time partner he say approach the door he examine it wistfully but maybe they 's another way he draw back a little raise he right leg and smash the heavy cowhide boot against the door the wood split from top to bottom and bull 's leg be drive on through the aperture he pause to wrench the fragment of the door from lock and hinge and then beckon to pete reeve look for you gun in here reeve the little man cast one twinkle glance at he companion and then be instantly among the litter of the closet floor he emerge strap a belt about he the holster tug far down so that the muzzle of the gun be almost at he knee bull appreciate the diminutive size of the man for the first time see he in conjunction with the big gun on he thigh there be a odd change in the little man also the moment he gun be in place he tug he broad-brimmed hat a little lower across he eye and poise himself as if on tiptoe he glance be a constant flicker about the room until it come to rest on bull suppose you lemme in on the meaning of all this who be you and where do you figure on let I loose what in thunder be it all about we 'll talk later now you get to get start bull wave to the door pete reeve dart past he with noiseless step and pause a moment at the threshold of the jail plainly he be ready for fight or flight and he right hand be toy constantly with the holstered butt of he gun bull follow to the outside hoss ask the little man curtly on foot answer bull with equal brevity and he lead the way straight across the street there be no danger of be see all the life of the town be draw to a center about the hotel light be flash behind its window man be constantly pound across the veranda run in and out bull lead the way past the building and cut for the cottonwood and now demand pete reeve now partner that word sting bull it have not be apply to he more than a half a dozen time in he life together with its implication of free and equal brotherhood to be call partner by the great man who have conquer terrible uncle bill campbell they be a mess in the hotel say bull explain as shortly as he could seem that sheriff anderson be the gent that do the killing of armstrong it get find out and the sheriff try to get away lot of noise and trouble ah say reeve it be he then -- the old hound i might have know but i kep ' on figure that they be two of 'em well the sheriff be a handy boy with he gun do he drop anybody before they get he i hear two gun go off like one they must of be the sheriff 's cannon they be say bull but they bullet do not hit nothing but wood wild eh shoot into the wall nope into a chair the little man be struggle and pant sometimes break into a trot to keep up with the immense stride of he companion a chair you do not say so bull be silent how come he shoot at a chair drunk the chair be sail through the air at he h be return pete reeve somebody throw a chair at he and the sheriff get rattle and shoot at it instead of dodge well i have see a pile of funnier thing than that happen in gun play off and on who throw the chair i do you he squint up at the lofty form of bull hunter what name do you say he ask gently hunter be my name mostly they call I bull you get the size for that name partner so you clean up the sheriff with a chair he sigh i wish i would be there to see it but who get the inside on the sheriff i dunno what you mean pete reeve look closely at he companion plainly he be bewildered somewhere between a smile and a frown i mean who find out that the sheriff do it he tell it himself say bull drunk en nope not drunk he be ask if he do not do the murder great gun who ask he i do it say bull as simply as ever reeve bit he lip he have just put bull down as a simple-minded hulk he be force to revise he opinion you do that you foller he up eh i just do a little thinking so i ask he reeve shake he head maybe you hypnotize he he suggest nope i just ask he i get a lot of folk sit around and then i begin tell the sheriff how he do the shooting and he admit it nope he jump for a gun and then you heave a chair at he pete reeve draw in a long breath but what reason do you have son i get to ask you that before i thank you the way i want to thank you but before you kick out you 'll find that pete reeve be a friend my reason be say bull that i have business to do with you that could not be do in a jail so i have to get you out and now where be we head where we can do that business they have reach a broad break in the cottonwood the moonlight be fall so softly and brightly bull pause and look around he i guess this 'll have to do he declare all right son you can be as mysterious as you want now what you get I here for to kill you say bull gently pete reeve flinch back then he tap he holster make sure of the gun become more easy that be interesting he announce you could not wait for the law to hang I eh bull begin explain laboriously he push back he hat and begin to count off he point into the palm of one hand you shoot up uncle bill campbell he explain it be not that i get any grudge agin ' you for that but you see uncle bill take I in young and give I a home all these year i think it would sort of pay he back if i run you down so i walk across the mountain and come after you wait exclaimed pete reeve you walk yep he go on heedless of the fact that pete reeve be peer earnestly into the face of he companion now pucker with the earnest frown of thought i come down hope to get you and kill you besides that would not only pay back uncle bill it would make he think that i be a man you see reeve i be not quick thinking and i be not bright i be not get a quick tongue and sharp eye and they be treat I like i be a kid all my life so i get to do something i get to i be not get anything agin ' you but you just happen to be the one that i get to fight stand over yonder by that stump i 'll stand here and we 'll fight fair and square pete reeve obey he movement slow as if they be the result of hypnotism bull he say rather faintly look at the towering bulk of he opponent i dunno maybe i be go nutty but i figure that you come down here to kill I for the sake of get you uncle to pat you on the back once or twice and you find you can not get at I because i be in jail so you work out a murder mystery to get I out and then you tackle I you say you be not very bright i dunno maybe you be not bright but you be mighty different he pause and rub he forehead son i have see pretty good man in my day but i be not never see one that i cotton to like i do to you you have save my life how can you figure on I go out and take yours now you be not go to maybe say bull calmly maybe i 'll get to you son answer the other almost sadly shake he head when i be right with a good steady nerve they be not any man in the world that can sling a gun with I and tonight i be right if it come to a showdown -- but be you pretty good with a gun yourself bull no answer bull frankly i be not any good compare to a expert like you but i be good enough to take a chance they sort of chance be not take twice bull you see say bull i be go to make a rush as i pull the gun and if i get to you before i be dead well -- all i ask be to lay my hand on you you see the little man shudder and blink i see he say and swallow with difficulty but in the name of reason bull have sense lemme talk i 'll tell you what that uncle of yours be -- do not talk exclaimed bull hunter i sort of like you partner and it sort of break I down to hear you talk do not talk but listen the next time that frog croak we go for we gun eh that frog off in the marsh he have hardly speak before the ominous sound be hear and bull reach for he gun for all he bulk of hand and unwieldy arm the gun come smoothly swiftly into he hand he would have have a ordinary man cover long before the latter have he gun muzzle-clear of the leather but pete reeve be no ordinary man he arm jerk down he finger flicker down and up they go down empty they come up with the burden of a long revolver shine in the moonlight and he fire before bull 's gun come to the level for a shot only pete reeve know the marvel of he own shooting this day he have swear a solemn and silent oath that he would not kill this faithful courageous fellow from the mountain he could have plant a bullet where the life lay at any instant of the fight but he fire for another purpose the moment bull reach for he weapon he have lurch forward aim to shoot as he run pete reeve set himself a double goal he first intention be to disarm the giant the other be to stop he rush for once within the grip of those big finger he life would be squeeze out like the juice of a orange he task be doubly difficult in the moonlight but the first shot go home nicely aim as exactly as a scientist find a spot with he instrument where the moon 's ray splash across the bare right forearm of bull he send a bullet that slash through the great muscle the revolver drop from the nerveless hand of the giant but bull never pause on he come empty-handed but with power of death as the little man well know in the finger of he extended left hand he come with a snarl a savage intake of breath as he feel the hot slash of pete 's bullet but reeve standing erect like some duelist of old he left hand tuck into the hollow of he back take the great gambling chance and refuse to shoot to kill he place he second shot more effectively for this time he must stop that tremendous body advance upon he he find one critical spot between the knee and the thigh halfway up on the inside of the left leg he drive that second bullet with the precision of a surgeon the leg crumple under bull and send he pitch forward on he face perhaps the marsh ground be unstable but it seem to pete reeve that the very earth quake beneath he foot as the big man fall he swing he gun wide and lean to see how serious be the damage he have do bleeding would be the greater danger but that fraction of a second bring he into another peril the giant heave up on he sound right leg and he sound left arm and fling himself forward two limb dangle uselessly with a hideously contorted face bull swing he left arm in a wide circle for a grip and scoop in pete reeve as the latter spring back with a cry of horror the action sweep pete in and crush he gun hand and arm against the body of he assailant paralyze he only power of attack or defense reeve be carry down to the ground as if beneath the bulk of a mountain there be no question of spare life now pete reeve begin to fight for life he wrestle at he gun to tug it free but find it anchor he pull the trigger and the gun speak loud and clear but the bullet plunge into empty space then he feel that left arm begin to move and the hand work up behind he back like a great spider higher it rise and the huge thick finger reach up and around he throat fumble to get at the windpipe pete reeve make he last effort it be like strive to free himself from a ton 's weight hysteria of fear and horror seize he and he voice give utterance to he terror as he scream the big finger join around he throat any further pressure would end he he look up into the glaring eye and the contorted face of the giant the rasp pant breathing paralyze he sens there be a slight inward contraction of the grip then it cease miraculously he feel the great hand relax and fall away the bulk be heave away from he and stagger to he own foot he see bull hunter support against a tree one leg useless one arm streaming i could not seem to do it say bull hunter thickly i could not noways seem to do it reeve you see i sort of like you and i could not kill you pete when pete reeve recover from he astonishment he say you can do more you can go home and tell that infernal hound of a uncle of yours that you have the life of pete reeve under you fingertip and that you do not take it it be the second time i have owe my life and both time in one day and both time to one man you tell you uncle that the big man sag still more against the tree i 'll never go home pete unless ghost walk and i 'll never tell uncle bill anything unless the ghost talk i be die pretty pronto i think pete dyin ' you be not hurt bad bull it be the bleed all the sens be run out of my head -- like water -- and the moon -- be turn black -- and -- he slump down at the foot of the tree chapter 10 when old farmer morton and he son come in they buckboard through the marsh they hear the scream of pete reeve for help leave they team they bolt across country to the open glade there they find pete still shout for help kneel above the body of a man and work desperately to arrange a effectual tourniquet they run close and discover the two man old morton know enough rude surgery to stop the bleed it be he who count the pulse and listen to the heart low he say very low -- life be just flickerin ' stranger if they be as much light of life in he say pete reeve as the flicker of a candle i 'll fan it up till it be as big as a forest fire man he be get to live h be say morton and how come the shooting stop you fool question say reeve help I get he to town and to a bed it be useless to attempt to carry that great loose-limbed body they bring the buckboard perilously through the shrubbery and then manage with infinite labor to lift bull hunter into it with pete reeve support the head of the wounded man and caution they to drive gently they manage the journey to the town as softly as possible at the hotel a strong-armed cortege bear bull to a bed and they carry he reverently have he sens be with he he would have wonder greatly and have he uncle or he uncle 's son be there they would surely have laugh uproariously in the hotel room pete reeve take command at once he be too big to die he tell the dubious doctor he be get to live and the minute you say he can not out you go and another doc come in now do you work the doctor haunt by the deep fiery eye of the gunfighter step into the room to minister to he patient he have a vague feeling that if bull hunter die pete reeve would blame he for lack of care in truth pete seem ready to blame everyone he threaten to destroy the whole village if a dog be allow to howl in the night or if the baby next door be permit to cry in the day silence settle over the little town -- silence and the fear of pete reeve pete himself never leave the sickroom wide-eyed silent-footed he be ever about he seem never to sleep and the doctor swear that the only reason bull hunter do not die be because death fear to enter the room while the awful reeve be there but the long hour of unconsciousness and delirium wear away then come the critical period when a relapse be fear finally the time come when it could be confidently state that bull be recover he health and he strength all this fill a matter of week bull be still unable to leave he bed he be dull and listless bony of hand and liable to sleep many hour through the very heart of the day at this point of he recovery the door open one day and in the warmth of the afternoon a big man come into the room shut the door softly behind he bull turn he head slowly and then blink for it be the unshaven face of he cousin harry campbell that he see with he eye close bull wonder why that face be so distinctly unpleasant when he open they again harry have draw closer he hat push on the back of he head after the manner of a baffled man and a faint smile work at the corner of he lip he take the limp hand of bull in he and squeeze it cautiously then he lay the hand back on the sheet and grin more confidently at bull well i 'll be hang bull here you be as big as life pretty near and you do not act like you know I sure i do sit down harry what brung you all this way why anxious to see how you be do again bull blink such anxiety from harry be a mystery they be not talk about much else up we way say harry but how you come across the mountain in the storm and how big you be and how you get the sheriff and how you rush pete reeve bare-handed sure be some story all the way down i just have to say that i be bull hunter 's cousin to get free meal he lick he lip and grin again so i come down to see how you be i be do tolerable fair say bull slowly and it be good of you to come this long way to ask that question how 's thing to home dad 's bung up for life can not do nothing but cuss but at that he lay over anything you ever hear harry 's eye flick nervously about the room it be he that send I down where 's reeve this be in a whisper bull gesture toward the next room asleep can he hear if i talk asleep say bull be up with I two day i take a bad turn a while back pete 's help himself to a nap and he need one now listen say harry dad figure this out and dad 's mostly never wrong he say ` reeve shot up bull now he be hang around try to make up by nursing bull accord to report because he be afraid of what bull 'll do when he get back on he foot but bull have get to know that even when he be back on he foot he can not beat reeve -- not while reeve can pull a gun nobody can beat that devil if he want to beat reeve just take advantage of he while reeve be not expect anything -- which mean while bull be sick ' do you get what dad mean sort of say bull faintly he shut out the eager dirty unshaven face i 'll just close my eye against the light i can hear you pretty well go on here be the idea everybody know you hate reeve and reeve fear you otherwise would he act like this aside from be afraid of a lynching in case you should die no he would not well one of these day you take this gun -- here harry shove one under the pillow of bull -- and call pete reeve over to you and when he lean over you bed blow he brain out that be easy and it 'll do what you 'll want to do someday you hear then you can say that reeve start something -- that you shoot in self-defense everybody 'll believe you and you 'll get one big name for kill reeve you foller I bull open he eye but they be squint as though he be in the severest pain listen harry he say at last i be think thing out i owe a lot to you dad for take I in and keep I but all i owe he i can pay back in cash -- someday i do not owe he no love not you neither harry have rise to he foot with a snarl sit down say bull let he great voice swell ever so little i be pretty near dead but i be still man enough to wring the neck of a skunk sit down harry obeyed limply and he giant cousin go on he voice soften again when you come in i close my eye say bull because it seem to I like you be a dream i would be awake i would be live among man that sort of like I and respect I and do not laugh at I and then you come and i see you dirty face and it make I think of a bad nightmare i would have when you and you brother and you dad treat I worse 'n a dog well harry i be through with that dream i 'll never go back to it i be go to stay awake the rest of my life it be you dad that put the wish to kill reeve into my head with he talk i meet reeve and reeve pump some bullet with sense into I he let out some of my life but he let in a lot of knowledge among other thing he show I what a friend might be he be stay here and nurse I and talk to I -- like i be he equal almost instead of be sort of simple like i really be and i have make up my mind that i be go to cut loose from remember you folk in the mountain i be not you kind i do not want to be you kind i want to fight like pete reeve i do not want to murder like a campbell all the way through i want to be like pete reeve he do not know it maybe when i be well he 'll go off by himself but whether he be near or far i have adopt he i be go to pattern after he and the happiest day of my life will be when i earn the right to have this man that i try to kill come and take my hand and call I ` friend ' i guess that answer you harry now get out and take my talk back to you dad and do not trouble I no more -- you spoil my sleep as he speak the door of the next room open softly peter reeve stand at the entrance harry shake with fear back toward the other door then leap far out and whirl out of sight with a slam and clatter of foot on the stair pete reeve come slowly to the bedside i be awake son he say and i could not help hearing bull flush heavily it be the best thing i ever hear say pete the best thing that be ever come to my ear -- partner with that word they hand join in reality far more than he dream bull have be bear again chapter 11 when they be together they make a study in contrast by see one it be possible to imagine the other for instance see the high narrow forehead peak face the gray-flecked hair of pete reeve he nervous step he pierce and uneasy eye -- see this man with he body from which all spare flesh be waste so that he remain only muscle and nerve it be easy to conjure up the figure of bull hunter by thinking of opposite they very voice hold a world of difference the tone of pete reeve be pitch a little high hard and somewhat nasal and when he be angry he word come shrill and ring the mere sound of he voice be irritating -- it put one on edge with expectancy of action whereas the full deep slow musical voice of bull hunter be a veritable sleep producer man might fear charlie bull hunter because of he tremendous bulk but child hear he voice be unafraid the motion of pete reeve be as fast and as deft as the whiplash striking of a snake the motion of bull hunter be premeditated and cautious as befitting one whose hand might crush what they touch and whose footfall make a flooring groan he sit cross-legged on the floor he back against the wall they have move a ponderous stool into the room so that bull might have something on which to sit but long habit have make he uneasy in a chair and he keep to the floor by preference with the great square chin rest on he fist and he knee support he elbow that position press the forearm against the biceps and the big muscle bulge out on either side vast as the thigh of a strong man with lionlike wrinkle of attention between he eye he listen to the exposition of the little man and follow he movement with patient submission -- like a pupil to whom a great master have consent to unfold the secret of he brushwork in such a manner do bull hunter drink in the word and the act of pete reeve and indeed where gun be the subject of conversation it would have be hard to find a man more thoroughly equip to pose as a expert than pete reeve that fleshless hand all speed of motion as it whip out the gun from the nerve and sinew become a incredible ghost with the holster and the long heavy colt dance and flash at he fingertip as though it be a gilded shadow as he work he talk and as he talk he stride constantly back and forth through the room with he light-falling mincing step he grow excite he flush there come a thrill and a ring and a deepen of the voice for the master be indeed talk of the secret of he craft a thousand man of the mountain and the cattle range man who for personal pride or for physical need study accuracy and speed in gunplay would have pay untold price to learn these secret from the lip of the little man to bull hunter the mystery be reveal for nothing freely and drill and drum into he through the week of he convalescence and still the lesson continue now that he be hale and hearty once more -- as the clean-swept platter from which he eat three time a day give evidence i have practice you admit say bull in he slow voice as pete reeve come to a pause but i have not get you way with a gun pete you have get a genius for it i do not blame you for laugh at I when i try to get out my gun fast i can shoot straight that be because i have not any nerve as you say but i 'll never be able to get out a gun as fast as a thought -- the way you do fact be pete i do not think fast you know shut up explode pete reeve who have be inwardly chafe with impatience during the whole length of this speech sometimes you talk like a fool bull and this be one time bull shake he head my arm be too big he say sadly the muscle get in my way i can feel it bind when i try to jerk out the gun fast better give up the job pete i sure appreciate all the pain you have take with I -- but i 'll never be a gunfighter pete reeve shake he head with a sigh and then drop into a chair grow suddenly inert no use he groan all because you be not get any confidence bull he lean forward in he sudden way know something i be keep it back but now i 'll tell you the straight of it you be faster with a gun right now than four man out of five bull gape in amazement fact cry reeve you get it out slicker than most and after it be out you shoot as straight as any man i have ever see trouble be you do not appreciate yourself you have have it drill into you so long that you be stupid that now you believe it all nonsense you get more than a million have and you be fast right now on the draw once get hold of how important it be and you 'll keep try but you think it be only a game you just play at it you do not work i wish you could have see I when i be first practice with a gun i live with it hour every day it be my companion and right up to now there be not a day go by that i do not spend some time keep on edge with my revolver bull you 'll have to do the same thing you hear he spring up again it be impossible for he to remain seat a long time you think it do not mean much look here the colt flick into he hand and lay tremble in he palm and as he talk it shift smoothly as if of its own volition forward toward he fingertip backward to the side drop out until it seem about to fall only to be catch with one finger through the trigger-guard and spin up again always the heavy weapon be in motion as though some of the nervous spirit of reeve have enter the heavy metal it respond to he thought rather than to he muscle bull hunter gaze enchanted he be accustom to forget himself and admire other look here go on the little man look at I i weigh about a hundred and twenty i be skinny i be a runt and look at you you weigh -- heaven know what no fat but all muscle from you head to you foot you be the strongest man that i have ever see take I i be not a coward but you bull you do not know what fear means well there you be without fear and stronger than three strong man you be pretty fast with a gun and you shoot straight as a hawk look and still if we stand face to face and go for we gun i would live and you with you muscle would be dead bull i know bull nod that be what this gun mean cry pete this gun and the fact that i can get it out of the leather faster 'n you do not very much faster but by just as much quicker as it take for a eyelid to wink that be not much time but it be enough time to mean life or death that be all i be not the only man that be faster 'n you be they 's other i have never be beat to the draw but they be some that be shoot so close to I that it sound like one gun go off -- with a sort of a stammer and any one of those man would of shot you dead bull if you would fight 'em now know that tell I be you go to keep practice i 'll keep tryin ' pete but i 'll never get much faster you see my arm -- it be too big too heavy it get in my way handle a little thing like a revolver pete spin the big colt and shove it back into the holster so incredibly fast that the steel hiss against the leather there you go run yourself down he mutter he begin to pace the room again bite he nether lip and now and then shooting side glance at bull glance partly guilty and partly scornful presently he come to a halt he have also come to a new resolution one that cost he so much that bead of perspiration come out on he forehead bull he say gravely i be go to tell you the secret you have tell I a dozen already bull sigh you have teach I how to swing the muzzle up and not too far up and how to lean back instead of forward and how to harden the arm muscle just as i pull the trigger and how to squeeze with the whole hand and keep my wrist stiff and how -- none of they thing count say pete gravely almost sadly compare to what i be go to tell you stand up it be plain that he be go to give something from the depths of he mind the cost and importance of it make he eye like steel and draw he mouth to a thin straight line bull hunter arise and as the great body unfold and the leg straighten it seem that he would never reach he full height at length he stand enormous wide towering he be not a freak but simply a perfectly proportioned man increase to a huge scale pete reeve cant he head back and look into the face of the giant there be a momentary affectionate appreciation in he eye then he harden he expression let you arm hang loose bull hunter obey the hand come just above the holster that be strap on he thigh all these week pete reeve have keep he from go a instant without that gun except when he sleep and even when he sleep the gun have to be under he pillow because it help to have it near all the time pete have explain it sort of soak into you dream it be never out of you mind it haunt you like the face of the girl you love you see bull hunter do not see but he have nod humbly after he fashion and obey now with he arm fall loose at he side he peer studiously into the face of he master gunman and wait for the next order draw the command be snap out bull 's gun whip from the holster and pete reeve draw in the same instant carelessly he eye watch the movement of bull instead of pay heed and put he gun up again but bull follow the example almost reluctantly nearly beat you that time pete he exclaim happily but maybe you be not half try beat I sneer pete i be not half try but you do not beat I i shoot you twice before you have you muzzle in line i shoot you in the throat and through the tooth before you gun be ready bull with a shrug of the massive shoulder touch the mention place and look with awe at the little man now listen bull grow tense watch my draw pete do not put he hand near the butt of he weapon he hold he arm out before he dangle in the air there be a convulsive moment one could see the imaginary weapon shoot from the holster and become level and rigid pointed at its mark i have see before -- fast as my eye could go bull sigh look again say pete grit he tooth with impatience this time i be go so slow a cow could see and beat I he make the same motion but to a ordinary eye it be still as fast as light bull shake he head idiot cry pete he voice jump up the scale flat and harsh and pierce it be the wrist not the arm but the -- he stop with a expression of dismay even now he regret reveal the mystery it seem but then he go on i find out quick that i could not beat a good gunman if i use the old method practice make perfect they practice as much as i do so i study the method and the great idea come to I they all use the whole arm look at you you shoulder bulge up when you make the draw and you raise the whole arm matter of fact you would ought only to use you finger not stir a muscle above the wrist now try bull try -- the gun do come clear of the holster no good he say gravely it be magic when you do it pete it just make a fool of I shut up and listen pete say sharply i be tell you a thing that 'll save you life some day he draw a little closer he emotion make he swell to a greater stature and he rise a little on tiptoe as if partly to make up for the difference between they bulk bull obey now start think start concentrate on that right hand there be nothing else to you body you see you forget you get a muscle there be three thing in the world you see just three thing and no more there be you gun with a bullet in it there be you hand that be go to get the gun out and there be you target -- that doorknob say keep on think they be not any more to you body you be just a hand and a eye all you nerve be down there in that hand they be all pile down there that hand be full of electricity do not let you eye wander keep on concentrate you be stock the electricity in that hand when you hand move it 'll be as fast as the jump of a spark and when that hand move the gun be go to come out clean in it it be _ get _ to come out with it you hear it be _ get _ to you fingertip catch under the butt they flick up they do not draw the gun they throw it out of the holster they pitch the muzzle up and the butt come smack back against the palm of you hand and in the same part of a second you pull the trigger you hear he lean forward tremble from head to foot the eye of the big man be begin to narrow i hear i understand he say through he tooth you do not pull the gun you _ think _ it out of the leather and then the bullet hit the doorknob you do not move you arm you arm do not exist you be just a hand and a brain -- thinking and that think send a bullet at the mark he leap back draw there be a wink of light at the hip of bull hunter and the gun roar instantly he cry out alarmed confused ashamed i do not mean to shoot pete i be a fool i do not mean to it -- i sort of could not help it the -- the trigger be just pull without my want it to lord what 'll people think but pete reeve have fling he arm around the big man as far as they would go and he hug he in a hysteria of joy then he leap back dance throw up he hand you do it he cry he voice squeak hysterical i make a fool of myself all right say bull bewilder by this exhibition of joy where he have expect anger fool nothing look at that knob the doorknob be a smash wreck drive into the thick wood of the door by the heavy slug of the revolver footstep be run up the stair of the hotel pete reeve run to the door and fling it open it be all right boy he call clean a gun and it go off no harm do chapter 12 and now say pete reeve look almost ruefully at he pupil with a little practice on that they be not a man in the world that could safely take a chance with you i could not myself pete i mean it son not a man in the world i be afraid all the time i be afraid you do not have that there electricity in you or whatever they call it i be afraid you have too much beef and not enough nerve but you have not and now that you have the knack keep practice every day -- think the gun out of the leather -- that be the trick bull hunter look down to the gun with great stare eye as though it be the first time in he life that he have see the weapon pete reeve note he expression and abruptly become silent grin happily for there be the dawn of a great discovery in the eye of the big man the gun be no longer a gun it be a part of he it be flesh of he flesh he have literally think it out of the holster and the report of the weapon have startle he more than it have frighten anyone else in the building he look in amazement down to the broad expanse of he right hand it be tremble a little as though in fact that hand be fill with electric current he close he finger about the butt of the gun at once the hand become steady as a rock he toy with the weapon in loosely open finger again and it slide deftly it seem impossible for it to fall into a awkward position the voice of pete reeve come from a great distance and they be only one thing lack to make you perfect -- and that be to have to fight once for you life and drop the other gent after that happen -- well pete reeve will have a successor how much that mean bull hunter very well know the terrible fame of pete reeve run the length and the breadth of the mountain of course bull do not for a moment dream that pete mean what he say it be all figurative it be say to fill he with self-confidence but part of it be true he be no longer the clumsy-handed bull hunter of the moment before a great change have take place from that moment he very way of think would be different he would be capable of less misty movement of the mind he would be capable of use he brain as fast as he hand act a tingle of new life new possibility be open before he he have always accept himself as a stupidly hopeless burden in the world a burden on he friend useless cloddish now he find that he have hope he own mind and body be a undiscovered country which he be just begin to enter what might be therein be worth a dream or two and bull hunter straightway begin to dream happily that be a talent which he have always possess in superabundance the brief remainder of the day pass quickly and then just before supper time a stranger come to call on pete reeve he be a tall bony fellow with straight-looking eye and a imperious lift of he head when he address anyone manners be he name -- hugh manners when he be introduce he run he eye unabashedly over the great bulk of bull hunter and then promptly he turn he back on the big man and exclude he from the heart of the conversation it irritated bull unwontedly he discover that he have change a great deal from the old day at he uncle 's shack when he be use to the scorn and the indifference of all man as a worthless and stupid hulk of flesh with no mind worth consider but he say nothing another great talent of bull 's be he ability to keep silent shortly after this they go down to the supper table all through the meal hugh manners engage pete reeve in soft rapid-voiced conversation which be so nicely gauge as to range that bull hunter hear no more than murmur he seem to have a great many important thing to say to pete and he keep pete nodding and listen with a frown of serious interest at first pete try to make up for the insolent neglect of he companion by draw a word or two from bull from time to time but it be easy for bull to see that pete wish to hear he newfound friend hold forth it hurt bull but he resign himself and draw out of the talk after supper he go up to the room and find a book there have be little time for reading since he pass the first stage of convalescence from he wound pete reeve have keep he constantly occupy with gun work and the hunger for print have be accumulate in bull he start to satisfy it now beside the smoking lamp he hardly hear pete and hugh manners enter the room and go out again onto the second story of the veranda on which they room open from time to time the murmur of they voice come to he but he regard it not it be only when he have lower the book to muse over a strange sentence that he wander eye be catch beyond the window by the flash of a fall star of unusual brilliance it be so bright indeed that he cross the room to look out at the sky step very softly for he have grow accustomed to lighten he footfall and now unconsciously the murmur voice of the talker make he move stealthily -- not to steal upon they but to keep from break in on they talk but when he come to the door open on the veranda the word he hear banish all thought of fall star he listen dazed pete reeve have just break into the steady flow of the newcomer 's talk it be no use hugh i can not go you see i be tie down here with the big fellow tie down think bull hunter and he wince a curse then why do not you throw the big hulk over he be not a hulk protest pete somewhat sharply and the heart of bull warm again hush say hugh manners he 'll be hear no danger he be at he book and that mean that he would not hear a cannon that be he way he do not look like a book-learned gent say hugh manners with more respect in he voice he do not look like a lot of thing that he be say pete i do not know what he be myself -- except that he be the straightest gentlest kindest simplest fellow that ever walk bull hunter turn to escape from hear this eulogy but he dare not move for fear he retreat might be hear -- and that would be immensely embarrassing just what he be i do not know say pete again he do not know himself he be have what you might call a extra-long childhood -- that be why he be get that misty look in he eye that fool look scoff hugh manners you think so i tell you manners he be just wake up and when he be clear wake up he 'll be a world-beater you see that doorknob smash yep what of it he do it with a gun standing clean across the room with a flash draw shooting from the hip -- and he make a clean center hit of it pete bring out these fact jerkily one by one pile one extraordinary thing upon the other and when he have finish hugh manners gasp i be mighty glad he say that you tell I that i -- i might of make some mistake you would sure have make a awful mistake if you tangle with he manners do not forget it you work i guess partly say pete modestly i speed he draw up a bit but he have the straight eye and the steady hand when i start with he he do not need much target practice -- just the draw and he be really fast he be get my draw that tell volume to manners and why not take he in with we he ask after a reverent pause not that exclaimed pete besides he could not ride and keep up with we he would wear out three hoss a day with he weight maybe we could find a extra-strong hoss he be not so big as to kill a good strong hoss pete i have see a hoss that carry -- no good say pete with decision i would not even talk to he about we business he do not guess it he think that i be -- well he do not have any idea about how i make a living that be all but how _ will _ you make a living if you stick with he i dunno pete sigh but i be not go to turn he down but be not you about use up you money it be pretty low and you be support he sure he be not get a cent bull start he have not think of that matter at all but it stand to reason that pete have expend a large sum on he sponge say manners cynically do not talk about it that way say pete uneasily he be like a big kid he do not think about those thing if i be break he would give I he last cent that be what you think shut up manners bull be like -- a cross between a son and a brother pretty big of bone for you son pete you 'll have a hard time support he and manners chuckle then more seriously you be make a fool of yourself pardner throw this big hulk over and come back -- with I they 's load of money stake out wait for we listen say pete solemnly i be go to tell you why i 'll never turn bull hunter down if i live to be a hundred when i be a kid a dirty trick be do I by old bill campbell i wait all these year till a little while ago to get back at he then i find he and fight he i do not kill he but i ruin he and send he back to he home tie on he hoss with a bust shoulder that he 'll never be able to use again he right shoulder at that there be a subdue exclamation from manners but pete go on seem he be the uncle of this bull take bull in when bull be orphan because he have to not because he want to and he raise bull up to be a sort of general slave around the place well when he come back home all shoot up he try to get he son to take my trail but they do not have the nerve but bull that they would always look down on for a big good-for-nothing hulk -- bull step out and take my trail on foot and hit across the mountain in a storm above the timberline and he follow till he come up with I here where he find I in jail accuse of a murder do he turn back he do not he do not want the law to hang I he want to kill I with he own hand so 's he could go back home and hear he uncle call he a man and praise he a little that show how simple he be well i 'll cut a long story short bull scout around find out that the sheriff have do the killing himself and just saddle the blame on I and then he make the sheriff confess get I out of jail and take I out in the wood ` now ' say he ` you have get a gun and i have get a gun and i be go to kill you if i can ' no use argue he go for he gun i do not want to kill a man who have save my life i try to stop he with bullet i shoot he through the right arm and make he drop he gun then he charge I barehand there be a gasp from manners barehand repeat pete that be the stuff that be in he i shoot he through the left leg he pitch onto he face and then hang if he do not get up on one arm and one leg and throw himself at I he get that big arm of he around I i could not do a thing my gun be squeeze between he and I he start fumble pretty soon he find my throat with they big gorilla finger of he i think my last minute have come one squeeze would have smash my windpipe -- and good-bye pete reeve but he would not kill I after i would fill he full of lead he let I go after he have the advantage he would not take it pete choke he conclude briefly he mighty near bleed to death before i could get the wound bandage and then i stay on here and nurse he matter of fact manners he save my life twice and that be why i be tie to he for life besides between you and I he mean more to I than the rest of the world put together listen say manners after a pause i see what you mean and i 'll tell you what you get to do that big boy will do anything you tell he he foller you with he eye well we 'll find a hoss that will carry he i guarantee that then you put you game up to he best foot forward and he 'll come with we not in a thousand year say pete with emotion that boy will never go crooked if i can keep he straight do you know what he be do because he uncle and cousin try to get I he be swear never to see one of 'em again he be give they up -- he own flesh and blood -- to follow I and i be go to stick to he that be complete and final no pete of all the fool -- bull wait to hear no more he steal back to the table on the far side of the room sick at heart and sit down to think or try to think the truth come to he slowly pete reeve whom he have take as he ideal be as a matter of fact -- he dare not think what the blow shake he to the center but he have be live on the charity of reeve he have be drain the resource of the generous fellow and how would he ever be able to pay he back one thing be definite he must put a end to any increase of the obligation he must leave the moment the thought come to he he tear a flyleaf out of the book and write in he big sprawling hand : _ dear pete : _ _ i have to tell you that it have just occur to I that you have be pay all the bill and i have be pay none that have to stop and the only way for I to stop it be to go off all by myself i hate to sneak away but if i stay to say good-bye i know you 'll argue I out of it because i be no good at a argument good-bye and good luck and remember that i be not forget anything that have happen that when i have enough money to pay you back i be come to find you if i have to travel all the way around the world _ _ you pardner bull _ that do he pause a moment tempt to tear up the little slip but the original impulse prevail he put the paper on the table pick up he hat and steal slowly from the room chapter 13 he go out the back door of the hotel so that few people might mark he leave and cut for the wood once in they he change he direction to the east head for the lower rolling hill in that direction he turn back when the light of the town have draw into one small glimmer ray then this too go out and with it the pain of leave pete reeve become acute he feel lose and alone that keen mind have guide he so long as he stalk along with the great swinging stride through the darkness the holster rub on he thigh and he remember pete truly he have come into the hand of pete reeve a child and he be leave he as a man the dawn find he forty mile away and still swing strongly down the wind road it be better country now the desert sand have disappear and here the soil support a good growth of grass that would fatten the cattle it be a cheerful country in more way than the greenness of the grass however there be no high mountain but a continual smooth rolling of hill so that the landscape vary with every half-mile he travel and every now and then he have to jump a runlet of water that murmur across he trail a pleasant country a clear sky and a cool wind touch at he face the contentment of bull hunter increase with every step he take he have diminish the sharpness of he hunger by take up a few link of he belt but he be glad when he see smoke twist over a hill and come on the other side in view of a crossroads village he finger the few piece of silver in he pocket that would be enough for breakfast at least it be enough barely that and no more for the long walk have make he ravenous and the keenness of he spirit serve to put a razor edge on a appetite which be already sharp he begin eat before the regular breakfast at the little hotel be ready he eat while the other man be present he be still eat when they leave how much he say when he be do he host scratch he head i figure three time a regular meal ought to be about it he say even then it do not cover everything but matter of fact i be ashamed to charge any more he ruefulness change to a grin when he have the money in he hand and bull hunter rise from the table but you get something to feed son he say you certainly get something to feed and -- be what the boy be say right it come to bull that while he sit at the table there have be many curious glance direct toward he and a hum whisper have pass around the table more than once but he be accustom to these side glance and murmur and he have pay no attention besides food have be before he i do not know what do they say that you be dunbar from the south -- hal dunbar that be not my name say bull my name be hunter i guess they be wrong say the other trouble be every time anybody see a big man they say ` there go hal dunbar ' but you be too big even to be dunbar i reckon he survey the bulk of bull hunter with admire respect this personal survey embarrass the big man he would have withdraw but he host follow with he conversation we know dunbar be come up this way though he send the word on up that he be go to come to ride diablo i guess you have hear about diablo bull aver that he have not and he eye go restlessly down the road it weave in long curve delightfully white with the border of green on either side he could see it almost toss among the far-off hill now be the time of all time for walk and if pete reeve start to trail he this morning he would need to put as much distance behind he by night as he long leg could cover but still the hotel proprietor hang beside he he want to make the big man talk it be possible that there might be in he a story as big as he body so you be not hear of diablo devil be the right name for he black as night and meaner 'n a mountain lion that be diablo he be big enough and strong enough to carry even you account of he be so strong that be why dunbar want he big enough and strong enough to carry I repeat bull hunter he have have unfortunate experience try to ride horse he weight crush down they quarter and make they walk with brace leg to be sure that be up in the high mountain where the horse be little more than pony yep big enough he be kind of a freak hoss you see run to almost seventeen hand i have hear tell though i be not see he he be over to the bridewell place yonder in the hill -- along about fifteen mile by the road i figure he run till he be three without ever be take up and he get wild as a mustang they never be good on manage on the bridewell place you see and then when they try to break he he start do some breaking on he own account they say he can jump about halfway to the sky and come down stiff-legged in a way that snap you neck near off i see young huniker along about a month after he try to ride diablo huniker be a pretty good rider by all account but he be sure a sick gent around hoss after diablo get through with he scare of a ten-year-old mare huniker be after diablo finish with he scott porter try he too that be a fight last close onto a hour they say nip and tuck all the way diablo be not buck all the time no he be not that way he wait in between spell till he be think up something new to do and he be always think they say but if he be not so mean he would be a wonderful hoss get a stride as long as from here to that shed they say he ramble on with a grow enthusiasm and think of a hoss like that be give away give away say bull with a sudden interest and then he remember that horse be outside of he education entirely he listen with gloomy attention while he host go on yes sir give away be what i say and give away be what i mean old chick bridewell have keep he long enough he say he be tire of pay buckaroo for get bust up try to ride that hoss man-eater that be what he call diablo and he want to give the hoss away to the first man that can ride he hal dunbar hear about it and send up word that he be come up to ride he he must be a brave man say bull innocently he have a immense capacity for admire other brave the proprietor pause as though this have not occur to he before why they be not such a thing as fear in hal dunbar i guess but if he decide to ride diablo he 'll ride he well enough he have he way about thing hal dunbar do the sketchy portrait impressed bull hunter greatly you know he then how would i be mistake you for he if i know he no he live way down south but they be a pile hear about he that be never see he for some reason the word of he host remain in the mind of bull as he go down the road that day oddly enough he picture man and horse as be somewhat alike -- diablo vast and black and fierce and hal dunbar dark and huge and terrible of eye also which be proof enough that bull hunter be a good deal of a child he care less about the world as it be than for the world as it might be and as long as life give he something to dream about he do not care in the least about the fact of existence another man would have be worry about the future but bull hunter go down the road with he swing stride perfectly at peace with himself and with life he have not enough money in he pocket to buy a meal but he be not think so far ahead it be still well before noon when he come in sight of the bridewell place it vary not a whit from the typical ranch of that region a low-built collection of shed and arm sprawl around the ranch house itself about the building be a far-flung network of corral bull hunter find he way among they and follow a sound of hammer he be well among the shed when a great black stallion shot into view around a nearby corner toss he head and mane he be pursue by a shrill voice cry diablo hey you old fool stand still it be I it be tod to the amazement of bull hunter diablo the terrible diablo the man-killer pause and reluctantly turn about shake he head as though he do not wish to obey but be compel by the force of conscience at once a bare-legged boy of ten come in sight running and shake he fist angrily at the giant horse indeed it be a tremendous animal not the seventeen hand that the hotel proprietor have describe to bull but a full sixteen three and so proudly high-headed so stout-muscled of body so magnificently long and taper of leg that a wiser horseman than the hotelkeeper might have put diablo down for more than seventeen hand most tall horse be like tall man -- they be freakish and malformed in some of they member but diablo be as trim as a pony he have the high withers the mightily sloped shoulder and the short back of a weight carrier and although at first glance he underpinning seem too frail to bear the great mass of he weight or withstand the effort of he drive power of shoulder and deep broad thigh yet a closer reckoning make one aware of the comfortable dimension of the cannon bone with all that this feature portend diablo carry he bulk with the grace which come of compacted power well in hand not that bull hunter analyze the stallion in any such fashion he be literally ignorant of horseflesh but in spite of he ignorance the long neck not overfleshed suggest length of stride and the mighty girth mean wind beyond exhaustion and tell of the great heart within the point of a ordinary animal may be overlook but a great horse speak for himself in every language and to every man he be coal-black this diablo except for the white stock of he off forefoot he be night-black and so silken sleek that as he turn and prance flash of light glimmer from shoulder to flank bull hunter stare in amazement that change to appreciation and appreciation that burst in one overpower instant to the full understanding of the beauty of the horse joy enter the heart of the big man he have look on horse hitherto as pretty picture perhaps but useless to he here be a animal that could bear he like the wind wherever he would go here be a horse who could gallop tirelessly under he all day and labor through the mountain bear he as lightly as the cattle pony bear ordinary man the cumbersome feeling of he own bulk which usually weigh heavily on bull disappear he feel light of heart and light of limb in the meantime the bare-legged boy have come to the side of the big horse still shrill he anger he stand under the lofty head of the stallion and shake he small fist into the face of diablo the terrible and while bull quake expect to see the head tear from the shoulder of the child diablo point he ear and sniff the fist of the boy inquisitively in fact this could not be the horse of which the hotelkeeper have tell he or perhaps he have be recently tame and break that for some reason make the heart of bull hunter sink the boy now reach up and twist he finger into the mane of the black come along now and if you pull away ag ` in you old fool diablo i 'll give you a thumping i tell you git along diablo meekly lower he head and make he step mince to regulate he gait to that of he tiny master he be bring alongside a rail fence there he wait patiently while the boy climb up to the top rail and then slide onto he back again bull hunter catch he breath he expect to see the stallion leap into the air and snap the child high above he head with a single arching of he back but there be no such violent reaction diablo indeed turn he head with he ear flatten and bare he tooth but it be only to snort at the knee of the boy plainly he be bluff if horse ever bluff the boy carelessly dig he brown toe into the cheek of the great horse and shove he head about giddap he call git along diablo diablo walk gently forward hurry up i be not get all day and the boy thump the giant with he bare heel diablo break into a trot as soft as smooth flow as water passing over a smooth bed of sand bull run to the corner of the shed and gape after they until the pair slide around a corner and be go instinctively he draw off he hat and gape he be startle back to himself by loud laughter nearby and look up he see a old fellow in overalls with a handful of nail and a hammer he stand among a scattering of upright which represent apparently the beginning of the skeleton of a barn now he lean against one of these upright and indulge he mirth bull regard he mildly he be use to be laugh at chapter 14 that be the way they all do say the old man they all gape the same fool way when they see diablo the first time be that the wild horse ask bull in he gentle voice that be he i s ` pose after see tod handle he you 'll want to try to ride he right off bull look in the direction in which the horse have disappear he swallow a lump that have rise in he throat and shake he head sadly nope you see i dunno nothing about horse really the old man regard he with a new and sudden interest take a wise man to call himself a fool he declare axiomatically bull take this dubious bit of praise as a invitation and come slowly closer to the other he have the child 's way of eye a stranger with embarrassing steadiness at a first meeting and thereafter pay little attention to the face he write the feature down in he memory and keep they at hand for reference as it be as he draw nearer the old man grow distinctly serious and when bull be directly before he he gaze up into the face of bull with distinct amazement at a distance the big man do not seem so large because of the grace of he proportion when he be directly confront however he seem a veritable giant by the lord you _ be _ big and who might you be stranger my name 's charlie hunter though mostly folk call I just plain bull that be queer chuckle the other well glad to know you i be bridewell they shake hand and bridewell note the gentleness of the giant as a rule strong man be tempt to show they strength when they shake hand bridewell appreciate the modesty of charlie hunter and you do not come to ride diablo no i just stop in to see he and -- bull sigh profoundly i know he give even I a touch now and then though i know what a devil he be devil repeat bull astonished why he be as gentle as a kitten because you see tod ride he bridewell laugh that do not mean nothing tod can bully he sure but just let a grown man come near he -- with a saddle that 'll change thing pretty pronto you 'll see the finest little bit of boiled-down hell-raising that ever be the jingle of a pair of spur be diablo 's idea of a drum -- and he make he charge right off gentle huh the grunt be expressive and what good 's a hoss if he can not be ride with a saddle he wave the subject of diablo into the distance they be not any hope unless hal dunbar can ride he if he can not i 'll shoot the beast shoot he echo bull hunter he take a pace back and he big boyish face cloud to a frown not that i guess why not ask bridewell curious at the change in the big stranger why not what good be he why -- he be good just to look at i would keep he just for that and you can have he just for that -- if you can manage to handle he want to try bull shake he head i do not know nothing about horse he confess again he glance at the skeleton of stand beam build a barn eh you would not call it pitch hay or shoe a hoss that i be do i guess say the old fellow crossly i be fuss at build a barn but a fine chance i get i get all my timber here -- look at that he indicate the stack of beam and lumber around he and then i get some man out of town to work with I on it but they get lonely do not like work on a ranch besides they have a scrap with I i would not have 'em loaf around the job rather have no help at all than have a loafer help I so they quit then i try to get my cowhand to give I a lift but they would not touch a hammer specialist in cow be what they say they be ding bust 'em so here i be try to do something and do nothing how can i handle a beam that it take three man to lift he illustrate by go to a stack of long and massive timber and tug at the end of one of they he be able to raise that end only a few inch you see bull nod suppose you give I the job handle the timber he suggest i be not much good with a hammer and nail but i might manage the lift all by yourself one man he eye the bulk of bull hopefully for a moment then the light fade from he face nope you could not raise 'em not they joist yonder i think i could say bull old bridewell thrust out he jaw he have be a combative man in he youth and he still have the instinct of a fighter i get ten dollar he say that say you can not lift that beam and put she up on end that one right there that i try to lift a minute ago all right bull nod you be on for the bet the old man chuckle gayly all right let 's see you give a heave bull hunter obediently step to the timber it be a twelve footer of bulky dimension heavy wood not thoroughly seasoned yet he do not approach one end of it he lay he immense hand on the center of it old bridewell chuckle to himself softly as he watch he be begin to feel that the big stranger be a little simple-minded he chuckle cease when he see the timber cant over on one edge look out he call for bull have slip he hand under the lift side you 'll get you finger smash plumb off that way i have to get a hold under it you see explain bull calmly and so say he knee sag a little and when they straighten the timber rise lightly in he hand and be place on he shoulder where would you like to have it ask bull bridewell rub he eye yonder he say faintly bull walk to the designate place the great timber teeter up and down quiver with the jar of each stride there he swing one end to the ground and thrust the other up until it be erect be this the way you want it say bull by this time bridewell have recover he self-possession to some degree yet he eye be wide as he approach yep just let it lean agin ' that corner piece will you hunter bull obey that might make a fellow 's shoulder sort of sore he remark if he have to carry those timber all day all day gasp bridewell and then he see that the giant indeed be not even pant from he effort he be already turn he attention to the pile of timber here he say reluctantly draw out some money here 's you ten but bull refuse it can not take it he explain i just make the bet by way of talk you see i know i could lift it and you do not have any real idea about I besides if i would lose i could not have pay i have not any money he say this so gravely and simply that old bridewell watch he quizzically half suspect that there be a touch of irony hide somewhere it gradually dawn on he that a man who be flat break be refuse money which he have win fairly on a bet the idea stagger bridewell he be within a ace of put bull hunter down as a fool something hold he back through some underlying respect for the physical might of the big man and a respect also for the honesty which look out of he eye he pocket the money slowly he be never averse to save but i have be think say bull as he sadly watch the money disappear that you might be need I to help you put up the barn do you think you could hire I h be grumble bridewell you think you could handle these big timber all day yes say bull if none of 'em be any bigger than that last one yes i could handle 'em all day easily it be impossible to doubt that he say this judiciously and not with a desire to overstate he power in spite of himself the old rancher believe you see explain bull eagerly you say that you need three man for that work that be why i ask and i suppose you would want the pay of three man bull shake he head anything you want to pay I he declare the rancher frown this sound like the beginning of a shrewd bargain and he respect and suspicion be equally increase suppose you say what you want he ask well bull say slowly i would have to have a place to sleep and -- i be a pretty big eater i guess you be say bridewell but if you do three man 's work you get a right to three man 's food what else do you want bull consider as though there be few other wish that he could express i have not any money he apologize d'you think maybe you could pay I a little something outside of food and a place to sleep bridewell blink and then prepare himself to become angry when it dawn on he that this be not intend for sarcasm he find that bull be search he face eagerly as though he fear that he be ask too much what would do you suggest bridewell tentatively i dunno say bull sigh with relief anything you think it be plain that the big man be half-witted -- or nearly so bridewell keep the sparkle of exultation out of he eye you leave it to I then and i 'll do what be more 'n right by you when d'you want to start work right now chapter 15 when bull leave the dining room that night after supper mr bridewell look across the table at she husband with horror in she eye do you see she gasp he eat the _ whole _ pot of bean sure i see he and he grin but -- he 'll eat we out of house and home why he be like a wolf bridewell chuckle with superior knowledge he be eat enough for three he admit but he be work enough for six -- besides most of he wages come in food but work i never see anything like it he handle more timber than a dozen when it come to spike they in place he see I swing that twelve-pound sledge and near break my back ' i think it be easier this way ' he say ` besides you can hit a lot faster if you use just one hand ' and he take the hammer and send that big spike in all the way to the head with one lick and he wonder why i do not work the same way be not get any idea how strong he be mrs bridewell listen with wide eye the idea she murmur the idea where 's he now she husband go to the back door he be sit over by the pump talk to tod sit talk like they be one age i reckon he be sort of half-witted how come sharply ask mr bridewell be not tod get more brain than most growed-up man i reckon he have admit the proud father and if they have put the same question to bull hunter the giant would have agree with they emphatically he approach the child tamer of diablo with a diffidence that be almost reverence the freckle-faced boy look up from he whittle when the shadow of bull fall athwart he with a equal admiration also with suspicion for the cowpuncher on the whole be apt to make game of the youngster and he grave grown-up way he be therefore shrewdly suspicious of jest at he expense furthermore he have see the big stranger heave the great timber about and whirling the sledge with one hand he half suspect that the joke might be point with the weight of that heavy hand he amazement be accordingly great when he find the big man actually sit down beside he cross-legged and he be absolutely stupefy when bull hunter say i have be aim at this chance to talk to you tod all day h be grunt tod noncommittally and examine the other with a cautious side glance but the face of bull hunter be unutterably free from guile tod instantly begin to adjust himself the man he most worship be the lean swift profanely formidable cowpuncher but there be something in he that respond with a thrill to this accept equality with such a man as bull hunter even he father he have see stricken to a awed silence at the sight of bull 's prowess you see explain bull frankly i be wonder how you manage to handle diablo the way you do tod chuckle it be just a trick you watch I a while with he you 'll soon catch on but bull shake he head as he answer maybe a mighty bright man might figure it out but i be not good at figure thing out tod the boy blink he be accustom to the study understatement of the cowpuncher and he be accustom also to they real vanity which underlie the surface shyness but it be patent that bull hunter in spite of he size be truly humble this conception be new to tod and slowly grow in he brain he active eye run over the bulk beside he he almost pity the giant besides pondered bull heavily i guess there be a whole lot of bright man that have see you handle diablo but they could not make out what you do they try to ride diablo and get they neck nearly break they be good rider but i be not you see diablo 's the first horse i have ever see that could really carry I he add apologetically i be so heavy no vanity certainly he gesture toward himself as though he be ashamed of he brawn and the heart of tod warm and expand he himself would never be large and he heart have ache because of he smallness many a time yep he say judiciously you be pretty heavy about the heaviest i ever see i guess maybe hal dunbar be as big but i never see hal i have hear a good deal about hal but -- he stop short and stiffen tod see that the eye of the big man have fix on the corral in which stand diablo a puff of wind have come and the great black have throw up he head into it a impose picture with mane and tail blow sidewise not until the stallion turn away from the unseen thing which he have scented in the wind do bull turn to he small companion with a sigh tod nod he eye glint i know he say i use to feel that way -- before i learn how to handle diablo he interpret you feel like it would be pretty fine to get onto diablo 's back and have he gallop under you about the finest thing in the world sigh bull hunter he cast out he great hand before he as he try to explain the mysterious emotion which the horse have excite in he you see tod i be pretty big and i be pretty slow most folk have horse and they get about pretty lively on 'em but i have always have to walk the enormity of this lack make tod stare for travel and horse be inseparably connect in he mind he shudder a little at the thought of the big man stalk across the burning and interminable sand of the desert or toiling through the mountain it seem to he that he could see the sign of that pain stamp in the face of bull hunter and he heart leap again in sympathy so when i see diablo -- bull pause but tod have understand suddenly the boy become excited suppose you be to learn to ride diablo before hal dunbar come to try he out suppose that could you teach I the giant ask in a almost awed whisper the child look over he companion with a vague wonder it would be a tremendous responsibility this teaching of the giant but what could be more spectacular than to have such a man as he pupil but to share he unique empire over diablo -- that would be a great price to pay no he decide it would not do besides suppose even i _ could _ teach you how to ride diablo -- with a saddle which i do not think i could -- what would happen when hal dunbar come up to these part and find that the hoss he want be somebody else 's he would make a awful fuss -- and he be a fight man bull he say this impressively lean a little toward the giant and he be reward infinitely by see the right hand of the giant stir a little toward the holster at he thigh i guess i would have to take my chance with he be all bull answer in he mildest tone tod be begin to guess that there be a certain amount of mental strength under this quiet exterior he have often note that he father who make by far the most noise be more easily placate than he mother in spite of she gentle silence the strength of bull hunter have a strain of the same thing about it you would take a chance with hal dunbar he repeat wonderingly he tremble a little with a sort of nervous ecstasy at the thought of that come encounter that be more 'n anybody else in these part would do why everybody be hear about hal dunbar everybody 's scared of he he can ride anything that be big enough to carry he he can fight like a wildcat with he hand and he can shoot like -- he eye wander toward a superlative -- like pete reeve almost he conclude with a tone of awe a spark of tenderness shone in the eye of bull d'you know pete reeve no and i do not want to ma have a brother once and he meet up with pete reeve a tragedy be infer in that oblique reference bull decide that this be a conversational topic on which he must remain silent and yet he yearn to speak of the little withered catlike fellow with the wise brain who have do so much for he when i be big enough muse the boy with a quiet savagery maybe i 'll meet up with pete reeve bull switch the talk to a more comfortable topic but how would you make a start with that man-eating diablo tod study the question i get a way with hoss you see he begin modestly he play two brown finger in he mouth and send out a shrilling whistle that be answer immediately by a whinny and a little chestnut gelding sun-faded to a sand color nearly canter into view around the corner of a shed and approach they he come to a pause nearby and have study bull hunter with large unafraid curious eye for a moment begin to nibble impertinently at the ragged hat brim of the child git away exclaim tod and when the chestnut make no move to go the brown fist flash up at the reach head but the head be jerk away with a motion of catlike deftness he be a terrible bother crackajack be say the boy angrily and from the corner of he eye he steal a glance of unspeakable pride at the big man he be a beauty exclaim bull hunter a regular beauty for crackajack combine the toughness of a mustang and the lean strong running line of a thoroughbred in miniature he leg be as delicately make as the leg of a deer he head be a little model of impish intelligence and beauty you and crackajack be pal say bull i guess that be what you be we get on tolerable well admit the boy whose heart be full with this praise of he pet bull continue on the agreeable topic and i 'll bet he be fast too he look like speed to I maybe you do not know hoss but you sure get hoss sense tod chuckle most folk take crackajack for a toy pony he be not i have see he carry a full-grown man all day and keep up with the best of 'em he do not mind the weight of I no more 'n if i be a feather he be fast he be tough and he know more 'n a hoss should know you might say he change he voice and a brief command make crackajack give up he teasing and retreat bull watch the exquisite little creature go with a smile of pleasure he do not know it but that smile unlock the last door to tod 's heart he be pretty near as wild as diablo when i first get he say the boy and mean -- say he would be kick around all he life but i fat he up in the barn and he get so 's he would follow I around and now he run loose like a dog and come when i whistle he know more thing than you could shake a stick at crackajack do i 'll bet he do say bull with shine eye say say the boy suddenly i be go to tell you about the way i work with diablo i 'll take that mighty kind say bull gratefully d'you think i would have a chance with he even if you show I how you get to have a way with hoss admit the boy and he examine bull again but i think you 'll get on with hossflesh pretty well when diablo first come he use to go plumb crazy when anybody come near he corral he still do if a grow man come there well they use to go out and stand and watch he and laugh at he prance around and kick up a fuss at the sight of 'em and it make I mad make I plumb mad to see they bother diablo when he be not do no harm when they be not gain anything by it either i use to go out when nobody be around and stand by the bar with a bit of hay and grain head in my hand first off he would prance around even at I but pretty soon he see that i be not big enough to do he no harm and then he would just stand still and snort and look at I along about the third time he take notice of the grain head and come and smell they and the next day he eat 'em well i keep at it that way pretty soon i go inside the corral diablo just come up sort of excited and tremble and do not know whether to bash my head in with he forehoof or let I go then he see the grain head and eat they while he be make up he mind what to do about I and he wind up by just have a little talk with I he be terribly dirty and dusty and he be shed nobody dare to brush he and so i take a soft-haired brush and start to work on he neck he like it and so i dress he down and leave he pretty near shine and every day after that i go and have a talk with he and brush he then i ride crackajack up to the bar and let diablo see I on he with no bridle or saddle pretty soon i find out that it be the saddle and the bridle and the spur that scared diablo to death he do not mind anything else so very much so one day i climb up the fence and slide onto diablo 's back and he just turn he head and snort at I just then pa see I and let out a terrible yell and diablo pitched I right off over he head and over the fence but i get right up and come back to he he see that he could get I off whenever he want to and he see that i do not do he no harm when i get on after that everything be easy i never bother he none with a saddle or a bridle and there you be d'you think you can do the same but the saddle and the bridle say bull what about they that be up to you to figure out a way of get he use to 'em i 'll go introduce you now if i can bull rise and the boy lead the way if he take to you pretty kind say the boy you may have a chance but if he begin act up it will not be no use chapter 16 diablo greet they with a throw up of he formidable head he take he place in the very middle of he corral but when bull hunter and he small guide reach the bar the black stallion seem to go suddenly mad he fling himself into the air and come down buck back and forth across the corral he throw himself in the wildest swirl of pitch that bull hunter have ever see or ever dream of he be a educate bucker you see say the boy in admiration they be not any trick that he do not know look diablo have begin to sunfish in the most approved method and swirl from this to some fence rowing as swift as the jagged course of lightning at every jump bull could see a imaginary rider snap from the back of the black giant a cloud of dust be send swish up and in the midst of this fog diablo come to a pause as sudden as the beginning of he strange struggle against a imaginary foeman but it seem to bull hunter that the ground beneath he foot be still quiver from the impact of that mighty body that be just he way of tell you what he 'll do when you try to saddle he chuckle the boy as he speak he slip through the bar of the corral look out exclaimed bull in horror for the stallion have rush at the small intruder with gaping mouth bull reach for he gun -- diablo be already on the child but at the last minute he swerve and flash around tod in a circle he be all right tod be shrill through he laughter for the horrify face of bull amuse he that be just he way of say that he be glad to see I in fact diablo come to a sudden halt directly behind the child he head tower aloft above that of tod while he flash he defiance at bull hunter as though he be make use of the small bulwark of tod against the stranger diablo you old fool the boy be say as he reach up and manage to wind he finger in the end of diablo 's mane you come along and meet my friend bull hunter i figure you be go to get to know he pretty good before long hey bull come up close to the bar so 's he can see you be not get a rope or a whip or spur and stick you hand out so 's he can sniff at it that be he way of say how d'ye do bull obey and to he amazement diablo respond to the small forward urge of the child 's hand and approach the bar one tremble step at a time bull begin to talk to he softly he have never talk like this to any living creature he do not know exactly what he say the word come of they own accord into he throat he only know that he want to reassure the big powerful uncertain brute and though diablo stop short at the first sound of bull 's voice and lay he ear back he presently prick one of those ear again and allow himself to be draw forward with long crouching stride that be the way say the child softly as though he fear that a loud voice might break in upon the spell you know how to talk to he and outside of I you be the only one that do i know you would have it in you for diablo have extend he long neck and actually sniff the hand of bull hunter he immediately toss he head aloft but he do not flinch away that be half the fight win already advise the boy in the same soft voice d'you want to try the saddle on he now the saddle now exclaim bull i should say not why he do not hardly know I i 'll have to get acquaint before i try anything like that he discover that tod be nod in hearty approval you do know he say do not tell I that you be not be around hoss a pile yep you get to get acquaint what you want to do now bull consider i would like to have something to show he that it be not unpleasant have I around i would like to have he see some good result you know be there anything i could feed he the boy chuckle best thing be some dry prune with the pit take out of 'em i have some at the house they get stick in diablo 's tooth and it be sure funny to see he eat 'em but he just nacherally plumb like the taste of the prune he follow he own suggestion by scamper away to the house and return almost at once with a hat full of the prune you want to feed he these now first say bull i would like to have you leave we alone if i can not teach he to like I all by myself then i would better give up right away the boy look at he in surprise and then impulsively stretch out he hand they shake hand gravely you get the right idea pardner say tod go ahead -- and good luck and keep talk to he all the time that be the main thing he retreat accordingly but before the evening be over bull regret dismiss he little ally so quickly for although diablo indulge in no more threatening outbreak of temper he resolutely refuse to eat the prune from bull 's hand several time he approach the bar of the corral and the patiently extend hand but always he draw back snort and sometimes he would run around the corral shake he head and throw up he heel after the manner of a horse tempt but still afraid of be overrule it be long after dark when bull give up the attempt he go back to the bunkhouse roll up the blanket which have be assign to he and carry they out to the corral close to the fence he lay they down and a few minute later he be wrap in they and sound asleep the last thing he remember be the form of the great stallion standing watchfully in the exact middle of the corral the starlight glimmer very faintly in he big eye bull hunter fall asleep and have a nightmare of the arrival of the famous hal dunbar the next day a fierce conquest of diablo and the battle end with the departure of dunbar on the back of the stallion the dream wake he nervous and he turn and see diablo standing huge and formidable in the darkness as though he have not move from he first position in the morning the arduous labor of the building begin again and though the prodigious appetite of bull at the breakfast table make even old bridewell look askance bull have not be at work a hour handle the ponderous upright and joist before he employer be smile to himself he new hand be certainly worth he keep and more for weariness seem a stranger to that big body and no weight be too great to be cheerily assume and always he work with a sort of nervous anxiety as though he fear that he might not be do enough during the day bridewell attempt to probe the past history of he hire man expect a story as big as the body of the man but bull be discreetly vague for he have no wish to reveal he connection with pete reeve and if he leave out reeve he feel that there be nothing in he life worth talk about many a time he wonder what the little gunfighter be do and what trail he be ride now a dangerous trail he doubt not and a lawless trail he greatly fear but someday he might be able to find the terrible little man and bring he back to a truer place in society that night he begin again the long quiet struggle with diablo and before he end diablo have gather some of the dry fruit from the palm of he hand with a sensitive tremble pair of lip and he have come back for more and more yet it be not until the next night that bull venture inside the bar of the corral and sit cross-legged on the ground with a vague feeling that diablo would be less alarmed if he visitor bulk less large inside the bar he seem a entirely new proposition to the stallion the big black keep discreetly on the far side of the corral with much snort and stamp and it be not until the next evening that he venture to approach the man still another day pass before bull be allow to stand and touch the neck of the black and that it seem to he be the greatest forward step toward the conquest it be terribly slow work and in the meantime the skeleton frame of the barn be fast rise would he accomplish he purpose by the time the barn be complete and bridewell no longer have a use for he or would hal dunbar arrive before that appoint time that night however another portentous event happen wake in the night bull hear a sound of deep regular breathing close to he and turn on he side he see that diablo have lie down as close to he as the corral fence would allow and there he sleep panther-black sleek in the starlight bull stretch out he hand the head of the stallion jerk up but a moment later he carelessly sniff the extend finger and resume he position of repose and the heart of bull hunter swell with triumph that event give he a new idea and the follow evening he make a groundwork of branch in the corner of the corral itself and put down he blanket on the evergreen diablo be much concerned and walk about examine the new work from every angle there bull sleep and the next night he find that during the day the stallion have tear the bough to piece and scatter they about he patiently lay a new foundation and after this the bed be leave strictly alone in the meantime bull have make a light strong halter of rawhide and after several attempt he manage to slip it onto the head of diablo once in place it be easy to teach diablo that he must follow when he feel a pull on the halter -- the first step be reward with dry prune and after that it be simple on that evening also bull make he next step forward toward the most difficult proposition of all -- he take a partly fill barley sack and put it on the back of diablo the next moment the sack be shoot into the air as diablo leap up and arch he back like a cat at the height of he leap he come down tremble and snort but bull pick up the fall sack and allow he to smell it diablo find that the smell be good and that the hateful sack even contain thing very good to eat the next time the sack be put on he back he quiver and shrink but he do not buck it off after that bull spend he evening in gradually increase the weight of that sack until a full hundred pound cause diablo no worry whatever and when this point have be attain bull decide that he might venture he own bulk on the back of diablo he confide he purpose to tod and the boy greatly excited hide himself at a distance to watch in the begin it be deceptively easy diablo stand perfectly unconcerned as bull raise himself on the bar of the fence and when the long leg of bull be pass over he back diablo merely turn he head and sniff the shoe tentatively slowly very softly steadying himself on the top bar of the fence bull lower he weight more and more until the whole burden be on the back of the stallion -- and then he take he hand from the top rail but the moment he release that grip there be a change in diablo as though he realize that the man have suddenly trust himself entirely to he mount bull feel a sudden wincing of all that great body the quarter sink and tremble he think at first that it be because the horse be fail under the weight of this ponderous burden but instinct tell he a moment later that it be fear and a mixture of suspicious anger diablo take one of he long catlike step and pause without bring up he other foot in vain bull speak to he softly steadily diablo take another step quicken to a soft trot and stop suddenly that weight on he back fail to leave he he begin to tremble violently bull feel the sudden thundering of the great heart beneath the pressure of he knee to the stallion this man have be a friend a constant companion the touch of he hand be pleasant pleasanter still be the continual deep murmur of the voice reassure tell he of a superior and guardian mind look out for he interest now that hand be stroke he sleek neck and that voice be steadily in he ear but the position be the most hate one to be sure there be no saddle no cutting binding cinch no drag of cruel spanish curb to control he head no tear spur to threaten he but he flank twitch where the spur have dig in many a time and he pant remember the cinch those memory build up a panic he become unsure the voice reach he less distinctly moreover it be a strange time of the evening the light of the day be nearly do the moon be barely up and all thing be ghostly and unreal in that slant light something of all that go through the mind of diablo be understand by bull hunter it be telegraph to he by the twitching and vibration of great muscle by the stiff arching of the neck and the snort breathing but he be begin to forget fear the stallion dance lightly forward and as the wind strike the face of bull hunter he suddenly rejoice this be what he have dream of to be carry thus lightly easily the weight that have crush other horse be nothing to diablo it make he feel buoyant he become tinglingly alert on the back of diablo not a horse of the mountain could overtake he if he flee and not a man of the mountain could escape he if he pursue on the back of the stallion that think have hardly form in he excited mind when diablo spring cat-footed to one side it make bull hunter sway and he naturally seek to preserve he balance by grip the powerful barrel of the horse with he knee but at the first touch of the knee diablo go suddenly mad exactly what he do bull hunter never know indeed it seem that diablo leave he foot shoot a dizzy height into the air and at the crest of he rise do three or four thing at once at any rate as the stallion land bull pitch from the arched back and hurtle forward and to the right side he land heavily against the ground he head strike a small rock and he lay there a moment stunned far off he hear tod shrilling at he bull be you hurt he gather himself together and arise i be all right stay where you be do not try he again he 'll kill you bull maybe but i be go to try diablo stand on the far side of the corral in the moonlight a splendid figure with haughty tail and head inwardly he be tremble enraged he know what would come he have throw man before and usually he have try to batter they to piece after they fall this man he have no desire to batter there have be no saddle no bridle no spur no quirt -- nevertheless he must not be control by the hand of any man but have throw the fellow now other man would run on he swing the accursed rope over they head shout cursing at he in strident voice vitally he yearn to break through the bar of the corral and flee but the bar be there and he must stay in the inclosure with this friendly enemy it be not the prostrate man he fear so much as vengeance from other man for that have always be the way but no one come no shout be hear except from the small thin familiar voice of tod and presently the giant arise from the ground where he have fall and come toward he diablo flatten he ear expectantly at the first throat-tearing curse he would charge but no curse come the man approach as always with extended hand and the voice be the smooth gentle murmur that carry peace into the shadowy mind of a horse something relax in diablo if the man do not resent be throw off -- if that be a sort of game as it be -- why should he diablo resent have the man on he back the hand touch he nose gently another hand be stroke he neck presently he be lead to the fence and again that heavy weight slide onto he back he crouch again with wave of blind panic surge up in he but the panic do not master he sense this time and as he brain clear he begin to discover that there be no urge no will of another impose upon he he could walk where he please follow he own sweet will or else he could stand still it make no difference but the soft-touching hand and the deep quiet voice be assure he that the man be glad to be up there on he back diablo turn he head one ear quiver and come forward tentatively then the other he have accept bull hunter afterward bull find tod the boy wring he hand ecstatically that be what i call game he say why tod the big man smile you do the same thing he know i be nothing but you be a growed man but -- what be this bull you back 's all wet it be nothing much say bull calmly when i fall my head hit a stone there be some thing worth pay for and diablo 's one of they chapter 17 the cut prove as he have say to be a small thing but it turn out that diablo be far from win he be halter and he would carry bull bareback the saddle be quite another affair so bull return to the idea of the barley sack with gradual addition on each side of the sack he attach hang strap diablo snort at these and try they with he tooth they remind he vaguely of the swing stirrup that have so often batter he tender side he discover that the strap be not alive however and be not harmful and when they length be increase and a uncovered stirrup be tie on each side he gradually become accustomed to these also the next stage be pass the strap under he belly they be tie there loosely the circle be complete and diablo examine they critically find nothing wrong then a dozen time in a single evening the strap be draw up tighter and tighter until they touch he at this he become excited and it require all the resourcefulness of bull to quiet he but in three day the barley sack and its queer-looking addition have be change for a true saddle -- with the cinch draw up tight enough for ride and this without elicit a single buck spasm from diablo not even to tod do bull hunter impart he great tiding he have not yet climb into that real saddle diablo have not yet hear the creak of the stirrup leather under the weight of he rider indeed there be still much to be do before the happy day when he saddle the black stallion and take down the bar of the corral gate and ride he out and ride he without a bit for on the point of steel in the mouth of diablo bull hunter know that the horse would be against it resolutely so he confine himself to a light hackamore alone that be enough for diablo have learn to rein over the neck and stop at the slightest pull of the rein the next morning he go out to he work with a light heart they have have the help of several new man during the past ten day and now the frame of the roof be almost complete it would not be long before bull 's service could be dispense with and he connect the idea of the completion of the barn in a symbolic fashion with the completion of he conquest of the stallion the two would be accomplish in the same moment as it be no wonder then that as he climb the ladder up the side of the barn with the ladder quake beneath he weight bull hunter begin to sing he thundering bass ringing among the ranch building until mr bridewell open the kitchen window to hear the better and old bridewell stop he ear in mock dismay at the thunder of bull 's voice but the work be not two hour old when little tod scamper up to he side bull he whisper hal dunbar be down yonder with a couple of man he be come to ride diablo what 'll we do bull what 'll we do diablo will throw he say bull with conviction but he will not he can not stammer the boy in he excitement nothing could throw hal dunbar wait till you see he just you wait till you see gee bull he be as big as you and -- the other qualification be apparently too amazing to be adequately describe by the vocabulary of tod if any other man can ride diablo say bull at length i do not think i care about he so much i have be figure that i be the only man who can get on he back if somebody else can handle he they be welcome to the horse as far as i be concerned be you go to let he go like that tod be bitter with shame and anger after all we work be you go to give he up without a fight a fight would be a gunfight and a gunfight end up in a death say bull gently i do not like bloodshed tod the boy writhe here be a idol smash with a vengeance i might of know he groan you be not nothing but -- but a big hulk and he turn on he heel and give the exciting news to he father for a event of this caliber bridewell call down all he man from the building and they start for the corral hal dunbar and he two man already be stand close to the bar and diablo stand quiver high-headed in the center of the inclosure but of the picture the attention of bull hunter center mainly on hal dunbar he dream of the man have be true he be a huge fellow as tall as bull or taller and nearly as bulky but about bull hunter there be a suggestion of ponderous unwieldiness and there be none of that suggestion about hal dunbar he be lithe and straight as a poplar and as supple in he movement the poise of he head and the alertness of he body and something of lightness in he whole posture tell of the trained athlete providence have give the man a marvelous body and he have improve it to the uttermost to crown all there be a remarkably handsome face dark eye and coal-black hair yet more than the impose body of this hero of the range bull be impress by the spirit of the man the thing that tod have feel he feel in turn it shine from the eye it speak in the set of dunbar 's mouth something unconquerable it be impossible after a single glance to imagine this man fail diablo it be true have the same invincible air indeed they seem mean for each other this horse and this man they might have be pick from a crowd and the one assign to the other huge lithe fleet powerful and fiercely free surely hal dunbar be intend by fate to sit in the saddle and govern diablo accord to he will the heart of charlie hunter sink here be the end then of all the love he have put into he work of all the feminine gentleness with which he have pet diablo and soothe he and he discover in that bitter moment that he have not work merely to gain control of the horse there would be no joy in make diablo bend to he will he aim be and from the first unconsciously have be to win diablo so that the stallion would serve he joyously and freely out of the love he bear he as he think of this he glance rest on the long spoon-handled spur of big hal dunbar dunbar be shake hand with bridewell lean a trifle over the little old man here be one that 'll be sorry to see you ride diablo say bridewell he point to hunter he be be work week try to make a pet out of the hoss a pet out of he a pet echo dunbar he measure bull hunter with a certain bright interest the sleeve of bull be roll up to the elbow and down the forearm run the tangling mass of muscle but the interest of dunbar be only monetary presently he lip curl slightly and he turn he haughty head toward the great stallion i 'll do something more than pet he ill make something useful out of the big brute saddle he boy he gesture carelessly and he two attendant start toward the corral one with a heavy saddle and one with a rope as he stand roll he cigarette and watch negligently he impress bull as a veritable knight of the range a baron with baronial adherent it come partly from he splendid stature and more from he flauntingly rich costume the heavy gold braid on the sombrero the gilded spur the brilliant silk shirt would have be out of place on another man but they fit in with hal dunbar they be adjunct to the pride of he face bull 's attention waver to tod be -- be they go to rope diablo tod flash a half-disgusted half-despairing glance up at he companion what d'you think they be go to do what do you think bull turn away sick heart he could not bear the thought of the great stallion struggle helpless in the snaky coil of the rope but of course there be no other way yet he muscle tighten and the perspiration pour out on he forehead as he hear a shout from one of the man then a brief drum of diablo 's hoof and finally the heavy thud as the stallion strike full length on the ground that sound stunned bull as though he have receive a blow himself every nerve in he be tingle revolt against the brutality they be idiot hopeless fool to dream of conquer diablo by brute force and if they succeed they would have a broken-spirited horse on they hand worse than useless or else a treacherous man-killer to the end of he day he look again diablo saddle and blindfold be be drive out of the corral a man hold he on either side and he mouth drag out be already bleed from the cruel spanish bit at that bull hunter see red when he sens return to he he go hurriedly to dunbar friend he say earnestly plead will you let I make a suggestion the insolent dark eye run over he mockingly oh you be the fellow who try to make a pet out of diablo well what be the suggestion if you wear those spur you 'll drive he mad take 'em off mr dunbar dunbar stare at he in amazement and then look to the other do you hear that this wise one want I to try to ride without spur who teach you to ride eh i do not know much about it confess bull humbly but i know you be apt to cut he up badly with those big spur and what the devil difference do that make to you cry dunbar with heat and what do you mean by all these fool suggestion i be ride the horse bull draw back downhead hal dunbar cast one contemptuous glance toward he and then step to the side of diablo the stallion be quiver and crouch with fear and anger and shake he head from time to time to get clear of the bandage which blind he and make he helpless now and then he rear a little and come down on prance forefoot and bull note the spring and play of the fetlock joint the whole run mechanism of the horse indeed seem compose of coiled spring once release what would the result be and the first hope enter he mind the first hope since he have see the proud form of hal dunbar now the big man set he hand on the pommel and vault into the saddle with a lightness that bull admire hugely under the impact of that descend bulk the stallion crouch almost to the earth but he come up again with a snort and a strangle neigh of rage be you ready call dunbar gather the rein and give the string of he quirt another twist around he right hand one of he man have mount he horse with a rope the noose end of which be around diablo 's neck this would serve as a pivot block to keep diablo run in a circle if he try to run in a straight line the run noose would stop he and choke he down he would have to gallop in a circle for he buck and to help keep he in that circle the spectator now group themselves loosely in a wide rim but bull hunter do not move from where he stand he could see all that he wish all ready call the man with the rope let she go then the bandage be tear from the eye of the stallion by dunbar 's second assistant and the fellow leap aside as he do so even then he barely escape diablo have launch himself in pursuit and he tooth snap a fraction of a inch from the shoulder of the fugitive as the rope come taut and jerk he aside and the full weight of dunbar be throw back on the rein that mighty wrench of back and shoulder and arm would have break the jaw of a ordinary horse it hardly disturb diablo he head be first tuck back until he chin be against he breast but a moment later he be head down buck as never horse buck before one second earlier hal dunbar have seem almost as powerful as the animal he ride now he suddenly become small for one thing diablo waste no time run against the rope he follow the line of least resistance and bolt around the wide circle with tremendous leap gather impetus as he run -- then stop in mid-career by the terrific process of hurl himself in the air and come down on four stiff leg and with he back humped so that the rider sit at the uneasy apex of a pyramid and this be merely a begin that wild category of trick which bull have see partially unravel the first time he visit the horse be now bring forth again enlarged improve upon make more intricate intensify but well and nobly do hal dunbar sustain he fame as a peerless rider he ride straight up and a cheer come from the spectator when they see that he be not touching leather in the midst of the fiercest contortion of diablo it seem that the great brute would snap the very saddle off he back but still the rider sit erect sway as though in a storm but still firmly glue to the saddle even the heart of bull hunter warm to the battle they be a brutally glorious pair as they struggle the wrenching hand of the rider and the spanish bit have bloody the mouth of the stallion the spur be cling horribly at he side and he fight back like a mad thing he fling himself on the ground dunbar barely slip from the saddle in time and whip onto he foot again but as he lurch up he carry the weight of the rider again for dunbar have leap into he seat and as diablo come up on all fours it could be see that the big man have secure both stirrup -- the difficult thing in that feature of the fight dunbar urge the stallion on with a yell and swing the quirt over he head he bring it down with a stinging cut on the silky flank of the great horse bull hunter crouch as though the lash have cut into he own flesh he become savage for the moment he want to have he hand on that rider but the cut of the quirt transform diablo if he have fight hard before he now fall into a truly demoniacal frenzy the long flash leg be spring indeed and the moment he hoof strike the earth he be fling up again to a greater height he be sunfish now in that most deadly manner when the horse land on one forehoof the rider receive a double jar from the down-shock and then the whiplash snap to the side hal dunbar be no longer use he quirt it dangle idly at he side the joy have go from he face in its place as shock after shock benumb he brain there be a expression of fierce despair neither be he ride straight up but he be pull leather otherwise nothing human could have retain a seat in the saddle for a instant diablo squeal snort and grunt with effort be dash back and forth fling himself aloft come down on one stiff leg double back with jackrabbit agility there be no longer applause from the onlooker old bridewell himself in all of he year have never see ride such as this and it seem that diablo at last have meet he master never have he fight as he fight now never have he be stay with as he be now with foam and sweat the great black be reek but never once be the effort relax it be too terrible a sight to be applaud then at the end of a run instead of hurl himself into the air as he have usually do before diablo fling himself down and roll it catch dunbar by surprise but the yell of horror from the bystander stimulate he to sharp action and he be out of the saddle in the last hair 's breadth of time diablo have be carry on over to he foot by the impetus of the fall and he be already rise when dunbar leap for the saddle fair and true he strike the saddle and with marvelous skill he left foot catch the stirrup and clung to it -- but the right foot miss its aim and before dunbar could lodge he foot squarely the stirrup be dance crazily as diablo begin a wild combination of cross-bucking and sunfish the hat snap from the head of dunbar and he long black hair toss with both hand he be cling all joy of battle be go from he in its place be stare fear for he right foot be still out of the stirrup choke he down choke he -- he shriek before he could be obey by he confused henchman diablo shoot into the air and at the very crest of he rise buck dunbar lurch to one side there be a groan from the bystander and the next instant the stallion landing on the one stiffen foreleg have snap he rider from the saddle and hurl he to the ground he lay in a shapeless heap and the stallion whirl to finish he enemy chapter 18 every second of the fight bull hunter have follow the action of the horse as though he be direct they from the distance with some electric form of communication and control when hal dunbar with a yell of despair be flung sidewise in the saddle as diablo buck in mid-air bull hunter know what be come and lurch through the line of watcher straight across the open space of the circle he race as he have never run before and while the other stand freeze while the man with the rope tug futilely bull come in front of the stallion as diablo whirl to smash he late rider to a pulp there be no question of dunbar crawl out of the way he have roll on he back with arm outstretch helplessly stunned even in the lightning speed of the action bull find time to wonder what would be the result if the hoof of the wild horse crash down into that upturned handsome face now stain with crimson and black with dust he have no time to imagine further diablo red-eyed with anger have whirl on he and rear and swerve from those terrible paw hoof bull hunter leap in and up he goal be not the toss bridle rein but the stout strap which circle the head just above the bit and he big right hand jar home on this goal all he weight be behind he stiffened arm and under the blow the stallion lurch higher a down-sweep of a forefoot gash bull 's shoulder and tear he shirt to shred but he press expect every instant the finish blow on he head in he go with all he weight behind the effort and feel the stallion stagger on he hind leg then topple lose balance and fall with a crash on he side bull follow he in the fall for half a step then whirl scoop the nerveless body of hal dunbar in he arm and rush stagger under the burden to the edge of the circle diablo have regain he footing instantly but as he strive to follow the rope have draw taut about he throat and he be check as for bull hunter he lay the senseless burden down in safety and turn toward the stallion one haunting fear be in he mind have diablo be sufficiently blind in the excitement of the battle to fail to recognize he or have the great horse know the hand that topple it back in the latter case bull hunter could never come near the black without peril of he life in a gloomy quandary he stare at the tremble shine giant who stand with he head high and he tail flaunt and all the fierce pride of victory in he eye one knot of people have gather over the fall hal dunbar but some remain dazed and gaping look at the form of the conqueror a wild temptation come to bull to test the horse even in this crisis of excitement with every evil passion rouse in he he step out again he right hand extend he voice soft diablo the stallion jerk he head toward the voice but the head be twitch away as the man with the rope bring it taut again you fool he shout get back or the hoss 'll nail you unreasoning rage pour thrilling through bull hunter he shake he great fist at the other slack away on that rope or i 'll break you in two there be a moment of amaze silence then with a curse the rider throw the rope on the ground get you head break then bull hunter have forget he already he have resume that approach at he voice the stallion turn that proud and terrible head -- with the ear flatten against he neck it give he a ominous snakelike appearance about the head but still bull go steadily and slowly toward he with he hand out that ancient gesture of peace and good will there be shout and warning from the other hal dunbar he sens return have stagger to he foot he have receive no injury in the fall and now he gape in amazement at this empty-handed man approach the stallion and diablo be no longer control by the rope but all the outcry mean nothing to bull hunter they fade to a blur all he see be the head of the stallion have he known and remember that fall and the hand that force he to it he could not tell there might be any murderous intent in that quiver crouch form just that name over and over again very softly diablo steady diablo now he be within two pace -- within a yard -- he finger be close to the terrible head and the ear of diablo prick forward ah diablo they 'll never touch you with the spur again the stallion make a long step and with he head raise he look over the shoulder of bull hunter and snort he defiance at all other man in the world and down he neck the big gentle hand be run soothing he quiver body and the steady voice be bring infinite message of reassurance to the troubled brain that hand be loosen now the rope which be burn into he neck -- loosen it draw it off and now the bridle follow and diablo 's mouth be free from the cruel taint of the steel the head of the stallion turn -- great soft eye look into the face of bull hunter and accept he as a friend forever hal dunbar groggy from the shock of the fall stagger toward they get away from the horse he command hey riley grab diablo for I again i 'll ride he this time he be too unsteady to walk in a straight line but the fire of battle be in he eye again there be no doubt the gameness of the big man old bridewell catch he arm and draw he back if diablo get a sniff of you on the wind he 'll come at you like a wolf stand back here -- and watch hal dunbar be too daze to resist besides he begin to see that all eye be focus on the black stallion and the man beside he that man be the huge cloddish stranger who have advise he to ride without spur then the full meaning come to dunbar the rope be no longer around the neck of the stallion the very bridle have be take from he head and yet the stranger stand undaunted beside he and the stallion do not seem to be anger by that nearness the next thing dunbar hear be the voice of bridewell say nerviest thing i ever see i be put this bull hunter down for a half-wit pretty near all he strength in he back and none in he head but i change my mind today when you hit the ground diablo whirl on you and he would of smash you to bit before they could choke he down and pull he away but bull come out of the crowd on the run grab the bridle make diablo rear take that cut on he shoulder and throw he fair and square finest coolest headiest thing i ever see do with a hoss in a pinch and he save you skin dunbar you would be a mess this minute if it be not for hunter he throw diablo and turn around and pick you up as if you be a baby and pack you over here then he go back -- and you see what be he be do he save my life mutter dunbar that big -- he save my life gratitude for the moment at least be obscure in he mind all he feel vividly be a burning shame he hal dunbar the invincible have be beat fairly and squarely in the battle with the horse not only this he have be save from complete destruction only by the intervention of this nonentity this bull hunter whom he have scorn only a few moment before he look about he in blind anger at the bystander worst of all this be a new country where he be only vaguely know and whenever he name be mention in these part in the future there would be someone to tell of the superior prowess of hunter and how the life of dunbar be throw away and save by another no wonder that big hal dunbar writhe with the shame of it he forget even that emotion now in wonder at what be happen hunter have step to the side of the horse raise he foot and put it in the stirrup do the fool intend to climb into the saddle while that black devil be not blindfold without even a bridle that in fact be what he be do the steady murmur of the voice of hunter reach he as the big man soothe the horse he see the head of diablo turn see he sniff the shoulder of he companion and then hunter lift himself slowly into the saddle there be a groan of excitement from the spectator and at the sound rather than at the weight of he back diablo crouch it be only for a moment that he quiver wild-eyed irresolute then he straighten and throw up he head bull hunter he face white and draw but he mouth resolute have touch the shine flank of the stallion and diablo move into a soft trot gentle as the flow of water before he the circle split and roll back he glide through guide by a hand that touch lightly on he neck and in a utter silence he be see to turn the corner of the nearest shed and approach the corral hal dunbar rub he eye be the first to speak a trick horse he say by the lord a trick horse the first time i ever see he play that trick gasp old bridewell he eye huge and round except when tod be up on he i dunno what be happen it be like a dream but there be a saddle on he now and that be something even tod could never make he stand i dunno what be happen the little crowd break up into chatter group here have be a thing that would bear tell and retell for many a year in the confusion dunbar 's man riley approach he employer both gratitude and shame be forget by dunbar now he grip the shoulder of this man and groan i have lose he riley the only horse ever foal that could have carry I the way a man should be carry now i 'll have to ride plow horse the rest of my life he point to the cloddish heavy-limbed gray which he have ride in he quest for the superhorse at the bridewell place i be think say riley i be think a pile the last few minute what you be think about what good do think do I i have lose the horse have not i and that half-wit have he he have he -- now suggest riley watch the face of the big man for fear that he might go too far you mean by that query the master exactly say riley because he have the black now it do not mean that he be go to have he forever do it riley you be a devil that fellow save my life they tell I i do not mean you be go to bump he off but suppose you get he to come and work on you place there might be way of get the hoss -- buy he or something get he there and we 'll find a way besides he can teach you how to handle the hoss before you get he i say it be all turn out for the best dunbar frown take he with I and every place i go i hear it say ` there be the man who ride the horse that throw dunbar ' no curse he i 'll see he in hade before i take he with I how else be you go to get the hoss tell I that that be it mutter dunbar i have get to have he i have get to have he do you watch i feel as if the big black devil have wing he have you in the air most of the time all right and riley grin shut up snap he master but the chief thing be i want to show that big black fiend that i be he master he -- he be beat I once but one beating do not finish I then go get hunter to come with we when we ride back dunbar hesitate another instant and then nod it have to be do he stride off in pursuit of bull and presently find the big man in the corral rub down the stallion the little bright-eyed tod be close beside they it have be a great day for tod first he have feel that he giant pupil be disgrace -- a man without spirit and then in the time of blackest doubt bull hunter have become a hero and accomplish the great feat -- ridden diablo before all the incredulous eye of the watcher all of tod 's own effort have be repay a thousandfold when he hear bull say to one of those who follow with question and admiration it be not my work tod show I how to go about it tod deserve the credit that be the reason that tod 's eye now be supernally bright when big hal dunbar approach diablo show sign of excitement but charlie hunter quiet he with a word and go to the bar of the corral the hand of dunbar be stretch out and bull take it with humble earnestness i be glad you be not hurt bad he say for a minute or two i be scare that diablo -- i know cut in dunbar for he detest a new description of the scene of he failure then he make himself smile but i have come to thank you for what you do hunter between you and I i know that i talk rather sharp to you a while back i be sorry for that and now -- why man you side must be wound it be just a little scratch say bull good-naturedly it be not the first time that diablo have make I bleed but now -- well be not he worth a fight mr dunbar and he gesture to the magnificent watchful head of the stallion the heart of hal dunbar swell in he by fair means or foul he must have that horse and on the spot he make he proposition to hunter he have only to climb on the back of diablo and ride south with he the pay would be anything -- double what he get from bridewell who besides be almost through with he dunbar understand but i be not much good and bull sigh reluctantly i can not use a rope and i do not know cattle and -- i 'll find use for you will you come so it be settle but before bull climb into the saddle and start off after dunbar little tod draw he to one side there be not any good in dunbar watch he and -- remember I bull chapter 19 that ride to the southern mountain seem to bull hunter to mark a great point of departure between he old life and a new life he have not hear riley fox-faced and wicked of eye say to he master what this big fool need be a little kidding make he think that we figure he to be a big gun he have not see hal dunbar make a wry face before he nod all that bull hunter could know be that the three man -- riley dunbar and joe castor -- be all exceedingly pleasant to he on the way of all the man in the world only pete reeve have treat he as these man be now do and it be sweet beyond measure to bull hunter to be treat with considerate respect to have he opinion ask to be defer to and flatter as for the thousand little aside with which they make a mock of he they be far above he head it seem only patent to bull hunter that he have be accept freely into the equal society of man he draw a vague comparison between that success and he mastery of diablo the big stallion be like a kitten under he hand it require much coax during the first half-day of ride to bring diablo within speak distance of the other man but gradually he discover that they could do he no harm so long as the gentle voice of hunter be near he thereafter he be entirely amenable to reason one could see that the stallion be learn difficult lesson but he be learn they fast eye and ear and scent tell he that these creature be dangerous old experience tell he that they be dangerous and only a blind trust in bull hunter enable he to conquer the panic which surge up in he brain time and again but he keep on try and the constant struggle against man which have feature he life make he astonishingly quick to pick up new fact the first step have be the hard one and it seem to bull hunter that the close-knit smooth-flowing muscle beneath he be carry he onward into the esteem of all man to diablo he give the praise and after diablo to little freckled tod and to pete reeve the fighter as for take any credit for himself that idea never come to he for a moment the long trip take two day they cross the green rolling hill they pass the foothill and climb steadily they come onto a broad high plateau -- it be a natural kingdom this ranch of the dunbar the fence around it be the continuous range of mountain skirt the plateau on all side and in every direction up to those blue summit as far as the eye carry stretch the land which own hal dunbar as master to bull hunter when they reach the crest and the broad domain be point out to he this seem a princely stretch indeed and hal dunbar be more like a king than ever it be easy to forgive pride in such a man and a certain asperity of temper how could so rich and powerful a man be like other the ranch house be worthy of such a hold a heavy growth of beautiful silver spruce sweep up the slope of some hill and ride through the forest one catch the first glimpse of the building it be spread out carelessly the foundation lay deep to cover the irregularity of the ground it be a heterogeneous mass obviously not the work of any one builder here a one-story wing ramble far to the side build heavily of log rudely square and there be a three-story frame section of the house and still again there be a tall tower effect of rough stone as for the barn and shed which sweep away down the farther and lower slope the meanest of they look to bull as though it might have make a home of more than average comfort the three other rider note the gaping astonishment of bull and pass the wink quietly around to hal dunbar it be grow more and more annoying that he have to trouble himself with such a clod of a man and use diplomacy where contemptuous force would have be so much more after he heart but he continue to follow the scheme first lay down for he pursuit by clever riley and when they come to the wide-ranging stable he assign the black stallion to a roomy box stall bull hunter thank he for the courtesy as though it have be a direct personal favor as a matter of fact hal feel that he be merely take care of a horse which be already as good as he come back toward the house bull walk slowly in the rear of the little party he want to take plenty of time and drink in the astonishing detail of what to he be a palace and about the weather-beaten old house he feel that there be a touch of mystery of a more or less feudal romance climb the step to the porch he turn a broad sweep of hill open above the top of the spruce and the blue mountain be pile beyond while he stand a door slam and he hear a girl 's mellow voice call hello hal what luck what luck no luck grumble young dunbar all the luck have go the way of my friend here he bring out the last word jokingly this be charlie hunter commonly call bull for reason you may guess bull this be mary hood bull have turn lumberingly and he find himself stare at a girl in a more formal ride outfit than he have ever see before with tall boot of soft red leather and a little round black hat set on she hair and a coat fit somewhat closely the rather masculine outfit only serve to make she freer more independent more delightfully herself bull hunter think she look he up and down and reserved judgment it seem he ride diablo dunbar be explain and that be why you bring he she ask flash a queer glance at hal then she come a pace down the step and shake hand with bull he take the small hand carefully with a fear that the bone would break unless he be excessively gentle at last she laugh so frankly that a tingle go through he big body and he peer closely at she as a rule the laughter of other make he hot with shame but this laughter be different it seem to invite he into a pleasant secret i be glad to meet the man who conquer diablo she be say i do not beat diablo he hasten to explain we just sort of reach a understanding he see that i do not mean he any harm -- so he let I ride he that be all there be to it he see she eye narrow a trifle as she look down at he for she have draw back to the level of the porch be she despise he and condemn he merely because he have tell she the truth he flush at the thought and then he be call into the house by dunbar and bring to a room the size of it inspire he with a profound awe and he be still gaping when dunbar leave he in the hall the master of the house meet riley and the fox-faced lieutenant draw he aside i have get a plan he say you be full of plan mutter dunbar evilly all the way home he have be strive to find some way of explain he lack of success with the stallion to mary hood she have grow up on the ranch with he for she father have be the manager of the ranch for twenty year and she have grow up with the feeling that hal dunbar be infallible and invincible do you see the big hulk look at mary hood riley ask the name come pat with the unpleasant part of hal 's brooding and he scowl grow blacker what about it look at she as though she be a angel -- touch she hand as though it be fire i tell you hal she knock hunter clean off he balance not the first she be do that to say hal with mean maybe not maybe not say riley rather hastily but i be think suppose you go to mary and tell she that you be dead set on keep this hunter with you tell she that he be a hard fellow to handle that he like she and that the best way to make sure of he be for she to be nice to he she can do that easy she take nacheral to flirt flirt with that thick-head she would laugh in my face she would do more than that for you hal h be grunt dunbar greatly mollify i ask she to make hunter happy what come of it if she father see hunter make eye at she he 'll blow the head off the clodhopper i know riley nod he be always afraid she 'll take a fancy to one of the hand and run off with he or something like that he be dead set agin ' she say two word to anybody like I say he grit he tooth and flush at the thought then he continue but that be just what you want you want to get hunter 's head blow off do not you dunbar catch the shoulder of riley and whirl he around be you talk murder to I riley i be talk sense say riley by the lord growl dunbar you be a plain bad one riley you like deviltry for the sake of the deviltry itself you want I to get -- how much do you want the black hoss chief dunbar sigh you can not touch he after he save you life and i can not touch he because everybody know that i be you man but suppose you get the girl and hunter plant then when jack hood ride in this afternoon i 'll take he where he can see 'em together leave the rest to I will you i 'll have jack hood scared she be go to elope before morning and jack will do the rest you know he way suppose hood get kill kill -- by that jack hood why you know he be near as good as you with he gat dunbar nod slowly after all the scheme be a simple one well whisper riley you and the devil win say hal after all what be this hunter amount to nothing and i need the horse he execute the first step of the scheme instantly he go downstairs and find the girl still on the veranda she begin to mock he at once you 'll go to heaven hal give a home to the man who beat you he manage to smile although the word be poison to he he have love she as long as he could remember and sooner or later she would be he wife but the period remain indefinitely in the future as the whim of the girl change it be for that reason as hal very well know that she father become furious when she smile at another man the rich marriage be he goal and when a second man step onto the stage old jack hood be ready to fight hal see a way of stop she gibe and prove he good intention toward hunter all in a breath he save my life mary i lose a stirrup and the devil of a horse throw I briefly he sketch in the story of the rescue and how bull hunter afterward have ride the horse without spur without a bridle before he end she eye be shine that be what he mean when he say he have not beat diablo i understand now at the time i think he be a little simple hal he be not exceptionally clever mary say hal and that be where the point come in of what i want you to do hunter be apt to take a fancy that he be not want here -- that he be be keep out of charity because he save my life nothing i can say will convince he i want you to give he a better reason for stay around will you do it -- as a great favor she drop she chin into she hand and study he just what be you drive at hal you know what i mean well enough i want you to waste a smile or two on he mary will you do that make he think you like he a good deal that you be glad to have he around will you take he out for a walk this afternoon and get he to tell you the story of he life you can always make a man talk and generally you turn they into fool you have do it with I often enough he add gloomily flirt with that big quiet fellow she say gravely hal you be criminal besides you know that i do not flirt it be just the opposite when i like a man i be simply frank about it but you have a way of be frank so that a poor devil usually think you want to marry he and then there be the devil to pay you know it perfectly well that be not true hal i will not argue but will you do it absolutely not it might be quite a game he may not be altogether a fool and suppose he be to wake up suppose he be simply half-asleep he see a gleam of excitement come in she eye and wisely leave she without another word after thing have reach a certain point mary could be generally trust to carry the action on chapter 20 jack hood have ride out on he round with a new horse that morning and the new horse develop the gait of a plow horse the result be that grim old jack reach the house that night with a body rack by the labor of the day and a disposition poison for the entire evening he be meet at the stable by riley and the sight of he bring a spark for the moment into the eye of the foreman you be back then and you get diablo look yonder jack hood go to the box stall and come back rub he hand but he exultation be cut short by riley 's remark he do not belong to hal hal be throw and another gent ride he the amazement of jack hood take the shape of a wild torrent of profanity he be proud of the ranch which he have control for so long and still prouder of he young master he creed include two main point -- the essential beauty of he daughter and the infallibility of young hal dunbar consequently he great ambition be to unite the two mary take to hunter pretty kindly conclude riley as they walk back toward the house at the conclusion of the story the foreman take off he hat and shake back he long iron-gray hair trust she for that something new be always what she want they have get the new well pretty near sink say riley take a look at it all right but before they have go halfway down the path onto which riley have cunningly divert the older man he catch hood 's arm and stop he with a whisper look at that _ already _ this hunter be not such a slow worker eh jack they have come in view of the little terraced garden which be mary 's particular property it be screen from the house by a rank or two of the spruce and on a rustic bench seat with they back to the witness be mary and bull hunter the girl be rapt in attention and she eye never leave the face of hunter as for bull he be talk steadily and it seem to jack hood that as the big stranger talk he lean closer and closer to the girl the hint which riley have already drop be enough to inflame the imagination of the suspicious foreman what he now see be totally conclusive he think now under he very eye he see the big man stretch out he hand and he see the hand of mary drop into it it be more than riley have dare to hope for he catch jack hood by the shoulder and whirl he around and half drag he back to the house not in front of you daughter jack he plead i do not blame you for be mad when a skunk like that start flirt with a girl the first day he be see she but if you get anything to say to he wait till mary be out of the way there go the supper bell hurry on in keep hold on yourself do i have to sit through supper and look at that hound not at all suggest the cunning riley have a bite in the kitchen and go up to you room i 'll say that you get some figure to run over afterward you can come down and jump he he watch jack hood disappear grin faintly and then hunt for hal dunbar it be start he say i drop a word in jack 's ear and then show he the two of 'em sit together it be like a spark in the powder the old boy explode how close be they sit ask hal suspiciously close enough riley grin for he be not averse to make even dunbar himself writhe the result be that hal maneuver to draw mary hood aside when she come in with big hunter for supper something in bull hunter 's face disturb the owner of the ranch for the eye of bull be alight and he be smile for no apparent reason how do thing go he ask carelessly you be all wrong about he say the girl earnestly he be not a half-wit by any means hal i have a hard time of it at first but then i get he talk about diablo and the trouble end not a bit of sentiment in he but just like a great big simple honest boy with a man 's strength it would have do you good to hear he and he 'll stay with we ask hal dryly for he be far from enthusiastic of course he 'll stay do you know what he do he promise to try to teach I to ride diablo and he even shake hand on it hal i like he immensely all during the meal the glance of hal dunbar alternate between the girl and the giant he be more disturbed than he dare to confess even to himself it be not so much that bull hunter sit with a faintly dreamy smile stare into the future and forget he food but it be the fact that mary hood be continually smile across the table into that big calm face dunbar begin to feel that the devil be indeed behind the wit of riley he begin to wait nervously for the come of the girl 's father and the explosion as soon as supper be over follow the time-honored custom which the first dunbar establish on the ranch mary leave the room and the man gather in group for card or dice or talk for they be not ordinary hire hand but pick man many of they have grow gray in the dunbar service now be the time for the come of jack hood and hal have not long to wait the door at the far side of the big room be throw open not five minute after the disappearance of mary hood and she father enter he come with a brow as black as night toss a sharp word here and there in reply to the greeting and go to the fireplace lean against the mantel and roll a cigarette while he smoke from under he shaggy brow he look over the company hal dunbar wait hold he breath one brilliant picture be dawn on he mind -- himself mount on great black diablo and swinging over the hill at a matchless gallop the picture vanish jack hood have leave the fireplace and be cross the room with he alert quick step he nerve show in that step and it be nerve power that make he a dreaded gunfighter he gloom seem to have vanish now he smile here he pause there for a cheery word and so he come to where bull hunter sit with he long leg stretch before he and the unchanging dreamy smile on he face over those long leg jack hood stumble when he whirl on the seat man he cheer be go and a devil be in he face you damned lummox he say what d'ye mean by trip I I gasp bull the smile gradually fading and blank amazement take its place it be at this moment that a man step out of the shadow of the kitchen doorway a very small withered man no doubt he be some late arrival ask hospitality for the night and have come after supper be over he have be feed in the kitchen and then send in among the other man for no one be turn away hungry from the dunbar house he be so small so light-footed that he
