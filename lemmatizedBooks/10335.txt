not to be overawe 1892 prefatory note i be indebted to the editor of scribner 's magazine the cosmopolitan and babyhood for permission to reprint the three essay which have appear in they page the other be publish for the first time it may be well to ward off the full seriousness of my title nursery logic by say that a certain informality in all of these papers arise from the fact that they be originally talk give before member of society interested in the training of child three of they -- child 's story how shall we govern we child and the magic of ` together ' -- have be write for this book by my sister miss nora smith kdw new york _ August _ 1892 contents the rights of the child child 's play child 's plaything what shall child read child 's story _ nora a smith _ the relation of the kindergarten to social reform how shall we govern we child _ nora a smith _ the magic of together _ nora a smith _ the relation of the kindergarten to the public school other people 's child the rights of the child give I liberty or give I death the subject of child 's rights do not provoke much sentimentalism in this country where as somebody say the present problem of the child be the painless extinction of they elder i interview the man who wash my window the other morning with the purpose of get at the level of he mind in the matter denni i say as he be polish the glass i be write a article on the ` rights of child ' what do you think about it denni carry he forefinger to he head in search of a idea for he be not accustom to have he intelligence so violently assault and after a moment 's puzzle thought he say what do i think about it mum why i think we would ought to give 'em to 'em but lor ' mum if we do not they _ take _ 'em so what be the odds and as he leave the room i think he look pained that i should spin word and squander ink on such a topic the french dressmaker be my next victim as she fit the collar of a effete civilization on my nineteenth century neck i put the same question i have give to denni the rights of the child madame she ask she scissors poise in air yes the rights of the child be it of the american child madame yes say i nervously of the american child mon dieu he have they this may well lead we to consider rights as oppose to privilege a multitude of privilege or rather indulgence can exist with a total disregard of the child 's rights you remember the man who say he could do without necessity if you would give he luxury enough the child might say i will forego all my privilege if you will only give I my rights : a little less sentiment please -- more justice there be woman who live in perfect puddle of maternal love who yet seem incapable of justice generous to a fault perhaps but seldom just _ who own the child _ if the parent own he -- mind body and soul we must adopt one line of argument if as a human be he own himself we must adopt another in my think the parent be simply a divinely appoint guardian who act for he child until he attain what we call the age of discretion -- that highly uncertain period which arrive very late in life with some person and not at all with other the rights of the parent be almost unlimited it be a very delicate matter to decide just when and where they infringe upon the rights of the child there be no standard the child be the creature of circumstance the mother can clothe he in jaeger wool from head to foot or keep he in low neck short sleeve and low stocking because she think it pretty she can feed he exclusively on raw beef or on vegetable or on cereal she can give he milk to drink or let he sip he father 's beer and wine put he to bed at sundown or keep he up till midnight teach he the catechism and the thirty-nine article or tell he there be no god she can cram he with fact before he have any appetite or power of assimilation or she can make a fool of he she can dose he with old-school remedy with new-school remedy or she can let he die without remedy because she do not believe in the reality of disease she be quite willing to legislate for he stomach he mind he soul she teachableness it go without say be generally in inverse proportion to she knowledge for the arrogance of science be humility compare with the pride of ignorance in these matter the child have no rights the only safeguard be the fact that if parent be absolutely brutal society step in remove the untrustworthy guardian and appoint another but society do nothing can do nothing with the parent who injure the child 's soul break he will make he grow up a liar or a coward or murder he faith it be not very long since we decide that when a parent brutally abuse he child it could be take from he and make the ward of the state the society for the prevention of cruelty to child be of later date than the society for the prevention of cruelty to animal at a distance of a century and a half we can hardly estimate how powerful a blow rousseau strike for the rights of the child in he educational romance emile it be a sort of gospel in its day rousseau once arrest and exile he book burn by the executioner -lrb- a few year before he would have be burn with it -rrb- he idea naturally become a craze many of the reform for which he passionately plead be so much a part of we modern thought that we do not realize the fact that in those day of routine pedantry and slavish worship of authority they be the daring dream of a enthusiast the seem impossible prophecy of a new era aristocratic mother be convert to he theory and begin nurse they child as he command they great lord begin to learn handicraft physical exercise come into vogue everything that emile do other people want to do with all rousseau 's vagary oddity misconception posing he rescue the individuality of the child and make a tremendous plea for a more natural a more human education he succeed in make people listen where rabelai and montaigne have fail and he inspire other teacher notably pestalozzus and froebel who knit up he ragged seam of theory and translate he dream into possibility rousseau vindicate to man the right of be pestalozzus say grow froebel the greatest of the three cry live you give bread to man but i give man to themselves the parent whose sole answer to criticism or remonstrance be i have a right to do what i like with my own child be the only impossible parent he moral integument be too thick to be pierce with any shaft however keen to he we can only say as jacque do to orlando god be with you let 's meet as little as we can but most of we dare not take this ground we may not philosophize or formulate we may not live up to we theory but we feel in greater or less degree the responsibility of call a human be hither and the necessity of guard and guide in one way or another that which owe its be to we we should all agree if put to the vote that a child have a right to be well bear that be a trenchant speech of henry ward beecher 's on the subject of be bear again that if he could be bear right the first time he would take he chance on the second hereditary rank say washington irve may be a snare and a delusion but hereditary virtue be a patent of innate nobility which far outshine the blazonry of heraldry over the unborn we power be almost that of god and we responsibility like he toward we as we acquit ourselves toward they so let he deal with we why should we be astonish at the warped cold unhappy suspicious nature we see about we when we reflect upon the number of unwished-for unwelcomed child in the world -- child who at best be never love until they be see and know and be often grudge they be from the moment they begin to be i wonder if sometimes a starve cripple agonize human body and soul do not cry out why o man o woman -- why be what i be have you suffer I to be physiologist and psychologist agree that the influence affect the child begin before birth at what hour they begin how far they can be control how far direct and modify modern science be not assure but i imagine those month of preparation be give for other reason than that the cradle and the basket and the wardrobe might be ready -- those long month of supreme patience when the life-germ be grow from unconscious to conscious be and when a host of mysterious influence and impulse be be carry silently from mother to child and if beauty bear of murmur sound shall pass into its face how much more subtly shall the grave strength of peace the sunshine of hope and sweet content thrill the delicate chord of be and warm the tender seedling into richer life mr stoddard speak of that sacred passion maternal love that like a orange-tree bud and blossom and bear at once when a true woman put she finger for the first time into the tiny hand of she baby and feel that helpless clutch which tighten she very heart-strings she be bear again with the new-born child a mother have a sacred claim on the world even if that claim rest solely on the fact of she motherhood and not alas on any other she life may be a cipher but when the child come god write a figure before it and give it value once the child be bear one of he inalienable rights which we too often deny he be the right to he childhood if we could only keep from untwist the morning-glory only be willing to let the sunshine do it dickens say real child go out with powder and top-boot and yet the child of dickens 's time be simple bud compare with the full-blown miracle of conventionality and erudition we raise nowadays there be no substitute for a genuine free serene healthy bread-and-butter childhood a fine manhood or womanhood can be build on no other foundation and yet we american home be so often fill with hurry and worry we manner of living be so key to concert pitch we plan of existence so complicated that we drag the baby along in we wake and force they to we artificial standard forget that sweet flower be slow and weed make haste if we must or fancy that we must lead this false too feverish life let we at least spare they by keep they forever on tiptoe we be in danger of produce a army of conventional little prig who know much more than they should about matter which be profitless even to they elder in the matter of clothing we sacrifice child continually to the moloch of maternal vanity as if the demon of dress do not demand we attention sap we energy and thwart we activity soon enough at best and the right kind of child before they be spoil by fine feather do detest be dress up beyond a certain point a tiny maid of my acquaintance have a elaborate parisian gown which be fasten on the side from top to bottom in some mysterious fashion by a multitude of tiny button and cord it fit the dear little mouse like a glove and terminate in a collar which be a instrument of torture to a person whose patience have not be develop from year to year by similar trial the get of it on be anguish and as to the get of it off i hear she moan to she nurse the other night as she wriggle she curly head through the too-small exit oh i only god know how i hate gettin ' peel out o ' this dress the spectacle of a small boy whom i meet sometimes in the horse-car under the wing of he predestinate idiot of a mother wring my very soul silk hat ruffle shirt silver-buckled shoe kid glove cane velvet suit with one two-inch pocket which be a insult to he sex -- how i pity the pathetic little caricature not a spot have he to locate a top or a marble or a nail or a string or a knife or a cooky or a nut but as a bloodless substitute for these necessity of existence he have a toy watch -lrb- that will not go -rrb- and a embroidered handkerchief with cologne on it as to keep child too clean for any mortal use i suppose nothing be more disastrous the divine right to be gloriously dirty a large portion of the time when dirt be a necessary consequence of direct useful friendly contact with all sort of interesting helpful thing be too clear to be deny the child who have to think of they clothes before play with the dog digging in the sand help the stableman work in the shed build a bridge or weed the garden never get half they legitimate enjoyment out of life and unhappy fate do not many of we have to bring up child without a vestige of a dog or a sand heap or a stable or a shed or a brook or a garden conceive if you can a more difficult problem than give a child he rights in a city flat you may say that neither do we get ours : but bad as we be we be always good enough to wish for we child the joy we miss ourselves thrice happy be the country child or the one who can spend a part of he young life among live thing near to nature 's heart how bless be the little toddling thing who can lie flat in the sunshine and drink in the beauty of the green thing grow who can live among the other little animal he brother and sister in feather and fur who can put he hand in that of dear mother nature and learn he first baby lesson without any meddlesome middleman who be cradle in sweet sound from early morn to dewy eve lull to he morning nap by hum of cricket and bee and to he night 's slumber by the sighing of the wind the plash of wave or the ripple of a river he be a part of the shine web of creation learn to spell out the universe letter by letter as he grow sweetly serenely into a knowledge of its law i have a good deal of sympathy for the little people during they first eight or ten year when they be just begin to learn life 's lesson and when the law which govern they must often seem so strange and unjust it be not a occasion for a big burning sympathy perhaps but for a tender little one with a half smile in it as we think of what we be and what in young clothes we hope to be and of how many thing have come across for childhood be a eternal promise which no man ever keep the child have a right to a place of he own to thing of he own to surroundings which have some relation to he size he desire and he capability how should we like to live half the time in a place where the piano be twelve foot tall the door knob at a impossible height and the mantel shelf in the sky where every mortal thing be out of reach except a collection of highly interesting object on dressing-table and bureau guard however by giant and giantess three time as large and powerful as ourselves forever say must not touch and if we do touch we should be spank and have no other method of revenge save to spank back symbolically on the inoffensive person of we doll thing in general be so disproportionate to the child 's stature so far from he organ of prehension so much above he horizontal line of vision so much ampler than he immediate surroundings that there be between he and all these big thing a gap to be fill only by a microcosm of plaything which give he he first object-lesson in proof of which let he see a lady richly dress he hardly notice she let he see a doll in similar attire he will be ravish with ecstasy as if to show that it be the disproportion of the size which unfit he to notice the lady the larger he grow the bigger he want he toy till when he wish reach to life-sizes good-by to the trumpery and onward with reality -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : e seguin -rrb- my little nephew be prowl about my sitting-room during the absence of he nurse i be busy write and when he take up a delicate pearl opera-glass i stop he investigation with the time-honored no no dear that be for grown-up people have not it get any little-boy end he ask wistfully that little-boy end to thing be sometimes just what we fail to give even when we think we be strain every nerve to surround the child with pleasure for child really want to do the very same thing that we want to do and yet have constantly to be thwart for they own good they would like to share all we pleasure keep the same hour eat the same food but they be meet on every side with the seemingly impertinent piece of dogmatism it be not good for little boy or it be not nice for little girl robert loui stevenson show in he child 's garden of verse that he be one of the very few people who remember and appreciate this phase of childhood could anything be more deliciously real than these verse in winter i get up at night and dress by yellow candle light : in summer quite the other way i have to go to bed by day i have to go to bed and see the bird still hop on the tree and hear the grown-up people 's foot still go past I on the street and do it not seem hard to you that when the sky be clear and blue and i should like so much to play i have to go to bed by day mr hopkinson smith have write a witty little monograph on this relation of parent and child i be glad to say too that it be address to father -- that left wing of the family guard which generally manage to retreat during any active engagement leave the command to the inferior officer this left wing be impose on all full-dress parade but when there be any fight to be do it retire rapidly to the rear and only wheel into line when the smoke of the conflict have pass out of the atmosphere open you heart and you arm wide for you daughter he say and keep they wide open do not leave all that to they mother a intimacy will grow with the year which will fit they for another man 's arm and heart when they exchange yours for he make a chum of you boy -- hail-fellow-well-met a comrade get down to the level of he boyhood and bring he gradually up to the level of you manhood do not look at he from the second story window of you fatherly superiority and example go into the front yard and play ball with he when he get into scrape do not thrash he as you father do you put you arm around he neck and say you know it be pretty bad but that he can count on you to help he out and that you will every single time and that if he have let you know earlier it would have be all the easier again the child have a right to more justice in he discipline than we be generally wise and patient enough to give he he be by and by to come in contact with a world where cause and effect follow each other inexorably he have a right to be teach and to be govern by the law under which he must afterwards live but in too many case parent interfere so mischievously and unnecessarily between cause and effect that the child 's mind do not can not perceive the logic of thing as it should we might write a pathetic remonstrance against the decline and fall of domestic authority there be food for thought and perhaps for fear in the subject but the fact be obvious and they inevitableness must strike any thoughtful observer of the time the old educational regime be akin to the social system with which it be contemporaneous and similarly in the reverse of these characteristic we modern mode of culture correspond to we more liberal religious and political institution it be the age of independent criticism the child problem be merely one phase of the universal problem that confront society it seem likely that the rod of reason will have to replace the rod of birch parental authority never use to be call into question neither be the catechism nor the bible nor the minister how should parent hope to escape the universal interrogation point level at everything else in these day of free speech it be hopeless to suppose that even infant can be muzzle we revel in we republican virtue let we accept the vice of those virtue as philosophically as possible a lady have be advertise in a new york paper for a german governess to mind a little girl three year old the lady 's english be doubtless defective but the fate of the governess be thereby indicate with much greater candor than be usual the mother who be most apt to infringe on the rights of she child -lrb- of course with the best intention -rrb- be the firm person afflict with the lust of dominion there be no elasticity in she firmness to prevent it from degenerate into obstinacy it be not the firmness of the tree that bend without break but the firmness of a certain long-eared animal whose force of character have impress itself on the common mind and become proverbial jean paul say if _ pa trop gouverner _ be the best rule in politics it be equally true of discipline but if the child be unhappy who have none of he rights respect equally wretched be the little despot who have more than he own rights who have never be teach to respect the rights of other and whose only conception of the universe be that of a absolute monarchy in which he be sole ruler child rarely love those who spoil they and never trust they they keen young sense detect the false note in the character and draw its own conclusion which be generally very just the very best theoretical statement of a wise disciplinary method that i know be herbert spencer 's let the history of you domestic rule typify in little the history of we political rule at the outset autocratic control where control be really needful by and by a incipient constitutionalism in which the liberty of the subject gain some express recognition successive extension of this liberty of the subject gradually end in parental abdication we must not expect child to be too good not any better than we ourselves for example no nor even as good beware of hothouse virtue already most people recognize the detrimental result of intellectual precocity but there remain to be recognize the truth that there be a moral precocity which be also detrimental we higher moral faculty like we higher intellectual one be comparatively complex by consequence they be both comparatively late in they evolution and with the one as with the other a very early activity produce by stimulation will be at the expense of the future character in these matter the child have a right to expect example he live in the sens he can only learn through object lesson can only pass from the concrete example of goodness to a vision of abstract perfection o'er wayward childhood wouldst thou hold firm rule and sun thee in the light of happy face love hope and patience these must be thy grace and in thine own heart let they first keep school yes in thine own heart let they first keep school i can not see why max o'rell should have exclaim with such unction that if he be to be bear over again he would choose to be a american woman he have never try be one he do not realize that she not only have in hand the emancipation of the american woman but the reformation of the american man and the education of the american child if that triangular mission in life do not keep she out of mischief and make she the angel of the twentieth century she be a hopeless case spencer say it be a truth yet remain to be recognize that the last stage in the mental development of each man and woman be to be reach only through the proper discharge of the parental duty and when this truth be recognize it will be see how admirable be the ordination in virtue of which human being be lead by they strongest affection to subject themselves to a discipline which they would else elude woman have be fight many battle for the higher education these last few year and they have nearly gain the day when at last complete victory shall perch upon they banner let they make one more struggle and that for the highest education which shall include a specific training for parenthood a subject thus far quite omit from the curriculum the mistaken idea that instinct be a sufficient guide in so delicate and sacred and vital a matter the comfortable superstition that baby bring they own direction with they -- these fiction have exist long enough if a girl ask I why since the function of parenthood be so uncertain she should make the sacrifice necessary to such training sacrifice entail by this highest education of body mind and spirit i can only say that it be better to be ready even if one be not call for than to be call for and find want child 's play the play of the age be the heart-leaf of the whole future life for the whole man be visible in they in he finest capacity and he innermost be mr ww newell in he admirable book on child 's game trace to they proper source all the familiar play which in one form or another have be hand down from generation to generation and be still play wherever and whenever child come together in any number the result of he sympathetic and scholarly investigation be most interesting to the student of childhood and as valuable philologically as historically in speaking of the old round and rhyme formula which have preserve they vitality under the efface hand of time he say -- it will be obvious that many of these well-known game-rhyme be not compose by child they be formerly play as in many country they be still play by young person of marriageable age or even by mature man and woman the truth be that in past century all the world judge by we present standard seem to have be a little childish the maid of honor of queen elizabeth 's day if we may credit the poet be devote to the game of tag with which even diana and she nymph be suppose to amuse themselves we need not however go to remote time or land for illustration which be supply by new england country town of a generation ago dancing under that name be little practice the amusement of young people at they gathering be play game these game generally result in forfeit to be redeem by kiss in every possible variety of position and method many of these game be round but as they be not call dance and as man-kind pay more attention to word than thing the religious conscience of the community which object to dance take no alarm such be the pleasure of young man and woman from sixteen to twenty-five year of age nor be the participant mere rustic many of they could boast as good blood as careful breeding and as much intelligence as any in the land neither be the morality or sensitiveness of the young woman of that day in any respect inferior to what it be at present now that we country town be become mere outlying suburb of city these remark may be read with a smile at the rude simplicity of old-fashioned american life but the laugh should be direct not at we own country but at the bygone age it must be remember that in mediaeval europe and in england till the end of the seventeenth century a kiss be the usual salutation of a lady to a gentleman whom she wish to honor the portuguese lady who come to england with the infanta in 1662 be not use to the custom but as pepy say in ten day they have ` learn to kiss and look freely up and down ' kiss in game be therefore a matter of course in all rank in respectable and cultivate french society at the time of which we speak the amusement not merely of young people but of they elder as well be every whit as crude madame celnart a recognize authority on etiquette compile in 1830 a very curious complete manual of society game recommend they as recreation for _ business man _ ` they vary movement ' she say ` they diversity the gracious and gay idea which these game inspire the decorous caress which they permit all this combine to give real amusement these caress can alarm neither modesty nor prudence since a kiss in honor give and take before numerous witness be often a act of propriety ' the old ballad and nursery rhyme doubtless have much of innocence and freshness in they but they only come to we nowadays taint by the odor of city street the pleasure and poetry of the original essence be go and vulgarity reign triumphant if you listen to the word of the game which child play in school yard on sidewalk and in the street on pleasant evening you will find that most of they to say the least border closely on vulgarity that they be utterly unsuitable to childhood notwithstanding that they be play with great glee that they be in fine common rude silly and boorish one can never watch a circle of child go through the vulgar inanity of jenny o'jone say daughter will you get up green gravel or here come two duck a-roving without unspeakable shrinking and moral disgust these play be die out let they die for there be a hint of happier thing abroad in the air the wisest mind of wise antiquity tell the riddle of the sphinx if have ear to hear we would hear we youth should be educate in a stricter rule from the first for if education become lawless and the youth themselves become lawless they can never grow up into well-conducted or meritorious citizen and _ the education must begin with they play _ we talk a great deal about the strength of early impression i wonder if we mean all we say we do not live up to it at all event in childish play deep meaning lie the hand that rock the cradle be the hand that rule the world give I the first six year of a child 's life and i care not who have the rest the child of six year have learn already far more than a student learn in he entire university course the first six year be as full of advancement as the six day of creation and so on if we do believe these thing fully we should begin education with conscious intelligence at the cradle if not earlier the great german dramatic critic schlegel once sneer at the brother jacob and william grimm for what he style they meditation on the insignificant these two brother say a wiser student a historian of german literature be animated by a pathetic optimism and possess that sober imagination which delight in small thing and narrow interest linger over they with strong affection they explore village and hamlet for obscure legend and folk tale for nursery song even and bring to bear on such thing at once a human affection and a wise scholarship they meditation on the insignificant become the basis of they scientific greatness and the source of they popularity every child have read some of grimm 's household tale the frog prince han in luck or the two brother but comparatively few people realize perhaps that this collection of story be the foundation of the modern science of folk-lore and a by-play in research of philology and history which place the name of grimm among the benefactor of we race i refer to these brother because they express one of the lead theory of the new education my principle say jacob grimm have be to undervalue nothing but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great when friedrich froebel the founder of the kindergarten in the course of he research begin to watch the play of child and to study they unconscious action he meditation on the insignificant become the basis of scientific greatness and of a influence still in its infancy but destine perhaps to revolutionize the whole educational method of society it be while he be look on with delight at the play of little child they happy busy plan and make-believe they intense interest in outward nature and in put thing together or take they apart that froebel say to himself : what if we could give the child that which be call education through he voluntary activity and have he always as eager as he be at play how well i remember year ago the first time i ever join in a kindergarten game i be beckon to the charming circle and not only one but a dozen opening be make for I and immediately though i be a stranger a little hand on either side be put into mine with such friendly trusting pressure that i feel quite at home then we begin to sing of the spring-time and i find myself a green tree wave its branch in the wind i be frightened and self-conscious but i do it and nobody seem to notice I then i be a flower open its petal in the sunshine and presently a swallow gather straw for nest-building then carry away by the spirit of the kindergartner and she child i flutter my clumsy apology for wing and forget self fly about with all the other as happy as a bird soon i find that i the stranger have be choose for the mother swallow it be to I the girl of eighteen like mount a throne and be crown four cunning curly head cuddle under my wing for protection and slumber and i see that i be expect to stoop and brood they which i do with a feeling of tenderness and responsibility that i have never experience in my life before then when i follow my baby swallow back to they seat i see that the play have break down every barrier between we and that they cluster about I as confidingly as if we be old friend i think i never before feel my own limitation so keenly or desire so strongly to be fully worthy of a child 's trust and love kindergarten play take the child where they love to be into the world of make-believe in this lovely world the child be blacksmith carpenter wheelwright bird bee butterfly tree flower sunbeam rainbow frog lamb pony -- anything they like the play be so characteristic so poetic so profoundly touching in its simplicity and purity so full of mean that it would inspire we with admiration and respect be it the only salient point of froebel 's educational idea it endeavor to express the same idea in poetic word harmonious melody and fitting motion appeal thus to the thought feeling and activity of the child physical impression be at the beginning of life the only possible medium for awaken the child 's sensibility these impression should therefore be regulate as systematically as possible and not leave to chance froebel supply the means for bring about the result in a simple system of symbolic song and game appeal to the child 's activity and sensibility these he argue ought to contain the germ of all later instruction and thought for physical and sensuous perception be the point of departure of all knowledge when the child imitate he begin to understand let he imitate the airy flight of the bird and he enter partially into bird life let the little girl personate the hen with she feathery brood of chicken and she own maternal instinct be quicken as she guard and guide the wayward motion of the little flock let the child play the carpenter the wheelwright the wood-sawyer the farmer and he intelligence be immediately awaken he will see the force the mean the power and the need of labor in short let he mirror in he play all the different aspect of universal life and he thought will begin to grasp they significance thus kindergarten play may be define as a systematize sequence of experience through which the child grow into self-knowledge clear observation and conscious perception of the whole circle of relationship and the symbol of he play become at length the truth itself bind fast and deep in heart knowledge which be deeper and rarer than head knowledge after all to the class occupied exclusively with material thing this phase of froebel 's idea may perhaps seem mystical there be nothing mystical to child however all be real for they vision have not be dispel turn wheresoe'er i may by night or day the thing which i have see i now can see no more as soon as the child begin to be conscious of he own activity and he power of regulate they he desire to imitate the action of he future life nothing so delight the little girl as to play at housekeeping in she tiny mansion sacred to the use of doll see she whimsical attention to dust and dirt she tremendous wisdom in dispense the work and order the duty of the household she careful attention to the moral and manners of she rag-baby the boy too try to share in the life of a man to play at he father 's work to be a miniature carpenter salesman or what not he ride he father 's cane and call it a horse in the same way that the little girl wrap a shawl about a towel and shower upon it the tenderest token of maternal affection all these example go to show that every conscious intellectual phase of the mind have a previous phase in which it be unconscious or merely symbolic to get at the spirit and inspiration of symbolic representation in song and game it be necessary first of all to study froebel 's mutter und kose-lied perhaps the most strikingly original instructive serviceable book in the whole history of the practice of education the significant remark quote in froebel 's reminiscence be this : he who understand what i mean by these song know my inmost secret you will find people who say the music in the book be poor which be largely true and that the versification be weak which be often not always true and be sometimes to be attribute to faulty translation but the idea the spirit the continuity of the plan be matchless and critic who call it trifling or silly be those who have not the see eye nor the understanding heart froebel 's wife say of it -- a superficial mind do not grasp it a gentle mind do not hate it a coarse mind make fun of it a thoughtful mind alone try to get at it froebel -lrb- 1 -rrb- consider it he duty to picture the home as it ought to be not by write a book of theory and of rule which be easily forget but by accompany a mother in she daily round through house garden and field and by follow she to workshop market and church he do not represent a woman of fashion but prefer one of humbler station whom he clothes in the old german housewife style it may be a small sphere she occupy but there she be the center and she completely fill she place she rejoice in the dignity of she position as educator of a human being whom she have to bring into harmony with god nature and man she think nothing too trifling that concern she child she watch clothes feed and train it in good habit and when she darling be asleep she prayer finish the day she may not have read much about education but she sympathy with the child suggest means of do she duty love have make she inventive she discover means of amusement for play she talk and sing sometimes in poetry and sometimes in prose from mother in he circle of relation and friend froebel have learn what a mother can do and although he have no child of he own he heart vibrate instinctively with the feeling of a mother 's joy hope and fear he do not care about the scorn of other when he feel he must speak with a almost womanly heart to a mother he own loss of a mother 's tender care make he the more appreciate the importance of a mother 's love in early infancy the mother in he book make use of all the impression influence and agency with which the child come in contact : she protect from evil she stimulate for good she place the child in direct communication with nature because she herself admire its beauty she have a right feeling towards she neighbor and to all those on whom she depend a movement of arm and foot teach she that the child feel its strength and want to use it she help she lift she teach and while play with she baby 's hand and foot she be never at a loss for a song or story -lrb- footnote 1 : eleonore heerwart -rrb- the mother also know that it be necessary to train the sens because they be the active organ which convey food to the intellect the ear must hear language music the gentle accent and warn voice of father and mother it must distinguish the sound of the wind of the water and of pet animal the eyesight be direct to object far and near as the pigeon fly the hare run the light flicker on the wall the calm beauty of the moon and the twinkling star in the dark blue sky of the effect of froebel 's symbolic song and game with melodious music and appropriate gesture kindergartner all speak enthusiastically they know that -- first : the word suggest think to the child second : the thought suggest gesture third : the gesture aid in produce the proper feeling we all believe thoroughly in the influence of mind on body the inward work outward but we be not as ready to see the influence of body on mind yet if mind or soul act upon the body the external gesture and attitude just as truly react upon the inward feeling the soul speak through the body and the body in return give command to the soul all attitude mean something and they all influence the state of mind fourth : the melody beget spiritual impression fifth : the gesture feeling and melody unite in give a sweet and gentle intercourse in develop love for labor home country associate and dumb animal and in unconsciously direct the intellectual power learn to sing well be the best possible means of learn to speak well and the exquisite precision which music give to kindergarten play destroy all rudeness and do not in the least rob it of its fun or merriment we can not tell how early the please sense of musical cadence affect a child in some child it be blended with the earliest haziest recollection of life at all as though they have be literally ` cradle in sweet song ' and we may be sure that the hearing of musical sound and singing in association with other be for the child as for the adult powerful influence in awaken sympathetic emotion and pleasure in associate action who can see the kindergarten game lead by a teacher who have grow into they spirit and ever forget the joy of the spectacle it bring tear to the eye of any woman who have ever be call mother or ever hope to be and i have see more than one man retire surreptitiously to wipe away he tear be it that touch of nature which make the whole world kin be it the perfect self-forgetfulness of the child be it a touch of self-pity that the radiant vision of we childhood day have be dispel and the year have bring the inevitable yoke or be it the touch sight of so much happiness contrast with what we know the home life to be sydney smith say : if you make child happy now you will make they happy twenty year hence by the memory of it and we know that virtue kindle at the touch of this joy selfishness rudeness and similar weedy growth of school-life or of street-independence can not grow in such a atmosphere for joy be as foreign to tumult and destruction to harshness and selfish disregard of other as the serene vernal sky with its refreshing breeze be foreign to the uproar and terror of the hurricane for this kind of ideal play we be indebted to friedrich froebel and if he have leave no other legacy to childhood we should exalt he for it if you be skeptical let I beseech you to join the child in a free kindergarten and play with they you will be convince not through you head perhaps but through you heart i remember convert such a grim female once you know henry jame say some woman be unmarried by choice and other by chance but olive chancellor be unmarried by every implication of she be now this predestinate spinster acquaintance of mine well nigh spoil by year of school-teaching in the wrong spirit be determine to think kindergarten play simply a piece of nauseating frivolity she try she best but keep in the circle with the child five successive day she relax so completely that it be with the utmost difficulty that she keep herself from be a butterfly or a bird it be always so no one can resist the unconscious happiness of child as for the good that come to grown people from play with child in this joyous freedom and with this deep earnestness of purpose it be beyond all imagination if i have a daughter who be frivolous or worldly or selfish or cold or unthoughtful -- who regard life as a pleasantry or fall into the still more stupid mistake of think it not worth living -- i should not -lrb- at first -rrb- make she read the bible or teach in the sunday-school or call on the minister or request the prayer of the congregation but i should put she in a good kindergarten training school no normal young woman can resist the influence of the study of childhood and the daily life among little child especially the child of the poor : it be irresistible oh these tiny teacher if we only learn from they all we might instead of feeling ourselves over-wise i never look down into the still clear pool of a child 's innocent question eye without thinking : dear little one it must be ` give and take ' between thee and I i have gain something here in all these year but thou hast come from thence more lately than have i thou hast a treasure that the year have steal from I -- share it with I let we endeavor then to make the child 's life objective to he let we unlock to he the significance of family social and national relationship so that he may grow into sympathy with they he love the symbol which interpret he nature to himself and in he eager play he picture the life he long to understand if we could make such education continuous if we could surround the child in he earlier year with such a atmosphere of goodness beauty and wisdom none can doubt that he would unconsciously grow into harmony and union with the all-good the all-beautiful and the all-wise child 's plaything book can not teach what toy inculcate in the precede chapter we discuss froebel 's play and find that the playful spirit which pervade all the kindergarten exercise must not be regard as trivial since it have a philosophic motive and a definite earnest purpose we discuss the meaning of childish play and deplore the lack of good and worthy national nursery play pass then to froebel 's mother-play we find that the very heart of he educational idea lie in the book and that it serve as a guide for mother whose baby be yet in they arm as well as for those who have little child of four or five year under they care we find that in froebel 's play the mirror be hold up to universal life that the child in play they grow into unconscious sympathy with the natural the human the divine that by play at the life he long to understand he grow at last into a conscious realization of its mystery -- its truth its mean its dignity its purpose we find that symbolic play lead the child from the symbol to the truth symbolize we discover that the carefully choose word of the kindergarten song and game suggest think to the child the thought suggest gesture the melody beget spiritual feeling we discuss the relation of body and mind the effect of bodily attitude on feeling and think as well as the moulding of the body by the indwelling mind froebel 's plaything be as significant as he play if you examine the material he offer child in he gift and occupation you can not help see that they meet the child 's natural want in a truly wonderful manner and that use in connection with conversation and story and game they address and develop he love of movement and he love of rhythm he desire to touch and handle to play and work -lrb- to be busy -rrb- and he curiosity to know he instinct of construction and comparison he fondness for gardening and digging in the earth he social impulse and finally he religious feeling froebel himself say if he educational material be find useful it can not be because of they exterior which be as simple as possible and contain nothing new but they worth be to be find exclusively in they application if you can work out he principle -lrb- or better one still when we find better one -rrb- by other means pray do it if you prefer since the object of the kindergartner be not to make froebel a _ idol _ but a _ ideal _ he seem to have find type-form admirable for awake the higher sens of the child and unlike the usual scheme of object lesson they tell a continued story when the object-method first burst upon the enraptured sight of the teacher this list of subject appear in a print catalogue show the ground of study in a certain school for six month : -- _ tea spider apple hippopotamus cow cotton duck sugar rabbit rice lighthouse candle lead-pencil pin tiger clothing silver butter-making giraffe onion soda _ such reckless heterogeneity as this be impossible with froebel 's educational material for even if they be give to the child without a single word they carry something of they own logic with they they emphasize the gospel of do for froebel believe in positive in teaching not negative in stimulant not deterrent how inexpressibly tiresome be the everlasting do not in some household do not get in the fire do not play in the water do not tease the kitty do not trouble the doggy do not bother the lady do not interrupt do not contradict do not fidget with you brother and _ do not _ worry I now while perhaps in this whole tirade not a word have be say of something to do let sleep fault lie as long as possible while we quietly oust they little by little by develop the good quality surely the less we use deterrent the better since they be often the child 's first introduction to what be undesirable or wrong i be quite sure they have something of that effect on grown people the tell we not to do and that we can not must not do a certain thing surround it with a momentary fascination if you enemy suggest that there be a pot of pari green on the piazza but you must not take a spoonful and dissolve it in a cup of honey and give it to you maiden aunt who have make she will in you favor you innocent mind hover for a instant over the murderous idea froebel 's play-material come to the child when he have enter upon the war-path of get something to do if legitimate means fail then let the portcullis fall the child must be busy the fly on the window-pane will be crush the kettle tie to the dog 's tail the curtain cut into snip the baby 's hair shingle -- anything that he untiring hand may not pause a instant -- anything that he chubby leg may take he restless body over a circuit of a hundred mile or so before he be immure in he crib for the night the child of four or five year be still interested in object in the concrete he want to see and to hear to examine and to work with he hand how absurd then for we to make he fold he arm and keep he active finger still or strive to stupefy he with such a opiate as the alphabet if we can possess we soul and primer in patience for a while and feed he sens if we will let he take in live fact and await the result that result will be that when he have learn to perceive compare and construct he will desire to learn word for they tell he what other have see thought and do this reading and write what be it after all but the sign for thing and thought logically we must first know thing then thought then they record the law of human progress be from physical activity to mental power from a hercule to a shakespeare and it be as true for each unit of humanity as it be for the race everything in froebel 's plaything train the child to quick accurate observation they help child to a fuller vision they lead they to see do you ever think how many people there be who have eye see not ruskin say hundred of people can talk for one who can think but thousand can think for one who can see to see clearly be poetry prophecy religion all in one a gentleman who be try to write the biography of a great man complain to I lately that in consult a dozen of he friend -- man and woman who have know he as preacher orator reformer and poet -- so few of they have anything characteristic and fine to relate what he say be the use of try to write biography with such mummy for witness they would have see just as much if they have have nothing but glass eye in they head what be education good for that do not teach the mind to observe accurately and define picturesquely to get at the essence of a object and clear away the accompany rubbish this be the only training that fit man and woman to live with any profit to themselves or pleasure to other what a biographer for example or at least what a witness for some other biographer be latent in the little boy who when tell by he teacher to define a bat say : he be a nasty little mouse with injy-rubber wing and shoe-string tail and bite like the devil there be a eye worth have agassiz himself could not have hit off better the salient characteristic of the little creature in question have that remarkable boy be bring into contact for five minute only with julius caesar who can doubt that the tell description he would have give of he would have come down through all the age i do not mean to urge the adoption of any ultra-utilitarian standpoint in regard to plaything or advise you rudely to enter the realm of early infancy and interfere with the baby 's legitimate desire by any meddlesome pedagogic reasoning choose he toy wisely and then leave he alone with they leave he to the throng of emotional impression they will call into be remember that they speak to he feeling when he mind be not yet open to reason the toy at this period be surround with a halo of poetry and mystery and lay hold of the imagination and the heart without awake vulgar curiosity thrice happy age when one can hug one 's white woolly lamb to one 's bibbed breast kiss its pink bead eye in irrational ecstasy and manipulate the squeak in its foreground without desire to explore the cause thereof at this period the well-beloved toy the dumb sharer of the child 's joy and sorrow become the nucleus of a thousand enterprise each render more fascinating by its presence and sympathy if the toy be a horse they take imaginary journey together and the road be doubly delightful because never travel alone if it be a house the child live therein a different life for every day in the week for no monarch alive be so all-powerful as he whose throne be the imagination little tin soldier shem ham and japhet from the noah 's ark the hornless cow the tailless dog and the elephant that will not stand up these play they allotted part in he innocent comedy and meanwhile he grow steadily in sympathy and in comprehension of the ever-widening circle of human relationship when we have restore plaything to they place in education -- a place which assign they the principal part in the development of human sympathy we can later on put in the hand of child object whose impression will reach they mind more particularly dr e seguin we commissioner of education to the universal exhibition at vienna philosophize most charmingly on child 's toy in he report -lrb- chapter on the training of special sens -rrb- he say the vast array of plaything -lrb- separate by nationality -rrb- leave at first sight a impression of silly sameness but that a second look discover in they particular character as of national idiosyncrasy and a closer examination show that these puerility have sense enough in they not only to disclose the movement of the mind but to predict what be to follow he classify the toy exhibit and in so do give we delightful and valuable generalization some of which i will quote : -- chinese and japanese toy innumerable as be to have be expect japanese toy much brighter the doll relieve in gold and gaudy color absolutely saucy the application of the natural and mechanical force in they toy can not fail to determine the taste of the next generation towards physical science chinese doll be sober in color meek in demeanor and comprehensive in mien the favorite chinese toy remain the theatrical scene where the family be treat _  la molire _ persium send beautiful toy from which can be infer a national taste for music since most of they doll be blow instrument turkey egypt arabium have send no doll do they make none under the impression correct in a low state of culture that doll for child become idol for man the finlander and laplander who be not trouble with such religious prejudice give rosy cheek and body as fat as seal to they doll the french toy represent the versatility of the nation touch every topic grave or grotesque from berlin come long train of artillery regiment of lead horse and foot on move tramway from the hartz and the alp still issue those wooden herd more characteristic of the dull feeling of they maker than of the instinct of the animal they represent the american toy justify the rule we have find good elsewhere that they character both reveal and preface the national tendency with we toy refer the mind and habit of child to home economy husbandry and mechanical labor and they very material be durable mainly wood and iron so from childhood every people have its sympathy express or suppress and set deeper in its flesh and blood than scholastic idea the child who have no toy seize reality very late and never form ideal the nation render famous by they artist artisan and idealist have supply they infant with many toy for there be more philosophy and poetry in a single doll than in a thousand book if you will tell we what you child play with we will tell you what sort of woman and man they will be so let this republic make the toy which will raise the moral and artistic character of she child froebel 's educational toy do we one service in that they preach a silent but impressive sermon on simplicity it be easy to see that the hurlyburly of we modern life be not wholly favorable to the simple creed of childhood delight and liberty when busy or at rest but we might make it a little less artificial than we do perhaps every thoughtful person know that the simple natural plaything of the old-fashioned child which be nothing more than peg on which he hang he glowing fancy be healthier than we complicated modern mechanism in which the child have only to press the button and the toy do the rest the electric-talking doll for example -- imagine a generation of child bring up on that and the toy-maker be not even content with this grand personage four foot high who say papa mamma she be _ passe _ already they have begin to improve on she a electrician describe to I the other day a superb new altruistic doll fit to the need of the present decade you be to press a judiciously located button and ask she the test question which be if she will have some candy whereupon with a angelic detached-movement-smile -lrb- located in the left cheek -rrb- she be to answer give brother _ big _ piece give I little piece if the thing get out of order -lrb- and i devoutly hope it will -rrb- it will doubtless return to a state of nature and horrify the bystander by remark give I _ big _ piece give brother _ little _ piece think of have a gilded dummy like that give you to amuse yourself with think of have to play -- to _ play _ forsooth with a model of propriety a high-minded monstrosity like that do not it make you long for you dear old darkey doll with the raveled mouth and the stuff leak out of she leg or you beloved arabellum clarinda with the broken nose beautiful even in dissolution -- creature not too bright or good for human nature 's daily food bang battered hairless sharer of we mad joy and reckless sorrow how we love they in they simple ugliness with what halo of romance we surround they with what devotion we nurse the one with the broken head in those early day when new head be not to be buy at the nearest shop and even if they could have be purchase for we would we the primitive child of those dear dark age have ever think of wrenching off the crack blonde head of ethelinda and buy a new strange nameless brunette head glue it calmly on ethelinda 's body as a small acquaintance of mine do last week apparently without a single pang never a doll have a personality in those time and have yet to a few simple backwoods soul even in this day and generation think of charle kingsley 's song -- i once have a sweet little doll dear can we imagine that as write about one of these modern monstrosity with eyeglass and corset and vinaigrette i once have a sweet little doll dear the prettiest doll in the world she face be so red and so white dear and she hair be so charmingly curl but i lose my poor little doll dear as i play on the heath one day and i seek for she more than a week dear but i never could find where she lay i find my poor little doll dear as i play on the heath one day folk say she be terribly change dear for she paint be all wash away and she arm trodden off by the cow dear and she hair not the least bit curl yet for old sake 's sake she be still dear the prettiest doll in the world long live the doll dolly-o'diamond precious lamb humming-bird honey-pot jewel jam darling delicate-dear-delight -- angel-o'red angel-o'white take away the doll you erase from the heart and head feeling image poetry aspiration experience ready for application to real life every mother know the development of tenderness and motherliness that go on in she little girl through the nursing and petting and teaching and caring for she doll there be a good deal of journalistic anxiety concern the decline of mother be it possible that father too be in any danger of decline it be impossible to overestimate the sacredness and importance of the mother-spirit in the universe but the father-spirit be not positively valueless -lrb- so far as it go -rrb- the newspaper-pessimist talk comparatively little about develop that in the young male of the species in three year ' practical experience among the child of the poorer class and during all the succeed year when i have fill the honorary and honorable office of general-utility woman story-teller song-singer and playmaker-in-ordinary to they royal highness some thousand of baby i have be strike with the greater hardness of the small boy a certain coarseness of fiber and lack of sensitiveness which make they less susceptible at first to gentle influence once upon a time i set about develop this father spirit in a group of little gamin whose general attitude toward the weaker sex toward bird and flower and insect toward beauty in distress and wound sensibility be in the last degree offensive in the bird game we have always have a mother bird in the nest with the birdling we now introduce a father bird into the game though the child have be only a little time in the kindergarten and be not fully baptize into the spirit of play still the boy be generally willing to personate the father bird since they delight in the active and manly occupation of fly about the room seek worm overshadow they natural repugnance to feed the young this accomplish we play master rider in which a small urchin caper about on a hobby horse go through a variety of adventure and finally return with present to wife and child this in turn become a matter of natural experience and we move towards we grand _ coup d'tat _ once a week we have doll ' day when all the child who own they bring they doll and the exercise be order with the single view of amusing and edify they the picture of that circle of ragged child come before I now and dim my eye with its pathetic suggestion such doll five-cent ten-cent doll doll with soil clothes and doll in a highly indecorous state of nudity doll whose ruddy hue of health have be absorb into they mother ' system doll make of rag doll make of carrot and doll make of towel but all dispense odor of garlic in the common air maternal affection however pardon all limitation and they be clasp as fondly to maternal bosom as if they have be import from paris bless my soul might have be the unspoken comment of these tiny mother if we be only to love we offspring when handsome and well clothed then the mother-heart of society be in a bad way doll ' day be the day for lullaby i always wish i might gather a group of stony-hearted man and woman in that room and see they melt under the magic of the scene perhaps you can not imagine the union of garlic and magic nevertheless o ye of little faith it may exist the kindergarten cradle stand in the center of the circle and the kindergarten doll clean beautiful and well dress lay inside the curtain wait to be sing to sleep with the other doll one little girl after another would go proudly to the mother 's chair and rock the cradle while the other child hum they gentle lullaby at this juncture even the older boy -lrb- when the influence of the music have steal in upon they sens -rrb- would glance from side to side longingly as much as to say -- o lord why didst thou not make thy servant a female that he might dandle one of these interesting object without degradation in such a hour i suddenly say josephus will you be the father this time and without give he a second to think we begin we familiar lullaby the radical nature the full enormity of the proposition do not -lrb- in that moment of sweet expansion -rrb- strike josephus he move towards the cradle seat himself in the chair put he foot upon the rocker and rock the baby soberly while my heart sing in triumph after this the father as well as the mother take part in all family game and this mighty and much-needed reform have be work through the magic of a fascinating plaything what shall child read what we make child love and desire be more important than what we make they learn when i be a little girl -lrb- oh six most charming word -rrb- -- it be not necessary to name the year but it be so long ago that child be still remind that they should be see and not hear and also that they could eat what be set before they or go without -lrb- two maxim that suggest a hoary antiquity of time not easily measure by the sens -rrb- -- when i be a little girl i have the great good fortune to live in a country village i believe i always have a taste for book but i will pass over that early period when i manifest it by carry they to my mouth and endeavor to assimilate they contents by the cram process and also that later stage which herald the dawn of the critical faculty perhaps when i tear they in bit and hold up the tattered fragment with shout of derisive laughter unlike the critic no more be give I to mar but like the critic i have mar a good many ere my vandal hand be stay as soon as i could read i have free access to a excellent medical library the gloom of which be brighten by a few shelf of theological work bequeath to the family by some orthodox ancestor and temper by a volume or two of blackstone but outside of these which be emphatically not the stuff my dream be make of i can only remember a certain little walnut bookcase hang on the wall of the family sitting-room it have but three shelf yet all the mystery of love and life and death be in the score of well-worn volume that stand there side by side and we turn to they year after year with undiminished interest the number never seem small the story never grow tame : when we come to the end of the third shelf we simply go back and begin again -- a process all too little known to latter-day child i can see they yet those row of shabby and incongruous volume the contents of which be transfer to we hungry little brain some of they be close at hand now and i love they ragged corner they dog 's - eared page that show the pressure of childish thumb and they dear old back break in my service there be a red-covered book of snob vanity fair with no cover at all scottish chief in crimson a brown copy of george sand 's teverino and next it a green bailey 's festus which i only attack when mentally rabid and a little of which go a surprisingly long way and then a maroon david copperfield whose page be limp with my kiss -lrb- to write a book that a child would kiss oh dear reward oh sweet sweet fame -rrb- in one corner -- spare I you smile -- be a fat autobiography of pt barnum give I by a grateful farmer for save the life of a valuable jersey calf just as she be on the point of strangle herself this book so inflamed a naturally ardent imagination that i be with difficulty dissuade from enter the arena as a circus manager consideration of age or sex have no weight with I and lack of capital eventually prove the deterrent force on the shelf above be kenilworth the lady of the lake and half of rob roy i have always hesitate to read the other half for fear that it should not end precisely as i make it end when i be force by necessity to supplement sir walter scott then there be gulliver 's travels and if any of the story seem difficult to believe i have only to turn to the map of lilliput and brobdingnag with the degree of latitude and longitude duly mark which always convince I that everything be fair and aboveboard of course there be a great green and gold shakespeare not a properly expurgate edition for female seminary either nor even prose tale from shakespeare adapt to young reader but the real thing we expurgate as we read child fashion take into we sleek little head all that we could comprehend or apprehend and unconsciously pass over what might have be hurtful perhaps at a later period i suppose we fail to get a very close conception of shakespeare 's colossal genius but we do get a tremendous and lasting impression of force and power life and truth when we declaim certain scene in a upper chamber with sloping wall and dormer window a bed for a throne a cotton umbrella for a sceptre we creation be harmless enough if i remember rightly we nine-year-old lady macbeth and iago falstaff and cleopatra after they have be dip in the divine alembic of childish innocence come out so respectable that they would not have bring the historic blush to the cheek of youth on the shelf above the shakespeare be a few thing presumably better suit to childish taste -- hawthorne 's wonder book kingsley 's water baby miss edgeworth 's rosamond and the arabian night there be also two little tale give we by a wander revivalist who be on a star tour through the new england village how gussie grow in grace and little harriet 's work for the heathen -- melodramatic history of spiritually perfect and physically feeble child who bless the world for a season but die young enliven by a few page devote to completely vicious and adorable one who live to curse the world to a good old age last of all bring out only on state occasion be a most seductive edition of that nursery gaboriau who kill cock robin with color illustration in which the head of the bird be make to move oracularly by means of cunningly arrange strip pull from the bottom of the page this be a relic of infancy we first introduction to the literature of plot counterplot intrigue and crime and the mystery of the murder be very real to we this book still in existence with all the bird headless from over-exertion be always inextricably associate in my mind with childish woe as a desire on my part to make the bird wag they head be always contemporaneous to a second with a like desire on my sister 's part and on those rare day when the precious volume be take down one of we always don the penitential nightgown early in the afternoon and sup frugally in bed while the other feast gloriously at the family board never quite happy in she virtue however since it separate she from beloved vice in disgrace that paltry tattered volume when it confront I from its safe nook in a bureau drawer make my heart beat faster and set I dream pray tell I if any book read in you later and wiser year ever bring to you mind such vivid memory to you lip so linger a smile to you eye so ready a tear true enough we could never have love the earth so well if we have have no childhood in it what novelty be worth that sweet monotony where everything be know and love because it be know this autobiographical babble be excusable for one reason only it be in remember what book greatly move we in earlier day what book waken strong and healthy desire enlarged the horizon of we understanding and inspire we to generous action that we get some clue to the book with which to surround we child and a reminiscence of this kind become a sort of psychological observation the moment we realize clearly that the book we read in childhood and youth make a profound impression that can never be repeat later -lrb- save in some rare crisis of heart and soul where a print page mark a epoch in one 's mental or spiritual life -rrb- then we become reinforce in we opinion that it make a deal of difference what child read and how they read it agne repplier say : it be part of the irony of life that we discriminate taste for book should be build up on the ash of a extinct enjoyment a book be such a fact to child its people be so alive and so heartily love and hate its scene so absolutely real prone on the hearth-rug before the fire or curl in the window seat they forget everything but the story the shadow deepen until they can read no longer but they do not much care for the window look into a enchanted region people with brilliant fancy the old garden be sometimes the forest of arden sometimes the land of lilliput sometimes the border the gray rock on the river bank be now the cave of monte cristo and now a castle defend by score of armed knight who peep one by one from the alder-bush while fair ellen and the lovely undine float together on the quiet stream for form a truly admirable literary taste i can not indeed say much in favor of my own motley collection of book just mention for i be simply tumble in among they and leave to browse in accordance with charle lamb 's whimsical plan for bridget elia more might have be add and some take away but they have in they a world of instruction and illumination which child miss who read too exclusively those book write with rigid determination down to they level neglect certain old classic for which we fondly believe there be no substitute you can not always persuade the child of this generation to attack robinson crusoe and if they do they be too sophisticated to thrill properly when they come to Friday 's footstep in the sand think of it my contemporary : think of substitute for that intense moment some of the modern tuppenny climax i do not wish to drift into a cheap cynicism and apotheosize the old day at the expense of the new we be often incline to paint the past with a halo round its head which it never wear when it be the present we can reproduce neither the child nor the condition of fifty or even twenty-five year ago to-day 's child must be fit for to-day 's task educate to answer to-day 's question equip to solve to-day 's problem but be we help they to do this in absolutely the best way at all event it be difficult to join in the paean of gratitude for the ton of child 's book that be turn out yearly by parental publisher if the child of the past do not have quite enough deference pay to they individuality they likes and dislike and if they need be too often leave until the need of everybody else have be consider -- on the other hand they be not surfeit with well-meant but ill-directed attention if the hay be throw so high in the rack that they could not pluck a single straw without stretch up for it why the hay be generally worth stretch for and be perhaps quite as healthful as the sweet and easily digest nursery porridge which some people adopt as exclusive diet for they darling nowadays let we look a little at some of the famous child 's book of a past generation and see what be they general style and purpose take for instance those of mr barbauld who may be include in that group of man and woman who completely alter the style of teaching and write for child -- rousseau de genlis the edgeworth jacotot froebel and diesterweg all great teacher -- didactic deadly-dull mr barbauld who compose as one of she biographer tell we a considerable number of miscellaneous piece for the instruction and amusement of young person especially female -lrb- girl be always young female in those day child be infant and story be tale -rrb- who can ever forget those early lesson write for she adopted son charle who appear in the page sometimes in a state of hopeless ignorance and imbecility and sometimes clothe in the wisdom of the ancient the use of the offensive phrase excessively pretty as apply to a lace tidy by a very tiny female name lucy bring down upon she sinful head eleven page of such moralizing as would only be deliver by a modern mamma on hear a confession of robbery or murder all this do strike we as insufferably didactic yet we can not approve the virulence with which southey and charle lamb attack good mr barbauld in she old age for she purpose be eminently earnest she view of education healthy and sensible for the time in which she live she style polish and admirably quiet she love for young people indubitably sincere and profound and she character worthy of all respect and admiration in its dignity womanliness and strength nevertheless charle lamb exclaim in a whimsical burst of spleen : ` goody two shoe ' be out of print while mr barbauld 's and mr trimmer 's nonsense lie in pile around hang they -- the cursed reasoning crew those blight and blast of all that be human in man and child miss edgeworth have what seem to we in these day the same overplus of sublime purpose and though a much greater writer be quite as desirous of be instructive first last and all the time and quite as unable or unwilling to veil she purpose no book however have ever have a more remarkable influence upon young people and there be many of they -- old-fashioned as they be -- which the sophisticated child of to-day could read with pleasure and profit poor naughty rosamond choose the immortal purple jar out of that apothecary 's window instead of the shoe she need and in a follow chapter after page of excellent maternal advice take the hideous but useful red morocco housewife instead of the coveted plum people may say what they like of miss edgeworth 's lack of proportion as a moralist and economist but we have few writer for child at present who possess the practical knowledge mental vigor and moral force which make she a impose figure in juvenile literature for nearly a century there have never be a time when the difficulty of make a good use of book be as great as it be to-day or a time when it require so much decision to make a wise choice simply because there be so much print matter precipitated upon we that we can not see the wood for the tree it be not my province to discriminate between the various writer for child at the present time to give a complete catalogue of useful book for child would be quite impossible to give a partial list or endeavor to point out what be worthy and what unworthy would be little better no course of read lay down by one person ever suit another and the publish list of best book with they solemn platitude in the way of advice be generally interesting only in they reflection of the writer 's personality i would not choose too absolutely for a child save in he earliest year but would rather surround he with the best and worthiest book and let he choose for himself for there be elective affinity and antipathy here that need not be disregard -- that be indeed certain indication of latent power and trustworthy guide to the child 's unfold possibility book can only be profoundly influential as they unite themselves with decisive tendency provide the right condition for mental growth and then let the child do the grow if we dictate too absolutely we _ en_velop instead of _ de_veloping he mind and weaken he power of choice on the other hand we do not wish he read to be partial or one-sided as it may be without intelligent oversight i be tell bedtime story the other night to a proper wise dull little girl of ten year when i have successfully introduce a mother-cat and kitten to she attention i plunge into what i think a graphic and perfectly natural conversation between they when she cut I short with the observation that she dislike story in which animal talk because they be not true i be rebuke and try again with better success until there come a unlucky figure of speech concern a blossom locust-tree that bent its green bough and laugh in the summer sunshine because its flower be fragrant and lovely and the world so green and beautiful this she think on sober second think a trifle silly as tree never do laugh now that exasperate scrap of humanity -lrb- she be abnormal to be sure -rrb- ought to be lock up and feed upon fairy tale until she be able to catch a faint glimpse of the light that never be on sea or land poor blind deaf little person predestined perhaps to be the mother of a lot of other blind deaf little person some day -- how i should like to develop she imagination whatever child read let we see that it be good of its kind and that it give variety so that no integral want of human nature shall be neglect -- so that neither imagination memory nor reflection shall be starve i own it be difficult to help they in they choice when most of we have not learn to choose wisely for ourselves a discriminate taste in literature be not to be gain without effort and we constant reading of the little book spoil we appetite for the great one style be a matter of some moment even at this early stage mother sometimes forget that child can not read slipshod awkward redundant prose and sing-song vapid verse for ten or twelve year and then take kindly to the best thing afterward long before a child be conscious of such a thing as purity delicacy directness or strength of style he have be act upon unconsciously so that when the period of conscious choice come he be either attract or repel by what be good accord to he training child be fond of vivacity and color and love a bit of word painting or graceful nonsense but there be people who strive for this and miss after all the true warmth and geniality that be most desirable for little people apropo of nonsense we remember leigh hunt who say that there be two kind of nonsense one result from a superabundance of idea the other from a want of they style in the hand of some writer be like war-paint to the savage -- of no perceptible value unless it be lay on thick we little one begin too often on cheap and tawdry story in one or two syllable where picture in primary color try they best to atone for lack of matter then they enter on a prolonged series of child 's book some of they write by people who have neither the intelligence nor the literary skill to write for a more critical audience on the same basis of reasoning which put the young and inexperienced teacher into the lowest grade where the mind ought to be form and assign to the more practice the simpler task of _ in_forming the already partially form -lrb- or _ de_formed -rrb- mind there have never be such conscientious intelligent and purposeful work do for child as in the last ten year and if a overwhelming flood of trash have be pour into we lap along with the better thing we must accept the inevitable the legend myth and fable of the world as well as its history and romance be be bring within reach of young reader by writer of wide knowledge and trained skill know then as we do the danger and obstacle in the way and realize the innumerable inspiration which the best think give to we can we not so direct the reading of we child that we older boy and girl shall not be so exclusively modern in they taste so that they may be incline to take a little less mr saltus a little more shakespeare temper they devotion to mr kipling by small dose of dante forsake the duchess for a dip into thackeray and use hawthorne as a safe and agreeable antidote to mr haggard we need not despair of the child who do not care to read for book be not the only means of culture but they be a very great means when the mind be really stimulate and not simply pad with they mr frederic harrison say : book be no more education than law be virtue of all man perhaps the book-lover need most to be remind that man 's business here be to know for the sake of live not to live for the sake of know but a child who have no taste for reading who be utterly incapable of lose himself in a print page quite unable to forget he childish grief and plunge soul forward headlong into a book 's profound impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth -- such a child be to be pity as miss one of the chief joy of life such a child have no dear old book-friendship to look back upon he have no sweet association with certain musty cover and time-worn page no sacred memory of quiet moment when a new love of goodness a new throb of generosity a new sense of humanity be bear in the ardent young soul bear when we have turn the last page of some well-thumbed volume and press we tear-stained childish cheek against the window pane when it be grow dusk without and a mother 's voice call we from we shelter to lay the book down dear and come to tea for to speak in better word than my own it be the book we read before middle life that do most to mould we character and influence we life and this not only because we nature be then plastic and we opinion flexible but also because to produce lasting impression it be necessary to give a great author time and meditation the book that be with we in the leisure of youth that we love for a time not only with the enthusiasm but with something of the exclusiveness of a first love be those that enter as factor forever in we mental life child 's story to be a good story-teller be to be a king among child the business of story-telling be carry on from the soundest of economic motive in order to supply a constant and grow demand we be force to satisfy the clamorous nursery-folk that beset we on every hand beside we stand a eager little creature quiver with expectation gaze with wide-open eye and say appealingly tell I a story or perhaps a circle of toddler be gather round each one offer the same fervent prayer with so much trust and confidence express in look and gesture that none but a barbarian could bear to disappoint it the story-teller be the child 's special property when once he gift have be find out he may bid good-by to he quiet snooze by the fire or he peaceful rest with a favorite book though he hide in the uttermost part of the house yet will he be discover and make to deliver up he treasure on this one subject at least the little one of the earth be a solid unanimous body for never yet be see the child who do not love the story and prize the story-teller perhaps we never dream of practice the art of story-telling till we be draw into it by the imperious command of the little one about we it be a untrodden path to we and we scarcely understand as yet its difficulty and hindrance its breadth and its possibility yet this eager unceasing demand of the child-nature we must learn to supply and supply wisely for we must not think that all the food we give the little one will be sure to agree with he because he be so hungry this would be no more true of a mental than of a physical diet what object then shall we story serve beyond the important one of please the little listener how can we make they distinctly serviceable fill the difficult and well-nigh impossible _ rle _ of useful as well as ornamental there be of course certain general benefit which the child gain in the hearing of all well-told story these be familiarity with good english cultivation of the imagination development of sympathy and clear impression of moral truth we shall find however that all story appropriate for young child naturally divide themselves into the follow class : -- i the purely imaginative or fanciful and here belong the so-called fairy story ii the realistic devoted to thing which have happen and might could would or should happen without violence to probability these be generally the vehicle for moral lesson which be all the more impressive because not insist on iii the scientific convey bit of information about animal flower rock and star iv the historical or simple interesting account of the life of hero and event in we country 's struggle for life and liberty there be a great difference in opinion regard the advisability of tell fairy story to very young child and there can be no question that some of they be entirely undesirable and inappropriate those contain a fierce or horrible element must of course be promptly rule out of court include the bluggy tale of cruel stepmother ferocious giant and ogre which fill the so-called fairy literature yet those which be pure in tone and gay with fanciful coloring may surely be tell occasionally if only for the quicken of the imagination perhaps however it be best to keep they as a sort of sweetmeat to be take on high day and holiday only let we be realistic by all means but beware o story-teller of be too realistic avoid the shudder tale of the wicked boy who stone the bird lest some hearer be inspire to try the dreadful experiment and see if it really do kill tell not the story of the bear who be set on a hot stove to learn to dance for child quickly learn to gloat over the horrible deal with the positive rather than the negative in story-telling learn to affirm not to deny some one perhaps will say here the knowledge of cruelty and sin must come some time to the child then why shield he from it now true it must come but take heed that you be not the one to introduce it arbitrarily stand far off from childhood say jean paul and brush not away the flower-dust with you rough fist the truth of botany of mineralogy of zoology may be weave into attractive story which will prove as interesting to the child as the most extravagant fairy tale but endeavor to shape you narrative so dexterously around the bit of knowledge you wish to convey that it may be the pivotal point of interest that the child may not suspect for a moment you intention of instruct he under the guise of amusement should this dark suspicion cross he mind you power be weaken from that moment and he will look upon you henceforth as a deeply dye hypocrite the historic story be easily tell and universally interesting if you make it sufficiently clear and simple the account of the first thanksgiving day of the discovery of america of the origin of independence day of the boyhood of we nation 's hero -- all these can be make intelligible and charming to child i suggest topic deal with we own country only because the child must learn to know the near-at-hand before he can appreciate the remote it be best that he should gain some idea of the growth of he own tradition before he wander into the history of other land in any story which have to do with soldier and battle do not be too martial do not permeate you tale with the roar of gun the smell of powder and the cry of the wounded inculcate as much as possible the idea of a struggle for a principle and omit the horror of war we must remember that upon the kind of story we tell the child depend much of he later taste in literature we can easily create a hunger for highly spiced and sensational writing by tell grotesque and horrible tale in childhood when the little one have learn to read when he hold the key to the mystery of book then he will seek in they the same food which so gratify he palate in earlier year we be just begin to realize the importance of beginning in education true a king of israel whose wisdom be greatly extol and whose writings be widely read urge the importance of the early training of child about three thousand year ago but the progress of truth in the world be proverbially slow when parent and teacher legislator and lawgiver be at last heartily convince of the inestimable importance of the first six year of childhood then the play and occupation of that formative period of life will no longer be neglect or leave to chance and the exercise of story-telling will assume its proper place as a educative influence long ago when i be just begin the study of childhood and when all its possibility be rise before I up up from glory to glory -- long ago i be ask to give what i consider the qualification of a ideal kindergartner my answer be as follow -- brief perhaps but certainly comprehensive : -- the music of st cecilium the art of raphael the dramatic genius of rachel the administrative ability of cromwell the wisdom of solomon the meekness of mose and -- the patience of job twelve year ' experience with child have not lower my ideal one whit nor lead I to deem superfluous any of these qualification in fact i should make the list a little longer be i to write it now and should add perhaps the prudence of franklin the inventive power of edison and the talent for improvisation of the early troubadour the troubadour indeed could they return to the earth would wander about lonely and unwelcomed till they find home and refuge in the hospitable atmosphere of the kindergarten -- the only spot in the busy modern world where delighted audience still gather around the professional story-teller if i be ask to furnish a recipe for one of these professional story-teller these spinner of childish narrative i should suggest one measure of pure literary taste two of gesture and illustration three of dramatic fire and four of ready speech and clear expression if to these you add a pinch of tact and sympathy the compound should be a toothsome one and certain to agree with all who taste it and now as to the kind of story we professional be to tell in select this the first point to consider be its suitability to the audience a story for very little one three or four year old perhaps must be simple bright and full of action they do not yet know how to listen they comprehension of language be very limited and they sympathy quite undeveloped nor be they prepare to take wing with you into the lofty realm of the imagination : the adventure of the playful kitten of the birdle learning to fly of the lose ball of the faithful dog -- thing which lie within they experience and belong to the sweet familiar atmosphere of the household -- these they enjoy and understand it will be find also that the number of child to whom one be talk be a prominent factor in the problem of select a story two or three little one gather close about you may pay strict attention to a quiet calm eventless history but a circle of twenty or thirty eager restless little people need more sparkle and incident if one be address a large number of child the home from which they come must be consider child of refined cultivate parent who have listen to family conversation who have be talk to and encourage to express themselves -- these be able to understand much more lofty theme than the poor little mite who be only familiar with plain practical idea and rough speech confine to the most ordinary want of life and now after the story be well select how long shall it be it be impossible to fix a exact limit to the time it should occupy for much depend on the age and the number of the child i be remind again of recipe and of the dismay of the inexperienced cook when she read stir in flour enough to make a stiff batter alas how be she who have never make a stiff batter to settle the exact amount of flour necessary i might give certain suggestion as to time such as close while the interest be still fresh or do not make the tale so long as to weary the child but after all these be only cook-book direction in this as in many other department of work with child one must learn in that dear school which experience keep five minute however be quite long enough with the baby and you will find that twice this time spend with the older child will give room for a tale of absorb interest with appropriate introduction and artistic _ dnouement _ as one of the chief value of the exercise be the familiarity with good english which it give i need not say that especial attention must be pay to the phraseology in which the story be clothe many person who never write ungrammatically be inaccurate in speech and the very familiarity and ease of manner which the story-teller must assume may lead she into colloquialism and careless expression of course however the language must be simple the word for the most part saxon no ponderous johnsonian expression should drag they slow length through the recital entangle in they fold the comprehension of the child nor on the other hand need we confine ourselves to monosyllable adopt the bald style of primer and first reader it be quite possible to talk simply and yet with grace and feeling and we may be sure that child invariably appreciate poetry of expression the story should always be accompany with gesture -- simple free unstudied motion descriptive perhaps of the sweep of the mother bird 's wing as she soar away from the nest or the wave of the fir-tree 's branch as he sing to himself in the sunshine this universal language be understand at once by the child and not only serve as a interpreter of word and idea but give life and attraction to the exercise illustration either impromptu or carefully prepared beforehand be always hail with delight by the child nor need you hesitate to try you ` prentice hand at this work never mind if you can not draw it must be a rude picture indeed which be not enjoy by a audience of little people they vivid imagination will triumph over all difficulty and enable they to see the ideal shine through the real it be well now and then also to have the child illustrate the story they drawing if execute quite without help be most interesting from a psychological standpoint and will afford great delight to you as well as to the little artist themselves the story can also be illustrate with clay modeling a idealized mud-pie-making very dear to child they soon become quite expert in mould simple object and enjoy the work with all the capacity of they childish heart now and then encourage the little one to repeat what they remember of the tale you have tell or to tell something new on the same theme if the story you have give have be within they range and on a familiar subject a torrent of infantile reminiscence will immediately gush forth and you will have a miniature experience meeting if you have be tell a dog story for instance -- i hed a dog once ' t cry jimmy breathlessly and be just about to tell some startling incident concern he when nickey pipe up and so hed i and the pound man tuk he and so on all around the circle in the free kindergarten each child palpitate with eagerness to give you he bit of personal experience gather the little one as near to you as possible when you be tell story the tiniest in you lap the other cuddle at you knee this be easily manage in the nursery but be more difficult with a large circle of child with the latter you can but seat yourself among the wee one confident that the interest of the story will hold the attention of the older child what a happy hour it be this one of story-telling dear and sacred to every child-lover what a eager delightful audience be these little one grieve at the sorrow of the hero laugh at they happy success breathless with anxiety lest the cat catch the disobedient mouse clap hand when the ugly duckling be change into the swan -- all appreciation all interest all joy we might count the rest of the world well lose could we ever be surround by such bloom face such loving heart and such ready sympathy the relation of the kindergarten to social reform new social and individual want demand new solution of the problem of education social reform it be always rather a awe-striking phrase it seem as if one ought to be a philosopher even to approach so August a subject the kindergarten -- a simple unpretentious place where a lot of tiny child work and play together a place into which if the hard-headed man of business chance to glance and if he do not stay long enough or come often enough would conclude that the child be fritter away they time particularly if that same good man of business have weigh and measure and calculate so long that he have lose the see eye and understanding heart some year ago a san francisco kindergartner be thread she way through a dirty alley make friendly visit to the child of she flock as she linger on a certain door-step receive the last confidence of some weary woman 's heart she hear a loud but not unfriendly voice ringing from a upper window of a tenement-house just round the corner clear thing from under foot peal the voice in stentorian accent the teacher o ' the _ kid ' guard _ be comin ' down the street eureka think the teacher with a smile there be a bit of sympathetic translation for you at last the german word have be put into the vernacular the odd foreign syllable have be take to the ignorant mother by the lisping child and the _ kindergartner _ have become the _ kid ' guard _ heaven bless the rough translation colloquial as it be no royal accolade could be dearer to its recipient than this quaint new christen what have the kindergarten to do with social reform what bearing have its theory and practice upon the conduct of life a brass-buttoned guardian of the peace remark to a gentleman on a street-corner if we could open more kindergarten sir we could almost shut up the penitentiary sir we hear the sentiment applaud it and promptly print it on the cover of three thousand report but on calm reflection it appear like a exaggerated statement i be not sure that a kindergarten in every ward of every city in america would almost shut up the penitentiary sir the most determine optimist be weigh down by the feeling that it will take more than the ardent prosecution of any one reform however vital to produce such a result we appoint investigate committee who ask more and more question compile more and more statistics and get more and more confused every year be we criminal native or foreign bear that we may know whether we be worse or better than other people have they ever learn a trade that we may prove what we already know that idle finger be the devil 's tool have they be educate -- by any one of the sorry method that take shelter under that much-abused word -- that we may know whether ignorance be a bliss or a _ blister _ be they marry or single that we may determine the influence of home tie have they be give to the use of liquor that we may heap proof on proof mountain high against the monster evil of intemperance what have be they family history that we may know how heavily the law of heredity have lay its burden upon they burn question all if we would find out the cause of crime to discover the why and wherefore of thing be a law of human think the reform school penitentiary prison insane asylum hospital and poorhouse be all fill to overflow and it be entirely sensible to inquire how the people come there and to relieve pardon bless cure or reform they as far as we can meanwhile as we be dismiss or blessing or bury the unfortunate from the impose front gate of we institution new throng be crowd in at the little back door life be a bridge full of gaping hole over which we must all travel a thousand evil of human misery and wickedness flow in a dark current beneath and the blind the weak the stupid and the reckless be continually fall through into the rush flood we must it be true organize we life-boat it be we duty to pluck out the drown wretch receive they vow of penitence and gratitude and pray for courage and resignation when they celebrate they rescue by fall in again but we agree nowadays that we should do they much better service if we could contrive to mend more of the hole in the bridge the kindergarten be try to mend one of these hole it be a tiny one only large enough for a child 's foot but that be we bit of the world 's work -- to _ keep it small _ if we can prevent the little people from stumble we may hope that the grown folk will have a surer foot and a steadier gait a wealthy lady announce she intention of give $ 25000 to some home for incurable why cry a bright kindergartner _ do not _ you give twelve and a half thousand to some home for _ curable _ and then you other twelve and a half will go so much further in a word solicitude for childhood be one of the sign of a grow civilization to cure be the voice of the past to prevent the divine whisper of to-day what be the true relation of the kindergarten to social reform evidently it can have no other relation than that which grow out of its existence as a plan of education education we have all glibly agree lessen the prevalence of crime that sound very well but as a matter of fact have we past system produce all the result in this direction that we have hope and pray for the truth be people will not be make much better by education until the plan of educate they be make better to begin with froebel 's idea -- the kindergarten idea -- of the child and its power of humanity and its destiny of the universe of the whole problem of living be somewhat different from that hold by the vast majority of parent and teacher it be imperfectly carry out even in the kindergarten itself where a conscious effort be make and be infrequently attempt in the school or family he plan of education cover the entire period between the nursery and the university and contain certain essential feature which bear close relation to the gravest problem of the day if they could be make a integral part of all we teaching in family school and institution the burden under which society be groan to-day would fall more and more lightly on each succeed generation these essential feature have often be enumerate i be no fortunate herald of new truth i may not even put the old wine in new bottle but iteration be next to inspiration and i shall give you the result of eleven year ' experience among the child and home of the poorer class this experience have not be confine to teach one do not live among these people day after day plead for a welcome for unwished-for baby stand beside tiny grave receive pathetic confidence from wretched father and helpless mother without face every problem of this workaday world they can not all be solve even by the wisest of we we can only seize the end of the skein nearest to we hand and patiently endeavor to straighten the tangled thread the kindergarten start out plainly with the assumption that the moral aim in education be the absolute one and that all other be purely relative it endeavor to be a life-school where all the practice of complete living be make a matter of daily habit it assert boldly that do right would not be such a enormously difficult matter if we practice it a little -- say a tenth as much as we practice the piano -- and it intend to give child plenty of opportunity for practice in this direction it say insistently and eternally do noble thing not dream they all day long for development action be the indispensable requisite to develop moral feeling and the power and habit of moral do we must exercise they excite encourage and guide they action to check reprove and punish wrong feeling and do however necessary it be for the safety and harmony nay for the very existence of any social state do not develop right feeling and good do it do not develop anything for it stop action and without action there be no development at best it stop wrong development that be all in the kindergarten the physical mental and spiritual being be consciously address at one and the same time there be no piece-work tolerate the child be view in he threefold relation as the child of nature the child of man and the child of god there be to be no disregard any one of these divinely appoint relation it endeavor with equal solicitude to instill correct and logical habit of thought true and generous habit of feeling and pure and lofty habit of action and it assert serenely that if information can not be gain in the right way it would better not be gain at all it have no special hobby unless you would call its eternal plea for the all-sided development of the child a hobby somebody say lately that the kindergarten people have a certain stock of metaphysical statement to be air on every occasion and that they be over-fond of prate about the being of the child it would hardly seem as if too much could be say in favor of the symmetrical growth of the child 's nature these be not mere silken phrase but if any one dislike they let he take the good honest ringing charge of colonel parker remember that the whole boy go to school yes the whole boy do go to school but the whole boy be seldom educate after he get there a fraction of he be attend to in the evening however and a fraction on Sunday he take himself in hand on saturday and in vacation time and accomplish a good deal notwithstanding the fact that he sight be a trifle impaired already and he hearing grow a little dull so that dame nature work at a disadvantage and begin doubtless to dread boy who have enjoy too much schooling since it seem to leave they in a state of coma we general scheme of education further mental development with considerable success the training of the hand be now be laboriously weave into it but even when that be accomplish we shall still be work with imperfect aim for the stress lay upon heart-culture be as yet in no way commensurate with its gravity we know with that indolent fruitless half-knowledge that pass for know that out of the heart be the issue of life we feel not with the white heat of absolute conviction but placidly and indifferently as become the dweller in a world of change that conduct be three fourth of life but we do not crystallize this belief into action we dream not do the noble thing the kindergarten do not fence off a half hour each day for moral culture but keep it in view every moment of every day yet it be never obtrusive for the mental faculty be be address at the same time and the body strengthen for its special work with the method generally practice in the family and school i fail to see how we can expect any more delicate sense of right and wrong any clearer realization of duty any greater enlightenment of conscience any higher conception of truth than we now find in the world i care not what view you take of humanity whether you have calvinistic tendency and believe in the total depravity of infant or whether you be a disciple of wordsworth and apostrophize the child as a mighty prophet seer blest on whom those truth do rest which we be toiling all we life to find if you be a fair-minded man or woman and have have much experience with young child you will be compel to confess that they generally have a tolerably clear sense of right and wrong need only gentle guidance to choose the right when it be put before they i say most not all child for some be poor blur human scrawl blot all over with the mistake of other people and how do we treat this natural sense of what be true and good this willingness to choose good rather than evil if it be make even the least bit comprehensible and attractive in various way all equally dull blind and vicious if we look at the downright ethical significance of the method of training and discipline in many family and school we see that they be positively degrade we appoint more and more monitor instead of train the inward monitor in each child make truth-telling difficult instead of easy punish trivial and grave offens about in the same way practice open bribery by promising child a few cent a day to behave themselves and weaken they sense of right by give they picture card for tell the truth and credit for do the most obvious duty this have be carry on until we be on the point of need another deluge and a new start be it strange that we find the moral sense blunt the conscience unenlighten the moral climate with which we surround the child be so hazy that the spiritual vision grow dimmer and dimmer -- and small wonder upon this solid mass of ignorance and stupidity it be difficult to make any impression yet i suppose there be greater joy in heaven over a cordial thwack at it than over most blow at exist evil the kindergarten attempt a rational respectful treatment of child lead they to do right as much as possible for right 's sake abjure all reward save the pleasure of work for other and the delight that follow a good action and all punishment save those that follow as natural penalty of broken law -- the obvious consequence of the special bit of wrong-doing whatever it may be the child 's will be address in such a way as to draw it on if right to turn it willingly if wrong coercion in the sense of fear personal magnetism nay even the child 's love for the teacher may be use in such a way as to weaken he moral force with every free conscious choice of right a human being 's moral power and strength of character increase and the converse of this be equally true if the child be unruly in play he leave the circle and sit or stand by himself a miserable lonely unit until he feel again in sympathy with the community if he destroy he work he unite the tattered fragment as best he may and take the moral object lesson home with he if he have neglect he own work he be not give the joy of work for other if he do not work in harmony with he companion a time be choose when he will feel the sense of isolation that come from not live in unity with the prevail spirit of good will he can have as much liberty as be consistent with the liberty of other people but no more if we could infuse the _ spirit _ of this kind of discipline into family and school life make it systematic and continuous from the earliest year there would be fewer morally slack-twisted little creature grow up into inefficient bloodless manhood and womanhood it would be a good deal of trouble but then life be a good deal of trouble anyway if you come to that we can not expect to swallow the universe like a pill and travel on through the world like smile image push from behind blind obedience to authority be not in itself moral it be necessary as a part of government it be necessary in order that we may save child danger of which they know nothing it be valuable also as a habit but i should never try to teach it by the story of that inspired idiot the boy who stand on the burning deck whence all but he have flee and from whence he would have flee if he mental endowment have be that of ordinary boy for obedience must not be allow to destroy common sense and the feeling of personal responsibility for one 's own action we task be to train responsible self-directing agent not to make soldier virtue thrive in a brace moral atmosphere where good action be take rather as a matter of course the attempt to instill a idea of self-government into the tiny slip of humanity that find they way into the kindergarten be useful and infinitely to be prefer to the most implicit obedience to arbitrary command in the one case we may hope to have some time or other a enlighten will and conscience struggle after the right fail often but rise superior to failure because of a ever stronger joy in right and shame for wrong in the other we have a _ good goose _ who do the right for the picture card that be set before he -- a trained dog sort of child who will not leap through the hoop unless he see the whip or the lump of sugar so much for the training of the sense of right and wrong now for the provision which the kindergarten make for the growth of certain practical virtue much need in the world but touch upon all too lightly in family and school the student of political economy see clearly enough the need of greater thrift and frugality in the nation but where and when do we propose to develop these virtue precious little time be give to they in most school for they cultivation do not yet seem to be insist upon as a integral part of the scheme here and there a inspired human be seize on the thought that the child should really be teach how to live at some time between the age of six and sixteen or he may not learn so easily afterward accordingly the pupil under the guidance of that particular person catch a glimpse of eternal verity between the print line of they geography and grammar the kindergarten make the growth of every-day virtue so simple so gradual even so easy that you be almost beguile into think they commonplace they seem to come in just by the way as it be so that at the end of the day you have see thought and word and deed so sweetly mingled that you marvel at the universal dovetailedness of thing as dickens put it they will flourish better in the school too when the cheerful hum of labor be hear there for a little while each day the kindergarten child have just enough strip for he weave mat -- none to lose none to destroy just enough block in each of he box and every one of they he find be require to build each simple form he cut he square of paper into a dozen crystal-shaped bit and behold each one of these tiny flake be need to make a symmetrical figure he have be careless in follow direction and he form of fold paper do not come out right it be not even and it be not beautiful the false step in the beginning have perpetuate itself in each succeed one until at the end either partial success or complete failure meet he eye how easy here to see the relation of cause to effect courage say the kindergartner better fortune next time for we will take greater pain can you rub out the ugly wrong crease we will try alas no wrong thing be not so easily rub out be they use you worsted quite to the end dear : it cost money let we save all the crumb from we lunch for the bird child do not drop any on the floor : it will only make work for somebody else and so on to the end of the busy happy day how easy it be in the kindergarten how seemingly difficult later on it seem to be only book afterward and book be good enough in they own way but they be a mighty bloodless substitute for life the most superficial observer value the industrial side of the kindergarten because it fall directly in line with the present effort to make some manual training a part of school work but twenty or twenty-five year ago when the subject be not so popular kindergarten child be work away at they pretty useful task -- tiny missionary help to show the way to a truth now fully recognize as to the value of lead child to habit of industry as early in life as may be that they may see the dignity and nobleness of labor and conceive of they individual responsibility in this world of action that be too obvious to dwell upon at this time to froebel life action and knowledge be the three note of one harmonious chord but he do not advocate manual training merely that child might be keep busy nor even that technical skill might be acquire the piece of finish kindergarten work be only a symbol of something more valuable which the child have acquire in do it the first step in all the kindergarten occupation be direct or suggest by the teacher but these dictation or suggestion be merely intend to serve as a sort of staff by which the child can steady himself until he can walk alone it be always the creative instinct that be to be reach and vivify : everything else be secondary by reproduction from memory of a dictate form by take from or add to it by change its center corner or side -- by a dozen ingenious preliminary step -- the child 's inventive faculty be develop and he soon reach a point in draw building modeling or what not where he greatest delight be to put he individual idea into visible shape the simple request make something pretty of you own bring a score of original combination and design -- either the old thought in different shape or something fresh and audacious which hint of genius instead of twenty hackneyed and slavish copy of one pattern we have twenty free individual production each the expression of the child 's inmost personal thought this invest labor with a beauty and power and confer upon it a dignity to be gain in no other way it make every task however lowly a joy because all the higher faculty be bring into action much so-called busy work where pupil of the a class be allow to stick a thousand peg in a thousand hole while the b class be recite arithmetic be quite fruitless because it have so little thought behind it unless we have a care manual training when we have succeed in get it into the school may become as mechanical and unprofitable as much of we mind training have be and its moral value thus largely miss the only way to prevent it be to borrow a suggestion from froebel then and only then shall we have insight with power of action knowledge with practice practice with the stamp of individuality then do will blossom into be and be be the mother of all the little doings as well as of the grown-up deed and heroic sacrifice the kindergarten succeed in get these interesting and valuable free production from child of four or five year only by develop in every possible way the sense of beauty and harmony and order we know that people assume somewhat at least the color of they surroundings and if the sense of beauty be to grow we must give it something to feed upon the kindergarten try to provide a room more or less attractive quantity of picture and object of interest grow plant and vine vase of flower and plenty of light air and sunshine a canary chirp in one corner perhaps and very likely there will be a cat curl up somewhere or a forlorn dog which have follow the child into this safe shelter it be a pretty pleasant domestic interior charming and grateful to the sens the kindergartner look as if she be glad to be there and the child be generally smile everybody seem alive the work lie cosily about be neat artistic and suggestive the child pass out of they seat to the cheerful sound of music and be presently join in a ideal sort of game where in place of the mawkish sentimentality of sally walker of obnoxious memory we see all sort of healthful poetic childlike fancy weave into song rudeness be for the most part banish the little human butterfly and bee and bird flit hither and thither in the circle the make-believe tree hold up they branch and the flower they cup and everybody seem merry and content as they pass out the door good-by and bow and kiss be waft backward into the room for the manners of polite society be observe in everything you draw a deep breath this be a _ real _ kindergarten and it be like a little piece of the millennium everything be so very pretty and charming say the visitor yes so it be but all this color beauty grace symmetry daintiness delicacy and refinement though it seem to address and develop the aesthetic side of the child 's nature have in reality a very profound ethical significance we have all see the preternatural virtue of the child who wear she best dress hat and shoe on the same August occasion child be tidier and more careful in a dainty well-kept room they treat pretty material more respectfully than ugly one they be incline to be ashamed at least in a slight degree of uncleanliness vulgarity and brutality when they see they in broad contrast with beauty and harmony and order for the most part they try to live up to the place in which they find themselves there be some connection between manners and moral it be very elusive and perhaps not very deep but it exist vice do not flourish alike in all condition and locality by any mean a ignorant negro be overhear pray let I so lib dat when i die i may _ hab manners _ dat i may know what to say when i see my heabenly lord well i dare say we shall need good manners as well as good moral in heaven and the constant cultivation of the one from right motive might give we a unexpected impetus toward the other if the systematic development of the sense of beauty and order have a ethical significance so have the happy atmosphere of the kindergarten a influence in the same direction i have know one or two solid man and one or two predestinate spinster who say that they do not believe child could accomplish anything in the kindergarten because they have too good a time there be something uniquely vicious about people who care nothing for child 's happiness that sense of the solemnity of mortal condition which have be indelibly impressed upon we by we puritan ancestor come soon enough heaven know meanwhile a happy childhood be a unspeakably precious memory we look back upon it and refresh we tired heart with the vision when experience have cast a shadow over the full joy of live the sunshiny atmosphere of a good kindergarten give the young human plant a impulse toward eager vigorous growth love 's warmth surround they on every side woo they sweetest possibility into life root take a firmer grasp bud form and flower bloom where under more unfriendly condition bare stalk or pale leaf would greet the eye -- pathetic unfulfilled promise -- soul no happier for have live in the world the world no happier because of they living virtue kindle at the touch of joy the kindergarten take this for one of its text and do not breed that dismal fungus of the mind which dispose one to believe that the pursuit of knowledge must necessarily be disagreeable the social phase of the kindergarten be most interesting to the student of social economics coperative work be strongly emphasize and the child be inspire both to live he _ own full _ life and yet to feel that he life touch other life at every point -- for we be member one of another it be not the unity of the little bird in the couplet who agree in they little nest because they would fall out if they do not but a realization in embryo of the divine principle that no man liveth to himself as to specifically religious culture everything foster the spirit out of which true religion grow in the morning talk when the child be most susceptible and ready to be good as they say they thought be lead to the beauty of the world about they the pleasure of right do the sweetness of kind thought and action the loveliness of truth patience and helpfulness and the goodness of the creator to all create thing no parent of whatever creed or lack of creed whether a bigot or unbeliever could object to the kind of religious instruction give in the kindergarten and yet in every possible way the child-soul and the child-heart be direct towards everything that be pure and holy true and steadfast if the child love not he brother whom he have see how can he love god whom he have not see love worketh no ill to he neighbor therefore love be the fulfil of the law there be a vast deal of practical religion to be breathe into these little child of the street before the abstraction of belief can be comprehend they can not live on word and prayer and text the thought and feeling must come before the expression as mr whitney say the world be determine to vaccinate child with religion for fear they should take it in the natural way some wise saying of the good dr holland in nichola minturn come to I as i write nichola say in discuss this matter of charity and the various means of effect a radical cure of pauperism rather than its continual alleviation : if you read the parable of the sower i think that you will find that soil be quite as necessary as seed -- indeed that the seed be throw away unless a soil be prepare in advance i believe in religion but before i undertake to plant it i would like something to plant it in the sower be too few and the seed be too precious to be throw away and lose among the thorn and stone last but by no means least the admirable physical culture that go on in the kindergarten be all in the right direction physiologist know as much about morality as minister of the gospel the vice which drag man and woman into crime spring as often from unhealthy body as from weak will and callous conscience vile fancy and sensual appetite grow stronger and more terrible when a feeble physique and low vitality offer no oppose force deadly vice be nourish in the weak diseased body that be pen day after day in filthy crowded tenement of great city if we could withdraw every three-year-old child from these physically enfeeble and morally brutalize influence and give they three or four hour a day of sunshine fresh air and healthy physical exercise we should be do humanity a inestimable service even if we attempt nothing more i have try as briefly as i might in justice to the subject to emphasize the follow point : -- i that we must act up to we conviction with regard to the value of preventive work if we be ever oblige to choose let we save the child ii that the relation of the kindergarten to social reform be simply that as a plan of education it offer we valuable suggestion in regard to the mental moral and physical culture of child which in view of certain cry evil of the day we should do well to follow the essential feature of the kindergarten which bear a special relation to the subject be as follow : -- 1 the symmetrical development of the child 's power consider he neither as all mind all soul nor all body but as a creature capable of devout feeling clear thinking noble do 2 the attempt to make so-called moral culture a little less immoral the rational method of discipline look to the growth of moral self-directing power in the child -- the only proper discipline for future citizen of a free republic 3 the development of certain practical virtue the lack of which be endanger the prosperity of the nation namely economy thrift temperance self-reliance frugality industry courtesy and all the sober host -- none of they drawing-room accomplishment and consequently in small demand 4 the emphasis place upon manual training especially in its development of the child 's creative activity 5 the training of the sense of beauty harmony and order its ethical as well as aesthetical significance 6 the insistence upon the moral effect of happiness joy the favorable climate of childhood 7 the training of the child 's social nature a attempt to teach the brotherhood of man as well as the fatherhood of god 8 the realization that a healthy body have almost as great a influence on moral as a pure mind i do not say that the consistent practice of these principle will bring the millennium in the twinkling of a eye but i do affirm that they be the thought-germ of that better education which shall prepare humanity for the new earth over which shall arch the new heaven ruskin say crime can only be truly hinder by let no man grow up a criminal by take away the will to commit sin but you object that be sheer impossibility it do seem so i confess and yet unless you be willing to think that the whole plan of a omnipotent being be to be utterly overthrow set aside thwart then you must believe this ideal possible somehow sometime i know of no better way to grow towards it than by live up to the kindergarten idea that just as we gain intellectual power by do intellectual work and the finest aesthetic feeling by create beauty so shall we win for ourselves the power of feeling nobly and willing nobly by do noble thing how shall we govern we child not the cry say a chinese author but the rising of a wild duck impel the flock to follow he in upward flight long ago in a far-off country a child be bear and when he parent look on he they love he and they resolve in they simple heart to make of he a strong brave warlike man but the god of that country be a hungry and a insatiable god and he cry out for human sacrifice so when he arm have be thrice heated till they glow red with the flame of the fire the mother cradle she child in they and he life exhale as a vapor a child be bear in another country and the tender eye of he mother see that he limb be misshapen and he life-blood a sickly current yet she heart yearn over he and she would have tend and train he and love he better than all the rest of she strong well-favored brood but when the elder of she people know that the child be a weakling they decree that he should die and she bent she head to the law which be stronger than she love in a third land a child be to be bear and the proud father make ready gift and purchase silken robe and prepare a feast for he friend but alas when the longed-for soul enter the world it be house in a woman-child 's body and straightway the joy be change into mourn bitter reproach be heap upon the mother for be there not enough woman already on the earth and the fiat go forth that the babe should straightway be deliver from the trial of existence so while its hold on life be yet uncertain the husband 's mother place wet cloth upon its lip and soon the faint breath stop and the white soul go flutter heavenward again in still another of god 's fair land a child enter the world and he grow toward manhood vigorous and lusty but he heed not he parent ' command and when he disobedience have be long continue the father of the tribe decree that he should be stone to death for so it be write in the sacred book and as the youth be the absolute property of he parent and as by common consent they have full liberty to deal with he as seem good to they they consent unto he death that he soul might be save alive and the evening sun shine crimson on he dead body as it lay upon the sand of the desert \* \* \* \* \* at a later day and in a christian country two child be bear one hundred year apart and the world have now so far progress that absolute power over the life of the offspring be deny the parent the one be rule with iron rod he be make to obey with a rigidity of compliance and a severity of treatment in case of failure which make obedience a slavish duty and he be teach besides that he be a child of satan and a heir of hell he find no joy in he youth and he miserable soul grovel in fear of the despot who dominate he and of the blaze eternity which he be tell would be the punishment for he sin he will be break he be make weak where he might have be strong and he do evil because he have learn no power of self-restraint : yet he people love he and they have do all these thing because they wish to purge he wholly from all uncleanness the parent of the other child be warn of the lamentable result of this gloomy training and they say one to another : we darling shall be free as air he duty shall be make to seem like pleasure or better still he shall have no duty but he pleasure he shall do only what he will that he will may grow strong and he can but choose the right for he know no evil we will hold up before he no bugbear of future punishment for doubtless there be no such thing and if there be it will not be mete out to such a child he will love and obey he parent because they have devote themselves to he happiness and because they have never impose distasteful obligation upon he and when he grow to manhood he will be a model of wisdom and of goodness but lo the child of this training be as great a failure as the child of austerity and gloom he be capricious lawless willful disobedient passionate he think of no one 's pleasure save he own he care for he parent only in so far as they could be of use to he and like a wild beast of the jungle he prey upon the life around he and care not whom he destroy if he appetite be satisfy in every field of opinion and action man be find swing from one extreme to the other of life 's manifold arc of vibration this perpetual movement may be the essential condition of existence for death be cessation of motion or it may be a never-ending effort of the mind to reach a ideal which disclose itself so seldom as to make its permanent abiding-place a matter of uncertainty doubtless there be somewhere a middle to the arc and in the lapse of age the needle may at last find the pole-point of central truth and be at rest but as yet in every department of labor and think it be vibrate and after tarry a while at one extreme it swing unsatisfied back to the other nowhere be these extreme more noticeable than in the government of child century ago in the patriarchal period the father of the family seem also to have exercise the function of a criminal judge but the uniting of the two set of duty in one person do not appear to have inspire the child with insurmountable awe for law be find both in number and deuteronomy fix the penalty of disobedience and of the striking of a parent by a child still later the roman father possess arbitrary power of life and death over he child but it be probable that natural affection and a more advanced civilization commonly make the law a dead letter though the world in time grow to feel that life belong to the be who hold it not to those who give it birth still discipline have for age be direct more to the body than to the mind with a idea apparently that the pain of the flesh will save the soul pious parent until within recent date have regard the flogging of child as absolutely a religious obligation and many a tender mother have steel she heart and strengthen she arm to give the blow which she regard as essential to the spiritual well-being of she child the birch rod and the bible be the parent ' complete guide to domestic management in puritan day and no one can deny that this treatment though rather a heroic one seem to have produce fine strong self-denying man and woman governor bradford in 1648 speak feelingly of the godliness of a puritan woman whose office it be to sit in a convenient place in the congregation with a little birchen rod in she hand and keep the child in great awe and from the frequency with which chastisement be mention in early puritan record it seem pretty clear that the sober little lad and lass of the day do not suffer from over-indulgence when this wholesale whipping begin to fall into disuse many philosopher prophesy the ruin of the race but these gloomy prediction have scarcely find they fulfillment as yet there have be however a colossal change in discipline from the day when disobedience be punishable with death to the agreeable moral suasion of the nineteenth century as exemplify in the fin de sicle nonsense rhyme : -- there once be a hopeful young horse who be bring up on love without force : he have he own way and they sugar he hay so he never be naughty of course the result of this delightful method of treatment seem rather problematic and the modern child be universally acknowledge to be no improvement upon he predecessor in point of respect and filial piety at least a superintendent 's report write thirty year ago for one of the new england state regret that even then home government have grow lax he wittily say that young america be _ rampant _ parental influence _ couchant _ and no reversal of these position be as yet visible in 1892 to those who note the method by which many child be manage it be a matter of wonderment that the result in character and conduct be not very much worse than they be dr channing wisely say the hope of the world lie in the fact that parent can not make of they child what they will happy accident of association and circumstance sometimes nullify the harm the parent have do and the tremendous momentum of the race-tendency carry the child over many a obstacle which he training have set in he path it seem crystal-clear at the outset that you can not govern a child if you have never learn to govern yourself plato say many century ago : the best way of train the young be to train yourself at the same time not to admonish they but to be always carry out you own principle in practice and all the wisdom of the ancient be in the think if then you be a fit person to be trust with the government of a child what goal do you propose to reach in you discipline what be you aim you ideal 1 the discipline should be thoroughly in harmony with child-nature in general and suit to the age and development of the particular child in question 2 it should appeal to the higher motive and to the higher motive alone 3 it should develop kindness helpfulness and sympathy 4 it should never use weapon which would tend to lower the child 's self-respect 5 it should be thoroughly just and the punishment or rather the retribution should be commensurate with the offense 6 it should teach respect for law and for the rights of other finally it should teach voluntary obedience the last lesson in life the choral song which rise from all element and all angel and as the object of true discipline be the formation of character it should produce a human be master of he impulse he passion and he will the journey 's end be fix one must next decide what route will reach it and will be short safe economical and desirable and the road to the presumably ideal discipline be many and well-traveled some of they it be true lead you into a swamp some to the edge of a precipice some will hurl you down a mountain-side with terrific rapidity other stop half-way bring you face to face with a blank wall and other again will lose you entirely on a bleak and trackless plain but no matter which route you select you will have the wise company of a great many teacher parent and guardian and a innumerable throng of fair and lovely child will journey by you side the road of threat and fear of arbitrary and over-severe punishment have be much travel in all time though perhaps it be a little grass-grown now the child who obey you merely because he fear punishment be a slave who cower under the lash of the despot undue severity make he a liar and a coward he hate he master he hate the thing he be make to do there be a bitter sense of injustice a seething passion of revenge forever within he and be he strong enough he would rise and destroy the power that have crush he he have do right because he be force to do so not because he desire it and since the right-doing the obedience be neither the fruit of he reason nor he love it can not be permanent the feeling of justice be strong in the child 's mind and you have constantly wound that feeling you have destroy the sense of cause and effect by you arbitrary punishment you have correct he for disobedience for carelessness for unkindness for untruthfulness for noisiness and for slowness in learn he lesson how be he to know which of these offens be the greatest if all have receive the same punishment why should give he a good thrashing teach he to be kind to he little sister why should he learn the multiplication table with greater rapidity because you ferule he soundly have you ever find pain a assistance to the memory if he have little intellectual perception of the difference between truth and falsehood why should you suppose that smart stroke on any portion of the body would quicken that perception be it not clear as the sun at noonday that since he observe the punishment to have no necessary relation to the offense and since he observe it to be light or severe accord to you pleasure -- be it not clear that he will suppose you to be use you superior strength in order to treat he unfairly and will not the supposition sow seed of hatred and rebellion in he heart another road to discipline be that of bribery to endeavor to secure goodness in a child by means of bribery to promise he a reward in case he obey you be manifestly a absurdity you be destroy the very trait in he character you be presumably endeavor to build up you be educate a human being who know good from evil and who should be teach deliberately to choose the right for the right 's sake who should do he duty because he know it to be he duty not for any extraneous reward connect with it a spiritual reward will follow nevertheless in the feeling of happiness engender and the child may early be lead to find he satisfaction in this and in the approval of those he love there be of course certain simple reward which can be use with safety and which the child easily see to be the natural result of good conduct if he treatment of the household pussy have be kind and gentle he may well be trust with a pet of he own if he put he toy away carefully when ask to do so father will notice the neat room when he come home if he learn he lesson well and quickly he will have the more time to work in the garden and the suggestion of these natural consequence be legitimate and of good effect it be always safer no doubt to appeal to a love of pleasure in child than to a fear of pain yet bribe and extraneous reward inevitably breed selfishness and corruption and lead the child to expect condition in life which will never be realize though retribution of one kind or another follow quickly on the heel of wrong-doing yet virtue be commonly its own reward and it be as well that the child should learn this at the beginning of life froebel say : do a simple natural child when act rightly think of any other reward which he might receive for he action than this consciousness though that reward be only praise how we degrade and lower the human nature which we should raise how we weaken those whom we should strengthen when we hold up to they a inducement to act virtuously emulation be often harness into service to further intellectual progress and the formation of right habit of conduct and this inevitably breed serious evil it be well to set before the child a ideal on which he may form himself as far as possible but when this ideal sit across the aisle play in a neighbor back yard or worse still be another child in the same family he be hate and despise he virtue become obnoxious and the unfortunate evildoer prefer to be vicious that he may not resemble a creature whose praise have so continually be sing that he very name be odious if the child grow accustomed to the comparison of himself with other and the endeavor to excel they he become selfish envious and either vain of he virtue and attainment or else thoroughly dishearten at he small success while he grudge that of he neighbor george macdonald say : no work noble or lastingly good can come of emulation any more than of greed i think the motive be spiritually the same to what can we appeal then in child as motive to goodness as aid in the formation of right habit of thought and action ah the child 's heart be a harp of many string and touch by the hand of a master a fine clear tone will sound from every one of they while the resultant strain will be a triumphant burst of glorious harmony touch delicately the string of love of approval and listen to the answer the child delight to work for you to please you if he can to do he task well enough to win you favorable notice and the breath of praise be sweet to he nostril it be right and justifiable that he should have this praise and it will be a aid to he spiritual development if bestow with discrimination only titanic strength of character can endure constant discouragement and failure and yet work steadily onward and the weak undeveloped human be need a word of approval now and then to show he that he be on the right track and that he effort be appreciate of course the kind and the frequency of the praise bestow depend entirely upon the nature of the child one timid self-distrustful temperament need frequently to bask in the sunshine of you approval while another somewhat predispose to vanity and self-consciousness feed a more brace moral climate there be no question that cleanliness and fresh air may be consider as minor aid to goodness and a dangerous outbreak of insubordination may sometimes be avert by hastily suggest to the little rebel a run in the garden preface by a thorough application of cool water to the flush face and little clenched hand while self-respect may often be restore by the donning of a clean apron beauty of surroundings be another incentive to harmony of action it be easier for the child to be naughty in a poor gloomy room scanty of furniture than in a garden gay with flower shaded by full-leafed tree and make musical by the voice of run water dr william t harri say : beauty can not create a new heart but it can greatly change the disposition and this seem unquestionable especially with regard to the glory of god 's handiwork which make goodness seem the natural way of live yet we would not wish we child to be sybarite and we must endeavor to cultivate in they breast a hardy plant of virtue which will live if need be on alpine height and feed on scanty fare it be a truism that interesting occupation prevent dissension and that idle finger be the devil 's tool a child who be good and happy during school time with its regular hour and alternate work and play often become in vacation fretful sulky discontented and in arm against the entire world the discipline of work if of a proper kind of a kind in which success be not too long delay be sure and efficacious success if the fruit of one 's own effort be so sweet that one long for more of the work which produce it the reverse of the medal may be see here also the knotted thread which break if pull too impatiently the drop stitch that make rough uneven place in the pattern the sail which be wrongly place and will not propel the boat the pile of withered leaf which be not remove and which the wind scatter over the garden -- be not all these concrete moral lesson in patience accuracy and carefulness we may safely appeal to public opinion sometimes in deal with child the chief object in do this be to create a constantly advance ideal toward which the child be attract and thereby to gain a constantly increase effort on he part to realize this ideal there come a time in the child 's development when he begin to realize he own individuality and long to see it recognize by other the view of life the sentiment of the people about he be clearly note and he desire to so shape he conduct as to be in harmony with they if he see that tale-bearing and cowardice be look upon with disgust by he comrade he will be a very spartan in he laconicism and courage if he father and older brother can bear pain without wince then he will not cry when he hurt himself oftentimes he be obdurate when reprove in private for a fault but when bring to the tribunal of the disapproval of other child he be chagrined repent and make atonement he be uneasy under the adverse verdict of a large company but the condemnation of one person do not weigh with he it be usually not wise however to appeal to public opinion in this way save on a abstract question as the child lose he self-respect and become degrade in he own eye if he fault be trumpet abroad story of brave deed poem of heroism self-sacrifice and loyalty have they place in create a sentiment of ideality in the child 's breast -- a sentiment which remain fixed sometimes even though it be not in harmony with the feeling of the majority now and then some noble soul be bear some hero so thrill with the ideal that he rise far above the public sentiment of he day but usually we count he great who overtop he fellow by a inch or two and he who fall much below the level of ordinary feeling be esteem as almost beyond hope to seek for the approval of other even though they embody we highest ideal be truly not the loftiest form of aspiration but it be one round in the ladder which lead to that higher feeling the desire for the benediction of the spirit-principle within we although discipline by means of fear as the word be commonly use can not be too strongly condemn yet there be a godly fear of which the bible speak which certainly have its place among incentive in will-train the child have not attain as yet and it be doubtful whether we ourselves have do so to that supreme excellence of love which absolutely casteth out fear a writer of great moral insight say : have not the law of seed and flower cause and effect the law of continuity which bind the universe together a tone of severity it have surely like all righteous law and carry with it a legitimate and wholesome fear if we be to reap what we have sow some perhaps most of we may dread the harvest the child shrink from the disapproval of the loved parent or teacher by so much the more as he reverence and respect those in authority over he do he dread to do that which he know they would condemn if he have be lead to expect natural retribution he will have a wholesome fear of put he hand in the fire since he know the inevitable consequence he understand that it be folly to expect that wrong can be do with impunity and shrink in terror from commit a sin whose consequence it be impossible that he should escape he know well that there be other punishment save those of the body and he have feel the anguish which follow self-condemnation there be nothing degrading in such fear but a heart-searching reverence and awe in the sincere and humble conviction that god 's law be everywhere such be some of the false and some of the true motive which can be appeal to in will-training but there be various point in they practical application which may well be consider may we not question whether we be not frequently too exact with child -- too much give to fault-finding be it not that the business of play be so engrossing to they and life so fascinating a matter on the whole -- be it not for these qualify circumstance we should harass many of they into dark cynicism and misanthropy at a very early age i marvel at the scrupulous exactness in regard to truth the fine sense of distinction between right and wrong which we require of a unfledged human being who would be puzzle to explain to we the difference between a hawk and a handsaw who live in the realm of the imagination and whose view of the world be that of a great play-house furnish for he benefit if we be one half as punctilious and as hypercritical in we judgment of ourselves we should be find guilty in short order and sentence to hard labor on a vast number of count there be many comparatively small fault in child which it be wise not to see at all they be mere temporary failing tiny drop which will evaporate if quietly leave in the sunshine but which if oppose will gather strength for a formidable current if we would sometimes apply tolstous 's doctrine of non-resistance to child if we would overlook the small transgression and quietly supply another vent for the troublesome activity there would be less clash of will and less raising of a evil spirit which gain wonderful strength while in action do we not often use a arbitrary and a threatening manner in we command to child when a calm gentle request in a tone of expectant confidence would gain obedience far more quickly and pleasantly some nature be antagonize by the shadow of a threat even if it accompany a reasonable order and if we acknowledge that the oil of courtesy be a valuable lubricator in we dealings with grown people it seem proper to suppose that it would not be entirely useless with child we can not expect to get from they what we do not give ourselves and it be idle to imagine that we can address they as we would a disobedient dog and be answer in tone of dulcet harmony again what possible harm can there be in sometimes give reason for command when they be such as the child would appreciate we do not desire to bring he up under martial rule and if he feel the wisdom of the order issue he will be much more likely to obey it pleasantly case may frequently occur in which reason either could not properly be give or would be beyond the child 's power of comprehension but if we treatment of he have be uniformly frank and affectionate he will cheerfully obey believe that as we command have be reasonable heretofore there be good cause to suppose they may still be so educational opinion tend more and more every day to the absolute conviction that the natural punishment the effect which follow the cause be the only one which can safely be use with child this be the method of nature severe and unrelenting it may be but calm firm and purely just he who sow the wind must reap the whirlwind and he who sow thistle may be well assure that he will never gather fig as he harvest the feeling of continuity of sequence be naturally strong in the child and if we would lead he to appreciate that the law be as absolute in the moral as in the physical world we shall find the ground already prepare for we purpose much transgression of moral law in later year be due to the fatal hope in the evil-doer 's mind that he will be able to escape the consequence of he sin could we make it clear from the beginning of life that there be no such escape that the mill of the god will grind at last though the hopper stand empty for many a year -- could we make this a absolute conviction of the mind i be assure that it would greatly tend to lessen crime and this be one of the defect of arbitrary punishment that it be sometimes withhold when the heart of the judge melt over the sinner lead he to expect other possible exemption in the future be it not sometimes give in anger also when the culprit clearly see it to be disproportionate to the crime here appear the advantage of the natural punishment -- it be never withhold in weak affection it be never give in anger it be entirely disassociate from personal feeling no poison arrow of injustice remain rankle in the child 's breast no rebellious feeling that the parent have take advantage of he superior strength to inflict the punishment : it be perceive to be absolutely _ fair _ and be fair it must be although painful yet satisfactory to that sense of justice which be a passion of childhood we american child be as precocious in will-power as they be keen-witted and they need a special discipline the courage activity and pioneer spirit of the father exercise in hew they way through virgin forest hunting wild beast in mountain solitude open up undeveloped land prospect for metal through trackless plain choose they own vocation help to govern they country -- all these thing have react upon the child and they be thoroughly independent feel the need of care for themselves when hardly able to toddle entrust this precocious bundle of nerve and individuality to a person of weak will or feeble intelligence and the child promptly become he ruler the power of strong volition become caprice he do not learn the habit of obedience and thus valuable directive power be lose to the world the lowest class of society say dr harri be the lowest not because there be any organize conspiracy to keep they down but because they be lack in directive power the jail the prison the reformatory be fill with man who be there because they be weak more than because they be evil if the right discipline in home and school have be give they they would never have become the charge of the nation thus we waste force constantly force of mind and of spirit sufficient to move mountain because we do not insist that every child shall exercise he inherit right which be that he be teach to obey it be a grave subject this of will-train the gravest perhaps that we can consider and its deepest water lie far below the sound of my plummet some of the principle however on which it rest be as firmly fix as the bed of the ocean which remain changeless though the wave continually shift above : -- 1 if we can but cultivate the _ habit _ of do right we enlist in we service one of the strongest of human agency its momentum be so great that it may propel the child into the course of duty before he have time to discuss the question or to parley with he conscience concern it 2 we must remember that force of character be cumulative and all the foregone day of virtue work they health into this the task need not be begin afresh each morning yesterday 's stroke be still there and to-day 's effort will make the carve deeper and bolder 3 we may compel the body to carry out a order the finger to perform a task but this be mere slavish compliance true obedience can never be enforce it be the fruit of the reason and the will the free glad offering of the spirit 4 though many motive have they place in early will-training -- love of approval deference to public opinion the influence of beauty hopeful occupation respect and rev for those in authority -- yet these be all preparatory the preliminary exercise which must be well practice before the soul can spread she wing into the blue 5 there be but one true and final motive to good conduct and that be a hunger in the soul of man for the blessing of the spirit a ceaseless longing to be in perfect harmony with the principle of everlasting and

the wild beast wary but if the day have be a fortunate one if he own stomach be fill and he body sheltered little care he whether long-haired savage number two be hungry and cold every one for himself

at all other time have slip away and when savage be turn into herdsman and farmer and toolmaker to what leader among man do a system of exchange of commodity for mutual convenience suggest itself one would like to have meet that paint savage who first suggest combination in warfare or that later politico-economist upon whom it faintly dawn that mutual help be possible in other direction save that of blood-shedding a union bear of the exigency of warfare would be strengthen later by the prompting of self-interest and lo the experiment be no longer a experiment and the fact be prove that man may fight and work together to they mutual profit and advancement ` tis a simple proposition after all that ten time one be ten and the bee the ant the grosbeak and the beaver prove it so clearly that any one of we may read though we pass by never so quickly yet all great truth appear in man 's mind in very rudimentary form at first and each successive generation furnish more favorable soil for they growth and development first man join hand in offensive and defensive alliance second they find that even when war be over still communication intercourse and exchange of goods be desirable third they discover that no great enterprise which would better they condition would be possible without coperation and fourth they begin to band themselves together here and there not only for they own protection for they own gain but to watch over the weak to succor the defenseless and even to uphold some dear belief the magic of together have thus far reach and who can tell what happy valley what fair land of beulah it may summon into existence in the future the incalculable value of coperation the solemn truth that we be member one of another that we can not labor for ourselves without labor for other nor injure ourselves without injure other -- all this be intellectually appreciate by most man to-day all this be doubtless acknowledge yet i can not find that it have obtain much recognition in education nor be especially insist upon in the training of child but surely if child have any social tendency -- and the fact need no proof -- these tendency should be give direction from the beginning toward benevolence toward harmonious work together for some common aim this would be comparatively easy even in a nursery contain three or four little people and how much simpler when school life begin and when the power of child be greatly increase while they be in hourly contact with a large number of equal society as dr hale say be the great charm and only value of school life but this charm and this value be reduce to a minimum in many school emulation that devil-shadow of aspiration so often use as a stimulus in education must forever separate the child from he fellow how can i have any christian fellowship with a man when i be envy he he success and grudging he he honor be i not tempt to withhold my help from my weak brother across the way lest my assistance place he on a equality with I again the monitor system as sometimes carry out tend to separation and engender dislike and distrust i be not likely to desire close communion except in the way of fisticuffs with a boy who have be spy upon I all day or who have very likely report I as have commit diver venial offens it be the idea of some teacher that discipline be further if child be train to have as little as possible to do with each other and there be no question that this method do facilitate a toe-the-line kind of government it would probably be more satisfactory to such a teacher if each child could be bring to school in a sedan-chair with only one window and that in front and could be keep in it during the whole session as such a plan however be scarcely feasible as child with or against we will have a natural and god-given instinct for each other 's company as they keenly enjoy banding themselves together for whatever purpose should not education follow the suggestion which a earnest study of child-nature can but give froebel with those divinely curious eye of he saw deeper into the child 's mind and heart than any of he predecessor and for every faint stir of life which he perceive provide adequate condition of development true prophet of the coming day he philosophy be rich with suggestion for the cultivation of the social power of the child no one ever feel more keenly than he the inseparable the organic connection of all life and with deep spiritual insight he provide nursery play and song by which the babe even in he mother 's arm may be lead faintly to recognize in he be one of the link of the great chain which girdle the universe later when as a child of three or four year he make he first step into the world and loose he mother 's hand enter a larger family of child of he own age he be still lead to feel himself a part of a vast union each member of which have minister to he and numberless way be open by which he can join with other to give back to the world some of the benefit he have enjoy story be tell and game be play which lead he to thank the kindly hand which have furnish he daily bread he warm clothing and he sweet white bed at night the feeling of gratitude grow and strengthen must overflow in action the world have do so much for he what can he do for the world be there not some little invalid who would greatly prize a book of dainty picture embroidered draw and paint by she child-friend then he will join with he companion and patiently and lovingly fashion such a book be the class room somewhat bare and colorless then he can give up some of he cherish work to make a bright frieze about the wall a national holiday be perhaps approach he will unite with all the other baby in make flag tri-colored chain and rosette to deck the room appropriately and to please the mother father and friend who be come to celebrate the occasion one of the greatest pleasure which be offer be that of be allow to help somebody if a child be quick neat and careful if he have finish he bit of work he may go and help the baby and very gently and very patiently he guide the chubby finger thread the needle or tie on little cap and conquer refractory button to be a little helper whether he be assist he companion or the grown-up people about he grow to seem the highest honor within he reach he know the joy of minister unto other and he feel that to help be to do the work of the world thus we endeavor to give external expression to the feeling stir in the heart of the child know that even love can grow cold if not nourish the whole spirit of the work if carry out as froebel intend must tend directly toward social evolution and the intense personalism which be a distinguishing mark of we civilization and be clearly see in we child need anoint with the oil of altruism the circle in which the child stand for the singing be itself a perfect representation of unity hand be join to make a round and lovely ring if any child be unkind or regardless of the rights of other it be easily see that he not only make himself unhappy but seriously mar the pleasure of all the other child if he willfully leave the circle a link in the chain be break which can only be mend when he repent he folly and pleasantly return to he place thus early he may be make to feel that all life touch he own and that he indulgence in selfish passion not only harm himself but be the more blameworthy in that it injure other the song and game can not be happily carry on unless each child be not only willing to help but willing also to give up he chief desire now and then all the child would like to be the flower in the garden perhaps but it be obvious that some must remain in the circle in order that the fence be perfect and prevent stray animal from destroy what we love and cherish so there be constant surrender of personal desire in recognition of the fact that other have equal rights and that after all one part be as good as another since all be essential to the whole in coperative build the child quickly see that the symmetrical figure which four little one have make together unite they material be infinitely larger and finer than any one of they could have make alone if they be make a village at they little table one build the church another workshop and store other school and house while the remainder make road lay out garden plant tree and plough the field no one of the child have strength enough time enough or material enough to build the village alone yet see how well and how quickly it be do when we all help the sand-box in which of course all child delight lend itself especially to coperative exercise they gather around it and plant garden with the bright-colored ball they use it for geography mould the hill mountain valley and trace the river near they home they arrange historical drama as paul revere 's ride or the landing of the pilgrim : but no child do any one of these thing alone there be constant and happy coperation it be the aim of one day 's exercise perhaps to retrace with the child the various step by which he comfortable chair and he strong work-table have come to he across one end of the sand-box a group of child plant a forest with little pine branch which they have bring the wood-cutter come fall the tree and cut away the bough another party of child bring the heavy team previously build from the play-material harness in the horse -lrb- take from a noah 's ark -rrb- and prepare to carry off the log now here come the road-maker and they lay out a smooth hard road for the team reach to the very bank of the river which another party of little one have make the log be tumble into the stream they float downward be raft carry to the mill little stick be furnish to represent the board into which they be sawn and the lumber be take to the cabinet-maker that he may fashion we furniture though there be twenty child around the sand-box yet all have be employ each have enjoy he own work yet appreciate the value of he neighbor 's they have work together harmoniously and the do have react upon the heart and strengthen the feeling of unity which be grow within such exercise can not fail to teach the value and power of social effort and the necessity of subordinate personal desire to the common good yet the development of individuality be not forget for we power as individual depend upon we recognition of the rights of other it be true that the social problem be a intricate one and can not be work out even partially at any stage of education unless the leader of the child be a true leader and be enthusiastically convince of the essential value of the principle on which the problem be base yet this might be say with equal truth of any educational aim for the gospel must always have its interpreter and some will ever give a more spiritual reading and seize the truth which be only half express while other dull-eyed mechanical kill with the letter after all say dr stanley hall there be nothing so practical in education as the ideal nor so ideal as the practical and we may be assure that the direction of the social tendency of the child toward high and noble aim toward the sinking of self and the generous thought of other -- that this be not only ideal not only a follow after the purest light yet vouchsafe to we but be at the same time practical in its detailed workings and in its adaptation to the need and desire of the day the relation of the kindergarten to the public school the nature of a educational system be determine by the manner in which it be begin the question for we to decide to-day be not how we can interest people in and how illustrate the true kindergarten for that be already do to a considerable extent but how we can convince school board superintendent and voter that the final introduction of the kindergarten into the public school system be a thing greatly to be desire the kindergarten and the school now two distinct dissimilar and sometimes though of late very seldom antagonistic institution -- how will the one affect or be affect by the other as to the final adoption of the kindergarten there be a preliminary question which go straight to the root of the whole matter at present the state accept the responsibility of educate child after a arbitrarily fix age have be reach ought it not rather if it assume the responsibility at all to begin to educate the child when he _ need education _ thoughtful people be now awake to the fact that this regulation be a artificial not a natural one and that we have be waste two precious year which might not only be put to valuable use but would so shape and influence after-teaching that every succeed step would be take with greater ease and profit we have be discreet in omit the begin so long as we do not feel sure how to begin but we know now that froebel 's method of deal with four or five year old baby when use by a discreet and intelligent person justify we in take this delicate debatable ground so far then it be a question of law -- a law which can be modify just as soon and as sensibly as the people wish before however that modification can become the active wish of the people its importance must be understand and its effect estimate could it be show that after-education will be hinder or in any way render more difficult by the kindergarten clearly all effort to introduce it must cease be it merely a matter of indifference something that would neither make nor mar the after-work of school then it would remain a matter of choice or fancy for individual parent to decide as they like but if it can be show that the work of the kindergarten will lay a more solid foundation or trace more direct path for the worker of a later period then it behoove we to give it a hearty welcome and to work out its principle with zealous good will : and work out its principle mean _ not _ accept it as a finality -- a piece of flawless perfection -- but as a stepping-stone which will lead we nearer to the truth if it be a good thing it be good for all if it be truth we want it everywhere but if this new department of education and training be to gain ground or accomplish the successful fruition of its wish there must be perfect unity among teacher concern it if they all understand the thing itself and understand each other there could be no lack of sympathy yet there have be misunderstand conflict occasionally and some otherwise worthy teacher have use the kindergarten as a sort of intellectual cuttle-fish to sharpen they conversational bill upon of course i be not blind to the fact that after we have determine that we ought to have the kindergarten there be many question of expediency : suitable room expense of material salary assistant age of child at entrance system of government number of child in one kindergarten and greatest of all but least thought of strangely the link together of kindergarten and school so that the development shall be continuous and the chain of impression perfect and unbroken suffice it to say that it have be do and can be do again but it need discretion forethought tact earnestness and unimpeachable honesty of administration for unless we can depend upon we school board and kindergartner _ implicitly _ count upon they for wise coperation brooding care and great wisdom in selection of teacher the experiment will be a failure we have risk enough to run as it be let we not permit we little one more susceptible by reason of age than any we have to deal with now -- let we not permit they to become victim of politics ring or machine teaching the kindergarten be more liable to abuse than any other department of teaching there be no ground in the universe so sacred as this but the difference between primary school be just as great only unfortunately we have become use to it and the kindergarten be under fire so to speak must be absolutely ideal in its perfection or it be ruthlessly hold up to scorn there be a tremendous awaken all over the country with regard to kindergarten and primary work and this be well since the greatest and most fatal mistake of the public school system have be make _ just here _ and the time be surely come when more knowledge wisdom tact ingenuity forethought yes and money will be expend in order to meet the demand of the case the time be come when the imp of parsimony will no longer be mistake for the spirit of economy when a woman possess of ordinary human frailty will no longer be require to guide direct develop train help love and be patient with sixty little one just begin to tread the difficult path of learning and each receive just one sixtieth of what he crave the millennium will be close at hand when we cease to expect from girl just out of the high school what socrate never attempt and would have deem impossible look at senator stanford 's famous palo alto stock farm each colt bear into that favor community be place in a class of twelve these twelve colt be care for and teach by four or five trained teacher no man interest in the training of fine horse ever object so far as i know to such expenditure of labor and money the end be suppose to justify the means but when the creature to be train be human being and when the end to be reach be not race-horses but merely citizen we employ a very different process of reasoning that this subject of early training be a vitally interesting one to think people can not be deny the kindergarten have become the fashion you say cynically this be scarcely true but it be a fact that the upper the middle and the lower class among we begin to recognize the existence of child under six year of age and realize that far from be nonentity in life or unknown quantity they be very lively unit in the sum of progressive education when we speak of kindergarten work among the child of the poor and argue its claim as one of the best means of take unfortunate little arab from the demoralizing life of the street and of give they aimless hand something useful to do they restless mind something good and fruitful to think of and they curious eye something beautiful to look on there be not a word of disapproval people seem willing to concede its moral value when apply to the lower class but when they be oblige to pay anything to procure this training for they own child or see any prospect of what they call a already extravagant school system make more so by its addition they become prolific in doubt in other word they believe in it when you call it _ philanthropy _ but not when you call it _ education _ and it must be call the germ of the better education toward which we be all struggle the nearest approach to the perfect beginning which we have yet find we see in the excellence of froebel 's idea educationally consider its only claim to peculiar power in deal with incipient hoodlumism it be only because it have such unusual fitness to child-nature such a store of philosophy and ingenuity in its appliance and such a wealth of spiritual truth in its aim and method that it be so great a power with neglect child and ignorant and vicious parent the principle on which froebel build he educational idea may be sum up briefly under four head first all the faculty of the child be to be draw out and exercise as far as age allow second the power of habit and association which be the great instrument of all education of the whole training of life must be develop with a systematic purpose from the earliest dawn of intelligence third the active instinct of childhood be to be cultivate through manual exercise -lrb- chiefly creative in character -rrb- which be make a essential part of the training and this manual exercise be to be value chiefly as a means of self-expression fourth the sens be to be train to accuracy as well as the hand the child must learn how to observe what be place before he and to observe it truly a acquirement which any teacher of science or art will appreciate to work out these principle froebel devise he practical method of infant education and the very name he give to the place where he play lesson be to be use mark he purpose no book be to be see in a kindergarten because no idea or fact be present to the child that he can not clearly understand and verify the object be not to teach he arithmetic or geometry though he learn enough of both to be very useful to he hereafter but to lead he to discover _ truth _ concern form and number line and angle for himself thus in the play-lesson the teacher simply rule the order in which the child shall approach a new thing and give he the correct name which henceforth he must always use but the observation of resemblance and difference -lrb- that groundwork of all knowledge -rrb- the reasoning from one point to another and the conclusion he arrive at be all he own he be only lead to see he mistake if he make one the child handle every object from which he be teach and learn to reproduce it it be not enough to say that any ordinary system of object teaching in the hand of a ingenious teacher will serve the purpose or take the place of the kindergarten people who say this evidently have no conception of froebel 's plan in which the simultaneous training of head heart and hand be the most striking characteristic the kindergarten be mainly distinguish from the later instruction of the school by make the knowledge of fact and the cultivation of the memory subordinate to the development of observation and to the appropriate activity of the child physical mental and moral its aim be to utilize the now almost waste time from four to six year a time when all negligent and ignorant mother leave the child to chance development and when the most careful mother can not train she child into the practice of social virtue so well as the truly wise kindergartner who work with she we learn through do be the watchword of the kindergarten but it must be a _ do _ which blossom into _ be _ or it do not fulfill its ideal for it be character building which be to go on in the kindergarten or it have miss froebel 's aim what do the kindergarten do for child under six year of age what have it accomplish when it send the child to the primary school i do not mean what froebel hope could be do or what be occasionally accomplish with bright child and a gifted teacher or even what be do in good private kindergarten for that be yet more but i mean what be actually do for child by charitable organization which be really do the work of the state i think they can claim tangible result which be wholly remarkable and yet they do not work for result or expect much visible fruit in these tender year from a culture which be so natural child-like and unobtrusive that its very outward simplicity have cause it to be regard as a plaything in glance over the acquirement of the child who have leave the kindergarten and have be actually _ teach _ nothing in the ordinary acceptation of the word we find that he have work experiment invent compare reproduce all thing have be reveal in the do and productive activity have enlighten and develop the mind first as to arithmetic it do not come first but though you speak with the tongue of man and angel and make not mention of arithmetic it profiteth you nothing the first gift show one object and the child get a idea of one whole in the second they receive three whole object again but of different form in the third and fourth the regularly divide cube be see and all possible combination of number as far as eight be make in the fifth gift the child see three and its multiple in fraction half quarter eighth third ninth and twenty-seventh with the sixth seventh and eighth gift the field be practically unlimited second as to the child 's knowledge of form size and proportion he development have be quite extensive : he know not always by name but by they characteristic vertical horizontal slanting and curved line square oblong equal side blunt and sharp angled triangle five six seven and eight side figure sphere cylinder cube and prism all this elementary geometry have of course be learn baby fashion in a purely experimental way but nothing will have to be unlearned when the pupil approach geometry later in a more thoroughly scientific spirit third as to the cultivation of language of the power of expression we can not speak with too much emphasis the vocabulary of the kindergarten child of the lower class be probably greater than that of he mother or father you can see how this come about the teacher themselves be oblige to make a study of simple appropriate expressive and explicit language the child be lead to express all he thought freely in proper word from the moment he can lisp he be train through singing to distinct and careful enunciation and the result be a remarkably good power of language i make haste to say that this need not necessarily be use for the purpose of chatter in the school the child have not of course learn to read and write but read be greatly simplify by he accurate power of observation and he practice of compare form the work of reading be play to a child whose eye have be thus train as to write we precede it by draw which be the sensible and natural plan the child will have have a good deal of practice with slate and lead pencil will have draw all sort of line and figure from dictation and have create numberless design of he own if in short we child could spend two year in a good kindergarten they would not only bring to the school those element of knowledge which be require but would have learn in some degree how to _ learn _ and in the measure of they progress _ have nothing to unlearn _ let those who labor day by day with inert mind never yet awaken to a wish for knowledge a sense of beauty or a feeling of pleasure in mental activity tell we how much valuable school time they would save if the raw material be thus prepare to they hand after spend five or six year at home or in the street without training or discipline the child be send to school and be expect to learn at once he look upon the strange new life with amazement yet without understand finally he mind become familiar in a mechanical manner ill-suited to the taste of a child with the work and exercise of primary instruction the consequence be very often a feeble body and a stuff mind the stuff have very little more effect upon the intellect than it have upon the organism of a roast turkey the kindergarten can remedy these intellectual difficulty beside give the child a impulse toward moral self-direction and a capacity for work out he original idea in visible and permanent form which will make he almost a new creature it can by take the child in season set the wheel in motion rouse all he best finest and highest instinct the purest noblest and most vivifying power of which he be possess there be a good deal of time spend in the kindergarten on the cultivation of politeness and courtesy and in the entirely social atmosphere which be one of its principal feature the amenity of polite society can be better practice than elsewhere the kindergarten aim in no way at make infant prodigy but it aim successfully at put the little child in possession of every faculty he be capable of use at bring he forward on line he will never need to forsake at teaching within he narrow range what he will never have to unlearn and at give he the wish to learn and the power of teaching himself its deep simplicity should always be maintain and no lover of childhood or thoughtful teacher would wish it otherwise it be more important that it should be keep pure than that it should become popular i have try thus somewhat at length to demonstrate that we educational system can not be perfect until we begin still earlier with the child and begin in a more childlike manner though at the same time earnestly and with definite purpose in try to make manhood and womanhood we sometimes treat child as little man and woman not realize that the most perfect childhood be the best basis for strong manhood further i have try to show that froebel 's system give we the only rational beginning but i confess frankly that to make it productive of its vaunted result it must be place in the hand of thoroughly train kindergartner fit by nature and by education for they most delicate exacting and sacred profession now as to compromise the question be frequently ask can not the best thing of the kindergarten be introduce in the primary department of the public school the best thing of kindergartening be the kindergarten itself and nothing else will do it would be necessary to make very material change in the primary class which be to include a kindergarten -- change that be demand by radically different method the kindergarten should offer the child experience instead of instruction life instead of learn practical child-life a miniature world where he live and grow and learn and expand no primary teacher be she minerva herself can work out froebel 's idea successfully with sixty or seventy child under she sole care you will see for yourselve that this simple natural motherly instruction of babyhood can not be transplant bodily into the primary school where the teacher have fifty or sixty child who be beyond the two most fruitful year which the kindergarten demand besides the teacher of the lower grade can not introduce more than a infinitesimal number of kindergarten exercise and at the same time keep up they full routine of primary study and exercise any one who understand the double need of the kindergarten and primary school can not fail to see this matter correctly and as i say before we do not want a few kindergarten exercise we want the _ kindergarten _ if teacher be all indoctrinate with the spirit of froebel 's method they would carry on its principle in deal with pupil of any age but froebel 's kindergarten pure and simple create a place for child of four or five year to begin they bit of life-work it be in no sense a school nor must become so or it would lose its very essence and truest mean let I show you a kindergarten it be no more interesting than a good school but i want you to see the essential point of difference : -- it be a golden morning a rare one in a long rainy winter as we turn into the narrow quiet street from the broader noisy one the sound of a bell warn we that we be near the kindergarten build a few belated youngster be hurry along -- some ragged some patch some plainly and neatly clothe some finish a portable breakfast thrust into they hand five minute before but all eager to be there while the lilliputian army be wend they way from the yard to they various room we will enter the front door and look about a little the window be wide open at one end of the great room the wall be tint with terra cotta and the woodwork be paint in indian red above the high wood dado run a row of illuminated picture of animal -- duck pigeon peacock calf lamb colt and almost everything else that go upon two or four foot so that the child can by simply turn in they seat stroke the head of they dumb friend of the meadow and barnyard there be a great quantity of bright and appropriate picture on the wall three window full of plant a canary chirping in a gilded cage a globe of gold-fish a open piano and a old-fashioned sofa which be at present adorn with a small scrap of a boy who clutch a large slate in one hand and a mammoth lunch-pail in the other it be he first day and he look as if he big brother have tell he that he would be wallop if he so much as wink a half-dozen charming girl be flutter about charming because whether plain or beautiful they all look happy earnest womanly full to the brim of life a sweet heart-lifting cheerfulness like spring-time of the year seem ever on they step to wait they be tie on white apron and prepare the day 's occupation for they be a detachment of student from a kindergarten training school and be on duty for the day one of they seat herself at the piano and play a stir march the army enter each tiny soldier with a shine morning face unhappy home be forget smile everywhere everybody glad to see everybody else happy child happy teacher sunshiny morning sunshiny heart delightful work in prospect merry play to follow it oh it be a beautiful world and i be glad i be in it so the bright face seem to say it be a cosmopolitan regiment that march into the free kindergarten of we large city curly yellow hair and rosy cheek sleek blonde braid and calm blue eye swarthy face and blue-black curl woolly little pow and thick lip long arched nose and broad flat one here you see the fire and passion of the southern race and the self-poise serenity and sturdiness of northern nation pat be here with a gleam of humor in he eye topsy all smile and tooth abraham trading top with isaac next in line gretchen and han phlegmatic and dependable franois never still for a instant christina rosy calm and conscientious and duncan as canny and prudent as any of he people pietro be there and olaf and little john bull what a opportunity for amalgamation of race and for lay the foundation of american citizenship for the purely social atmosphere of the kindergarten make it a life-school where each tiny citizen have full liberty under the law of love so long as he do not interfere with the liberty of he neighbor the phrase every man for himself be never hear but we be member one of another be the common principle of action the circle be form every pair of hand be fold and bright eye be tightly close to keep out the world the flesh and the rest of it while child and teacher sing one of the morning hymn : -- bird and bee and flower every happy day wake to greet the sunshine thankful for its ray all the night they be silent sleep safe and warm god who know and love they will keep they from all harm so the little child sleep all the night wake with each new morning fresh and sweet and bright thank god they father for he loving care with they song and praise they make the day more fair then come a trio of good-morning song with cordial handshake and score of kiss waft from finger-tips good-morning merry sunshine follow and the sun encourage by have some notice take of he in this blind and stolid world shine brighter than ever the song thumb and finger say ` good-morning ' bring two thousand finger flutter in the air -lrb- 10 x 200 if the sum seem too difficult -rrb- and give the eagle-eyed kindergartner a opportunity to look for dirty paw and preach the need sermon it be benny 's birthday five year old to-day he choose the song he like best and the child sing they with friendly energy three cheer for benny -- only three now say the kindergartner they be give with a enthusiasm that bring the neighbor to the window and benny burst with pride blush to the root of he hair the child stop at three however and have let off a tremendous amount of steam in the operation any wholesome device which accomplish this result be worthy of be perpetuate a draggled forsake little street-cat sneak in the door with a pitiful mew -lrb- i be sure i do not wonder if one be tire of life this would be just the place to take a fresh start -rrb- the child break into the song i love little pussy she coat be so warm and the kindergartner ask the small boy with the great lunch pail if he would not like to give the kitty a bit of something to eat he comply with the utmost solemnity think this the queerest community he ever see a broken-winged pigeon appear on the window-sill and receive he morning crumb and now a chord from the piano announce a change of program the child troop to they respective room fairly warm through with happiness and good will such a pleasant morning start to some who have be hustle out of a bed that hold several too many in the night wash a trifle -lrb- perhaps -rrb- and send off without a kiss with the echo of a sick mother 's wail or a father 's oath ring in they ear after a few minute of cheerful preparation all be busily at work two division have go into tiny quiet room to grapple with the intricacy of mathematical relation a small boy clad mostly in red woolen suspenders and large high-topped boot be pass box of block he be awkward and slow the teacher could do it more quietly and more quickly but the kindergarten be a school of experience where ease come by and by as the lovely result of repeat practice we hear a informal talk on fraction while the cube be divide into its component part and then see a building exercise by direction in the other quiet room they be build a village each child construct accord to he own idea the part assign he one of they start a song and they all join in -- oh builder we would like to be so willing skilled and strong and while we work so cheerily the time will not seem long if we all do we part well the whole be sure to be beautiful say the teacher one rickety badly make building will spoil we village i be go to draw a blackboard picture of the child who live in the village johnny you have not block enough for a good factory and jennie have not enough for hers why do not you club together and make a very large fine one this work for a common purpose yet with due respect for individuality be a very important part of kindergarten ethic thus each child learn to subordinate himself to the claim and need of society without lose himself no man liveth to himself be the underlie principle of action come back to the main room we find one division weave bright paper strip into a mat of contrast color and note that the occupation train the sense of color and of number and develop dexterity in both hand but what be this merry group do in the farther corner these be the baby bless they and they be modeling in clay what a inspire version of pat-a-cake and mud pie be this the sleeve be push up show a high-water mark of white arm join little brown paw what fun they be modeling the seal at the cliff house -lrb- for this chance to be a californium kindergarten -rrb- and a couple of two-year-old who have stray into this retreat not because there be any room for they here but because there be not any room for they anywhere else be slapping they lump of clay with all they might and then roll it into caterpillar and snake this last be not very educational you say but virtue kindle at the touch of joy and some lasting good must be bear out of the rational happiness that surround even the youngest baby in the kindergarten the sand-table in this room represent a italian or chinese vegetable garden the child have roll and level the surface and lay it off in square bed with walk between the planting have be make believe -- a different kind of seed in each bed but the child have name they all and label the various plat with piece of paper fasten in cleft stick a gardener 's house make of block ornament one corner and near it be he tool -- watering-pot hoe rake spade etc all make in cardboard modeling we now pass up-stair in one corner a family of twenty child be lay design in shine ring of steel and as the graceful curve multiply beneath they clever finger the kindergartner be tell they a brief story of a little boy who make with these very ring a design for a beautiful rise window which be copy in stain glass and hang in a great stone church of which he father be the architect another group of child be folding by dictation a four-inch square of color paper the most perfect eye-measure as well as the most delicate touch be need here constant reference to the sharp angle blunt angle square corner and right angle horizontal and vertical line show that the foundation be be lay for a future clear and practical knowledge of geometry though the word itself be never mention there be one unhappy little boy in this class he have break the law in some way and he have no work that be a strange idea say the woman visitor in my time work be give to we as a punishment and it seem a most excellent plan we look at it in another way say the kindergartner smile you see work be really the great panacea the best thing in the world we be always try to train the child to a love of industry and helpful occupation so we give work as a reward and take it away as a punishment we pass into the sunny upper hall and find some child surround a large sand-table the exercise be just finish and we gaze upon a miniature representation of the cliff house embankment and curve road a section of beach with people stand -lrb- wooden lady and gentleman from a noah 's ark -rrb- a section of ocean and a perfect seal rock make of clay run down-stairs timmy please and ask miss ellen if the seal be ready timmy fly presently the baby troop up each carry a precious seal extend on two tiny hand or repose in apron they be all burst with importance of course the small jonah of the flock tumble up the stair bump he nose and break he treasure there be a agonize wail _ i bust my seal _ some one spring to the rescue the seal be patch tear be dry and harmony be restore the animal be pile on the rock in realistic confusion and another class come out with twenty-five paper fish to be arrange in the wave of sand later on the sound of a piano invite we to witness the kindergarten play-time through kindergarten play the child come to know the external world the physical quality of the object which surround he they motion action and reaction upon each other and the relation of these phenomenon to himself a knowledge which form the basis of that which will be he permanent stock in life the child 's fancy be healthily feed by image from outer life and he curiosity by new glimpse of knowledge from the world around he there be play and play the ordinary unguided game of childhood be not to be confound for a instant with the genuine kindergarten play which have a far deeper significance than be apparent to the superficial observer take the simplest circle game it illustrate the whole duty of a good citizen in a republic anybody can spoil it yet nobody can play it alone anybody can hinder its success yet no one can get credit for make it succeed the play be over the child march back to they seat and settle themselves to another period of work which will last until noon we watch the bright face cheerful friendly chatter the busy figure hover over pleasant task and feel that it have be good to pass a morning in this republic of childhood i have give you but a tithe of the whole argument the veriest bird 's - eye view neither be it romance it be simple truth and that be the case how can we afford to keep froebel and he wonderful influence on childhood out of a system of free education which have for its aim the development of a free useful liberty-loving self-governing people it be too great a factor to be disregard and the come year will prove it so for the value of such school be no longer a matter of theory they have be test by experience and have win favor wherever they have be give a fair trial but how important a work they have to do in we scheme of public education be clear only when we consider the condition which we public school must meet nowadays on the theory upon which the state undertake the education of its youth at all -- the necessity of prepare they for intelligent citizenship -- a community might better economize if economize it must anywhere else than on the begin a enormous immigrant population be press upon we the kindergarten reach this class with great power and increase the insufficient education within the reach of the child who must leave school for work at the age of thirteen or fourteen it increase it too by a kind of training which the child get from no other schooling and bring he under influence which be no small addition to the sum total of good in he life the entire pedagogical world watch with interest the educational awakening of which the kindergarten have be the dawn if people really want to make the experiment if parent and tax-payer be anxious to have for they younger child what seem so beneficent a training then let they accept no compromise but after take the child at a proper age see to it that they get pure kindergarten true kindergarten and _ nothing _ but kindergarten till they enter the primary school then they will be prepare for study and begin it with infinite zest because they comprehend its meaning have have that beautiful beginning every later step will seem glad to the child he will not see knowledge through a glass darkly but face to face in she most charming aspect other people 's child where be thy brother abel we will suppose for the sake of argument that the rights of we own child be secure but though such security betoken a admirable state of affair it do not cover the whole ground there be always the other people 's child the still small voice be forever say where be thy brother abel there be many matter to be settle with regard to this brother abel and we differ considerably as to the exact degree of we responsibility towards he some people believe in give he the full privilege of brotherhood in share alike with he in every particular and other insist that he be no brother of theirs at all let the nationalist and socialist and all the other reformer decide this vexed question as best they can particularly with regard to the grown-up abel meanwhile there be a few sweet and wholesome service we can render to the brother abel who be not big enough to be nationalist and socialist nor strong enough to fight for they own rights among these kindly office to be render these practical agency for make abel a happy self-helpful and consequently a better little brother we may surely count the free kindergarten my mind convince I that the kindergarten idea be true not a perfect thing as yet but something on the road to perfection something full of vitality and power to grow and my heart tell I that there be no more beautiful or encouraging work in the universe than this of take hold of the unclaimed baby and give they a bit of motherliness to remember the free kindergarten be the mother of the motherless the father of the fatherless it be the great clean broom that sweep the street of its parentless or worse than parentless child to the increase comfort of the child and to the prodigious advantage of the street we be very much interested in the cleaning of city street and well we may be but up to this day a larger number of man and woman have concern themselves actively about sweep they of dust and dirt than of sweep they free of these child if dirt be misplace matter then what do you call a child who sit eternally on the curbstone and in the gutter of we tenement-house district i believe that since the great teacher of humanity speak those simple word of eternal tenderness that voice the mother side of the divine nature -- suffer little child to come unto I and forbid they not -- i believe that nothing more heartfelt more effectual have come ring down to we through the century than froebel 's inspired and inspiring call come let we live with the child this work _ pay _ in the best and the highest sense as well as the most practical it be true the kindergartner have the child in she care but three or four hour a day it be true in most instance that the home influence be all against she it be true that the very people for whom she be work do not always appreciate she effort it be true that in many case the child have be bear wrong and to accomplish any radical reform she ought to have begin with he grandfather it be true she make failure now and then and have to leave the sorry task seemingly unperformed give into the mighty hand of one who bringeth order out of chaos that which she finite strength have fail to compass she hear discourage word sometimes but they do not make a profound impression when she see the weary yet beautiful day go by bring with they hourly reward greater than speech can testify she see home change slowly but surely under she quiet influence and that of those home missionary the child themselves she get love in full measure where she least expect so radiant a flower to bloom she receive gratitude from some parent far beyond what she be conscious of deserving she see the ancient and respectable dirt-devil be drive from many of the home where he have reign supreme for year she see brutal punishment give place to sweeter method and kinder treatment and she be too happy and too grateful for these and more encouragement to be dishearten by any cynical dissertation on the determination of the world to go wrong and the impossibility of prevent it it be easier in my opinion to raise money for and interest the general man or woman in the free kindergarten than in any other single charity it be always comparatively easy to convince people of a truth but it be much easier to convince they of some truth than of other if you wish to find a library build a hospital establish a diet-kitchen open a bureau for woman 's work you be oblige to argue more or less but if you want money for neglect child you have generally only to state the case everybody agree in the obvious proposition a ounce of prevention -- as the twig be bent -- the child be father to the man -- train up a child -- a stitch in time -- prevention be better than cure -- where the lamb go the flock will follow -- it be easier to form than to reform and so on _ ad infinitum _ -- proverb multiply the advantage of preventive work be so palpable that as soon as you broach the matter you ought to find you case prove and judgment award to the plaintiff before you open you lip to plead the whole matter be crystal clear for happily where the protection of child be concern there be not any free-trade side to the argument we need the public kindergarten educationally as the vestibule to we school work we need it as a philanthropic agent lead the child gently into right habit of thought speech and action from the beginning we need it to help in the absorption and amalgamation of we foreign element for the social training the opportunity for coperation and the purely republican form of government in the kindergarten make it of great value in the development of the citizen-virtue as well as those of the individual i can not help think that if this side of froebel 's educational idea be more insist on throughout we common school system we should be make better citizen and no worse scholar if we believe in the kindergarten if we wish it to become a part of we educational system we have only to let that belief -- that desire -- crystallize into action but we must not leave it for somebody else to do it be clearly every mother 's business and father 's business -- spinster and bachelor be not exempt for they know not in what hour they may be snatch from sweet liberty and deliver into sweeter slavery it be a lawyer 's business for though it will make the world better it will not do it soon enough to lessen litigation in he time it be surely the doctor 's business and the minister 's and that of the business man it be in fact everybody 's business the beauty of this kindergarten subject be its kaleidoscopic character it present like all truth so many side that you can give every one that which he like or be fit to receive take the aggressively self-made man who think we general scheme of education unprofitable -- show he the kindergarten plan of manual training he rub he hand ah that be common sense he say i do not believe in you college -- i never go to college you may count on I give the man of esthetic taste a idea of what the kindergarten do in develop the sense of beauty show he in what way it be a primary art school explain to the musician you feeling about the influence of music show the physical-culture people that in the kindergarten the body have a equal chance with mind and heart tell the great-hearted man some sad incident relate to you by one of you kindergartner and as soon as he can see through he tear show he you subscription book give the woman who can not reason -lrb- and there be such -rrb- a opportunity to feel there be more than one way of imbibe truth fortunately and the brain be not the only avenue to knowledge finally take the utter skeptic into the kindergarten and let the child convert he it commonly be a he by the way the mother-heart of the universe be generally sound on this subject but get money and open kindergarten be not the only care of a kindergarten association at least there be other grave responsibility which no other organization be so well fitted to assume these be the persistent working upon school board until they adopt the kindergarten and much more delicate and difficult the protection of its interest after it be adopt the opening of kindergarten in orphanage and refuge where they prove the most bless instrumentality for good the spreading of such clear knowledge and intelligent insight into the kindergarten as shall prevent it from deterioration the insistence upon kindergartner properly train by properly qualify training teacher the gentle mothering and inspiring and help those kindergartner to realize they fair ideal -lrb- for froebel 's method be a grow thing and she who do not grow with it be a hopeless failure -rrb- the proper equipment and furnishing of class-room so that the public may have good object-lesson before its eye the insistence upon the ultimate ideal of the method as well as upon detail and technicality -- that be show people its soul instead of forever rattle its dry bone and when all be say and do the heaviest of the work fall upon the kindergartner that be why i be convince that we should do everything that sympathy and honor and money can do to exalt the office so that woman of birth breeding culture and genius shall gravitate to it the kindergartner it be who live with the child can make she work a integral part of the neighborhood the center of its best life she it be often who must hold husband to wife and parent to child she it be after all who must interpret the aim of the association and translate its noble theory into practice -lrb- ay and there be the rub -rrb- she it be who must harmonize great ideal principle with real and sometimes sorry condition a kindergarten association stand for certain thing before the community it be the kindergartner alone who can prove the truth who can substantiate the argument who can show the fact there be no more difficult vocation in the universe and no more honorable or sacred one if a kindergartner be look upon or pay or treat as a nursery maid she rank will gradually be recruit from that source the ideal teacher of little child be not bear we have to struggle on as best we can without she she would be bear if we know how to conceive she how to cherish she she need the strength of vulcan and the delicacy of ariel she need a child 's heart a woman 's heart a mother 's heart in one she need clear judgment and ready sympathy strength of will equal elasticity keen insight oversight the buoyancy of hope the serenity of faith the tenderness of patience the hope of the world lie in the child when we be better mother when man be better father there will be better child and a better world the sooner we feel the value of beginning the sooner we realize that we can put bungler and botcher anywhere else better than in nursery kindergarten or primary school -lrb- there be no three place in the universe so big with fate -rrb- the sooner we shall arrive at better result i be afraid it be chiefly woman 's work of course man can be useful in many little way such as give money and get other people to give it in influence legislation interview school board secure building preside over meeting and give a general air of strength and solidity to the undertaking but the chief plot and plan and work out of detail must be do by woman the male genius of humanity beget the idea of which each century have need -lrb- at least it be so say and i have never have the courage to deny it or the time to look it up -rrb- but the female genius i be sure have to work they out and to help be to do the work of the world if one can give money if only a single subscription let she give it if she can give time let she give that if she have no time for absolute work perhaps she have time for the right word speak in due season fail all else there be no woman alive worthy the name who can not give a generous heartthrob a warm hand-clasp a sunny helpful smile a ready tear to a cause that concern itself with childhood as a thank-offering for she own child a pledge for those the hidden future may bring she or a consolation for empty arm there be always time to do the thing that _ ought _ to be that _ must _ be do and for that matter who shall fix the limit to we power of helpfulness it be the unused pump that wheeze if we bounty be dry cross and reluctant it be because we do not continually summon and draw it out but if like the patriarch jacob 's we well be deep it can not be exhaust while we draw upon it it draw upon the unspent spring the hill-side the cloud the air and the sea and the great source of power must itself suspend and be bankrupt before ours can fail the kindergarten be not for the poor child alone a charity neither be it for the rich child alone a luxury corrective or antidote but the idea of which it try to be the expression be the proper atmosphere for every child it be a promise of health happiness and usefulness to many a unfortunate little waif whose earthly inheritance be utter blackness and whose moral blight can be outgrow and succeed by a development of intelligence and love of virtue the child of poverty and vice have still within he however overlay by the sin of ancestry a germ of good that be capable of growth if reach in time let we stretch out a tender strong hand and touch that poor germ of good lifting its feeble head in a wilderness of evil help it to live and thrive and grow end of project gutenberg 's child 's rights
