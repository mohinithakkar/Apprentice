very critical period the general diffusion of science have in some degree enlighten the mind of all man and have clear such as have any influence upon the progress of manners and society from a thousand unworthy pre-possession the dissipation and luxury that reign uncontrouled have spread effiminacy and irresolution every where -- the grand defection of the united state of america from the mother country be one of the most interesting event that have engage the attention of europe for century and the number of extraordinary genius that have distinguish themselves in the political world give a dignity to the scene they pour a lustre over the darkest part of the story and bestow a beauty upon the tragedy that it could not otherwise have possess at a time like this when the attention of mankind have be keep alive by a series of the most important event we cease to admire at thing which would otherwise appear uncommon and wonder almost lose they name even now however when man be almost grow callous to novelty and the youngest of we have like cato in the play live long enough to be surprise at nothing a matter have occur which few expect and to which for that reason man of no great strength of mind of no nerve of political feeling scarcely know how to reconcile themselves i refer to the coalition between the friend of the late marquis of rockingham and the noble commoner in the blue ribbon the manner of blame this action be palpable and easy the censure be chiefly direct against that wonderful man whom at least in they heart he countryman i believe have agree to regard as the person of brightest genius and most extensive capacity that now adorn the british senate have not this person we be ask for year attack the noble lord in the most unqualified manner be there any aspersion any insinuation that he have not throw out upon he character have he not represent he as the weakest man and the worst minister to whom the direction of affair be ever commit have he not imputed to he prerogative principle and he palpable misconduct the whole catalogue of we misfortune if such man as these be to unite for the detest purpose of ambition what security can we have for any thing valuable that yet remain to we be not this the very utmost reach of frontless profligacy what dependence after this be to be place in the man who have thus give the lie to all he profession and impudently fly in the face of that honest and unsuspecting virtue which have hitherto give he credit for the rectitude of he intention i do not mean for the present to enter into a direct answer to these several observation i leave it to other to rest the weight of they cause upon sound exclamation and pompous interogatory for myself i be firmly persuade that the oftner the late conduct of the rockingham connexion be summon to the bar of fair reason the more cooly it be consider and the less the examiner be lead away by the particular prejudice of this side or of that the more commendable it will appear we do not fear the light we do not shun the scrutiny we be under no apprehension for the consequence i will rest my argument upon the regular proof of these three proposition first -- that the rockingham connexion be the only connexion by which the country could be well serve secondly -- that they be not by themselves of sufficient strength to support the weight of administration thirdly -- that they be not the man whose service be the most likely to be call for by the sovereign in the present crisis first -- i be to prove that the country could not be well serve but by the rockingham connexion there be three point principally concern in the constitute a good administration liberal principle respectable ability and incorruptible integrity -- let we examine with a view to these the other four party in the british government the connexion of the earl of shelburne that of lord north the bedford party and the scottish in review these it be necessary that i should employ a manly freedom though at the same time i should be much unwilling to do a partial injustice to any of they it be true there be some difference between the language of the same man in office and out of office the bedford connexion however have never be conceive to bear a over favourable aspect to the cause of liberty they be the avowed enemy of innovation and reform the scottish party be pretty much confound with the set of man that be call by way of distinction the king 's friend the design of these man have be to exalt regal power and prerogative upon the ruin of aristocracy and the neck of the people argument and those by no means of a frivolous description have be bring to prove that a most subtle and deep-laid scheme be form by they in the beginning of the reign to subserve this odious purpose it have be suppose to have be pursue with the most inflexible constancy and like a skiff when it sail along the meandering course of a river finally to have turn to account the most untoward gale lord north whatever we may suppose to have be he intrinsic ability stand forward as perhaps the most unfortunate minister that this country ever produce misfortune overtake he in the assertion of the highest monarchical principle in spite of misfortune he adherr inflexibly to that assertion in the most critical situation he remain in a state of hesitation and uncertainty till the tide that take at the flood lead up to fortune be lose he versatility and the undisguised attachment that he manifest to emolument and power be surely unworthy of the stake that be entrust to he in what i have now say i do not much fear to be contradict it be not with a view to such as be attach to any of these party that i have take up the pen those who come under this description be almost universally the advocate of monarchy and think that they have nothing to regret but that power and police be not establish upon a more uncontrolable footing among we to such person i do not address myself i know of nothing that the friend of lord rockingham have to offer that can be of any weight with they and for my own part i should blush to say a word that should tend to conciliate they approbation to a system in which my heart be interested the man i wish chiefly to have in view be those that be personally attach to the earl of shelburne such as stand aloof from all party and be incline to have but a indifferent opinion of any and such as have adhere to the connexion i have undertake to defend but whose approbation have be somewhat cool by they late conduct the two last in particular i consider as least under the power of prejudice and most free to the influence of rational conviction the friend of freedom have i believe in no instance hesitate but between the rockingham connexion and the earl of shelburne it be these two then that it remain for I to examine lord shelburne have the misfortune of come very early upon the public stage at that time he connect himself with the earl of bute and enter with warmth into the opposition to mr secretary pitt in this system of conduct however he do not long persist he speedily break with the favorite and soon after join the celebrated hero that have lately be the object of he attack by this person he be introduce to a considerable post in administration in office he be chiefly remember by the very decisive stile of authority and censure he employ in a public letter relative to the resistance that be make to the act of 1767 for impose certain duty in america from he resignation with lord chatham he uniformly and strenuously oppose the measure that be adopt for crush that resistance he persevere with much apparent constancy in one line of conduct for near ten year and this be certainly the most plausible period of he story he first call forth the suspicion of generous and liberal man in every rank of society by he resolute opposition to the american independency in 1778 but it be in the administration that seem to have be form under so favourable auspices in the spring of 1782 that he come most forward to general examination the rockingham connexion in conformity to what be then suppose to be the wish of the people unite though not without some hesitation with the noble earl and he adherent in the conduct of public affair and how do he reward they confidence he be careful to retain the question respect he real sentiment upon the business of america in as much obscurity as ever he write officially a letter to sir guy carleton which have never see the light by which that officer be induce to declare the american independency already irreversibly recognize by the court of london by which he appear to have deceive all he brother minister without exception and by which mr fox in particular be induce to make the same declaration with general carleton to foreign court and to come forward in the common peremptorily to affirm that there be not a second opinion in the cabinet upon this interesting subject how must a man of he undisguised and manly character have feel when within a week from this time he find the noble earl declare that nothing have ever be further from he thought than a unconditional recognition and successfully exert himself to bring over a majority in the cabinet to the opposite sentiment lord shelburne 's obtain or accept call it which you will of the office of first lord of the treasury upon the demise of lord rockingham without the privity of he fellow minister be contrary to every maxim of ingenuous conduct and every principle upon which a association of party can be support the declaration he make and which be contradict both by he own friend in the cabinet and those of mr fox that he know of no reason _ in god 's earth _ for that gentleman 's resignation but that of he have succeed to the office of premier be surely sufficiently singular but he be celebrate for be a man of large profession and by these profession he have induce some person in different class in society to esteem he the friend of liberty and renovation what he have hold out however upon these head have not be entirely confident he have appear the enthusiastical partizan of the aristocracy a kind of government which carry to its height be perhaps of all the different species of despotism the most intolerable he have talk in a very particular stile of he fear of reduce the regal power to a shadow of he desire that the extension of prerogative should keep pace with the confirmation of popular rights and he resolution that if it be in he power to prevent it a king of england should never be bring to a level with a king of mahratta the true son of freedom will not certainly be very apprehensive upon this score and will leave it to the number that will ever remain the adherent of monarchical power to guard the barrier of the throne in opposition he declaration in favor of parliamentary reform seem indeed very decisive in administration he be particularly careful to explain away these declaration and to assure the people that he would never employ any influence in support of the measure but would only countenance it so far as it appear to be the sense of parliament in other word that he would remain neutral or at most only honor the subject with a eloquent harangue and interest himself no further respect it but let we proceed from he language to he conduct in office almost every salutary measure of administration from the resignation of lord north downward be bring about during the union of the noble earl with the rockingham connexion what inference be we to draw from this -- that administration as auspicious as it be transitory have never be charge with more than one error they be think too liberal in the distribution of two or three sinecure and pension to whom be they distribute uniformly exclusively to the friend of lord shelburne lord shelburne propose they to he August colleague and the marquis whose fault if he have any be a excess of mildness and a unsuspecting simplicity perhaps too readily comply but let it be remember that not one of he friend accept or to not one of he friend be these emolument extend but if the noble marquis be spare in the distribution of pension the deficiency be abundantly supply by he successor while the interest of the people be neglect and forget the attention of the premier be in a considerable degree engross by the petty arrangement of office for one man a certain department of business be mark out the place have be previously fill by another here the first person be at all event to be promote and the second gratify with a pension thus in the minute detail of employment in adjust the indeclinable of a court calendar to detach a _ commi _ from this department and to fix a clerk in that burthen after burthen have be heap upon the shoulder of a callous and lethargic people -- but no man can say that the earl of shelburne have be idle beside all this he have restore peace to he country he merit in this business have already be sufficiently agitate to examine they afresh would lead I too far from the scope of my subject i will not therefore now detain myself either to exculpate or criminate the minister to whom whatever they be they be principally to be ascribe from the consideration already suggest i be afraid thus much may be fairly infer that the earl of shelburne be a man dark insidious and inexplicit in he design no decide friend of the privilege of the people and in both respects a person very improper to conduct the affair of this country i would hope however that the celebrated character give of he by the late lord holland be somewhat too severe i have meet with many who by perseverance and labor have make themselves jesuit it be peculiar to this man to have be bear one such then be the estimate we be compel to form of a man who in he profession have sometimes go as far as the most zealous votary of liberty and what be the inference we shall draw from this shall we for the sake of one man so specious and plausible learn to think the language of all man equally empty and deceitful have once be betray shall we avoid all future risk by treat every pretender to patriotism and public spirit as a knave and a impostor this indeed be a conclusion to which the unprincipled and the vicious be ever propense they judge of they fellow by themselves and from the depravity of they own heart be willing to infer that every honesty have its price but the very motive that incline the depraved to such a mode of reasoning must upon the very same account deter the man of virtue from adopt it virtue be originally ever simple and unsuspecting conscious to its own rectitude and the integrity of its profession it naturally expect the same species of conduct from other by every disappointment of this kind it be mortified and humble long very long must it have be baffle and countless must have be its mortification ere it can be induce to adopt a principle of general mistrust and that such a principle should have so large a spread among person whose honesty candor forbid we to suspect be surely of all the paradoxe upon the face of the earth incomparably the greatest -- the man of virtue then will be willing before he give up all we political connexion without distinction to go along with I to the review of the only one that yet remain to be examine that of the late marquis of rockingham too much perhaps can not be say in they praise they have nearly engross the confidence of every friend of liberty they be the only man whose principle be never darken with the cloud of suspicion what let I ask have be they uniform conduct during the whole course of the reign they have be ever steady in they opposition to whatever bear a ill aspect to the cause of freedom and to the whole train of those political measure that have terminate in calamity and ruin they have be twice in administration prosperity and power be usually circumstance that prove the severest virtue while in power how then do this party conduct themselves of they first administration the principal measure be the stamp act a law that restore tranquility to a distract empire a law to which if succeed administration have universally adhere we have be at this moment the exclusive ally and patron of the whole continent of north america a law that they carry in opposition to the all-dreaded mr pitt on the one hand and on the other against the inclination of those secret director from whose hand they receive they delegated power they repeal the excise upon cyder they abolish general warrant and after have be the author of these and a thousand other benefit in the midst of storm and danger they quit they place with a disinterestedness that no other set of man have imitate they secured neither place pension nor reversion to themselves or any of they adherent they second administration be indeed very short but it be crowd with the most salutary measure the grant a full relief to ireland the pass several most important bill of oeconomy and reformation the pass the contractor bill the carry into effect that most valuable measure the abolish the vote of custom-house officer in the election of member of parliament and lastly the attempt to atchieve that most important of all object the establishment of a equal representation what might not have be expect from they longer continuance in office but i will not confine myself to the consideration of they conduct as a body the character of the individual of which they be compose will still further illustrate they true principle and furnish a strong additional recommendation of they to every friend of virtue and of liberty that i may not overcharge this part of my subject i will only mention two or three of they most distinguished leader the character of the present chancellor of the exchequer be entirely a _ unique _ though mix in all the busy scene of life though occupy for many year a principal place in the political affair of this country he have _ keep himself unspotted from the world _ -- the word of the elder cato be esteem so sacred with the roman that it become a proverb among they respect thing so improbable that they truth could not be establish even by the highest authority i would not believe it though it be tell I by cato and in a age much more dissipate than that of cato the integrity and honor of the noble lord i have mention have become equally proverbial not bond nor deed nor all the shackle of law be half so much to be depend upon as be he lightest word he be deaf to all the prejudice of blood or private friendship and have no feeling but for he country of the duke of portland i can say the less as not have have a opportunity of know much respect he he candor and he honor have never be question and i remember in the debate upon the celebrated secession of the rockingham party upon the death of they leader to have hear he ability particularly vouch in very strong term by mr chancellor pitt and the present lord sidney the latter in particular though one of my lord shelburne 's secretary of state fairly avowed in so many word that he should have be better satisfied with the appointment of he grace to the office he now hold than he be with the noble lord under whom he act the character of lord keppel with person not attach to any party have usually be that of a man of much honesty and simplicity without any remarkable ability it be a little extraordinary however that though force by a combination of unfavourable circumstance into a public speaker he be yet even in that line very far from contempt he speech be manly regular and to the purpose he defense upon he trial at portsmouth in which he must naturally be suppose to have have at least a principal share have in my opinion much beauty of composition the adversary of this party though unwilling to admit that the navy be so much improve under he auspices as be assert have yet i believe universally acknowledge he particular activity and diligence but i come to the great beast of he own party and the principal object of attack to they enemy the celebrated mr fox man of formality and sanctity have complain of he as dissipate they do not pretend however to aggravate they accusation by lay to he charge any of the greater vice he contempt of money and he unbounded generosity be universally confess let such then know that dissipation so qualified be a very slight accusation against a public man if indeed it deserve a serious consideration in all expansive mind in mind form for a extensive stage to embrace the welfare and the interest of nation there be a certain incessant activity a principle that must be employ debar they from they proper field and it will most inevitably run out into excess which perhaps have better have be avoid but do these excrescence which only proceed from the richness and fertility of the soil disqualify a man for public business far very far from it where ever be there a man who push dissipation and debauchery to a greater length than my lord bolingbroke and yet it be perhaps difficult to say whether there ever exist a more industrious or a abler minister the peace of utrecht conclude amidst a thousand difficulty from we ally abroad and we party that be never so much exasperate against each other at home must ever remain the monument of he glory he opposition to sir robert walpole seem evidently to have be found upon the most generous principle and though the warmth and ebullition of he passion evermore break in upon he happiest attempt yet be he exertion in both instance attend with the most salutary consequence but mr fox appear to I to possess all the excellency without any of the defect of lord bolingbroke he passion have i believe never be suspect of have embroil the affair of he party and he have uniformly retain the confidence of they all he friendship have be solid and unshaken he conduct cool and intrepid the littleness of jealousy never discolor a conception of he heart in office he be more constant and indefatigable than lord bolingbroke himself all he lesser pursuit seem annihilate and he be swallow up in the direction of public affair he have be accuse of ambition ambition be a very ambiguous term in its lowest sense it sink the meanest and degrade the dirtiest of we race in its highest i can not agree with those who stile it the defect of noble mind i esteem it worthy of the loudest commendation and the most assiduous culture mr fox 's be certainly not a ambition of emolument nobody dream it it be not a ambition that can be gratify by the distribution of place and pension this be a passion that can only dwell in the weakest and most imbecil mind its necessary concomitant be official inattention and oscitancy no the ambition of this hero be a generous thirst of fame and a desire of possess the opportunity of confer the most lasting benefit upon he country it be a instinct that carry a man forward into the field of fitness and of god the vulgar incapable of comprehend these exalted passion be apt upon the slightest occasion to suspect that this heroical language be only hold out to they for a lure and that the most illustrious character among we be really govern by passion equally incident to the meanest of mankind let such examine the feature and the manners of mr fox be that man make for a jesuit be he capable of the dirty laborious insidious trick of a hypocrite be there not a certain manliness about he that disdain to mislead be not candor and sincerity bluntness of manner and a unstudied air conspicuous in all he do -- i know not how far the argument may go with other with I i confess it have much weight i believe a man of sterling genius incapable of the littleness and meanness incident to the vulgar courtier what be the principal characteristic of genius be they not large view infinite conception a certain manliness and intrepidity of think but all real and serious vice originate in selfish view narrow conception and intellectual cowardice a man of genius may possibly be thoughtless dissipate and unstudied but he can not avoid be constant generous and sincere the union of first rate ability with malignity avarice and envy seem to I very nearly as incredible a phenomenon as a mermaid a unicorn or a phoenix i can not overcome the propensity i feel to add mr burke to this illustrious catalogue though the name of this gentleman lead I out of the circle of the cabinet mr burke raise himself from a obscure situation by the greatness of he ability and he unrivalled genius never be distinction more nobly earn of every species of literary composition he be equally a master he excel alike in the most abstruse metaphysical disquisition and in the warmest and most spirited painting he rhetoric be at once ornamented and sublime he satire be polish and severe he wit be truly attic luxuriant in the extreme he allusion be always striking and always happy but to enumerate he talent be to tell but half he praise the application he have make of they be infinitely more to he honor he have devote himself for he country the driest and most laborious investigation have not deter he among a thousand other article that might be mention he system of oeconomical reform must for ever stand forth alike the monument of he ability and he patriotism he personal character be of the most amiable kind humanity and benevolence be strongly paint in he countenance he transaction with lord rockingham be in the highest degree honorable to he and the more they be investigate and the better they be understand the more disinterestedness of virtue and generous singularity of think will be find to have be exhibit on both side it be necessary perhaps that i should say a word respect the aristocratical principle of this gentleman by which he be distinguish from the rest of he party to these principle i profess myself a enemy i be sorry they should be entertain by a person for whom in every other respect i feel the highest veneration but the view of that man must be truly narrow who will give up the character of another the moment he differ from he in any of he principle i be sure mr burke be perfectly sincere in he persuasion and i hope i have long since learn not to question the integrity of any man upon account of he tenet whether in religion or politics be they what they may i rejoice however that this gentleman have connect himself with a set of man by the rectitude of whose view i trust the ill tendency of any such involuntary error will be effectually counteract in the mean time this deviation of mr burke from the general principle of he connexion have give occasion to some to impute aristocratical view to the whole party the best answer to this be that the parliamentary reform be expressly stipulate by lord rockingham in he coalition with the earl of shelburne as one of the principle upon which the administration of march 1782 be form from what have be say i consider my first proposition as completely establish that the rockingham party be the only connexion of man by which the country could be well serve i would however just observe one thing by the way i forsee that my first proposition lie open to a superficial and childish kind of ridicule but in order to its operation it be not necessary to say that the friend of lord rockingham be persuade that the country could not be well serve but by themselves in reality this be the proper and philosophical state of it : that each individual of that connexion be persuade that the country could not be well serve but by he friend and i trust it have now appear that this be a just and rational persuasion the next argument adduce in conformation of my thesis be that they be not by themselves of sufficient strength to support the weight of administration it be certainly a melancholy consideration that there should not be virtue enough leave in a people to support a administration of honest view and uniform principle against all the cabal of faction this however be incontrovertibly the case with britain the bulk of she inhabitant be become in a very high degree inattentive and indifferent to the conduct of she political affair this have be at one time ascribe to they despair of the commonwealth and they mortification in perceive a certain course of mal-administration persist in in defiance of the known sense of the country at another time it have be imputed to they experience of the hollowness of all we public pretender to patriotism i be afraid the cause be to be seek in something more uniform in it be operation and less honorable to the lower rank of society than either of these in a word luxury and dissipation have every where loosen the band of political union the interest of the public have be forget by all man and we have be teach to laugh at the principle by which the patriot of former age be induce to sacrifice they fortune and they life for the welfare of they citizen provide the cup of enjoyment be not dash from we own lip and the pillow of sloth tear away from we own head we do not ask what shall be the fate of we liberty we posterity and we country disinterested affection seem to have take up she last refuge in a few choice spirit and elevated mind who appear among we like the inhabitant of another world in the mean time while the lower people have be _ careful for none of these thing _ they have be almost constantly decide in the senate not by a view to they intrinsic merit but in conformity to the jarring interest and the inexplicable cabal of faction in such a situation alas what can unprotected virtue do destitute of all that comeliness that allure strip of that influence that give weight and consideration and unskilled in the act of intrigue in conformity to these idea when the choice of a administration be once again throw back upon the people in march 1782 we perceive that no one party find themselves sufficiently strong for the support of government and a coalition become necessary between the rockingham connexion and a person they never cordially approve the earl of shelburne even thus support and call to the helm with perhaps as much popularity as any administration ever enjoy they do not carry they measure in parliament without difficulty the inconsiderate and interested do even think proper to ridicule they imbecility particularly in the house of lord the most unsuspected of all we patriot mr burke be reduce to the necessity of so far contract he system of reform upon this account as to have afford a handle to superficial raillery and abuse but turn we to the administration that succeed they who still retain some pretension to public spirit and among whom there remain several individual whose claim to political integrity be indisputably weaker than the ministry of lord rockingham to what shift be they not reduce to preserve they precarious power these be the man who have be loudest in they censure of the late coalition and yet do not they form coalition equally extraordinary with that which be now under consideration to omit the noble lord who preside at the treasury board and to confine myself to those instance which mr fox have occasion to mention in treat my subject be there not the late chancellor of the exchequer who have be severest in he censure of lord north and the lord advocate of scotland who be he principal supporter and be for push the american measure even to greater length than the noble patron himself be there not the master general of the ordnance who have ever go farthest in he view of political reform and declaim most warmly against secret influence and the lord chancellor the most determine enemy of reform and who have be suppose the principal vehicle of that influence lastly be there not in the same manner the secretary of state for the home department who be most unwearied in he invective against lord bute and the right honorable mr jenkinson who have be consider by the believer in the invisible power of that nobleman as the chief instrument of he design with these example of the necessity of powerful support and extensive combination what mode of conduct be it that it be most natural most virtuous and most wise for the rockingham connexion to adopt i confess i can perceive none more obvious or more just than that which they actually adopt a junction with the noble commoner in the blue ribbon at least from what have be say i trust thus much be evident beyond control that they have just reason to consider themselves abstractedly as too weak for the support of government still further to strengthen my argument i affirm in the third place that they be not the man whose service be likely to be call for by the sovereign i believe that this proposition will not be think to stand in need of any very abstruse train of reasoning to support it the late event respect it have be instead of a thousand argument from a apprehension probably of the uncourtierliness of they temper and they inflexible attachment to a system it seem to appear by those event that the sovereign have contract a sort of backwardness to admit they into he council which it be to be hope be only temporary it be however such as without any other apparent cause to cooperate with it alone suffice to delay the form a administration for six week in a most delicate and critical juncture even the union of that noble person who have be consider as he majesty 's favorite minister do not appear to be enough to subdue the averseness however then we may hope that untainted virtue and superior ability when more intimately know may be find calculate to surmount prejudice and conciliate affection it seem but too evident that in the critical moment those man by whom alone we have endeavor to prove that the country could be well serve would not voluntarily have be think on but it do not seem to have be enough consider at what time the coalition be make the rockingham connexion along with thousand of they fellow citizen who be unconnected with any party be induce from the purest view to disapprove of the late treaty of peace the voting with the friend of lord north upon that question be a matter purely incidental by that vote however in which a majority of the common house of parliament be include the administration of lord shelburne be dissolve it be not till after the dissolution be really effect that the coalition take place in this situation something be necessary to be do the nation be actually without a ministry it be a crisis that do not admit of hesitation and delay the country must if a system of delay have be adopt have immediately be throw back into the hand of those man from whom it have be so laboriously force scarce twelve month before or it must have be commit to the conduct of person even less propitious to the cause of liberty and the privilege of the people a situation like this call for a firm and manly conduct it be no longer a time to stoop to the yoke of prejudice it be a time to burst forth into untrodden path to lose sight of the hesitate and timid and generously to adventure upon a step that should rather have in view substantial service than momentary applause and should appeal from the short-sighted decision of systematic prudence to the tribunal of fact and the judgment of posterity but why do i talk of the tribunal of fact event be not within the disposition of human power ` tis not in mortal to command success and the character of wisdom and virtue be therefore very properly consider by all man who pretend to sober reflection as independent of it if then as i firmly believe the coalition be found in the wisest and most generous view the man that value himself upon he rational nature will not wait for the event he will immediately and peremptorily decide in its favor though it should be annihilate to-morrow though it have be originally frustrate in its view respect the continuation of a ministry he would not hesitate to pronounce that it be form in the most expansive and long-sighted policy in the noblest and most prudent daring in the warmest generosity and the truest patriotism but it will be say a coalition of party may indeed be allow to be in many case proper and wise but a coalition between party who have long treat each other with the extremest rancor appear a species of conduct abhorrent to the unadulterated judgment and all the native prepossession of mankind it pluck away the very root of unsuspecting confidence and can be productive of nothing but anarchy and confusion in answer to this argument i will not cite the happy effect of the coalition between party just as opposite by which mr pitt be introduce into office in the close of a former reign still less will i cite the coalition of the earl of shelburne with several leader of the bedford connexion and other whose principle be at least as inimical to the popular cause and the parliamentary reform as those of lord north and the known readiness of he and he friend to have form a junction with the whole of that connexion i need not even hint at the probability there exist that the noble lord then in administration would have be happy to have form the very coalition himself which he be willing we should so much reprobate in another i need not mention the suspicion that naturally suggest themselves upon the invincible silence of he party respect the mal-administration of lord north for so long a time and they bring forward the singular charge of fifty unaccounted million at the very moment that the coalition be complete i should be sorry to have it suppose that the connexion i be defend ever take a example from the late premier for one article of they conduct and i think the mode of vindicate they not from temporary example but from eternal reason as it be in itself most striking and most honorable so be it not a whit less easy and obvious let it be remember then in the first place that there be no other connexion sufficiently unquestionable in they sincerity and of sufficient weight in the senate with which to form a coalition the bedford party have they even be willing to have take this step in conjunction with the friend of lord rockingham be already strip of some of they principal and ablest member by the art of lord shelburne whether these ought to be consider in sound reason as more or less obnoxious than lord north i will not take upon I to determine certain i be that the scottish connexion be of all other the most suspicious in themselves and the most odious to the people the only choice then that remain be that which be make the only subject for deliberation be whether this choice be more or less laudable than on the other hand the desert entirely the interest of they country and leave the vessel of the state to the mercy of the wind secondly i would observe that the principal ground of dispute between lord north and he present colleague in administration be do away by the termination of the american war a impeachment of the noble lord for he past error be perfectly out of the question no one be mad enough to expect it a vein of public spirit diffuse itself among all rank of society be the indispensible concomitant of impeachment and attainder and such a temper i apprehend will not be suspect to be characteristic of the age in which we live but be it otherwise the rockingham connexion certainly never stand in the way of a impeachment have it be meditate and exclusive of this question i know of no objection that apply particular to the noble lord in contradistinction to any of the other party into which we be divide but in the third place the term upon which the coalition be make form a most important article of consideration in estimate its merit they be generally understand to have be these two that the rockingham connexion should at all time have a majority in the cabinet and that lord north should be remove to that hospital of incurable as lord chesterfield have stile it the house of lord surely these article be the happiest that could have be conceive for preserve the power of administration as much as may be with the friend of the people place merely of emolument and magnificence must be bestow somewhere where then can they be more properly lodge than in the hand of those who be best able to support a liberal and virtuous administration i beg leave to add once more in the fourth place that whatever the demerit of lord north as a minister may be suppose to have be he be perhaps in a thousand other respects the fittest man in the world to occupy the second place in a junction of this sort the union of the rockingham connexion with the earl of shelburne last year be i will admit less calculate to excite popular astonishment and popular disapprobation than the present in the eye of cool reason and sober foresight i be apt to believe it be much less wise and commendable lord shelburne though he have be able to win over the good opinion of several under the notion of he be a friend of liberty be really in many respects stiffly aristocratical or highly monarchical lord shelburne be a man of insatiable ambition and who pursue the end of that ambition by way the most complex and insidious the creed of lord north whatever it may be upon general political question be consistent and intelligible for my own part i do not believe he to be ambitious it be not possible with he indolent and easy temper that he should be very susceptible to so restless a passion in the heroical sense of that word he sit loose to fame he be undoubtedly desirous by all the method that appear to he honorable and just to enrich and elevate he family he wish to have it in he power to oblige and to serve he friend but i be exceedingly mistaken if he enter into the present alliance from view of authority and power upon the condition i have mention it be a scheme congenial only to a man of a dark and plot temper but the temper of lord north be in the highest degree candid open and undisguised easy at home upon every occasion there be not a circle in the world to which he presence would not be a addition it be calculate to inspire unconstraint and confidence into every breast simple and amiable be the just description of he character in every domestic relation constant and unreserved in he connexion of friendship the very versatility and pliableness so loudly condemn in he former situation be now a additional recommendation be this the man for whose intrigue and conspiracy we be bid to tremble another charge that have be urge against the coalition be that it be a step that dictate to the sovereign and exclude all but one particular set of man from the national council the first part of this charge be somewhat delicate in its nature i shall only say respect it that if as we have endeavor to prove there be but one connexion by which the business of administration could be happily discharge the friend of liberty rejoicing in the auspicious event will not be very inquisitive in respect to the etiquette with which they be introduce into the government in the mean time far from intend a exclusion they declare publicly that they would be happy to receive into they body any man of known integrity and ability from whatever party he come the declaration have never be contradict -- stranger to the remotest idea of proscription they erect a fortress where every virtue and every excellence might find a place the only remain objection to the coalition that i know of that it shock establish opinion be not i think in itself calculate to have much weight and have perhaps be sufficiently animadverted upon as we go along in what have be already say the proper question be be it a necessary step be there any other way by which the country could be redeem if a satisfactory answer have be furnish to these enquiry the inevitable conclusion in my opinion be that the more it mock established opinion and the more intellectual nerve it demand the more merit do it possess and the louder applause be its due i be not incline to believe that a majority of my countryman upon reflection have disapprove this measure i be happy to perceive that so much of that good sense and manly thinking in public question that have for age be consider as the characteristic quality of englishman be still leave among we there can be nothing more honorable than this -- by it we commonalty though unable indeed to forestal the hero and the man of genius in he scheme do yet if i may be allow the expression tread upon he heel and be prepare to follow he in all he view and to glow with all he sentiment sensible however that in the first blush of such a scheme its enemy must necessarily find they advantage in entrench themselves behind those prejudice that could not be eradicate in a moment i be willing to wait for the hour of calmness and deliberation i resolve cooly to let the first gush of prepossession blow over and the spring tide of censure exhaust itself i believe that such a cause demand only a fair and candid hearing i have endeavor to discharge my part in obtain for it such a hearing and i must leave the rest to my reader among these there probably will be some who strike with the force of the argument i have adduce on the one hand and entangled in they favorite prejudice on the other will remain in a kind of suspence ashamed to retract they former opinion but too honest to deny all weight and consideration to those i have defend to these i have one word to say and with that one word i will conclude i will suppose you to confess that appearance exclusive of the controverted step be in a thousand instance favourable to the new minister they have make the strongest profession and the largest promise of attachment to the general cause to profession and promise i do not wish you to trust i should blush to revive the odious and explode maxim not man but measure if you can not place some confidence in the present administration i advise you as honest man to do every thing in you power to drive they from the helm but you will hardly deny that all they former conduct have afford reason for confidence you be ready to admit that in no instance but one have they commit they character in that one instance they have much to say for themselves and it appear at least very possible that they may have be act in it by virtuous and generous principle even though we should suppose they mistaken remember then that popularity and fame be the very nutriment of virtue a thirst for fame be not a weakness it be the noble mind 's distinguish perfection if then you would bind administration by tenfold tie to the cause of liberty do not withdraw from they you approbation till they have forfeit it by betray in one plain and palpable instance the principle upon which they have formerly act i believe they need no new bond but be unchangeably fix in the generous system with which they commence but thus much be certain if any thing can detach they from this glorious cause if any thing can cool they ardor for the common weal there be nothing that have half so great a tendency to effect this as unmerited obloquy and disgrace fini \* \* \* \* \* new book print for j stockdale opposite burlington-house piccadilly

appear almost incredible i will not however trouble you lordship with the story if they be worthy of the press it be of no great consequence to the public how they find they way thither if they afford you lordship a moment 's amusement amidst the weightier care incident to you rank and fortune i have obtain my end i have endeavor in vain to investigate who be they author and to whom they be address it should seem from the internal evidence of the composition that they be write by a person who be originally of a low rank or a menial station but who be distinguish by he lord for those ability and talent he imagine he discover in he i have learn by a kind of vague tradition upon which i can place little dependence that the noble pupil be the owner of a magnificent _ chteau _ not a hundred mile from you lordship 's admire seat in the county of buckingham it be say that this nobleman amidst a thousand curiosity with which he garden abound have the unaccountable whim of place a kind of artificial hermit in one of its wildest and most solitary recess this hermit it seem be celebrate through the whole neighborhood for he ingenuity in the carve of tobacco-stopper and a variety of other accomplishment some of the peasant even mistake he for a conjuror if i might be allow in the conjectural licence of a editor i should be incline to ascribe the follow composition to this celebrated and ingenious solitaire since however this valuable tract remain without a owner i think it could not be so properly address to any man as you lordship i would not however be misunderstand i do not imagine that the claim this performance have upon the public attention consist in the value and excellence of it be precept on the contrary i consider it as the darkest and most tremendous scheme for the establishment of despotism that ever be contrived if the public enter into my sentiment upon the subject they will consider it as effectually supersede machiavel 's celebrated treatise of the prince and exhibit a more deep-laid and desperate system of tyranny for my part i esteem these great and destructive vice of so odious a nature that they need only be expose to the general view in order to the be scout by all and if which indeed i can not possibly believe there have be any noble lord in this kingdom mean enough to have study under such a preceptor i would willingly shame he out of he principle and hold up to he a glass which shall convince he how worthy he be of universal contempt and abhorrence the true reason my lord for which i have presume to prefix you name to these sheet be that the contrast between the precept they contain and the ingenuous and manly character that be universally attribute to you lordship may place they more strongly in the light they deserve and yet i doubt not there will be some reader perverse enough to imagine that you be the true object of the composition they will find out some of those ingenious coincidence by which the rape of the lock be convert into a political poem and the _ telemaque _ of the amiable fenelon into a satire against the government under which he live i might easily appeal against these treacherous commentator to the knowledge of all man reflect every corner of you lordship 's garden at stowe i might boldly defy any man to say that they now contain or ever do contain one of these artificial hermit but i will take up you lordship 's defense upon a broader footing i will demonstrate how contrary the character of you ancestor and you own have always be to the spirit and temper here inculcate if this run I a little into the beaten style of dedication even the modesty of you lordship will excuse I when i have so valuable a reason for adopt it i shall confine myself my lord in the few thought i mean to suggest upon this head to you two more immediate ancestor man distinguish above the common rate by they virtue or they ability richard earl temple you lordship 's immediate predecessor as the representative of you illustrious house will be long remember by posterity under the very respectable title of the friend of the earl of chatham but though he friend my lord we well know that he do not implicitly follow the sentiment of a man who be assuredly the first star in the political hemisphere and whose talent would have excuse if any thing could have excuse a unsuspecting credulity the character of lord chatham be never but in one instance tarnish he do not sufficiently dread the omnipotence of the favorite he fondly imagine that before a character so brilliant and success so impose as he have be no little system of favouritism could keep its ground twice my lord he be upon the brink of the precipice and once he fall when he tremble on the verge who be it that hold he back it be richard earl temple twice he come like he guardian angel and snatch he from he fate lord chatham indeed be form to champ the bit and spurn indignant at every restraint he know the superiority of he ability he recollect that he have twice submit to the honest counsel of he friend and he disdain to listen any longer to a coolness that assimilate but ill to the adventurousness of he spirit and to a hesitation that wear in he apprehension the guise of timidity what then do richard earl temple do there he fix he standard and there he pitch he tent not a step farther would he follow a leader whom to follow have be the boast of he life he erect a fortress that might one day prove the safeguard of he misguided and unsuspecting friend and yet my lord the character of richard earl temple be not that of causeless suspicion he prove himself in a thousand instance honest trust and sincere he be not like some man that you and i know dark dispassionate and impenetrable on the contrary no man mistake he no man ever charge he with a double conduct or a wrinkled heart he countenance be open and he spirit be clear he be a man of passion my lord he act in every momentous concern more from the dictate of he heart than he head but this be the key to he conduct he keep a watchful eye upon that bane of every patriot minister _ secret influence _ if there be one feature in he political history more conspicuous than the rest if i be call to point out the line of discrimination between he character and that of he contemporary upon the public stage it would be the _ hatred of secret influence _ such my lord be one of you immediate ancestor whose name to this day every honest briton repeat with veneration i will turn to another person still more nearly related to you and who will make a equal figure in the history of the age in which he live mr george grenville he character have be represent to we by a writer of no mean discernment as that of shrewd and inflexible he be a man of indefatigable industry and application he possess a sound understanding and he trust it this be a respectable description integrity and independency however mistaken be entitle to praise what be it my lord that he consider as the ruin of he reputation what be it that defeat all the view of a honest ambition and deprive he country of the service which he ability under proper direction be qualify to render it my lord it be _ secret influence _ it be in vain for minister to be able to construct they plan with the highest wisdom and the most unwearied diligence it be in vain that they come forward like man and risque they place they character they all upon measure however arduous that they think necessary for the salvation of they country they be defeat by what my lord by ability greater than they own by a penetration that discover blot in they wisest measure by a opposition bold and adventurous as themselves no : but by the _ lord of the bedchamber _ by a band of janissary who surround the person of the prince and be ready to strangle the minister upon the nod of a moment with these illustrious example ever rush upon you memory no man can doubt that you lordship have inherit that detestation of _ influence _ by which you ancestor be so honourably distinguish my lord have consider the high expectation which the virtue of you immediate progenitor have teach we to form upon the heir of they both we will recollect for a moment the promise that you first outset in life have make to you country one of you lordship 's first action upon record consist in the high profession you make at the county meeting of buckingham in that ever-venerable aera of oeconomy and reform the spring of 1780 my lord there be certain office of sinecure not dependent upon the caprice of a minister which this country have reserve to reward those illustrious statesman who have spend they life and wear out they constitution in she service no man will wonder when he recollect from whom you lordship have the honor to be descend that one of these office be in you possession this my lord be the subject of you generous and disinterested profession you tell you countryman that with this office you be ready to part if a reformation so extensive be think necessary you be determine not merely to be no obstacle to the design but to be a volunteer in the service you come forward in the eye of the world with you patent in you hand you be ready to sacrifice that parchment the precious instrument of personal wealth and private benevolence at the shrine of patriotism here then my lord you stand pledge to you country what be we not to expect from the first patriot of modern story you lordship will readily imagine that we expectation be boundless and indefinite glorious and immortal man we cry go on in this untrodden path we will no longer look with droop and cheerless anxiety upon the misfortune of britain we have a resource for they all the patriot of stowe be capable of every thing he do not resemble the vulgar herd of mortal he do not form he conduct upon precedent nor defend it by example virtue of the first impression be never yet separate from genius we will trust then in the expedient of he inexhaustible mind we will look up to he as we assure deliverer -- we be well acquaint with the wealth of the proprietor of stowe thanks eternal thanks to heaven who have bestow it with so liberal a hand we consider it as a deposit for the public good we count he acre and we calculate he income for we know that it be in the best sense of the word we own my lord these be the prejudice which englishman have form in you favor they can not refuse to trust a man descend from so illustrious progenitor they can not suspect any thing dark and dishonourable in the generous donor of 2700_l _ a year let then the commentator against whom i be provide abjure the name of briton or let they pay the veneration that be due to a character in every view of the subject so exalted as that of you lordship i have the honor to be my lord with the most unfeigned respect you lordship 's most obedient most devoted servant instruction to a statesman my lord i have long consider as the greatest happiness of my life the have so promise a pupil as you lordship though you ability be certainly of the very first impression they be not however of that vague and indefinite species which we often meet with in person who if providence have so pleased would have figure with equal adroitness in the character of a shoe-black or a link-boy as they now flatter themselves they can do in that of a minister of state you my lord be bear with that accomplishment of secrecy and retentiveness which the archbishop of cambray represent telemachus as have possess in so high a degree in consequence of the mode of he education you be always distinguish by that art never to be sufficiently value of talk much and say nothing i can not recollect and yet my memory be as great as my opportunity for observation have be considerable that you lordship when a boy ever betray a single fact that chance to fall within you notice unless indeed it have some tendency to procure a school-fellow a whipping i have often remark you lordship with admiration talk big and blustering loud so as to frighten urchin who be about half you lordship 's size when you have no precise meaning in any thing you say and i shall never forget the longest day i have to live when i hug you in my arm in a kind of prophetic transport in consequence of you whisper I in the midst of a room-full of company in so sly a manner that nobody could observe you that you have just see john the coachman bestow upon betty the cook-maid a most devout and cordial embrace from you rawest infancy you be as much distinguish as milton represent the goddess hebe to have be by nod and beck and wreathe smile with this difference that in she they be mark of gaiety and in you of demureness that in she they be unrestrained and general and in you intend only for a single _ confidant _ my lord reflect upon all these circumstance it be not to be wonder at that i treat you lordship even in clout with the reverence due to a infant jove and always consider myself as superintend the institution of the first statesman that ever exist but my lord it have ever be my opinion that let nature do as much as she will it be in the power of education to do still more the many statesmanlike quality that you bring into the world with you sufficiently prove that no man be ever more deeply indebted to the bounty of nature than you lordship and yet of all those quality she have bestow upon you there be not one that i hold in half so much esteem as that docility which have ever induce you to receive my instruction with implicit veneration it be true my coat be fustian and my whole accoutrement plebeian my shoe be clout and it be long since the wig that defend this penetrate brain could boast a crooked hair but you my lord have be able to discover the fruit through the thick and uncomely coat by which it be conceal you have crack the nut and have a right to the kernel my lord i think it necessary to premise these observation before i enter upon those important matter of disquisition which will form the object of my present epistle it be unnecessary for I to inform a person of so much discernment as you lordship that education be by its very nature a thing of temporary duration you lordship 's education have be long and there have be cogent reason why it should be so god grant that when leave to walk the world alone you be not betray into any of those unlucky blunder from the very verge of which my provident hand have often redeem you lordship do not mistake I my lord when i talk of the greatness of you talent it be now too late to flatter : this be no time for disguise pardon I therefore my dear and ever-honoured pupil if i may seem to offend against those minuter law of etiquette which be make only for common case at so important a crisis it be necessary to be plain you lordship be very cunning but i never imagine that you be remarkably wise the talent you receive at you birth if we be to speak with mathematical strictness should rather be denominate knack than ability they consist rather in a lucky dexterity of face and a happy conformation of limb than in any very elevated capacity of the intellect upon that score my lord -- you know i be fond of comparison and i think i have hit upon one in this case that must be acknowledge remarkably apposite i have sometimes see a ditch the water of which though really shallow have appear to careless observer to be very deep for no other reason but because it be muddy believe I my lord experience and penetrate observer be not so to be take in but as i be say education be a temporary thing and you lordship 's however lasting and laborious be at length bring to a period my lord if it so please the sovereign disposer of all thing i would be very well satisfied to remain in this sublunary state for some year longer if it be only that i might live to rejoice in the exemplification of my precept in the conduct of my pupil but if this boon be grant to my merit and my prayer at any rate i shall from this moment retire from the world from henceforth my _ secret influence _ be bring to its close i will no longer be the unseen original of the grand movement of the figure that fill the political stage i will stand aloof from the giddy herd i will not stray from my little vortex i will look down upon the transaction of court and minister like a etherial be from a superior element there i shall hope to see you lordship outstrip you contemporary and tower above the pigmy of the day to repeat a idea before deliver might be unbecome in a fine writer but it be characteristic and beautiful under the personage of a preceptor the fitness which nature bestow upon you frame would not have do alone but join with the lesson i have teach you they can not fail unless i grossly flatter myself to make the part which you lordship shall act sufficiently conspicuous receive then my lord with that docility and veneration which have at all time make the remembrance of you pleasant and revive to my heart the last communication of the instructor of you choice yes my lord from henceforth you shall see I you shall hear from I no more from this consideration i infer one reason why you should deeply reflect upon the precept i have now to offer remember that these little sheet be all the legacy my affection can bestow upon you i shall concenter in they the very quintessence and epitome of all my wisdom i shall provide in they a particular antidote to those defect to which nature have make you most propense but i have yet another reason to inforce you attention to what i be about to write i be as i have say the instructor of you choice when i have yet remain neglect in the world when my honor be wither by the hand of poverty when my blossom appear in the eye of those who see I of the most brown and wintery complexion and if you lordship will allow I to finish the metaphor when i stank in they nose it be then that you lordship remark and distinguish I you bounty it be that first revive my native pride it be true that it run in a little dribbling rivulet but still it be much to I even before you be able to afford I any real assistance you be always ready to offer I a corner of you gingerbread or a marble from you hoard you lordship have at all time a taste for sumptuousness and magnificence but you know how to limit you natural propensity in consideration of the call of affinity and to give you farthing to you friend do not then my dear lord belie the first and earliest sentiment of you heart as you have ever hear I let you attention be triple now read my letter once and again preserve it as a sacred deposit lay it under you pillow meditate upon it fast commit it to memory and repeat the scatter parcel of it as caesar be say to have do the greek alphabet to cool you rise choler be this the amulet to preserve you from danger be this the chart by which to steer the little skiff of you political system safe into the port of historic immortality my lord you and i have read machiavel together it be true i be but a bungler in italian and you lordship be generally oblige to interpret for I you translation i dare say be always scientifical but i be seldom so happy as to see either grammar or sense in it so far however as i can guess at the drift of this celebrated author he seem to have write as the professor of only one science he have treat of the art of government and have enquire what be wise and what be political he have leave the moralist to take care of themselves in the present essay my lord i shall follow the example of machiavel i profess the same science and i pretend only to have carry to much greater height a art to which he have give a considerable degree of perfection you lordship have have a great number of master you excellent father who himself have some dabble in politics spare no expence upon you education though i believe he have by no means so high a opinion of you genius and ability as i entertain you lordship therefore be to be presume competently verse in the rudiment of ethic you have read grotius puffendorf and cumberland for my part i never open a volume of any one of they i be self-taught my science originate entirely in my unbounded penetration and a sort of divine and supernatural afflatus with all this you lordship know i be a modest man i have never presume to entrench upon the province of other let the professor of ethic talk they nonsense i will not interrupt they i will not endeavor to set you lordship against they it be necessary for I to take politics upon a unlimited scale and to suppose that a statesman have no character to preserve but that of speciousness and plausibility but it be you lordship 's business to enquire whether this be really the case i need not tell you that i shall not like the political writer with which you be acquaint talk in the air my instruction will be of a practical nature and my rule adapt to the present condition of the english government that government be at present considerably though imperfectly a system of liberty to such a system the most essential maxim be that the governor shall be accountable and amenable to the govern this principle have sometimes be denominate responsibility responsibility in a republican government be carry as high as possible in a limited monarchy it stop at the first minister the immediate servant of the crown now to this system nothing can be more fatal than for the public measure not really to originate with administration but with secret adviser who can not be trace this be to cut all the nerve of government to loosen all the spring of liberty to make the constitution totter to its lowest foundation i say this my lord not to terrify you lordship the student and the imitator of machiavel must not be frighten with bugbear beside be cowardice as congenial to the feeling of you lordship as i confess it have sometimes be to mine cowardice itself be not so apt to be terrify with threat hang up _ in terrorem _ and menace of a vague and general nature it tremble only at a danger definite and impend it be the dagger at the throat it be the pistol at the breast that shake she nerve prudence be alarm at a distance and call up all she exertion but cowardice be short-sighted and be never productive of any salutary effort i say not this therefore to intimidate but to excite you i would teach you that this be a most important step indeed be the grand _ desideratum _ in order to exalt the english monarchy to a par with the glorious one of france or any other absolute monarchy in christendom in order my lord to annihilate responsibility nothing more be necessary than that every individual should be as free and as much in the habit of advise the king upon the measure of government as he minister let every discard and let every would-be statesman sow dissension in the royal council and pour the poison of he discontent into the royal ear let the cabinet ring with a thousand jarring sentiment and let the subtlest courtier let he that be the most perfect master of wheedle art and pathetic tone carry it from every rival this my lord will probably create some confusion at first the system of government will appear not a regular and proportioned beauty like the pheasant of indium but a gaudy and glaring system of unconnected part like esop 's daw with borrow feather anarchy and darkness will be the original appearance but light shall spring out of the noon of night harmony and order shall succeed the chaos the present patchwork of three different form of government shall be change into one simple and godlike system of despotism thus when london be burn a more commodious and healthful city spring as it be out of she ash but neither rome nor london be build in a day the glorious work i be recommend to you must be a work of time at first it will be necessary for the person who would subvert the silly system of english government to enter upon he undertaking with infinite timidity and precaution he must stalk along in silence like tarquin to the rape of lucretium he horse like those of lear must be shoe with feel he must shroud himself in the thickest shade let he comfort himself with this reflexion : it be but for a time it will soon be over no work of mortal hand can long stand against concussion so violent ulyss who enter troy shut up in the cincture of the wooden horse shall soon burst the enclosure shall terrify those from whose observation he lately shrink and carry devastation and ruin on whatever side he turn my lord i have consider the subject of politics with as much acuteness as any man i have revolve a thousand scheme which to recommend to the pursuit of the statesman of my own creation but there be no plan of action that appear to I half so grand and comprehensive as this of _ secret influence _ it be true the scheme be not entirely new it have be a subject of discussion ever since the english nation could boast any thing like a regular system of liberty it be complain of under king william it be boast of even to ostentation by the tory minister of queen anne the pelham cry out upon it in lord carteret it have be the business of half the history of the present reign to fix the charge upon my lord bute and yet in spite of these appearance in spite of all the deduction that modesty can authorise i may boldly affirm that my scheme have something in it that be truly original my lord i would not have you proceed by leap and start like these half-fledged statesman i would have you proceed from step to step in a finish and faultless plan i have too a improvement without which the first step be of no value which yet have seldom be add which at first sight have a very daring appearance but which i pretend to teach you lordship to practice with perfect safety but it be necessary for I before i come to this grand _ arcanum _ of my system to premise a few observation for the more accurately manage the influence itself my lord there be a variety of thing necessary to absolute secrecy there be nothing more inconvenient to a political character than that gross and unmanageable quantity of flesh and blood that fortune have decree that every mortal should carry about with he the man who be properly initiate in the _ arcana _ of a closet ought to be able to squeeze himself through a key hole and whenever any impertinent marplot appear to blast he to change this unwieldy frame into the substance of the viewless wind how often must a theoretical statesman like myself have regret that incomparable invention the ring of gyge how often must he have wish to be possess of one of those diabolical form describe by milton which now be taller than the pole and anon could shrink into the compass of a atom but i forget the characteristic of my profession it be not ours my lord to live in air-built castle and to deal in imaginary hypothesis on the contrary we be continually talk of the weakness and the frailty of humanity do any man impeach one of we body of bribery and corruption we confess that these practice may seem to run counter with the fine-spun system of morality but this be we constant apology human affair can be no otherwise manage do any man suggest the most beautiful scheme of oeconomy or present we with the most perfect model of liberty we turn away with a sneer and tell he that all this be plausible and pretty but that we do not concern ourselves with any thing but what be practicable in conformity to these idea i beg leave my lord to recal the fantastic wish that have just escape I to be corporeal be we irrevocable fate and we will not waste we time in fruitlessly accuse it my lord i have one or two little expedient to offer to you which though they do not amount to a perfect remedy in this case will yet i hope prove a tolerable substitute for those diabolical form of which i be talk i need not put you lordship in mind how friendly to such practice as ours be the cover of darkness and how convenient those little machine commonly call back-stairs i dare say even you lordship however inconsequently you may often conduct yourself would scarcely think of mid-day as the most proper season of concealment or the pass through a crowded levee the most natural method of enter the royal closet unobserved but my lord you will please to recollect that there be certain attendant upon the person of the sovereign whom i find class in that epitome of political wisdom the red book under the name of page most wise be the institution -lrb- and you lordship will observe that i be not now deviate into the region of fable -rrb- which be common to all the eastern court of have these office fill by person who upon peril of they life may not in any circumstance whatsoever utter a word but unfortunately in the western climate in which we reside the thing be otherwise the institution of mute be unknown to we the lip of we page have never be inure to the wholesome discipline of the padlock they be as loquacious and blab as much as other man you know my lord that i be fond of illustrate the principle i lay down by the recital of fact the last and indeed the only time that i ever enter the metropolis i remember as my barber be remove the hair from my nether lip : -- my barber have all that impertinent communicativeness that be incident to the gentleman of he profession he assure I that he have see that morning one of the page of the back-stair who declare to he upon the word of a man of honor that he have that moment admit a certain nobleman by a private door to the presence of he master that the face of the noble lord be perfectly familiar to he and that he have let he in some fifty time in the course of the past six month how silly be all this add the page and how glad should i be lick he lip that it be but a opera girl or a countess and yet my mistress be the very best mistress that ever i see _ oh this be poor and show a pitiful ambition __ in the man that do it _ i will swear my lord that the nobleman who could thus have be betray must have be a thick-headed fellow and fit for no one public office not even for that of _ turnspit of he majesty 's kitchen _ -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : vide burke 's speech upon oeconomy -rrb- my lord if you would escape that rock upon which this statesman terminate he political career ever while you live make use of bribery let the page finger you cash let they drink you health in a glass of honest claret and let they chuckle over the effect of you lordship 's munificence i know that you will pour forth many a pathetic complaint over the money that be draw off by this copious receiver but believe the wisest man that now exist when he assure you that it be well bestow you lordship 's bounty to myself have sometimes amount to near ten pound in the course of a twelvemonth that drain my lord be stop i shall receive from you no more let then the expence which you once incur for my sake be henceforth divert to this valuable purpose i believe my lord that this be all the improvement that can be make upon the head of page i think we can scarcely venture upon the expedient that would otherwise be admirable of these interview be carry on without the intervention of any such impertinent fellow from whom one be ever in danger without the smallest notice of have it publish at st jame 's - market and proclaim from the statue at charing-cross if however you should think this expedient adviseable i would recommend it to you not to mention it to you gracious master court be so incumbered and hedge in with ceremony that the member of they be always prone to imagine that the form be more essential and indispensable than the substance suppose then my lord you be by one of those sly opportunity which you know so well how to command to take off the key in wax and get a picklock key make exactly upon the model of it the end my lord take my word for it would abundantly sanctify the apparent sordidness of the means in this situation i can not help picture to myself the surprise and the joy that would be in a moment light up in the countenance of you friend you rencounter would be as unexpected and fortunate as that of lady randolph and she son when she fear every moment to have he murder by glenalvon you would fly into each other arm and almost smother one another in you mutual embrace but another thing that be abundantly worthy of you lordship 's attention be the subject of disguise and dark lanthorn harley afterwards earl of oxford be in the practice if i remember right for it be some time since i read dr swift 's political pamphlet of cross the park in a horseman 's coat but this be too shallow and thin a disguise a mask on the other hand might perhaps be too particular though indeed at midnight which be the only time that i would recommend to you lordship in which to approach within a hundred yard of the palace it might probably pass without much observation a slouched hat and a bob wig you lordship may at any time venture upon but there be nothing that be of so much importance in this affair as variety i would sometimes put on the turban of a turk and sometimes the half breeches of a highlander i would sometimes wear the lawn sleeve of a bishop and sometimes the tye-wig of a barrister a leathern apron and a trowel might upon occasion be of sovereign efficacy the long beard and neglect dress of a shylock should be admit into the list i would also occasionally lay aside the small clothes and assume the dress of a woman i would often trip it along with the appearance and gesture of a spruce milliner and i would often stalk with the solemn air and sweeping train of a duchess but of all the infinite shape of human dress i must confess that my favorite be the kind of doublet that prince harry wear when he assault falstaff the nearer it approach to the guise of a common carman the better and he long whip ought to be inseparable if you could add to it the sooty appearance of a coal-heaver or a chimney-sweep it would sit upon this more precious than velvet garb like spangle and lace i need not add that to a mind of elegance and sensibility the emblematical allusion which this dress would carry to the secrecy and impenetrableness of the person that wear it must be the source of a delightful and exquisite sensation and now my lord for the last head which it be necessary to mention under this division of my subject i mean that of lanthorn twenty people i doubt not whom you lordship might consult upon this occasion would advise you to go without any lanthorn at all beware of this my lord it be a rash and a thoughtless advice it may possibly be a false and insidious one you lordship will never think of go always in the same broad and frequented path many a causeway you will have to cross many a dark and wind alley to tread suppose my lord the pavement be to be tear up and you lordship be to break you shin suppose a drain be to have be open in the precede day without you know any thing of the matter and you lordship be to break you neck suppose which be more terrible than all the rest you be to set you foot upon that which i dare not name and by offend the olfactory nerve of majesty you be to forfeit he affection for ever so much my lord by way of declamation against the abolition of lanthorn you lordship however do not imagine i shall say any thing upon affair so common as the glass lanthorn the horn lanthorn and the perforated tin lanthorn this last indeed be most to my purpose but it will not do my lord it will not do there be a kind of lanthorn you lordship have see they that have one side dark and the other light i remember to have observe you lordship for half a day together pore over the picture of guy faux in the book of martyr this be one of the early intimation which my wisdom enable I to remark of the destination which nature have give you you know my lord that the possessor of this lanthorn can turn it this way and that as he please he can contrive accurately to discern the countenance of every other person without be visible himself i need not enlarge to you lordship upon the admirable use of this machine i will only add that my very dear and ever-lamented friend mr pinchbeck effect before he die a improvement upon it so valuable that it can not but preserve he name from that oblivious power by which common name be devour in he lanthorn the shade which use to be inseparable may be take away at the possessor 's pleasure like the head of a whisky and it may appear to all intent and purpose one of the common vehicle of the kind he have also a contrivance never to be sufficiently commend that when the snuff of the candle have attain a certain length it move a kind of automatic pair of snuffer that hang within side and amputate itself he leave I two of these lanthorn as a legacy such be my value for you lordship that i have work myself up to a resolution of parting with one of they in you lordship 's favor you will receive it in four day from the date of this by gine 's waggon that put up in holborn but my lord there be a second object of consideration still more important than this it be in vain for you lordship or any other person to persuade the sovereign against any of the measure of he government unless you can add to this the discovery of those new sentiment you have instil to all such as it may concern it be the business of every machiavelian minister such as you lordship both from nature and choice be incline to be to prop the cause of despotism in order to this the dignity of the sovereign be not to be commit but exalt to bring forward the royal person to put a negative upon any bill in parliament be a most inartificial mode of proceed it mark too accurately the stride of power and awaken too pointedly the attention of the multitude you lordship have hear that the house of lord be the barrier between the king and the people there be a sense of this phrase of which i be wonderfully fond the dissemination of the royal opinion will at any time create a majority in that house to divert the odium from the person of the monarch twenty-two bishop thirteen lord of the bed-chamber and all the rabble of household troops will at any time compose a army they may not indeed cover a acre of ground nor would i advise you lordship to distribute they into a great number of regiment they countenance be not the most terrific that be ever behold and it might be proper to officer they with person of more sagacity than themselves but under all this meekness of appearance and innocence of understand believe I my lord they be capable of keep at bay the common and the people of england unite in one cause for a considerable time they have be too long at the beck of a minister not to be somewhat callous in they feeling and they be too numerous not to have shoulder capacious enough to bear all the obloquy with which they conduct may be attend but then my lord as i would not recommend it to you to bring into practice the royal negative so neither perhaps would it be advisable for the sovereign to instruct those lord immediately attendant upon he in person king you be not to be inform be to be manage and humor by those that would win they confidence if you lordship could invent a sort of down more soft and yielding than have yet be employ it might be something but to point out to you master that he must say this and write that that he must send for one man and break with another be a unpleasant and ungrateful office it must be you business to take the burden from he shoulder you must smooth the road you would have he take and strew with flower the path of ruin if he favor you scheme with a smile of approbation if he bestow upon you proceedings the sanction of a nod it be enough it be godlike fortitude and heroic exertion but secrecy be the very essence of deep and insidious conduct i would advise you lordship to bring even you own name into question as little as possible my lord chesterfield compare a statesman who have be celebrate for influence during the greatest part of the present reign to the ostrich the brain of a ostrich you lordship will please to observe though he be the largest of bird may very easily be include in the compass of a nut-shell when pursue by the hunter he be say to bury he head in the sand and have do this to imagine that he can not be discover by the keenest search do not you my lord imitate the manners of the ostrich believe I they be ungraceful and if maturely consider will perhaps appear to be a little silly there be a contrivance that have occur to I which if it be not accompany with a circumstance somewhat out of date appear to I in the highest degree admirable suppose you be to treat the lord of the bedchamber with a sight of st paul 's cathedral there be a certain part of it of a circular form commonly call the whisper gallery you have probably hear that by the uncommon echo of this place the weakest sound that can possibly be articulate be increase by that time it have go half round into a sound audible and strong you lordship with you flock of goose about you would probably be frolic and gamesome you may easily contrive to scatter they through the whole circumference of this apartment of a sudden you will please to turn you face to the wall and utter in a solemn tone the royal opinion every body will be at a loss from whence the mandate proceed some of you companion more goose-like than the rest will probably imagine it a voice from heaven the sentence must be two or three time repeat at proper interval before you can contrive to have each of the lord in turn at the require distance this will demand a considerable degree of alertness and agility but alertness and agility be quality by which you lordship be so eminently distinguish that i should have very few apprehension about you success meanwhile it will be proper to have a select number of footman station at the door of the gallery arm with smelling-bottle some of you friend i suspect would be so much alarm at this celestial and ghost-like phenomenon as to render this part of the plan of singular service but after all i be apprehensive that many of the noble lord to whom i allude would be disgust at the very mention of any thing so old-fashioned and city-like as a visit to this famous cathedral and even if that be not the case it be proper to be provide with more than one scheme for the execution of so necessary a purpose the question be of no contemptible magnitude between instruction _ viva voce _ and a circular letter in favor of the first it may be say that a letter be the worst and most definite evidence to a man 's disadvantage that can be conceive it may easily be trace it can scarcely be deny the sense of it can not readily be explain away -- it must be confess there be something in this and yet my lord i be by all means for a letter a voice may often be overhear i remember my poor old goody use to say -lrb- heaven rest she soul -rrb- that wall have ear there be some lord my dear friend that can never think of be alone bugbear be ever start up in they prolific imagination and they can not be for a moment in the dark without expect the devil to fly away with they they have some useful pimp some favorite toad-eater that be always at they elbow ever remember so long as you live that toad-eater be treacherous friend beside it would be a little suspicious to see you lordship 's carriage make a regular tour from door to door among the lord of the bed-chamber and i would by no means have pinchbeck 's dark-lanthorn bring into common use consider my lord when that be wear out you will not know where to get such another a letter may be disguise in various way you would certainly never think of sign you name you might have it transcribe by you secretary but then this would be to commit you safety and you fame to the keep of another no my lord there be scheme worth a hundred of this consider the various hand in which a letter may be write there be the round hand and the italian hand the text hand and the run hand you may form you letter upon the roman or the italic model you billet may he engross you may employ the german text or the old primero if i be not mistaken you lordship study all these when you be a boy for this very purpose yes my lord i may be in the wrong but i be confidently of opinion that this be absolutely the first most important and most indispensible accomplishment of a statesman i would forgive he if he do not know a cornet from a ensign i would forgive he if he think italy a province of asia minor but not to write primero the nincompoop the numbscul if it be not that the person with whom you lordship have to correspond can some of they barely spell they native tongue i would recommend to you lordship the use of cypher but no you might as well write the language of mantcheux tartar for consider you letter may be intercept it be true they have not many peril to undergo they be not hand from post-house to post-house there be no impertinent office-keeper to inspect they by land there be no privateer to capture they by sea but my lord they have peril to encounter the very recollection of which make I tremble to the inmost fiber of my frame they be ale-houses my lord think for a moment of the clattering of porter-pot and the scream of my goodly hostess imagine that the blaze fire smile through the impenetrable window and that the kitchen shake with the peal of laughter these be temptation my lord that no mortal porter can withstand when the unvaried countenance of he gracious sovereign smile invitation upon he from the weather beat sign-post what loyal heart but must be melt into compliance from all these consideration my lord i would advise you to write with invisible ink milk i believe will serve the purpose though i be afraid that the milk that be hawk about the street of london have rather too much water in it the juice of lemon be a sovereign recipe there be a variety of other preparation that will answer the purpose but these may be learn from the most vulgar and accessible source of information and you will please to observe that i suffer nothing to creep into this political testament more valuable than those of richelieu mazarine and alberonus that be not entirely original matter my lord i defy you to learn a single particular of the refinement here communicate from the greatest statesman that live they talk of fox he would give he right hand for a atom of they i will now suppose you my lord by all these artifice arrive at the very threshold of power i will suppose that you have just defeat the grandest and the wisest measure of you political antagonist i think there be nothing more natural though the rule will admit of many exception than for people who act uniformly in opposition to each other upon public grounds to be of opposite character and disposition i will therefore imagine that shock with the boundless extortion and the relentless cruelty that have be practice in some distant part of the empire they come forward with a measure full of generous oblivion for the part provide with circumspect and collect humanity for the future i will suppose that they be desirous of take a impotent government out of the hand of jew and pedlar old woman and minor and to render it a part of the great system i will suppose that they be desirous of transfer political power from a company of rapacious and interested merchant into the hand of statesman man distinguish among a thousand party for clear integrity disinterested virtue and spotless fame this my lord would be a field worthy of you lordship 's prowess could you but gain the interested could you eternize rapacity and preserve inviolate the blot of the english name what laurel would not you lordship deserve i will therefore suppose that you gracious master meet you with a _ carte blanche _ that he be dispose to listen to all you advice and to adopt all you counsel you lordship be aware that the road of secret influence and that of popular favor be not exactly the same no ministry can long preserve they seat unless they possess the confidence of a majority of the house of common the ministry therefore against which you lordship act we will take it for grant be in this predicament in this situation then a important question naturally arise either a majority in the house of common must be purchase at any rate or the government must be conduct in defiance of that house or thirdly the parliament must be dissolve exclusive of these three i can conceive of no alternative we will therefore examine each in its turn shall a majority in the house of common be create much may be say on both side a very ingenious friend of mine for whose counsel i have a uncommon deference assure I that nothing would be so easy as this observe with a shrewdness that astonish I that ministry upon a late most important question muster no more than 250 vote and that there be 558 member he infer that you have nothing more to do than to send for those that be absent out of the country and you might have upward of 300 to pit against the 250 it be with infinite regret that i ever suffer myself to dissent from the opinion of this gentleman but suppose my lord which be at least possible that one half of the absentee should be friend to the cause of the people what would become of we then there remain indeed the obvious method of purchase vote and it might be suppose that you lordship 's talent of insinuation might do you knight 's service in this business but no my lord many of these country gentleman be at bottom no better than boor a mechlin cravat and a smirking countenance upon which you lordship build so much would be absolutely unnoticed by they i be afraid of risque my credit with you lordship but i can assure you that i have hear that one of these fellow have be know to fly from a nobleman cover with lace and powdered and perfumed to the very tip of the mode to follow the standard of a commoner whose coat have be stain with claret and who have not have a ruffle to he shirt my lord if common fame may be trust these puppy be literally tasteless enough to admire wit though the man who utter it be ever so corpulent and to discover eloquence in the mouth of one who can suffer himself to spit in a honorable assembly i be a plain man my lord but i really think that among marquiss and duke right honourable and right reverend these thing be intolerable i would therefore have you lordship give up at once and with a grace the very idea of bring over to you side the partisan of these huge slovenly fellow the scheme of govern the country without take the house of common along with you be much more feasible than this this might be do by pass a act of parliament by the authority of two estate of the realm to declare the house of common useless for my part i be far from think this so bold a step as by some it may be imagine be not rome a free state though it have no house of common have not the british house of common be incessantly exclaim upon as corrupt and nugatory have not a reform respect they be call for from all quarter of the kingdom i be much of opinion in the present case that that be the most effectual reform which go to the root rome have she hereditary nobility which compose she senate she have she consul a ill-imagined substitute for monarchical power in these my lord be comprehend in a manner the whole of she government i shall be tell indeed that they have occasionally they _ comitium _ or assembly of the citizen of the metropolis but this be so far from a objection to my reasoning that it furnish I with a very valuable hint for the improvement of the english constitution let the present house of common be cashier and let the common council of the city of london be place at st stephen 's chapel in they room these you lordship will find a much more worthy and manageable set of people than the representative of the nation at large and can any sensible man doubt for a moment which be the most respectable body of man examine they person among they predecessor i see many poor lank shrivel half-starved thing some bald some with a few straggle hair and some with a enormous bag pendant from no hair at all turn my lord to the other side there you will see a good comely creditable race of people they look like brother as they size and figure be the same so by the fire in they eye and the expression in they countenance you could scarcely know one of they from another they very gown be enough to strike terror into the most inattentive each of they cover he _ cranium _ with a venerable periwig whose flow curl and voluminous frizure bespeak wealth and contentment they face be buxom and they cheek be florid you will also my lord find they much more easy and tractable than the squeamish fretful discontented wretch with which other minister have have to do there be but one expence that will be requisite it be uniform and capable of a easy calculation in any great and try question i be go to say debate but debate i be apt to think would not be very frequent or very animated -- you lordship have nothing to do but to clear the table of the roll and parchment with which it be generally cover and spread a table cloth place upon it half a score immense turtle smoking hot and lard with green fat my lord i will forfeit my head if with this perfume regale they nostril a single man have resolution enough to divide the house or to declare he discontent with any of the measure of government by go out into the lobby so much my lord for this scheme it be too considerable to be adopt without deliberation it be too important and too plausible to be reject without examination the only remain hypothesis be that of a dissolution much i know may be say against this measure but for my own part next to the new and original system i have have the honor of open to you lordship it be with I a considerable favorite those whose interest it be to raise a outcry against it will exclaim what for the petty and sinister purpose of ambition shall the whole nation be throw into uproar and confusion who be it that complain of the present house of parliament be the voice of the people raise against it do petition come up from every quarter of the kingdom as they do to no purpose a few year ago for its dissolution but it be the prerogative of the king to dissolve he parliament and because it be he prerogative because he have a power of this kind reserve for singular emergency do it follow that this power be to be exercise at caprice and without weighty and comprehensive reason it may happen that the parliament be in the midst of its session that the very existence of revenue may be unprovided for and the urgent claim of humanity unfulfilled it be of little consequence they will perhaps pretend who be in and who be out so the national interest be honestly pursue and the man who superintend they be not defective in ability that then must be a most lawless and undisguised spirit of selfishness that can for these bauble risk the happiness of million and the preservation of the constitution all these observation my lord may sound well enough in the harangue of a demagogue but be it for such a man to object to a repetition of that appeal to the people in general in the frequency and universality of which the very existence of liberty consist till lately i think it have be allow that one of those reform most favourable to democracy be a abridgment of the duration of parliament but if a general abridgment be so desirable must not every particular abridgment have its value too shall the one be acknowledge of a salutary and yet the other be declare of a pernicious tendency be it possible that the nature of a part and of the whole can be not only dissimilar but opposite but i will quit these general and accurate reasoning it be not in they that we strength lie they tell we that the measure of a dissolution be a unpopular one my lord it be not so that you and i be to be take in picture to yourself the very kennels flow with river of beer imagine the door of every hospitable ale-house throughout the kingdom throw open for the reception of the ragged and pennyless burgess imagine the whole country fill with the shout of drunkenness and the air rent with mingled huzza represent the broken head and the bleeding nose the tattered raiment and staggering body of a million of loyal voter my lord will they pretend that the measure that give birth to this glorious scene be unpopular we must be very ill verse in the science of human nature if we could believe they but a more important consideration arise a general election would be of little value if by means of it a majority of representative be not to be gain to the aristocratical party if i be to disadvise a dissolution it would be from the fear of a sinister event it be true you lordship have a thousand soft blandishments you can smile and bow in the newest and most approve manner but my lord in the midst of a parcel of billingsgate fishwoman in the midst of a circle of butcher with marrow-bone and cleaver i be afraid these accomplishment would be of little avail it be he most noble patron who can swallow the greatest quantity of porter who can roar the best catch and who be the compleatest bruiser that will finally carry the day he must kiss the frost-bitten lip of the green-grocer he must smooth the frowzy cheek of chandlers-shop woman he must stroke down the infinite belly of a wapping landlady i see you lordship tremble at the very catalogue could you divide yourself into a thousand part and every part be ten time more gigantic than the whole you would shrink into non-entity at the disgustful scene in this emergency i can invent only one expedient you lordship i remember have six different service of plate when you be in ireland and the duke of p -- could boast only of three you have also five footman and a scullion boy more than he grace by all this magnificence i have be tell that you dazzle and enchant a certain class of the good people of that kingdom my lord you must now improve the popularity you gain import by the very first hoy a competent number of chairman you be not to be tell that they be accustom to put on a gold-lace coat as soon as they arrive upon we shore and dub themselves fortune-hunter it will be easy therefore to pass they here for gentleman whose low familiarity shall be construe into the most ravishing condescension no man my lord can drink better than they there be no constitution but that of a irish chairman that can dispense with the bounce whisky they be both brawny and courageous and must therefore make excellent bruiser they chief talent lie in the art of courtship and they be by no means nice and squeamish in they stomach for a mistress they can also occasionally put off the assume character of good breeding and if it be necessary to act over again the celebrated scene of balfe and m ` quirk they would not be find at a loss my lord they seem to have be create for this very purpose and if you have any hope from a general election you must derive every benefit from they distinguish merit i own however i be apprehensive for the experiment and after all would advise you lordship to recur to the very excellent scheme of the common-council man there be only one point more which it remain for I to discuss i have already take it for grant that you be offer you choice of every post that exist in the government of this country here again if you be to consult friend less know than myself you would be present with nothing but jarring and discordant opinion some would say george take it and some george let it alone for my part my lord i would advise you to do neither the one nor the other fickleness and instability you lordship will please to observe be of the very essence of a real statesman who be the greatest statesman this country ever have to boast they be my lord the two villier 's duke of buckingham do not the first of these take he young master to the kingdom of spain in order to marry the infanta and then break off the match for no cause at all do he not afterwards involve the nation in a quarrel with the king of france only because she most christian majesty would not let he go to bed to she what be the character of the second duke this nobleman stiff in opinion always in the wrong be every thing by start and nothing long but in the course of one revolve moon be chymist fiddler statesman and buffoon my lord i do not flatter you so far as to suppose that you ability be as great or that you will ever make so distinguish a figure as either of these nobleman but i would have you imitate they in you humbler circle and venture greatly though the honor you should derive from it should be only that you greatly fall accept therefore my lord of one of the principal responsible office without thought and without hesitation through terror or manly spirit or whatever you choose to call it resign again the next day as soon as you have do this make interest for another place and if you can obtain it throw it up as soon again this my lord be not as a ignorant and coxcomical writer have represent it the vibration of a pendulum but a conduct wise manly judicious and heroic who do not know that the twinkling star be of a more excellent nature than those which shine upon we with unremitted lustre who do not know that the comet which appear for a short time and vanish again for revolving year be more gaze upon than either but i be afraid the comet be too sublime a idea for you lordship 's comprehension i would therefore recommend to you to make the cracker the model of you conduct you should snap and bounce at regular interval at one moment you should seem a blaze star and the next be lose in trackless darkness my lord there be nothing which at all time i have take more pain to subdue than that overweening pride and immeasurable conceit which be the principal feature of you lordship 's character nature indeed have furnish you with one corrective to they or they must infallibly have damned you it be timidity other people may laugh at this quality for my part i esteem it worthy the loudest praise and most assiduous cultivation when the balance hang in doubt between the adventurousness of vanity and the frigidity of fear ever incline to the latter side i have rather you lordship should be a coward than a coxcomb if however you could attain to that reasonable and chastise opinion of yourself which should steer a proper mean between these extreme should make you feel you strength when menace by the most terrible adversary and you weakness when soothe by the most fawn parasite this my lord would be the highest perfection to which you could possibly attain i will therefore close my epistle with the discussion of a case which you lordship may think parallel to the species of behavior i have recommend to you cultivation i mean that of the celebrated and incomparable earl granville in the year 1746 i will show you what this nobleman do and in how many particulars you must for ever hope in vain to resemble he i remember my lord that you and i once study together the history of england in question and answer if you lordship recollect the year 1746 begin in the very height of the celebrated rebellion the minister of the sovereign at this time be that mixed and plausible character mr pelham and that immortalize booby the duke of newcastle these gentleman possess they full proportion of that passion so universally incident to the human frame the love of power they have form such a connection with the monied interest of the kingdom that no administration could go on without they conscious to this circumstance they have no toleration for a rival they could bear no brother near the throne from this sentiment they have drive that most able minister i have mention from the cabinet of he sovereign in no very justifiable manner about twelve month before the same jealousy keep alive they suspicion : they know the partiality of they master : they imagine they antagonist still lurk behind the curtain the distress of the kingdom be to they the ladder of ambition this be the language they hold to they sovereign : the enemy be already advance into the heart of you majesty 's dominion we know that you can not do without we you must therefore listen with patience to what we shall dictate drive from you presence for ever the wisest and the ablest of all you counsellor this be the only condition upon which we will continue to serve you in this perilous moment majesty as it be but natural be disgust with this language the pelham resign lord granville accept the seal and he hold they i believe for something more than a fortnight my lord i will tell you what be the pelham and what be the true character of lord granville whatever may be say and much i think may justly be say in favor of the former they be not man of genius capable of conduct and willing upon the whole to conduct with loyalty and propriety the affair of they country while they keep within the beaten channel they be not bear to grapple with arduous situation they have not that command spirit of adventure which lead a man into the path of supererogation and voluntary service : they have not that firm and collect fortitude which induce a man to look danger in the face to encounter it in all its force and to drive it from all its retrenchment they be particularly attach to the patronage which be usually annex to they high situation they do not come into power by the voice of the people they be not summon to assume the administration by a vote of the house of common they be introduce into the cabinet by a inglorious and guilty compromise of sir robert walpole a compromise that shun the light a compromise that reflect indelible disgrace upon every individual concerned in it we will suppose they ever so much in the right in the instance before we for certainly the same responsibility that ought to remove a minister from the helm when he be become obnoxious to he countryman equally make it improper that he should be originally appoint by the fancy or capricious partiality of the sovereign but be they over so much in the right it will yet remain true that they take a poor and ungenerous advantage of the personal distress of they master which man of a large heart and of sterling genius could never have persuade themselves to take such be the minister whom it appear that king george the second would have have no objection to strip of they employment i will tell you who it be that he be willing to have substitute in they place it be a man of infinite genius he taste be a standard to those who be most attach to the fine art and most uninterruptedly conversant with they he eloquence be splendid animated and engaging of all the statesman then exist in europe he be perhaps the individual who best understand the interest and the politics of all she court but you lordship may probably find it somewhat more intelligible if i take the other side of the picture and tell you what he be not he be not a man of fawn and servility he do not rest he ambitious pretension upon any habitual adroitness upon the art of wheedling and the tone of insinuation he rest they upon the most solid talent and the most brilliant accomplishment he do not creep into the closet of he sovereign uncalled and endeavor to make himself of consequence by assiduity and officiousness he plead for year in a manly and ingenuous manner the cause of the people in parliament it be by a popularity great and almost without exception that he be introduce into power when defeat by the undermine and contemptible art of he rival when convince that it be impossible for he to employ he ability with success in the service of he country he retire and it be only by the personal intreaty of he sovereign and to assist he in that arduous and difficult situation in which those who ought to have serve desert he that he once again accept of office he accept it for the

will be open on Monday the fourth day of August at epsom in surrey for the instruction of twelve pupil in the greek latin french and english language mdcclxxxiii a account of the seminary & c the two principal object of human power be government and education they have accordingly engross a very large share in the disquisition of the speculative in all age the subject of the former indeed be man already endowed with he greatest force of body and arrive at the exercise of he intellectual power : the subject of the latter be man as yet shut up in the feebleness of childhood and the imbecility of inexperience civil society be great and unlimited in its extent the time have be when the whole known world be in a manner unite in one community : but the sphere of education have always be limit it be for nation to produce the event that enchant the imagination and ennoble the page of history : infancy must always pass away in the unimportance of mirth and the privacy of retreat that government however be a theme so much superior to education be not perhaps so evident as we may at first imagine it be indeed wider in its extent but it be infinitely less absolute in its power the state of society be incontestibly artificial the power of one man over another must be always derive from convention or from conquest by nature we be equal the necessary consequence be that government must always depend upon the opinion of the govern let the most oppressed people under heaven once change they mode of thinking and they be free but the inequality of parent and child be the law of we nature eternal and uncontrolable -- government be very limit in its power of make man either virtuous or happy it be only in the infancy of society that it can do any thing considerable in its maturity it can only direct a few of we outward action but we moral disposition and character depend very much perhaps entirely upon education -- child indeed be weak and imbecil but it be the imbecility of spring and not that of autumn the imbecility that verge towards power and not that be already exhaust with performance to behold heroism in its infancy and immortality in the bud must be a most attractive object to mould those pliant disposition upon which the happiness of multitude may one day depend must be infinitely important proportionable to what we have state to be the importance of the subject be the attention that have be afford it in the republic of letter the brightest wit and the profoundest philosopher have emulate each other in they endeavor to elucidate so valuable a theme in vain have pedant urge the stamp of antiquity and the approbation of custom there be scarcely the scheme so visionary the execution of which have not at some time or other be attempt of the writer upon this interesting subject he perhaps that have produce the most valuable treatise be rousseau if man of equal ability have explore this ample field i know of none however who have so thoroughly investigate the first principle of the science or who have treat it so much at large if he have indulge to a thousand agreeable vision and wander in the pursuit of many a specious paradox he have however richly repay we for this defect by the profoundest research and the most solid discovery i have borrow so many of my idea from this admirable writer that i think it necessary to make this acknowledgement in the outset the learn reader will readily perceive that if i have not scruple to profit from he discovery at least i have freely and largely dissent from he where he appear to I to wander from the path of truth for my own part i be persuade that it can only be by strike off something of inflexibility from he system and something of pedantry from the common one that we can expect to furnish a medium equally congenial to the elegance of civilization and the manliness of virtue in pursuance of these principle it shall be my first business to enquire whether or not the language ought to make any part of a perfect system of education and if they ought at what time they should be commence the study of they do indeed still retain its ground in we public school and university but it have receive a rude shock from some writer of the present age nor have any attack be more formidable than that of the author of emile let we endeavor to examine the question neither with the cold prejudice of antiquity on the one hand nor on the other with the too eager thirst of novelty and unbounded admiration of the genius by whom it have be attack when we look back to the venerable ancient we behold a class of writer if not of a much higher rank at least of a very different character from the modern one natural advantage they indisputably possess the field of nature be all they own it have not yet be blast by any vulgar breath or touch with a sacrilegious hand its fairest flower have not be cull and its choicest sweet rifle before they as they be not encumber and hedge in with the multitude of they predecessor they do not servilely borrow they knowledge from book they read it in the page of the universe they study nature in all she romantic scene and all she secret haunt they study man in the various rank of society and in different nation of the world i might add to this several other advantage of these the noble freedom of mind that be characteristic of the republican of greece and rome and that have scarcely any parallel among ourselves would not be the least agreeably to these advantage they almost every where particularly among the greek bear upon they the stamp of originality all copy be feeble and unmarked they sacrifice the plainness of nature to the gaudiness of ornament and the tinsel of wit but the ancient be full of a noble and affect simplicity by one touch of nature and observation they paint a scene more truly than they successor be able to do in whole wire-drawn page in description they be unequalled they eloquence be fervent manly and sonorous they thought be just natural independent and profound the pathos of virgil and the sublimity of homer have never be surpass and as they knowledge be not acquire in learn indolence they know how to join the severest application with the brightest genius accordingly in they style they have unite simplicity eloquence and harmony in a manner of which the modern have seldom have even a idea the correctness of a caesar and the sonorous period of a cicero the majesty of a virgil and the politeness of a horace be such as no living language can express it be the remark of a certain old-fashioned writer the form of the world passeth away a century or two ago the greatest wit be know to have pathetically lament that the writer of whose merit i have be speak be hand down to we in so mutilate a condition now it seem very probable that if they work be totally annihilate it would scarcely call forth a sigh from the refine genius of the present age it be certainly very possible to carry the passion for antiquity to a ridiculous extreme no man can reasonably deny that it be by we only that the true system of the universe have be ascertain and that we have make very valuable improvement upon many of the art no man can question that some of we english poet have equal the ancient in sublimity and that to say the least we neighbor the french have emulate the elegance of they composition in a manner that be very far indeed from contempt from these concession however we be by no means authorise to infer they inutility but i shall be tell that in the first revival of letter the study of the ancient language might indeed be very proper but since that time we have have so many excellent truncation of every thing they contain that to waste the time and exhaust the activity of we youth in the learning of latin and greek be to very little purpose indeed translation what a strange word to I i confess it appear the most unaccountable invention that ever enter into the mind of man to distil the glowing conception and to travesty the beautiful language of the ancient through the medium of a language estrange to all its peculiarity and all its elegancy the best thought and expression of a author those that distinguish one writer from another be precisely those that be least capable of be translate and who be the man we be to employ in this promising business original genius disdain the unmeaning drudgery a mind that have one feature resemble the ancient will scarcely stoop to be they translator the person then to whom the performance must be commit be person of cool elegance endowed with a little barren taste they must be inanimate enough to tread with laborious imbecility in the footstep of another they must be eternally incapable of imbibe the spirit and glowing with the fire of they original but we shall seldom come off so well as this the generality of translator be either on the one hand mere pedant and dealer in word who understand the grammatical construction of a period never give themselves the trouble to enquire whether it convey either sentiment or instruction or on the other hand mere writer for hire the retainer of a bookseller man who translate homer from the french and horace out of creech let it not be say that i be now talk at random let we descend to example we need not be afraid of instancing in the most favourable i believe it be generally allow that mr pope 's iliad be the very best version that be ever make out of one language into another it must be confess to exhibit very many poetical beauty as a trial of skill as a instance of what can be effect upon so forlorn a hope it must ever be admire but be i to search for a true idea of the style and composition of homer i think i should rather recur to the verbal translation in the margin of the original than to the version of pope homer be the simplest and most unaffected of poet of all the writer of elegance and taste that ever exist he translator be the most ornamented we acknowledge homer by he loose and flowing robe that do not constrain a muscle of he frame but pope present himself in the close and ungraceful habit of modern time glitter with gem and stiff with weave gold no let we for once conduct ourselves with honesty and generosity if we will not study the ancient in they own nervous and manly page let we close they volume for ever i have rather say the amiable philosopher of chaeronea it should be say of I that there never be such a man as plutarch than that plutarch be ill-natured arbitrary and tyrannical and be i the bard of venusium sure i be i have rather be entirely forget than not be know for the polite the spirited and the elegant writer i really be to converse with the accomplish be the obvious method by which to become accomplished ourselves this general observation be equally applicable to the study of polite writer of we own and of other country but there be some reason upon account of which we may expect to derive a more perceptible advantage from the ancient they carry the art of composition to greater height than any of the modern they writer be almost universally of a higher rank in society than ours there do not then exist the temptation of gain to spur man on to the profession of a author a industrious modern will produce twenty volume in the time that socrate employ to polish one oration another argument flow from the simple circumstance of they writing in a different language of all the requisite to the attainment either of a style of we own or a discernment in that of other the first be grammar without this we idea must be always vague and desultory respect the delicacy of composition we may guess but we can never decide and demonstrate now of the minutiae of grammar scarcely any man ever attain a just knowledge who be acquaint with only one language and if the study of other be the surest i will venture also to pronounce it the easiest method for acquire a mastery in philology from what have be say i shall consider this conclusion as sufficiently establish that the language ought at some time to be learn by he who would form to himself a perfect character i proceed to my second enquiry at what time the study of they should be commence and here i think this to be the best general answer : at the age of ten year in favor of so early a period one reason may be derive from what i have just be mention the knowledge of more language than one be almost a indispensible prerequisite to the just understand either of the subject of grammar in particular or of that of style in general now if the cultivation of elegance and propriety be at all important it can not be enter upon too soon provide the idea be already competent to the capacity of the pupil the roman cornelium who never suffer a provincial accent or a grammatical barbarism in the hearing of she child have always be cite with commendation and the subsequent rhetorical excellence of the gracchus have be in a great degree ascribe to it fluency purity and ease be to be acquire by insensible degree : and against habit of this kind i apprehend there can be no objection another argument of still greater importance be that the knowledge of language have scarcely ever be master but by those the commencement of whose acquaintance with they be early to be acquaint with any science slightly and superficially can in my opinion be productive of little advantage but such a acquaintance with language must be very useless indeed what benefit can it be expect that we should derive from a author whom we can not peruse with facility and pleasure the study of such a author will demand a particular strength of resolution and aptitude of humor he can scarcely become the favorite companion of we retirement and the never-failing solace of we care something of slow and saturnine must be the necessary accompaniment of that disposition that can conquer the difficulty of such a pursuit and accordingly we find that the classic and the school be generally quit together even by person of taste who have not acquire a competent mastery of they in they course of education very few indeed have be those who estrange to the language till the age of manhood have after that period obtain such a familiarity with they as could ever be productive of any considerable advantage brute and savage be totally unacquainted with lassitude and spleen the lust of variety and the impatience of curiosity in a state of society we idea habitually succeed in a certain proportion and a employment that retard they progress speedily become disagreeable and tedious but child not have yet feel this effect of civilization be not susceptible to this cause of disgust they be endowed with a pliableness and versatility of mind that with a little attention and management may easily be turn to any pursuit they understanding not yet preoccupy they have a singular facility of apprehend and strength of retention it be certain this pliableness and facility be very liable to abuse it be not easy to believe that they be give to learn word without mean term of art not understand by the pupil the system of theologian and the jargon of metaphysics but then neither be they give without a capacity of be turn to advantage and it should seem that it could not be a very fallacious antidote to abuse to confine we instruction to such kind of knowledge as be of the highest importance and be seldom learn with success and even scarcely attainable at any other period let it be observe that i have not fix upon the age of ten year at random it be the observation of rousseau both child and man be essentially feeble child because however few be they want they be unable to supply they man in a state of society because whatever be they absolute strength the play of the imagination render they desire yet greater there be a intermediate period in which we power have make some progress and the artificial and imaginary want be unknown we be relatively strong and this he represent as the principal period of instruction this remark be indeed still more striking when apply to a pupil the progress of whose imagination be sedulously retard but it be not destitute either of truth or utility in the most general application we can possibly give it let it be observe that rousseau fix the commencement of this period at twelve year i would choose to take it at ten however we may find it convenient to distribute the production of nature into class and she operation into epocha yet let it be remember that she progress be silent and imperceptible between a perfect animal and vegetable the distinction be of the highest order between distant period we may remark the most important difference but the gradation of nature be uninterrupted of she chain every link be compleat as therefore i shall find in commence at ten year that my time will be barely sufficient for the purpose to which i would appropriate it i consider this circumstance as sufficient to determine my election a youth of ten year be omnipotent if we contrast he with a youth of eight but if the language constitute so valuable a part of a just system of education the next question be in what manner they be to be teach indeed i believe if the person employ in the business of education have take half the pain to smooth the access to this department of literature that they have employ to plant it round with briar and thorn its utility and propriety in the view we be now consider it would scarcely have be question there be something necessarily disgust in the form of grammar grammar therefore be make in we public school the business of a twelvemonth rule be heap upon rule with laborious stupidity to render they the more formidable they be present to we youth in the very language the first principle of which they be design to teach for my own part i be persuade the whole business of grammar may be dispatch in a fortnight i would only teach the declension of noun and the inflexion of verb for the rest nothing be so easily demonstrate as that the auxiliary science be best communicate in connection with they principal chronology geography be never so thoroughly understand as by he that treat they literally as the handmaid of history he who be instruct in latin with clearness and accuracy will never be at a loss for the rule of grammar but to complete the disgust we seem so careful to inspire the learn language be ever surround with the severity verity of discipline and it would probably be think little short of sacrilege to discompose they feature with a smile such a mode of proceeding can never be sufficiently execrated indeed i shall be tell this be the time to correct the native vice of the mind in childhood the influence of pain and mortification be comparatively trifling what then can be more judicious than to accumulate upon this period what must otherwise fall with tenfold mischief upon the age of maturity in answer to this reasoning let it be first consider how many there be who by the sentence of nature be call out of existence before they can live to reap these boast advantage which of you be there that have not at some time regret that age in which a smile be ever upon the countenance and peace and serenity at the bottom of the heart how be it you can consent to deprive these little innocent of a enjoyment that slide so fast away how be it you can find in you heart to pall these fleeting year with bitterness and slavery the undesigning gaiety of youth have the strongest claim upon you humanity there be not in the world a truer object of pity than a child terrify at every glance and watch with anxious uncertainty the caprice of a pedagogue if he survive the liberty of manhood be dearly buy by so many heart ache and if he die happy to escape you cruelty the only advantage he derive from the suffering you have inflict be that of not regret a life of which he know nothing but the torment but who be it that have tell you that the certain or even the probable consequence of this severity be beneficial nothing be so easily prove as that the human mind be pure and spotless as it come from the hand of god and that the vice of which you complain have they real source in those shallow and contemptible precaution that you pretend to employ against they of all the condition to which we be incident there be none so unpropitious to whatever be ingenuous and honorable as that of a slave it pluck away by the root all sense of dignity and all manly confidence in those nation of antiquity most celebrate for fortitude and heroism they youth have never they haughty and unsubmitting neck bow to the inglorious yoke of a pedagogue to borrow the idea of that gallant assertor of humanity sir richard steele : i will not say that we public school have not produce many great and illustrious character but i will assert there be not one of those character that would not have be more manly and venerable if they have never be subject to this vile and sordid condition have thus set aside the principal corruption of modern education the devise method for facilitate the acquisition of language will not be difficult the first book put into the hand of a pupil should be simple interesting and agreeable by they means he will perceive a reasonableness and a beauty in the pursuit if he be endow by nature with a clear understanding and the smallest propensity to literature he will need very little to stimulate he either from hope or fear attentive to the native gaiety of youth the period in which he attention be require though frequent in they return should in they duration be short and inoppressive the pupil should do nothing merely because he be see or hear by he preceptor if he have companion still nothing more be requisite than that degree of silence and order which shall hinder the attention of any from be involuntarily divert the pupil have nothing to conceal and no need of falsehood the approbation of the preceptor respect only what come directly under he cognizance and can not be disguise even here remember the volatility and sprightliness inseparable from the age humanity will induce he not to animadvert with warmth upon the appearance of a casual distraction but he will rather solicit the return of attention by gentleness than severity but of all rule the most important be that of preserve a uniform even tenor of conduct into the government of youth passion and caprice should never enter the gentle yoke of the preceptor should be confound as much as possible with the eternal law of nature and necessity the celebrated maxim of republican government should be adopt here the law should speak and the magistrate be silent the constitution should be for ever unchangeable and independent of the character of he that administer it nothing can certainly be more absurd than the attempt to educate child by reason we may be sure they will treat every determination as capricious that shock they inclination the _ chef d'oeuvre _ of a good education be to form a reasonable human being and yet they pretend to govern a child by argument and ratiocination this be to enter upon the work at the wrong end and to endeavor to convert the fabric itself into one of the tool by which it be construct the law of the preceptor ought to be as final and inflexible as they be mild and humane there be yet another method for facilitate the acquisition of language so just in itself and so universally practicable that i can not forbear mention it it be that of commence with the modern language french for instance in this country these in the education of we youth be universally postpone to what be stile the learn language i shall perhaps be tell that modern tongue be in a great measure derive from the latin the latter be very properly to be consider as introductory to the former but why then do we not adopt the same conduct in every instance why to the latin do we not premise the greek and to the greek the coptic and oriental tongue or how long since be it that the synthetic have be prove so much superior to the analytic mode of instruction in female education the modern language be teach without all this preparation nor do i find that we fair rival be at all inferior to the generality of we sex in they proficiency with the youth of sense and spirit of both sex the learning of french be usually consider rather as a pleasure than a burden be the latin communicate in the same mild and accommodate manner i think i may venture to pronounce that thus take in the second place there will be no great difficulty in render it equally attractive i would just observe that there be a obvious propriety in the french language be learn under the same direction as the latin and greek the pursuit of this elegant accomplishment ought at no time to be entirely omit but the attention of youth be distract between the method of different master and they amiable confidence in the direction under which they be place entirely ruin by mutability and inconstance the same observation may also be apply here as in the learn language the attention of the pupil should be confine as much as possible to the most classical writer and the french would furnish a most useful subsidiary in a course of history let I add that though i have prescribe the age of ten year as the most eligible for the commencement of classical education i conceive there would be no impropriety in take up the modern language so early as nine such then be the kind of subjection that the learning of language demand the question that recur upon we be how far this subjection may fairly be consider as exceptionable and whether its beneficial consequence do not infinitely outweigh the trifling inconvenience that may still be ascribe to it but there be another subject that demand we consideration modern education not only corrupt the heart of we youth by the rigid slavery to which it condemn they it also undermine they reason by the unintelligible jargon with which they be overwhelm in the first instance and the little attention that be give to the accommodate they pursuit to they capacity in the second nothing can have a greater tendency to clog and destroy the native activity of the mind than the profuseness with which the memory of child be load by nurse by mother by master what can more corrupt the judgment than the communicate without measure and without end word entirely devoid of mean what can have a more ridiculous influence upon we taste than for the first verse to which we attention be demand to consist of such strange and uncouth jargon to complete the absurdity and that we may derive all that elegance and refinement from the study of language that it be calculate to afford we first idea of latin be to be collect from such author as corderius erasmus eutropius and the selecta to begin indeed with the classical writer be not the way to smooth the path of literature i be of opinion however that one of the above-mentioned author will be abundantly sufficient let it be remember that the passage from the introductory study to those author that form the very essence of the language will be much facilitate by the previous acquisition of the french have speak of the article of memory let I be permit to mention the practice that have of late gain so great a vogue the instruct child in the art of spout and act play of all the quality incident to human nature the most universally attractive be simplicity the most disgusting be affectation now what idea have a child of the passion of a hero and the distress of royalty but he be teach the most vehement utterance and a thousand constrain cadence without its be possible that he should see in they either reasonableness or propriety i would not have a child require to commit any thing to memory more than be absolutely necessary if however he be a youth of spirit he will probably learn some thing in this manner and the sooner because it be not expect of he it will be of use for he to repeat these with a grave and distinct voice accommodate to those cadence which the comma the period and the note of interrogation mark in he author may require but without the smallest instruction to humor the gay or to sadden the plaintive another article that make a conspicuous figure in the education of we youth be composition before they be acquaint with the true difference between verse and prose before they be prepare to decide upon the poetical merit of lily and virgil they be call upon to write latin verse themselves in the same manner some of they first prose composition be in a dead language a uniform petty ridiculous scheme be lay down and within that scheme all they thought be to be circumscribe composition be certainly a desirable art and i think can scarcely be enter upon too soon it should be one end after which i would endeavor and the mode of effect it will be farther illustrate in the sequel to solicit a pupil to familiarity and to induce he to disclose he thought upon such subject as be competent to he capacity in a honest and simple manner after have thus warm he by degree it might be proper to direct he to write down he thought without any prescribed method in the natural and spontaneous manner in which they flow from he mind thus the talk of throw he reflection upon paper would be facilitate to he and he style gradually form without teach he any kind of restraint and affectation to the reader who enter at all into my idea upon the subject it be needless to subjoin that i should never think of put a youth upon the composition of verse from all i have say it will be sufficiently evident that it would be a constant object with I to model my instruction to the capacity of my pupil they be book that beyond all thing teach we to talk without think and use word without mean to this evil there can be no complete remedy but shall we abolish literature because it be not unaccompanied with inconveniency shall we return to a state of savage ignorance because all the advantage of civilization have they attendant disadvantage the only remedy that can be apply be to accustom ourselves to clear and accurate investigation to prefer whereever we can have recourse to it the book of nature to any human composition to begin with the latter as late as may be consistent with the most important purpose of education and when we do begin so to arrange we study as that we may commence with the simplest and easiest science and proportion we progress to the understanding of the pupil with respect to grammar in particular the declension of noun and the inflexion of verb we may observe that to learn word to which absolutely no idea be affix be not to learn to think loosely and to believe without be convince these certainly can never corrupt the mind and i suppose no one will pretend that to learn grammar be to be lead to entertain inaccurate notion of the subject about which it be particularly conversant on the contrary the idea of grammar be exceedingly clear and accurate it have in my opinion all those advantage by which the study of geometry be usually recommend without any of its disadvantage it tend much to purge the understanding to render it close in its investigation and sure in its decision it introduce more easily and intelligibly than mathematical science that most difficult of all the mental operation abstraction it imperceptibly enlarge we conception and generalise we idea but if to read its author be the most valuable purpose of learn a language the grammar will not be sufficient other book will be necessary and how shall these be choose so as not to leave behind we the understanding of we pupil shall we introduce he first to the sublime flight of virgil the philosophical investigation of a cicero or the refine elegance and gay satire of horace alas if thus introduce unprepared to the noblest height of science how can it be expect that he understanding should escape the shipwreck and every atom of common sense not be dash and scatter ten thousand way the study then i would here introduce should be that of history and that this study be not improper to the age with which i connect it be the second point i would endeavor to demonstrate but be history i shall be ask the study so proper for uninstructed mind history that may in some measure be consider as concentring in itself the element of all other science history by which we be inform of the rise and progress of every art and by whose testimony the comparative excellence of every art be ascertain history the very testimony of which be not to be admit without the previous trial of metaphysical scrutiny and philosophic investigation lastly history that be to be consider as a continual illustration of the art of fortification and tactic but above all of politics with its various appendage commerce manufacture finances to all this i calmly answer no : it be not history in any of these form that constitute the science to which i would direct the attention of my pupil of the utility of the history of art and science at least as a general study i have no very high opinion but be my opinion ever so exalted i should certainly chuse to postpone this study for the present i should have as little to do with tactic and fortification i would avoid as much as possible the very subject of war politics commerce finances might easily be defer i would keep far aloof from the nicety of chronology and the dispute of fact i would not enter upon the study of history through the medium of epitome i would even postpone the general history of nation to the character and action of particular man many of the article i have mention serve to compose the pedantry of history than history no science have be more abused it have be study from ostentation it have be study with the narrow view of little mind it have be warped to serve a temporary purpose ingenious art have hang it round with a thousand subtlety and a thousand dispute the time have at length arrive when it require a erect understanding and a penetrate view above the common rate to discover the noble purpose which this science be most immediately calculate to subserve in a word the fate of history have be like that of travel the institution have be preserve but its original use be lose one man travels from fashion and another from pride one man travels to measure building another to examine picture and a third perhaps to learn to dance scarcely any remember that its true application be to study man and manners perhaps a juster idea can not be give of the science we be consider than that which we may deduce from a reflection of rousseau the ancient historian say he be crowd with those view of thing from which we may derive the utmost utility even though the fact that suggest they should be mistaken but we be unskilled to derive any real advantage from history the critique of erudition absorb every thing as if it import we much whether the relation be true provide we could extract from it any useful induction man of sense ought to regard history as a tissue of fable whose moral be perfectly adapt to the human heart the mere external action of man be not worth the study : who would have ever think of go through a course of history if the science be comprise in a set of chronological table no : it be the heart of man we should study it be to they action as expressive of disposition and character we should attend but by what be it that we can be advance thus far but by specious conjecture and plausible inference the philosophy of a sallust and the sagacity of a tacitus can only advance we to the region of probability but whatever be the most perfect mode of historical composition it be to the simplest writer that we youth should be first introduce writer equally distant from the dry detail of du fresnoy and the unrivalled eloquence of a livy the translation of plutarch would in my opinion form the best introduction as he be not a writer of particular elegance he suffer less from a version than many other the roman revolution of vertot might very properly fill the second place each of these writer have this further recommendation that at least in the former part of they work they treat of that simplicity and rectitude of manners of the first greek and roman that furnish the happiest subject that can be devise for the initiate youth in the study of history under the restriction i have lay down history be of all science the most simple it have be ever consider by philosopher as the porch of knowledge it have ever be treat by man of literature as the relaxation of they feverer pursuit it lead directly to the most important of all attainment the knowledge of the heart it introduce we without expence and without danger to a acquaintance with manners and society by the most natural advance it point we forward to all the depths of science with the most attractive blandishments it form we by degree to a inextinguishable thirst of literature but there be still a objection remain and that the most important of all let history be strip as much as you will of every extraneous circumstance let it be narrow to the utmost simplicity there be still one science previously necessary it be that of moral if you see nothing in human conduct but purely the exterior and physical movement what be it that history teach absolutely nothing and the science devoid of interest become incapable of afford either pleasure or instruction we may add that the more perfectly it be make a science of character and biography the more indispensible be ethical examination but to such a examination it have be doubt whether the understanding of child be competent upon this question i will beg leave to say a few word and i have do it be scarcely necessary to observe that i do not speak here of ethic as a abstract science but simply as it relate to practice and the oeconomy of human life we enquiry therefore be respect the time at which that intuitive faculty be generally awaken by which we decide upon the difference of virtue and vice and be impel to applaud the one and condemn the other the moment in which the faculty of memory begin to unfold itself the man begin to exist as a moral be not long posterior to this be the commencement of prescience and foresight rousseau have tell we in he animated language that if a child could escape a whipping or obtain a paper of sweetmeat by promise to throw himself out at window tomorrow the promise would instantly be make nothing be more contrary to experience than this it be true death or any such evil of which he have no clear conception do not strongly affect he in prospect but by the view of that which be palpable and striking he be as much influence as any man however extensive he knowledge however large he experience it be only by seize upon the activity and earnestness incident to youthful pursuit and totally banish the idea of what be future that we can destroy its influence they mind like a sheet of white paper be susceptible to every impression they brain uncrouded with a thousand confused trace be a cause that every impression they receive be strong and durable the aera of foresight be the aera of imagination and imagination be the grand instrument of virtue the mind be the seat of pleasure and pain it be not by what we see but by what we infer and suppose that we be teach that any be be the object of commiseration it be by the constant return of the mind to the unfortunate object that we be strongly impressed with sympathy hence it be that the too frequent recurrence of object of distress at the same time that it blunt the imagination render the heart callous and obdurate the sentiment that the person about we have life and feeling as well as ourselves can not be of very late introduction it may be forward by cultivation but it can scarcely at any rate be very much retard for this sentiment to become perfectly clear and striking and to be apply in every case that may come before we must undoubtedly be a affair gradual in its progress from thence to the feeling of right and wrong of compassion and generosity there be but one step it have i think be fully demonstrate by that very elegant philosopher mr hutcheson that self-love be not the source of all we passion but that disinterested benevolence have its seat in the human heart at present it be necessary for I to take this for grant the discussion would lead I too far from my subject what i would infer from it be that benevolent affection be capable of a very early commencement they do not wait to be graft upon the selfish they have the larger scope in youthful mind as such have not yet learn those refinement of interest that be incident to person of longer experience accordingly no observation be more common than that mankind be more generous in the earlier period of they life and that they affection become gradually contract the farther they advance in the vale of year confidence kindness benevolence constitute the entire temper of youth and unless these amiable disposition be blast in the bud by the baneful infusion of ambition vanity and pride there be nothing with which they would not part to cherish adversity and remunerate favor hence we may infer that the general idea of merit and character be perfectly competent to the understanding of child of ten year false glory be the farthest in the world from insinuate its witchcraft into the undepraved heart where the vain and malignant passion have not yet erect they standard it be true the peculiar sublimity of heroism can not be suppose perfectly within he comprehension but something of this sort as we have already say be incident to every step in the scale of literature but the more perfectly to familiarise to my pupil the understanding and digest whatever he read i would consider it as a indispensible part of my business to talk over with he familiarly the subject that might necessarily demand we attention i would lead he by degree to relate with clearness and precision the story of he author i would induce he to deliver he fair and genuine sentiment upon every action and character that come before we i would frequently call upon he for a plain and simple reason for he opinion this should always be do privately without ostentation and without rivalship thus separate from the danger of foment those passion of envy and pride that prepare at a distance for we youth so many mortification and at the expence of which too frequently this accomplishment be attain i would train he to deliver he opinion upon every subject with freedom perspicuity and fluency without at any time dictate to he the sentiment it become he to entertain i might with a little honed artifice mould he judgment into the form it be most desirable it should take at the same time that i discover he genius and ascertain the original propensity of he mind it be unnecessary for I to say any thing respect moral in the other sense of the word i mean as they be connect with the conduct the habit of which we should endeavor to cultivate in a pupil as that subject have be already exhaust the vice of youth spring not from nature who be equally the kind and blameless mother of all she child they derive from the defect of education we have already endeavor to shut up all the inlet of vice we have preclude servility and cowardice we have take away the motive to concealment and falshood by the liberal indulgence we have prescribe we have lay the foundation of manly spirit and generous dignity a continual attention to history accompany with the cultivation of moral discernment and animated with the example of heroic virtue could not fail to form the heart of the pupil to all that be excellent at the same time by assiduous care the shoot of vanity and envy might be crush in the bud emulation be a dangerous and mistaken principle of constancy instead of it i would wish to see the connection of pupil consist only of pleasure and generosity they should learn to love but not to hate each other benevolent action should not directly be preach to they they should strictly begin in the heart of the performer but when actually do they should receive the most distinguished applause let I be permit in this place to observe that the association of a small number of pupil seem the most perfect mode of education there be surely something unsuitable to the present state of mankind in the wish to educate we youth in perfect solitude society call forth a thousand power both of mind and body that must otherwise rust in inactivity and nothing be more clear from experience than that there be a certain tendency to moral depravation in very large body of this kind to which there have not yet be discover a sufficient remedy if by the pursuit of principle like these the power of the understanding and the heart might be develop in concert if the pupil be train at once to knowledge and virtue if they be enable to look back upon the period of they education without regret one instance of anxious terror or capricious severity if they recollect they tutor with gratitude and thought of they companion as of those generous friend whom they would wish for the associate of they life -- in that case the pain of the preceptor would not be throw away fini the herald of literature -lrb- price two shilling -rrb- the herald of literature

author of the monthly and critical review gentleman in present the follow sheet to the public i hope i shall not be consider as encroach upon that province which long possession have probably teach you to consider as you exclusive right the labor it have cost I and the many peril i have encounter to bring it to perfection will i trust effectually plead my pardon with person of you notorious candor and humanity represent to yourselve gentleman i entreat you the many false key bribe to the lacquey of author that can keep they and collusion with the bookseller of author that can not which be require in the prosecution of this arduous undertaking imagine to yourselve how often i have shudder upon the verge of petty larceny and how repeatedly my slumber have be disturb with vision of the

fear be recollect other man have snuff a candle with they finger but i would not be misunderstand heroical as i trust my undertaking prove I i fear no man 's censure and court no man 's applause but i look up to you as a respectable body of man who have long unite you effort to reduce the disproportioned member of a ancient republic to a happy equality to give wing to the little emmet of grub-street and to hew away the excrescence of lawless genius with a hatchet in this character i honor you that you have assume it uncompelled and self-elected that you have exercise it undazzled by the _ igni fatuus _ of genius be you unfading glory have thus clear myself from the suspicion of any sinister view i can not here refrain from present you with a peace-offering have it be in my power to procure gum more costly or incense more fragrant i would have render it more worthy you acceptance it have be a subject upon which i have often reflect with mortification that the world be too apt to lay aside you lucubration with the occasion that give birth to they and that if they be ever open after it be only with old magazine by staid matron over they winter fire such person be totally incapable of compare you sentence with the maturer verdict of the public a comparison that would redound so much to you honor what i design at present be in some measure to remedy a evil that can never perhaps be entirely remove as the field which be thus open to I be almost unbounded i will confine myself to two of the most striking example in tristram shandy and the rosciad of churchill in the monthly review vol 24 p 103 i find these word : but you indiscretion good mr tristram be not all we complain of in the volume before we we must tax you with what you will dread above the most terrible of all insinuation -- nothing less than dullness yes indeed mr tristram you be dull _ very dull _ you jaded fancy seem to have be exhaust by two pigmy octavo which scarce contain the substance of a twelve-penny pamphlet and we now find nothing new to entertain we the follow epithet be select at random we be sick -- we be quite tired -- we can no longer bear corporal trim 's insipidity -- thread-bare -- stupid and unaffecting -- absolutely dull -- misapplication of talent -- he will unavoidably sink into contempt the critical review vol ii p 212 have the follow account of the rosciad : it be _ natural _ for young author to conceive themselves the cleverest fellow in the world and withal that there be not the least degree of merit subsisting but in they own work : it be _ natural _ likewise for they to imagine that they may conceal themselves by appear in different shape and that they be not to be find out by they stile but little do these _ connoisseur _ in write conceive how easily they be discover by a veteran in the service in the title-page to this performance we be tell -lrb- by way of quaint conceit -rrb- that it be write by _ the author _ what if it should prove that the author and the actor -lrb- a -rrb- be the same certain it be that we meet with the _ same _ vein of peculiar humor the same turn of think the same _ autophilism _ -lrb- there be a new word for you to bring into the next poem -rrb- which we meet with in the other insomuch that we be ready to make the conclusion in the author 's own word : -lrb- footnote a : _ the actor a poem by robert lloyd esq _ -rrb- who be it ------ lloyd we will not pretend however absolutely to assert that mr l -- write this poem but we may venture to affirm that it be the production jointly or separately of the new triumvirate of wit who never let a opportunity slip of sing they own praise _ caw I caw thee _ as sawney say and so to it they go and _ scratch _ one another like so many scotch pedlar in page 339 i find a passage refer to in the index under the head of a notable instance of they candor retract they insinuation against lloyd and colman and ascribe the poem in a particular vein of pleasantry to mr flexney the bookseller and mr griffin the printer candor certainly do not require that they should acknowledge mr churchill whose name be now insert in the title-page as the author or if author of any at least not of a considerable part of the poem that this be they sense of the matter appear from they account of the apology for the rosciad p 409 this be another _ brutum fulinen _ launch at the critical review by one churchill who it seem be a clergyman and it must be own have a knack at versification a bard who upon the strength of have write a few good line in a thing call _ the rosciad _ swagger about as if he be game-keeper of parnassus p 410 this apologist have very little reason to throw out behind against the critical reviewer who in mention _ the rosciad _ of which he call himself author commend it in the lump without specify the bald line the false thought and tinsel frippery from which it be not entirely free they conclude with contrast he with smollet in comparison of whom he be a puny antagonist who must write many more poem as good as the rosciad before he will be consider as a respectable enemy upon these extract i will beg leave to make two observation 1 abstract from all consideration of the profundity of criticism that be display no man can avoid be strike with the humor and pleasantry in which they be conceive or the elegant and gentlemanlike language in which they be couch what can be more natural or more ingenuous than to suppose that the person principally commend in a work be themselves the writer of it and for that allusion of the scotch pedlar for my part i hold it to be inimitable 2 but what be most admirable be the independent spirit with which they stem the torrent of fashion and forestall the second thought of they countryman there be a time when tristram shandy be applaud and churchill thought another dryden but who read tristram now there prevail indeed a certain quaintness and something like a affectation of be immoderately witty throughout the whole work but for real humor not a grain so say the monthly reviewer -lrb- v 21 p 568 -rrb- and so say the immortal knox both indeed grant he a slight knack at the pathetic but if i may venture a prediction he pretension to the latter will one day appear no better found than he pretention to the former and then poor churchill he satire now appear to be dull and pointless through he tedious page no modern student can labor we look back and wonder how the rage of party ever swell this _ thing _ into a poet even the great constellation from whose tribunal no prudent man ever appeal have exclude he from a kingdom where watt and blackmore reign but johnson and knox can by no means compare with the reviewer these attack the mountebank in the very midst of they short-lived empire those have only bring up the rear of public opinion and damned author already forget they fight the battle a second time and again they slew the slay gentleman it would have be easy to add twenty article to this list i might have select instance from the later volume of you entertaining work in which you deviation from the dictate of imaginary taste be still more numerous but i could not have confront they with the decisive verdict of time the rage of fashion have not yet cease and the ebullition of blind wonder be not over i shall

congratulate the public upon the final accomplishment of a work that must constitute one of the greatest ornament of the present age we have now before we in one view and describe by the uniform pencil of one historian the stupendous and instructive object of the gradual decline of the greatest empire circumscribe by degree within the narrow wall of a single city and at length after the various revolution of thirteen century totally swallow up in the empire of the turk of this term the event of more than nine hundred year be describe in that part of we author that now lie before we it can not therefore be expect that in the narrow limit we have prescribe to ourselves we should enter into a regular synopsis of the performance chapter by chapter after the laudable example of we more laborious brother reviewer we will pay we reader the compliment however unauthorised by the venerable seal of custom of suppose they already inform that anastasius succeed zeno and justin anastasius that justinian publish the celebrated code that be call by he name and that he general belisarius and narse be almost constantly victorious over the barbarian and restore for a moment the expire lustre of the empire we shall confine ourselves to two extract relate to subject of the greatest importance and which we presume calculate at once to gratify and excite the curiosity of the public the reign of the emperor heraclius be perhaps more crowd with event of the highest consequence than that of any other prince in the series it have therefore a proportionable scope allot it in the plan of mr gibbon who seem to understand better than almost any historian what period to sketch with a light and active pen and upon what to dwell with minuteness and dilate he various power while we pursue the various adventure of cosro ii begin he reign in a flight from he capital city sue for the protection and support of the greek emperor soon after declare war against the empire successively conquer mesopotamium armenia syrium palestine egypt and the greater part of natolium then beat a fugitive and at last murder by he own son we be unable to conceive of a story more interesting or more worthy of we attention but in contemplate the rife of the saracen khalifate and the religion of mahomet which immediately succeed these event we be compel to acknowledge a more astonishing object the follow be the character of the impostor as sketch by the accurate and judicious pencil of we historian we will leave it to the judgment of we reader only observe that mr gibbon have very unnecessarily bring christianity into the comparison and have perhaps touch the error of the false prophet with a lighter hand that the disparity might be the less apparent but heraclius have a much more formidable enemy to encounter in the latter part of he reign than the effeminate and divided persian this be the new empire of the saracen ingenious and eloquent temperate and brave as have be invariably they national character they have they exertion concentr and they courage animated by a legislator whose institution may vie in the importance of they consequence with those of solon lycurgus or numa though a impostor he propagate a religion which like the elevated and divine principle of christianity be confine to no one nation or country but even embrace a larger portion of the human race than christianity itself mahomet the son of abdallah be bear on the 9th of April 571 in the city of mecca have be early leave a orphan by both parent he receive a hardy and robust education not temper by the elegancy of literature nor much allay by the indulgency of natural affection he be no sooner able to walk than he be send naked with the infant peasantry to attend the cattle of the village and be oblige to seek the refreshment of sleep as well as pursue the occupation of the day in the open air -lrb- a -rrb- he even pretend to be a stranger to the art of write and read but though neglect by those who have the care of he infancy the youth of this extraordinary personage do not pass away without some of those incident which might afford a glimpse of the sublimity of he genius and some of those prodigy with which superstition be prompt to adorn the story of the founder of nation and the conqueror of empire in the mean time he understanding be enlarged by travel it be not to be suppose that he frequent the neighbouring country without make some of those profound observation upon the decline of the two great empire of the east and of persium which be calculate to expand he view and to mature he project the energy of he mind lead he to despise the foppery of idolatry and he find the christian in the most unfavourable situation tear into innumerable party by the sectary of athanasius arius eutych nestorius in this situation he extract that from every system that border most nearly upon the dictate of reason and frame to himself a sublime doctrine of which the unity of god the innocence of moderate enjoyment the obligation of temperance and munificence be the lead principle but it would have contribute little to he purpose if he have stop here enthusiastically devote to he extensive design and guide by the most consummate art he pretend to divine communication relate a thousand ridiculous and incredible adventure and though he constantly refuse a prodigy to the importunity of he countryman lay claim to several frivolous miracle and a few thinly scatter prophecy one of he most artful device be the deliver the system of he religion not in one entire code but in detach essay this enable he more than once to new mould the very genius of he religion without glaringly subject himself to the charge of inconsistency from these fragment soon after he death be compile the celebrated alcoran the style of this volume be generally turgid heavy monotonous it be disfigure with childish tale and impossible adventure but it be frequently figurative frequently poetical sometimes sublime and amidst all its defect it will remain the greatest of all monument of uncultivated and illiterate genius -lrb- footnote a : abuleda chron p 27 boulainvillier vie de mahomet b ii p 175 this latter writer exhibit the singular phenomenon of the native of a christian country unreasonably prejudice in favor of the arabian impostor that he do not live however to finish he curious performance be the misfortune of the republic of letter -rrb- the plan be carefully reserve by mahomet for the mature age of forty year thus digest however and communicate with the nicest art and the most fervid eloquence he have the mortification to find he convert at the end of three year amount to no more than forty person but the ardor of this hero be invincible and he success be finally adequate to he wish previous to the famous aera of he flight from mecca he have teach he follower that they have no defense against the persecution of they enemy but invincible patience but the opposition he encounter obliged he to change he maxim he now inculcate the duty of extirpate the enemy of god and hold forth the powerful allurement of conquest and plunder with these he unite the theological dogma of predestination and the infallible promise of paradise to such as meet they fate in the field of war by these method he train a intrepid and continually increase army inflamed with enthusiasm and greedy of death he prepare they for the most arduous undertaking by continual attack upon travel caravan and scatter village : a pursuit which though perfectly consonant with the institution of he ancestor paint he to the civilized nation of europe in the obnoxious character of a robber by degree however he proceed to the greatest enterprize and compel the whole peninsula of arabium to confess he authority as a prince and he mission as a prophet he die like the grecian philip in the moment when have bring he native country to co-operate in one undertaking he meditate the invasion of distant climate and the destruction of empire the character of mahomet however be exceed different from that of philip and far more worthy of the attention of a philosopher philip be a mere politician who employ the cunning of a statesman and the revenue of a prince in the corruption of a number of fall and effeminate republic but mahomet without riches without rank without education by the mere ascendancy of he ability subject by persuasion and force a simple and generous nation that have never be conquer and lay the foundation of a empire that extend over half the globe and a religion capable of survive the fate of empire he scheme be always lay with the truest wisdom he live among a people celebrate for subtlety and genius : he never lay himself open to detection he eloquence be specious dignified and persuasive and he blended with it a lofty enthusiasm that awed those whom familiarity might have embolden and silence he enemy he be simple of demeanor and ostentatious of munificence and under these plausible virtue he screen the indulgence of he constitutional propensity the number of he concubine and he wife have be ambitiously celebrate by christian writer he sometimes acquire they by violence and injustice and he frequently dismiss they without ceremony he temper do not seem to have be naturally cruel but we may trace in he conduct the feature of a barbarian and a part of he severity may reasonably be ascribe to the plan of religious conquest that he adopt and that can never be reconcile with the rights of humanity after the victory of omar and the other successor of mahomet have in a manner strip the court of constantinople of all its province the byzantine history dwindle into a object petty and minute in order to vary the scene and enhance the dignity of he subject the author occasionally take a prospect of the state of rome and italy under the contend power of the papacy and the new empire of the west when the singular and unparalleled object of the crusade present itself the historian embrace the illustrious scene with apparent eagerness and bestow upon it a greater enlargement than might perhaps have be expect from the nature of he subject but not greater we confidently believe than be calculate to increase the pleasure that a reader of philosophy and taste may derive from the perusal as the immortal saladin be one of the most distinguished personage in this story we have select he character as a specimen of this part of the work no sooner however be the virtuous noureddin remove by death than the christian of the east have they attention still more forcibly alarm by the progress of the invincible saladin he have possess himself of the government of egypt first under the modest appellation of vizier and then with the more August title of soldan he abolish the dynasty of the fatemite khalif though noureddin have be the patron of he family and the father of he fortune yet be that hero no sooner expire than he invade the territory of he young and unwarlike successor he conquer the fertile and populous province of syrium he compel the saheb of mawsel to do he homage the prince of the frank already tremble for they possession and prepare a new and more solemn embassy to demand the necessary succor of they european brethren the quality of saladin be gilded with the lustre of conquest and it have be the singular fortune of this moslem hero to be paint in fairer color by the discordant and astonished christian than by those of he own courtier and countryman who may reasonably be suppose to have know he best he have be compare with alexander and tho ' he be usually stile and with some justice a barbarian it do not appear that he character would suffer in the comparison he conquest be equally splendid nor do he lead the force of a brave and generous people against a nation depress by slavery and relax with effeminacy under he banner saracen encounter saracen in equal strife or the force of the east be engage with the firmer and more disciplined army of the west like alexander he be liberal to profusion and while all he possess seem the property of he friend the monarch himself often want that which with unstinted hand he have heap upon he favorite and dependent he sentiment be elevated he manners polite and insinuate and the affability of he temper be never subdue but the parallel be exceedingly far from entire he possess not the romantic gallantry of the conqueror of darius he have none of those ardent and ungovernable passion through whose medium the victory of arbelum and issus have transform the generous hero into the lawless tyrant it be a maxim to which he uniformly adhere to accomplish he lofty design by policy and intrigue and to leave as little as possible to the unknown caprice of fortune in he mature age he be temperate gentle patient the passion of he soul and the necessity of nature be subordinate to the equanimity of he character -lrb- a -rrb- he deportment be grave and thoughtful he religion sincere and enthusiastic he be ignorant of letter and despise all learn that be not theological the cultivation that have obtain under the khalif have not entirely civilized the genius of saladin he maxim of war be indeed the maxim of the age and ought not to be adopt as a particular imputation but the action of he striking off with he own hand the head of a christian prince who have attack the defenceless caravan of the pilgrim of mecca exhibit to we view all the feature of a fierce and untutored barbarian -lrb- b -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : bohaoddin p 71 he be a eye witness and have a considerable share in many of the transaction of saladin he be generally accurate and

not be impertinent before we finally take we leave of it to attempt a idea of its celebrated author we be happy in this place to declare we opinion that no author ever better obey the precept of horace and boileau in choose a subject nicely correspondent to the talent he possess the character of this writer patient yet elegant accurate in enquiry acute in reflexion be peculiarly calculate to trace the flow and imperceptible decline of empire and to throw light upon a period darken by the barbarism of its hero and the confused and narrow genius of its author in a word we need not fear to class the performance with those that shall do lasting perhaps immortal honor to the country by which they have be produce but like many other work of this elevated description the time shall certainly come when the history before we shall no longer be find but in the library of the learn and the cabinet of the curious at present it be equally seek by old and young the learn and unlearned the macaroni the peer and the fine lady as well as the student and scholar but this be to be ascribe to the rage of fashion the performance be not naturally calculate for general acceptance it be by the very tenor of the subject intersperse with a thousand minute and elaborate investigation which in spite of perspicuous method and classical allusion will deter the idle and affright the gay nor can we avoid ascribe the undistinguishing and extravagant applause that have be bestow upon the style to the same source of fashion the rank the fortune the connexion of the writer it be indeed load with epithet and crowd with allusion but though the style be often raise the thought be always calm equal and rigidly classic the language be full of art but perfectly exempt from fire learning penetration accuracy polish any thing be rather the characteristic of the historian than the flow of eloquence and the flame of genius far therefore from class he in this respect with such writer as the immortal hume who have perhaps carry the english language to the highest perfection it be capable of reach we be incline to rank he below dr johnson though we be by no means insensible to the splendid fault of that admirable writer one word perhaps ought to be say respect mr gibbon 's treatment of christianity he wit be indeed by no means uniformly happy as where for instance he tell we that the name of _ le boeuf _ be remarkably apposite to the character of that antiquarian or where speaking of the indefatigable diligence of tillemont he inform we that the patient and sure-footed mule of the alp may be trust in the most slippery path but allow every thing for the happiness of he irony and set aside we private sentiment respect the justice of its application we can not help think it absolutely incompatible with the law of history for we own part we honestly confess that we have meet with more than one passage that have puzzle we whether it ought to be understand in jest or earnest the irony of a single word he must be a churl who would condemn but the continuance of this figure in serious composition throw truth and falsehood right and wrong into inextricable perplexity article ii the history of america by william robertson dd & c vol iii iv 4to the expectation of almost all rank have be as much excite by the present performance as perhaps by almost any publication in the record of literature the press have scarcely be able to keep pace with the eagerness of the public and the third edition be already announce before we have be able to gratify we reader with a account of this interesting work for a great historian to adventure a established name upon so recent and arduous a subject be a instance that have scarcely occur report be sometime ago industriously propagate that dr robertson have turn he attention to a very different subject and even when it be generally know that the present work be upon the eve of publication it be still question by many whether a writer so celebrated for prudence have not decline the more recent part of the north american history the motive of he conduct upon this head as they be state in the preface we shall here lay before we reader but neither the history of portuguese america nor the early history of we own settlement have constitute the most arduous part of the present publication the revolution which unfortunately for this country have recently take place in the british colony have excite the most general attention at the same time that it have render the gratification of public curiosity a matter of as much delicacy as necessity could this event have be foresee by I i should perhaps have be more cautious of enter into engagement with the public to embark upon a subject respect which the sentiment of my countryman have be so much divide and the hand of time have not yet collect the verdict of mankind while the person to whose lot it have fall to act the principal part upon the scene be almost all living be a task that prudence might perhaps refuse and modesty decline but circumstance as i be i have choose rather to consider these peculiarity as plea for the candor of my reader than as motive to withdraw myself from so important a undertaking i should ill deserve the indulgence i have experience from the public be i capable of withdraw from a task by which they curiosity might be gratify from any private inducement of inconvenience or difficulty we have already say and the reader will have frequent occasion to recollect it that we by no means generally intend a analysis of the several work that may come before we in the present instance we do not apprehend that we shall lay ourselves open to much blame by pass over in silence the discovery of vespusius and the conquest of baretto and lay before we reader some extract from the history of the late war it be impossible not to remark that the subject be treat with much caution and that though the sentiment of a royalist be every where conspicuous they be those of a royalist moderate by misfortune and defeat the following be dr robertson 's account of the declaration of independence it be by this time sufficiently visible that the man who take upon themselves to be most active in direct the american counsel be man of deep design and extensive ambition who by no means confine they view to the redress of those grievance of which they complain and which serve they for instrument in the pursuit of object less popular and specious by degree they seek to undermine the allegiance and dissolve the tie which connect the colony with the parent country of britain every step that be take by she ministry to restore tranquility to the empire be artfully misrepresent by the zealot of faction every unguarded expression or unfortunate measure of irritation be exaggerate by leader who consider they own honor and dignity as inseparable from further advance and predict treachery and insult as the consequence of retreat they now imagine they have meet with a favourable opportunity for proceed to extremity they influence be greatest in the general congress and by they means a circular manifesto be issue by that assembly intend to ascertain the disposition of the several colony respect a declaration of independence they call they countryman to witness how real have be they grievance and how moderate they claim they say it be impossible to have proceed with more temper or greater deliberation but that they complaint have be constantly supersede they petition to the throne reject the administration of great britain have not hesitate to attempt to starve they into surrender and have miscarry in this they be ready to employ the whole force of they country with all the foreign auxiliary they could obtain in prosecution of they unjust and tyrannical purpose they be precipitated it be say by britain into a state of hostility and there no longer remain for they a liberty of choice they must either throw down they arm and expect the clemency of man who have act as the enemy of they rights or they must consider themselves as in a state of warfare and abide by the consequence of that state warfare involve independency without this they effort must be irregular feeble and without all prospect of success they could possess no power to suppress mutiny or to punish conspiracy nor could they expect countenance and support from any of the state of europe however they might be incline to favor they while they acknowledge themselves to be subject and it be uncertain how soon they might sacrifice they friend and ally to the hope of a reunion to look back they be tell to the king of england after all the insult they have experience and the hostility that be begin would be the height of pusillanimity and weakness they be bid to think a little for they posterity who by the irreversible law of nature and situation could have no alternative leave they but to be slave or independent finally many subtle reasoning be alledge to evince the advantage they must derive from intrinsic legislation and general commerce on the other hand the middle and temperate party represent this step as unnecessary uncertain in its benefit and irretrievable in its consequence they expatiate on the advantage that have long be experience by the colonist from the foster care of great britain the generosity of the effort she have make to protect they and the happiness they have know under she auspicious patronage they represent they doubt of the ability of the colony to defend themselves without she alliance they state the necessity of a common superior to balance the separate and discordant interest of the different province they dwell upon the misery of a internal and doubtful struggle determine never to depart from the assertion of what they consider as they indefeasible right they would incessantly besiege the throne with they humble remonstrance they would seek the clemency of england rather than the alliance of those power whom they conceive to be the real enemy of both nor would they ever be accessory to the shut up the door of reconciliation but the voice of moderation be seldom hear amidst the turbulence of civil dissention violent counsel prevail the decisive and irrevocable step be make on the 4th of July 1776 it remain with posterity to decide upon its merit since that time it have indeed receive the sanction of military success but whatever consequence it may produce to america the fatal day must ever be regret by every sincere friend to the british empire the other extract we shall select be from the story of lord cornwalli 's surrender in virginium and the consequent termination of the american war the loss of these redoubt may be consider as decide the fate of the british troops the post be indeed originally so weak and insufficient to resist the force that attack it that nothing but the assure expectation of relief from the garrison of new york could have induce the commander to undertake its defense and calmly to wait the approach of the enemy a officer of so unquestionable gallantry would rather have hazard a encounter in the field and trust he adventure to the decision of fortune than by coop he army in so inadequate a fortress to have prepare for they inevitable misfortune and disgrace but with the expectation he have be induce to form he do not think himself justified in have recourse to desperate expedient these hope be now at a end the enemy have already silence he battery nothing remain to hinder they from complete they second parallel three hundred yard nearer to the besiege than the first he lordship have receive no intelligence of the approach of succor and a probability do not remain that he could defend he station till such time as he could expect they arrival thus circumstance with the magnanimity peculiar to he he write to sir henry clinton to acquaint he with the posture of he affair and to recommend to the fleet and the army that they should not make any great risk in endeavor to extricate they but although he regard he situation as hopeless he do not neglect any effort become a general to lengthen the siege and procrastinate the necessity of a surrender if it be impossible finally to prevent it the number of he troops seem scarcely sufficient to countenance a considerable sally but the emergency be so critical that he order about three hundred and fifty man on the morning of the 16th to attack the battery that appear to be in the greatest forwardness and to spike they gun the assault be impetuous and successful but either from they have execute the business upon which they be send in a hasty and imperfect manner or from the activity and industry of the enemy the damage be repair and the battery complete before evening one choice only remain to carry the troops across to gloucester point and make one last effort to escape boat be accordingly prepared and at ten o'clock at night the army begin to embark the first embarkation arrive in safety the greater part of the troops be already land at this critical moment of hope and apprehension of expectation and danger the weather which have hitherto be moderate and calm suddenly change the sky be cloud the wind rise and a violent storm ensue the boat with the remain troops be bear down the stream to complete the anxiety and danger the battery of the enemy be open the day dawn and they effort be direct against the northern shore of the river nothing could be hope but the escape of the boat and the safety of the troops they be bring back without much loss and every thing be replace in its former situation every thing now verge to the dreaded crisis the fire of the besieger be heavy and unintermitted the british could not return a gun and the shell they last resource be nearly exhaust they be themselves wear down with sickness and continual watch a few hour it appear must infallibly decide they fate and if any thing be still want the french ship which have enter the mouth of the river seem prepare to second the general assault on they side in this situation lord cornwalli not less calm and humane than he be intrepid choose not to sacrifice the life of so many brave man to a point of honor but the same day propose to general washington a cessation of twenty four hour in order mutually to adjust the term of capitulation the troops which surrender in the post of york and gloucester amount to between five and six thousand man but there be not above three thousand eight hundred of these in a capacity for actual service they be all oblige to become prisoner of war fifteen hundred seaman be include in the capitulation the commander unable to obtain term for the loyal american be oblige to have recourse to a sloop appoint to carry he dispatch and which he stipulate should pass unsearched to convey they to new york the british fleet and army arrive off the chesapeak five day after the surrender have learn the melancholy fate of they countryman they be oblige to return without effect any thing to they former station such be the catastrophe of a army that in intrepidity of exertion and the patient endurance of the most mortifying reverse be scarcely to be equal by any thing that be to be meet with in history the applause they have receive undiminished by they subsequent misfortune should teach we to exclaim less upon the precariousness of fame and animate we with the assurance that heroism and constancy can never be wholly disappointed of they reward the publication before we be write with that laudable industry which ought ever to distinguish a great historian the author appear to have have access to some of the best source of information and have frequently throw that light upon a recent story which be seldom to be expect but from the developement of time and the research of progressive generation we can not bestow equal praise upon he impartiality conscious however and reserve upon general question the historian have restrict himself almost entirely to the narrative form and have seldom indulge we with what we esteem the principal ornament of elegant history reflexion and character the situation of dr robertson may suggest to we a obvious though incompetent motive in the present instance write for he contemporary and countryman he could not treat the resistance of america as the respectable struggle of a emerge nation write for posterity he could not denominate treason and rebellion that which success at least have stamp with the signature of gallantry and applause but such could not have be the motive of the writer in that part of the history of america which be give to the world some year ago perhaps dr robertson be willing to try how far he ability could render the most naked story agreeable and interesting we will allow he to have succeed but we could well have spare the experiment the style of this performance be sweet and eloquent we hope however that we shall not expose ourselves to the charge of fastidiousness when we complain that it be rather too uniformly so the narrative be indeed occasionally enliven and the language picturesque but in general we search in vain for some roughness to relieve the eye and some sharpness to provoke the palate one full and sweeping period succeed another and though pleased and gratified at first the attention gradually become languid it would not perhaps be a unentertaining employment to compare the style of dr robertson 's present work with that of he first publication the admire history of scotland the language of that performance be indeed intersperse with provincial and inelegant mode of expression and the period be often unskilfully divide but it have a vigor and spirit to which such fault be easily pardon we can say of it what we can scarcely say of any of the author 's later publication that he have throw he whole strength into it in that instance however he enter the list with almost the only historian with whom dr robertson must appear to disadvantage the incomparable hume in the comparison we can not but acknowledge that the eloquence of the former speak the professor not the man of the world he reason indeed but it be with the reason of logic and not with the acuteness of philosophy and the intuition of genius let not the living historian be offend to be second to hume in we opinion might satisfy the ambition of a livy or a tacitus article iii secret history of theodore albert maximilian prince of hohenzollern sigmaringen 12mo this agreeable tale appear to be the production of the noble author of the modern anecdote it be tell with the same humor and careless vivacity the design be to ridicule the cold pedantry that judge of youth without make any allowance for the warmth of inexperience and the charm of beauty such reader as take up a book merely for entertainment and do not quarrel with a author that do not scrupulously confine himself within the limit of moral instruction will infallibly find they account in it the follow specimen will give some idea of the manner in which the story be tell the learn bertram be much scandalize at the dissipation that prevail in the court of hohenzollern he be credibly inform that the lord treasurer of the principality who have no less than a revenue of 109l 7 10-3\/4 d commit to he management sometimes forget the care of a exchequer in the arm of a mistress nay fame have even whisper in he ear that the reverend confessor himself have a intrigue with a certain cook-maid but that which beyond all thing afflict he be the amour of theodore with the beautiful wilhelmina what cry he when he ruminate upon the subject can it be excusable in the learn bertram whose reputation have fill a fourth part of the circle of swabium who twice bear away the prize in the university of otweiler to pass these cry sin in silence it shall not be say thus animated he stride away to the antichamber of theodore theodore who be all graciousness venerate the reputation of bertram and order he to be instantly admit the eye of the philosopher flash with anger most noble prince cry he i be come to inform you that you must immediately break with the beautiful wilhelmina theodore stare but make no answer the vice of you highness say bertram awake my indignation while you toy away you hour in the lap of a w -- e the vast principality of hohenzollern sigmaringen hasten to its fall reflect my lord three village seven hamlet and near eleven grange

by the author of evelina and cecilium 3 vol 12mo there scarcely seem to exist a more original genius in the present age than this celebrated writer in the performance with which she have already entertain the public we can not so much as trace a feature of she illustrious predecessor the fable the character the incident be all she own in the mean time they be not less happy than they be new a belfield a monckton a morrice and several other personage of the admire cecilium will scarcely yield to the most finished draught of the greatest writer in comedy in tragedy miss burney alike excel and the union of they both in the vauxhall scene of the death of harrel rank among the first effort of human genius of consequence we may safely pronounce that the reputation of this lady be by no means dependent upon fashion or caprice but will last as long as there be understand to discern and taste to relish the beauty of fiction it must be acknowledge that she defect be scarcely less conspicuous than she excellency in she underplot she generally miscarry we can trace nothing of miss burney in the story of macartney albany and the hill she comedy sometimes deviate into farce the character of brigg in particular though it very successfully excite we laughter certainly deform a work which in its principal constituent rank in the very highest species of composition she style be often affect and in the serious be sometimes so labored and figurative as to cost the reader a very strict attention to discover the meaning without perfectly repay he trouble these fault be most conspicuous in cecilium which upon the whole we esteem by much she greatest performance in evelina she write more from inartificial nature and we be happy to observe in the present publication that the masculine sense by which miss burney be distinguish have raise she almost wholly above these little error the style of louisa be more polished than that of evelina and more consonant to true taste than that of cecilium the principal story of louisa like that of cecilium be very simple but adorn with a thousand beautiful episode as the great action of the latter be cecilium 's sacrifice of fortune to a virtuous and laudable attachment so that of the former be the sacrifice of rank in the marriage of the heroine to a young man of the most distinguished merit but neither conspicuous by birth nor favor by fortune the event romantic and inconsistent with the manners of polished society as it may appear be introduce by such a train of incident that it be impossible not to commend and admire the conduct of the heroine she character be that of inflexible vivacity and wit accompany with a spice of coquetry and affectation and though this line of portrait seem exhaust by congreve and richardson we will venture to pronounce louisa a perfect original it be impossible to describe such a character in the abstract without recollect millamant and lady g but in read this most agreeable novel you scarcely think of either as there be no imitation so there be not two expression in the work that can lead from one to the other louisa be more amiable than the former and more delicate and feminine than the latter mr burchel the happy lover be a author a young man of infinite genius of romantic honor of unbounded generosity lord raymond the brother of louisa become acquaint with he in he travels by a incident in which mr burchel do he the most essential service be afterwards introduce to he sister and be deeply smitten with she beauty and accomplishment he quit the house of lord raymond abruptly with a determination entirely to drop he connexion sometime after in a casual and unexpected meeting he save the life of he mistress in the conclusion he unparalleled merit and he repeated service surmount every obstacle to a union besides these two there be many other character happily imagine louisa be involve in considerable distress previous to the final catastrophe the manner in which she gay and sportive character be support in these scene be beyond all commendation but the extract we shall give as most singular in its nature relate to another considerable female

to the carriage sir charle mount on horseback as he come and they carry off the hero in triumph article v the peasant of bilidelgerid a tale 2 vol shandean this be the only instance in which we shall take the liberty to announce to the public a author hitherto unknown thus situate we shall not presume to prejudice we reader either way concern he but shall simply relate the general plan of the work it attempt a combination which have so happily succeed with the precede writer of the comic and the pathetic the latter however be the principal object the hero be intend for a personage in the highest degree lovely and interesting who in he earliest bloom of youth be subject to the most grievous calamity and terminate they not but by a untimely death the writer seem to have apprehend that a dash of humor be requisite to render he story in the highest degree interesting and he have spare no exertion of any kind of which he be capable for accomplish this purpose the scene be lay in egypt and the adjacent country the peasant be the son of the celebrated saladin the author have exercise he imagination in paint the manners of the time and climate of which he write article vi a essay on novel in three epistle inscribe to the right honorable lady craven by will hayley esq 4to the public have be for some time agree that mr hayley be the first of english poet envy herself scarcely dare utter a dissentient murmur and even generous emulation turn pale at the mention of he name he production allow for the very recent period in which he commence author be rather numerous a saturnine critic might be apt to suspect that they be also hasty be not the loftiness of they conception the majesty of they style the richness of they imagination and above all the energy both of they thought and language so conspicuous that we may defy any man of taste to rise from the perusal and say that all the study and consideration in the world could possibly have make they better after a course however of unremitted industry mr hayley seem to have relax and to the eternal mortification of the literary world last winter could not boast a single production of the prince of song the muse have now pay we another visit we be very sensible of we incapacity to speak or even think of this writer with prosaic phlegm we can not however avoid pronounce that in we humble opinion mr hayley have now outdo all he former outdoing and greatly repay we for the absence we so dearly mourn we be sensible that it be unbecome the character of a critic to lay himself out in general and vague declamation it be also within the law of possibility that a incurious or unpoetical humor in some of we reader and -lrb- ah I the luckless day -rrb- penury in other may have occasion they turn over the drowsy page of the review before they have peruse the original work some account of the plan and a specimen of the execution may therefore be expect the first may be dispatch in two word the design be almost exactly analogous to that of the essay on history which have be so much celebrate the author triumph in the novelty of he subject and pay a very elegant compliment to modern time as have be in a manner the sole inventor of this admirable species of composition of which he have undertake to deliver the precept he deduce the pedigree of novel through several generation from homer and calliope he then undertake to characterise the most considerable writer in this line he discuss with much learning and all the logical subtlety so proper to the didactic muse the pretension of the cyropedium of xenophon but at length reject it as contain nothing but what be literally true and therefore belong to the class of history he be very eloquent upon the shepherd of herma theagene and chariclea and the ethiopic of heliodorus turpin scudery cotterel sidney the countess d'anoi and all such writer as be never read next pass in review boccace and cervante occupy a very principal place the modern french writer of fictitious history from fenelon to voltaire close the first epistle the second be devote to english author the third to the law of novel write we shall present we reader as a specimen

certainly be compare with mr hayley we know not by what fatality dr beattie have acquire the highest reputation as a philosopher while he poetry though acknowledge to be please be comparatively little thought on it must always be with regret and diffidence that we dissent from the general verdict we should however be somewhat apprehensive of sacrifice the character we have assume do we fail to confess that he philosophy have always appear to we at once superficial and confused feeble and presumptuous we do not know any thing it have to recommend it but the good intention and we wish we could add the candid spirit with which it be write of he poetry however we think very differently though deficient in nerve it be at once sweet and flowing simple and amiable we be happy to find the author return to a line in which he appear so truly respectable the present performance be by no means capable to detract from he character as a poet this well know tale be relate in a manner highly pathetic and interesting as we be not at all desirous of pall the curiosity of the reader for the poem itself we shall make we extract at random the follow stanza as they be take from a part perfectly cool and introductory be by no mean the best in this agreeable piece they be preface by some general reflexion on the mischief occasion by the _ sacra fame auri _ the reader will perceive that dr

character that have rise into higher favor with the english nation than mr sheridan he be know and admire as a man of successful gallantry both with the fair sex and he own before he appear emphatically speak upon the public stage since that time he performance of the duenna and the school for scandal have be distinguish with the public favor beyond any dramatical production in the language he composition in gaiety of humor and spriteliness of wit be without a equal satiated it should seem with the applause of the theater he turn he attention to public and parliamentary speak the vulgar prejudice that genius can not expect to succeed in two different walk for some time operate against he but he possess merit and he compel applause he now rank by universal consent as a orator and a statesman with the very first name of a age that will not perhaps be account unproductive in genius and ability it be now generally suppose that he have do with the theater for we own part we must confess we entertain all possible veneration for parliamentary and ministerial ability we should be mortify to rank second to any man in we enthusiasm for the official talent of mr sheridan : but as the guardian of literature we regret the loss of he comic power we wish to preserve the poet without lose the statesman greatly as we admire the opera and the comedy we conceive he unbounded talent capable of something higher still to say all in a word we look at he hand for the misanthrope of the british muse it be unnecessary to say then that we congratulate the public upon the present essay it be mean only as a _ jeu d'esprit _ but we consider it as the earnest of that perseverance which we wish to prove and fear to lose the scene we have extract and which with another that may be consider as a kind of praxis upon the rule constitute the chief part of the alteration be apparently personal how far personal satire be commendable in general and how far it be just in

tis poor and pitiful _ -- what sir would you restrict the noble science of debate to the mere lie -- phaw that be a paltry trick that every fool could hit -- a mere vandal could throw he gantlet and a iroquois knock he antagonist down -- no sir the art of quarrel be vast and complicated -- month may worthily be employ in the attainment -- and the exercise afford range for the largest ability -- to quarrel after the newest and most approve method be the first of science -- the surest test of genius and the last perfection of civil society kastril you amaze I i think to dash the lie in another 's face be the most respectable kind of anger subtle o lud sir you be very ignorant a man that can only give the lie be not worth the name of quarrelsome -- quite tame and spiritless -- no sir the angry boy must understand beside the quarrel direct -- in which i own you have some proficiency -- a variety of other mode of attack -- such as the quarrel preventive -- the quarrel obstreperous -- the quarrel sensitive -- the quarrel oblique -- and the quarrel personal kastril o mr doctor that i do but understand half so much of the art of brangling as you do -- what would i give -- harkee -- i 'll settle a hundred a year upon you -- but come go on go on -- subtle o sir you quite overpower I -- why if you use I thus you will draw all my secret from I at once -- i shall almost kick you down stair the first lecture kastril how -- kick I down stair -- ware that -- blood and oon sir subtle well well -- be patient -- be patient -- consider it be impossible to communicate the last touch of the art of petulance but by fist and toe -- by sword and pistol kastril sir i do not understand you subtle enough we 'll talk of that another time -- what i have now to explain be the cool and quiet art of debate -- fit to be introduce into the most elegant society -- or the most August assembly -- you my angry boy be in parliament kastril no doctor -- i have indeed some thought of it -- but imagine that the accomplishment of petulance and choler would be of no use there -- i give it up subtle good heaven -- of no use -- why sir they can be no where so properly -- only conceive how August a little petulance -- and what a graceful variety snarl and snap would introduce -- true they be rather new in that connexion -- believe I sir there be nothing for which i have so ardently long as to meet they there -- i should die contented -- and you sir -- if you would introduce they -- eh kastril doctor you shall be satisfy -- i 'll be in parliament in a month -- i 'll be prime minister -- lord high treasurer of england -- or chancellor of the exchequer subtle oh by all means chancellor of the exchequer you be somewhat young indeed -- but that be no objection -- damn I if the office can ever be so respectably fill as by a angry boy kastril true true -- but doctor we forget you instruction all this time -- let I see -- ay -- first be the quarrel preventive subtle well think of -- why sir in you new office you will be liable to all sort of attack -- minister always be and a angry boy can not hope to escape -- now nothing you know be so much to the purpose as to have the first blow -- blunder be very natural -- you friend tell one story in the upper house and you another in the lower -- you shall give up a territory to the enemy that you ought to have keep and when charge with it shall unluckily drop that you and you colleague be ignorant of the geography of the country -- you foresee a attack -- you immediately open -- plan so extensively beneficial -- account so perfectly consistent -- measure so judicious and accurate -- no man can question -- no man can object to -- but a rascal and a knave -- let he come forward kastril very good very good -- for the quarrel opstreperous that i easily conceive -- a antagonist object shrewdly -- i can not invent a answer -- in that case there be nothing to be do but to drown he reason in noise -- nonsense -- and vociferation subtle come to my arm my dear kastril o thou art a apt scholar -- thou wilt be nonpareil in the art of brawling -- but for the quarrel sensitive -- kastril ay that i confess i do not understand subtle why it be thus my dear boy -- a minister be apt to be sore -- every man can not have the phlegm of burleigh -- and a angry boy be sorest of all -- in that case -- a objection be make that would dumbfound any other man -- he parry it with -- my honor -- and my integrity -- and the rectitude of my intention -- my spotless fame -- my unvaried truth -- and the greatness of my ability -- and so give no answer at all kastril excellent excellent subtle the quarrel oblique be easy enough -- it be only to talk in general term of place and pension -- the loaf and the fish -- a struggle for power -- a struggle for power -- and it will do excellent well if at a critical moment -- you can throw in a hint of some forty or fifty million unaccounted for by some people 's grandfather and uncle dead fifty year ago kastril ha ha ha subtle lastly for the quarrel personal -- it may be infinitely diversify -- i have other instance in my eye -- but i will mention only one -- mind capable of the widest comprehension when hold back from they proper field may turn to lesser employment that fool may wonder at and canting hypocrite accuse -- a cato might indulge to the pleasure of the bottle and a caesar might play -- unfortunately you may have a caesar to oppose you -- let he discuss a matter of finance -- that subject be always open -- there you have a easy answer in the former case you parry here you thrust -- you must admire at he presumption -- tell he roundly he be not capable of the subject -- and dam he strongest reason by call they the reason of a gambler kastril admirable -- oh doctor -- i will thank you for ever -- i will do any thing for you -lrb- face _ enter at the corner of the stage wink at _ subtle _ and exit _ -rrb- subtle _ come sir the captain will come to we
