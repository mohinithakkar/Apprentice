say he prayer the little finger be break the tender flesh be bruise and actually mangled strong man weep when they look on the body and the reverend murderer after have be set free on bail be glad to return and take refuge within the wall of he prison to escape summary punishment at the hand of a outraged community at the bare mention of such cruelty every heart grow sick and faint man and woman be dumb with horror : only tear and a hot demand for instant retaliation avail the question whether after all that baby martyr be not fortunate among he fellow would no doubt be meet by resentful astonishment but it be a question which may well be ask may well be ponder heart-rending as it be to think for a instant of the agony which the poor child must have bear for some hour after he infant brain be too bewilder by terror and pain to understand what be require of he it still can not fail to occur to deeper reflection that the torture be short and small in comparison with what the next ten year might have hold for he if he have live to earn entrance on the spiritual life by the briefest possible experience of the physical be always greater gain but how emphatically be it so when the condition of life upon earth be sure to be unfavorable if it be possible in any way to get a statistical summing-up and a tangible presentation of the amount of physical pain inflict by parent on child under twelve year of age the most callous-hearted would be surprised and shocked if it be possible to add to this estimate a accurate and scientific demonstration of the extent to which such pain by weaken the nervous system and exhaust its capacity to resist disease diminish child 's chance for life the world would stand aghast too little have be say upon this point the opponent of corporal punishment usually approach the subject either from the sentimental or the moral standpoint the argument on either of these grounds can be make strong enough one would suppose to paralyze every hand lift to strike a child but the question of the direct and lasting physical effect of blow -- even of one blow on the delicate tissue of a child 's body on the frail and tremble nerve on the sensitive organization which be try under a thousand unfavoring condition to adjust itself to the hard work of both living and grow -- have yet to be properly consider every one know the sudden sense of insupportable pain sometimes produce even dizziness and nausea which follow the accidental hit of the ankle or elbow against a hard substance it do not need that the blow be very hard to bring involuntary tear to adult eye but what be such a pain as this in comparison with the pain of a dozen or more quick tingle blow from a heavy hand on flesh which be which must be as much more sensitive than ours as be the soul which dwell in it purer than ours add to this physical pain the overwhelming terror which only utter helplessness can feel and which be the most recognizable quality in the cry of a very young child under whipping add the instinctive sense of disgrace of outrage which often keep the older child stubborn and still through-out -- and you have a amount and a intensity of suffer from which even try nerve might shrink again who do not know -- at least what woman do not know -- that violent weep for even a very short time be quite enough to cause a feeling of languor and depression of nervous exhaustion for a whole day yet it do not seem to occur to mother that little child must feel this in proportion to the length of time and violence of they cry far more than grow people who have not often see a poor child receive within a hour or two of the first whipping a second one for some small ebullition of nervous irritability which be simply inevitable from its spend and worn condition it be safe to say that in family where whipping be regularly recognize as a punishment few child under ten year of age and of average behavior have less than one whipping a week sometimes they have more sometimes the whipping be very severe thus you have in one short year sixty or seventy occasion on which for a greater or less time say from one to three hour the child 's nervous system be subject to a tremendous strain from the effect of terror and physical pain combine with long cry will any physician tell we that this fact be not a element in that child 's physical condition at the end of that year will any physician dare to say that there may not be in that child 's life crisis when the issue of life and death will be so equally balanced that the tenth part of the nervous force lose in such fit of cry and in the endurance of such pain could turn the scale nature 's retribution like she reward be cumulative because she sentence against evil work be not execute speedily therefore the heart of the son of man be fully set in they to do evil but the sentence always be execute sooner or later and that inexorably you son o unthinking mother may fall by the way in the full prime of he manhood for lack of that strength which he infancy spend in endure you hasty and severe punishment it be easy to say -- and universally be say -- by people who cling to the old and fight against the new all this outcry about corporal punishment be sentimental nonsense the world be full of man and woman who have grow up strong and good in spite of whipping and as for I i know i never have any more whipping than i deserve or than be good for I be you then so strong and clear and pure in you physical and spiritual nature and life that you be sure no different training could have make either you body or you soul better be these man and woman of whom the world be full so able-bodied whole-souled strong-minded that you think it needless to look about for any method of make the next generation better above all do you believe that it be a part of the legitimate outworking of god 's plan and intent in create human being to have more than one-half of they die in childhood if we be not to believe that this fearful mortality be a part of god 's plan be it wise to refuse to consider all possibility even those seemingly most remote of diminish it no argument be so hard to meet -lrb- simply because it be not a argument -rrb- as the assumption of the good and propriety of the thing that have be it be one of the devil 's best sophistry by which he keep good people undisturbed in do the thing he like it have be in all age the bulwark behind which evil have make stand and have slay they thousand it be the last enemy which shall be destroy it be the only real support of the cruel evil of corporal punishment suppose that such punishment of child have be unheard of till now suppose that the idea have yesterday be suggest for the first time that by inflict physical pain on a child 's body you might make he recollect certain truth and suppose that instead of whipping a very moderate and harmless degree of prick with pin or cut with knife or burn with fire have be suggest would not father and mother have cry out all over the land at the inhumanity of the idea would they not still cry out at the inhumanity of one who as thing be to-day should propose the substitution of prick or cut or burn for whipping but i think it would not be easy to show in what wise small prick or cut be more inhuman than blow or why lie may not be as legitimately cure by blister make with a hot coal as by black and blue spot make with a ruler the principle be the same and if the principle be right why not multiply method it seem as if this one suggestion candidly consider might be enough to open all parent ' eye to the enormity of whipping how many a loving mother will without any thought of cruelty inflict half-a-dozen quick blow on the little hand of she child when she could no more take a pin and make the same number of thrust into the tender flesh than she could bind the baby on a rack yet the pin-thrust would hurt far less and would probably make a deeper impression on the child 's mind among the more ignorant class the frequency and severity of corporal punishment of child be appalling the fact only need to be hold up closely and persistently before the community to be recognize as horror of cruelty far greater than some which have be make subject of legislation it be my misfortune once to be force to spend several of the hottest week of a hot summer in new york in near neighborhood to my room be block of building which have shop on the first floor and tenement above in these live the family of small tradesman and mechanic of the better sort during those scorch night every window be throw open and all sound be bear with distinctness through the hot still air chief among they be the shriek and cry of little child and blow and angry word from tired overworked mother at time it become almost unbearable : it be hard to refrain from a attempt at rescue ten twelve twenty quick hard blow whose sound ring out plainly i count again and again mingle with they come the convulsive scream of the poor child and that most piteous thing of all the reiteration of oh mamma oh mamma as if through all the helpless little creature have a instinct that this word ought to be in itself the strongest appeal these family be all of the better class of work people comfortable and respectable what sound be to be hear in the more wretched haunt of the city during those night the heart struggle away from fancy but the shriek of those child will never wholly die out of the air i hear they to-day and mingle with they the question ring perpetually in my ear why do not the law protect child before the point at which life be endanger a cartman may be arrest in the street for the brutal beating of a horse which be he own and which he have the right to kill if he so choose should not a man be equally withhold from the brutal beating of a child who be not he own but god 's and whom to kill be murder the inhumanity of parent -- needless denial webster 's dictionary which can not be accuse of any lean toward sentimentalism define inhumanity as cruelty in action and cruelty as a act of a human being which inflict unnecessary pain the word inhumanity have a ugly sound and many inhuman people be utterly and honestly unconscious of they own inhumanity it be necessary therefore to entrench one 's self behind some such bulwark as the above definition afford before venture the accusation that father and mother be habitually guilty of inhuman conduct in inflict unnecessary pain on they child by needless denial of they innocent wish and impulse most man and a great many woman would be astonish at be tell that simple humanity require they to gratify every wish even the smallest of they child when the pain of have that wish deny be not make necessary either for the child 's own welfare physical or mental or by circumstance beyond the parent 's control the word necessary be a very authoritative one conscience if leave free soon narrow down its boundary inconvenience hindrance deprivation self-denial one or all or even a great deal of all to ourselves can not give we a shadow of right to say that the pain of the child 's disappointment be necessary selfishness grasp at help from the hackneyed saying that it be best for child to bear the yoke in they youth the sooner they learn that they can not have they own way the better it be a good discipline for they to practice self-denial & c but the yoke that they _ must _ bear in spite of we lighten it all we can be heavy enough the instance in which it be for good and sufficient reason impossible for they to have they own way be quite numerous enough to insure they learn the lesson very early and as for the discipline of self-denial -- god bless they dear patient soul -- if man and woman bring to bear on the thwarting and vexation of they daily life and they relation with each other one hundredth part of the sweet acquiescence and brave endurance which average child show under the average management of average parent this world would be a much pleasanter place to live in than it be let any conscientious and tender mother who perhaps read these word with tear half of resentment half of grief in she eye keep for three day a exact record of the little request which she refuse from the baby of five who beg to stand on a chair and look out of the window and be hastily tell no it would hurt the chair when one minute would have be enough time to lay a fold newspaper over the upholstery and another minute enough to explain to he with a kiss and a hug that that be to save he spoil mamma 's nice chair with he boot and the two minute together would probably have make sure that another time the dear little fellow would look out for a paper himself when he wish to climb up to the window -- from this baby up to the pretty girl of twelve who with as distinct a perception of the become as she mother have before she go to school unhappy because she be compel to wear the blue necktie instead of the scarlet one and surely for no especial reason at the end of the three day a honest examination of the record would show that full half of these small denial all of which have involve pain and some of which have bring contest and punishment have be needless have be hastily make and make usually on account of the slight interruption or inconvenience which would result from yield to the request i be very much mistaken if the honest keep and honest study of such a three day ' record would not wholly change the atmosphere in many a house to what it ought to be and bring almost constant sunshine and bliss where now too often be storm and misery with some parent although they be neither harsh nor hard in manner nor yet unloving in nature the habitual first impulse seem to be to refuse : they appear to have a singular obtuseness to the fact that it be or can be of any consequence to a child whether it do or do not do the thing it desire often the refusal be withdraw on the first symptom of grief or disappointment on the child 's part a thing which be fatal to all real control of a child and almost as unkind as the first unnecessary denial -- perhaps even more so as it involve double and treble pain in future instance where there can not and must not be any give way to entreaty it be doubtless this lack of perception -- akin one would think to color-blindness -- which be at the bottom of this great and common inhumanity among kind and intelligent father and mother : a inhumanity so common that it may almost be say to be universal so common that while we be oblige to look on and see we dearest friend guilty of it we find it next to impossible to make they understand what we mean when we make outcry over some of its glaring instance you my dearest of friend -- or rather you who would be but for this one point of hopeless contention between we -- do you remember a certain warm morning last August of which i tell you then you have not hear the last here it be again : perhaps in print i can make it look blacker to you than i could then part of it i see part of it you unwillingly confess to I and part of it little blue eye tell I herself it be one of those ineffable morning when a thrill of delight and expectancy fill the air one feel that every appointment of the day must be unlike those of other day -- must be festive must help on the white day for which all thing look ready i remember how like the morning itself you look as you stand in the doorway in a fresh white muslin dress with lavender ribbon i say oh extravagance for breakfast i know you say but the day be so enchanting i could not make up my mind to wear any thing that have be wear before here a uproar from the nursery break out and we both run to the spot there stand little blue eye in a storm of temper with one small foot on a crumpled mass of pink cambric on the floor and nurse who be also very red and angry explain that miss would not have on she pink frock because it be not quite clean it be all dirty mamma and i do not want to put it on you have get on a nice white dress : why can not i you be in the main a kind mother and you do not like to give little blue eye pain so you kneel down beside she and tell she that she must be a good girl and have on the gown mary have say but that she should have on a pretty white apron which would hide the spot and blue eye be only six year old and of a loving generous nature dry she tear accept the very questionable expedient try to forget the spot and in a few moment come out on the piazza chirp like a little bird by this time the rare quality of the morning have steal like wine into we brain and you exclaim we will have breakfast out here under the vine how george will like it and in another instant you be flit back and forth help the rather ungracious bridget move out the breakfast-table with its tempting array oh mamma mamma cry blue eye can not i have my little tea-set on a little table beside you big table oh let I let I and she fairly quiver with excitement you hesitate how i watch you but it be a little late bridget be already rather cross the tea-set be pack in a box and up on a high shelf no dear there be not time and we must not make bridget any more trouble but -- see the tear come again -- you shall have some real tea in papa 's big gilt cup and another time you shall have you tea-set when we have breakfast out here again as i say before you be a kind mother and you make the denial as easy to be bear as you could and blue eye be again pacify not satisfy only bravely make the best of it and so we have we breakfast a breakfast to be remember too but as for the other time which you have promise to blue eye how well i know that not many time a year do such morning and breakfast come and that it be well she would forget all about it after breakfast -- you remember how we linger -- george suddenly start up say how hard it be to go to town i say girl walk down to the station with I both of you and I too I too papa say blue eye you do not hear she but i do and she have fly for she hat at the door we find she say again I too mamma then you remember she boot : oh my darling you say kiss she for you be a kind mother you can not go in those nice boot : the dew will spoil they and it be not worth while to change they we shall be back in a few minute a storm of tear would have burst out in a instant at this the third disappointment if i have not sit down on the door-step and take she in my lap whisper that auntie be go to stay too oh put the child down and come along call the great strong uncomprehending man -- blue eye ' dear papa pussy will not mind be a good girl pussy i 'll bring you a red balloon to-night you be both very kind you and george and you both love little blue eye dearly no i will not come i believe my boot be too thin say i and for the equivocation there be in my reply i be sure of be forgive you both turn back twice to look at the child and kiss you hand to she and i wonder if you do not see in she face what i do real grief and patient endurance even the king of the golden river do not rouse she : she do not want a story she do not want I she do not want a red balloon at night she want to walk between you to the station with she little hand in yours god grant the day may not come when you will be heart-broken because you can never lead she any more she ask I some question while you be go which you remember i repeat to you she ask I if i do not hate nice new shoe and why little girl could not put on the dress they like best and if mamma do not look beautiful in that pretty white dress and say that if she could only have have she own tea-set at breakfast she would have let I have my coffee in one of she cup gradually she grow happier and begin to tell I about she great wax-doll which have eye that could shut which be keep in a trunk because she be too little mamma say to play very much with it now but she guess mamma would let she have it to-day do i not think so alas i do and i say so in fact i feel sure that it be the very thing you would be certain to do to sweeten the day which have begin so sadly for poor little blue eye it seem very long to she before you come back and she be on the point of ask for she dolly as soon as you appear but i whisper to she to wait till you be rest after a few minute i take she up to you room -- that lovely room with the bay window to the east there you sit in you white dress surround with gay worsted all look like a carnival of humming-bird oh how beautiful i exclaimed in involuntary admiration what be you do you say that you be go to make a affghan and that the morning be so enchanting you could not bear the thought of touch you mending but be go to luxuriate in the worsted some time pass in sort the color and decide on the contrast and i forget all about the doll not so little blue eye i remember afterward how patiently she stand still wait and wait for a gap between we word that she need not break the law against interrupt with she eager -- please mamma let I have my wax dolly to play with this morning i 'll sit right here on the floor by you and auntie and not hurt she one bit oh please do mamma you mean always to be a very kind mother and you speak as gently and lovingly as it be possible to speak when you reply : -- oh pussy mamma be too busy to get it she can not get up now you can play with you block and with you other dolly just as well that be a good little girl probably if blue eye have go on implore you would have lay you worsted down and give she the dolly for you love she dearly and never mean to make she unhappy but neither you nor i be prepare for what follow you be a naughty ugly hateful mamma you never let I do _ any _ thing and i wish you be dead with such a burst of scream and tear that we be both frightened you look as well you might heart-break at such word from you only child you take she away and when you come back you cry and say you have whip she severely and you do not know what you should do with a child of such a frightful temper such a outburst as that just because i tell she in the gentlest way possible that she could not have a playthe it be terrible then i say some word to you which you think be unjust i ask you in what condition you own nerve would have be by ten o'clock that morning if you husband -lrb- who have in one view a much better right to thwart you harmless desire than you have to thwart you child 's since you in the full understanding of maturity give yourself into he hand -rrb- have instead of admire you pretty white dress tell you to be more prudent and not put it on have tell you it would be nonsense to have breakfast out on the piazza and that he could not wait for you to walk to the station with he you say that the case be not at all parallel and i reply hotly that that be very true for those matter would have be to you only the comparative trifle of one short day and would have make you only a little cross and uncomfortable whereas to little blue eye they be the all-absorbing desire of the hour which to a child in trouble always look as if it could never come to a end and would never be follow by any thing better blue eye cry herself to sleep and sleep heavily till late in the afternoon when she father come home you say that she must not have the red balloon because she have be such a naughty girl i have wonder many time since why she do not cry again or look grieve when you say that and lay the balloon away after eleven o'clock at night i go to look at she and find she sobbing in she sleep and toss about i groan as i think this be only one day and there be three hundred and sixty-five in a year but i never recall the distorted face of that poor child as in she fearful passion she tell you she wish you be dead without also remember that even the gentle christ say of he who should offend one of these little one it be better for he that a mill-stone be hang about he neck and he be drown in the depths of the sea the inhumanity of parent -- rudeness \/ # _ inhumanity _ -- cruelty _ cruelty _ -- the disposition to give unnecessary pain -- _ webster 's dict _ # \/ i have intend to put third on the list of inhumanity of parent needless requisition but my last summer 's observation change my estimate and convinced I that child suffer more pain from the rudeness with which they be treat than from be force to do needless thing which they dislike indeed a positively and graciously courteous manner toward child be a thing so rarely see in average daily life the rudeness which they receive be so innumerable that it be hard to tell where to begin in set forth the evil child themselves often bring they sharp and unexpected logic to bear on some incident illustrate the difference in this matter of behavior between what be require from they and what be show to they : as do a little boy i know whose father say crossly to he one morning as he come into the breakfast-room will you ever learn to shut that door after you and a few seconds later as the child be rather sulkily sit down in he chair and do you mean to bid anybody ` good-morning ' or not i do not think you give _ I _ a very nice ` good-morning ' anyhow reply satirical justice aged seven then of course he be reprove for speak disrespectfully and so in the space of three minute the beautiful opening of the new day for both parent and child be jar and rob of its fresh harmony by the father 's thoughtless rudeness be the breakfast-room door much more likely to be shut the next morning no the lesson be push aside by the pain the motive to resolve be dull by the antagonism if that father have call he son and put he arm round he -lrb- oh the bless and magic virtue of put you arm round a child 's neck -rrb- have say good-morning my little man and then in a confidential whisper in he ear what shall we do to make this forgetful little boy remember not to leave that door open through which the cold wind blow in on all of we -- can any word measure the difference between the first treatment and the second between the success of the one and the failure of the other score of time in a day a child be tell in a short authoritative way to do or not to do such little thing as we ask at the hand of older people as favor graciously and with deference to they choice would you be so very kind as to close that window may i trouble you for that cricket if you would be as comfortable in this chair as in that i would like to change place with you oh excuse I but you head be between I and the light : could you see as well if you move a little would it hinder you too long to stop at the store for I i would be very much oblige to you if you would pray do not let I crowd you & c in most people 's speech to child we find as synonym for these polite phrase : shut that window down this minute bring I that cricket i want that chair get up you can sit in this do not you see that you be right in my light move along i want you to leave off playing and go right down to the store for I do not crowd so can not you see that there be not room enough for two people here and so on as i write i feel a instinctive consciousness that these sentence will come like home-thrust to some surprised people i hope so that be what i want i be sure that in more than half the case where family life be mar in peace and almost strip of beauty by just these little rudeness the parent be utterly unconscious of they the truth be it have become like a established custom this different and less courteous way of speak to child on small occasion and minor matter people who be generally civil and of fair kindliness do it habitually not only to they own child but to all child we see it in the car in the stage in store in Sunday school everywhere on the other hand let a child ask for any thing without say please receive any thing without say thank you sit still in the most comfortable seat without offer to give it up or press its own preference for a particular book chair or apple to the inconveniencing of a elder and what a outcry we have : such rudeness such a ill-mannered child he parent must have neglect he strangely not at all : they have be steadily tell he a great many time every day not to do these precise thing which you dislike but they themselves have be all the while do those very thing to he and there be no proverb which strike a truer balance between two thing than the old one which weigh example over against precept however that it be bad policy to be rude to child be the least of the thing to be say against it over this they will triumph sooner or later the average healthy child have a native bias towards gracious good behavior and kindly affection he will win and be win in the long run and the chance be have better manners than he father but the pain that we give these bless little one when we wind they tenderness -- for that there be no atoning over that they can never triumph either now or hereafter why do we dare to be so sure that they be not grieve by ungracious word and tone that they can get use to be continually treat as if they be in the way who have not hear this say i have until i have long for a elijah and for fire that the grown-up cumberer of the ground who be the one really in the way might be burn up to make room for the child i believe that if it be possible to count up in any one month and show in the aggregate all of this class of misery bear by child the world would cry out astonished i know a little girl ten year old of nervous temperament whose whole physical condition be disorder and seriously by she mother 's habitual atmosphere of rude fault-finding she be a sickly fretful unhappy almost unbearable child if she live to grow up she will be a sickly fretful unhappy unlovely woman but she mother be just as much responsible for the whole as if she have derange she system by feed she on poisonous drug yet she be a most conscientious devoted and anxious mother and in spite of this manner a loving one she do not know that there be any better way than hers she do not see that she child be mortified and harm when she say to she in the presence of stranger how do you suppose you _ look _ with you mouth open like that do you want I to show you how you be sit -- and then a grotesque imitation of she stooping shoulder _ will _ you sit still for one minute _ do _ take you hand off my dress be there ever such a awkward child when the child reply fretfully and disagreeably she do not see that it be only a exact reflection of she own voice and manners she do not understand any of the thing that would make for she own peace as well as for the child 's matter grow worse instead of better as the child grow older and have more will and the chance be that the poor little soul will be worry into she grave probably most parent even very kindly one would be a little startled at the assertion that a child ought never to be reprove in the presence of other this be so constant a occurrence that nobody think of notice it nobody think of consider whether it be right and best or not but it be a great rudeness to a child i be entirely sure that it ought never to be do mortification be a condition as unwholesome as it be uncomfortable when the wound be inflict by the hand of a parent it be all the more certain to rankle and do harm let a child see that he mother be so anxious that he should have the approbation and good-will of she friend that she will not call they attention to he fault and that while she never under any circumstance allow herself to forget to tell he afterward alone if he have behave improperly she will spare he the additional pain and mortification of public reproof and while that child will lay these secret reproof to heart he will still be happy i know a mother who have the insight to see this and the patience to make it a rule for it take far more patience far more time than the common method she say sometimes to she little boy after visitor have leave the parlor now dear i be go to be you little girl and you be to be my papa and we will play that a gentleman have just come in to see you and i will show you exactly how you have be behave while this lady have be call to see I and you can see if you do not feel very sorry to have you little girl behave so here be a dramatic representation at once which that boy do not need to see repeat many time before he be forever cure of interrupt of pull he mother 's gown of drum on the piano & c -- of the thousand and one thing which able-bodied child can do to make social visit where they be a martyrdom and a penance once i see this same little boy behave so boisterously and rudely at the dinner-table in the presence of guest that i say to myself surely this time she will have to break she rule and reprove he publicly i see several telegraphic signal of rebuke entreaty and warn flash from she gentle eye to he but nothing do any good nature be too much for he he could not at that minute force himself to be quiet presently she say in a perfectly easy and natural tone oh charley come here a minute i want to tell you something no one at the table suppose that it have any thing to do with he bad behavior she do not intend that they should as she whisper to he i alone see he cheek flush and that he look quickly and imploringly into she face i alone see that tear be almost in she eye but she shake she head and he go back to he seat with a manful but very red little face in a few moment he lay down he knife and fork and say mamma will you please to excuse I certainly my dear say she nobody but i understand it or observe that the little fellow have to run very fast to get out of the room without cry afterward she tell I that she never send a child away from the table in any other way but what would you do say i if he be to refuse to ask to be excuse then the tear stand full in she eye do you think he could she reply when he see that i be only try to save he from pain in the evening charley sit in my lap and be very sober at last he whisper to I i 'll tell you a awful secret if you will not tell do you think i have do my dinner this afternoon when i get excuse well i have not mamma make I because i act so that be the way she always do but i have not have to have it do to I before for ever so long -- not since i be a little fellow -lrb- he be eight now -rrb- and i do not believe i ever shall again till i be a man then he add reflectively mary bring I all the rest of my dinner upstairs but i would not touch it only a little bit of the ice-cream i do not think i deserve any at all do you i shall never so long as i live forget a lesson of this sort which my own mother once give I i be not more than seven year old but i have a great susceptibility to color and shape in clothes and a insatiable admiration for all people who come finely dress one day my mother say to I now i will play ` house ' with you who do not remember when to play house be they chief of play and to whose later thought have it not occur that in this mimic little show lay bind up the whole of life my mother be the liveliest of playmate she take the worst doll the broken tea-set the shabby furniture and the least convenient corner of the room for she establishment social life become a round of festivity when she keep house as my opposite neighbor at last after the washing-day and the baking-day and the day when she take dinner with I and the day when we take we child and walk out together come the day for I to take my oldest child and go across to make a call at she house chill discomfort strike I on the very threshold of my visit where be the genial laughing talk lady who have be my friend up to that moment there she sit stock-still dumb stare first at my bonnet then at my shawl then at my gown then at my foot up and down down and up she scan I barely reply in monosyllable to my attempt at conversation finally get up and come nearer and examine my clothes and my child 's still more closely a very few minute of this be more than i could bear and almost cry i say why mamma what make you do so then the play be over and she be once more the wise and tender mother tell I playfully that it be precisely in such a way i have stare the day before at the clothes of two lady who have come in to visit she i never need that lesson again to this day if i find myself depart from it for a instant the old tingling shame burn in my cheek to this day also the old tingling pain burn my cheek as i recall certain rude and contemptuous word which be say to I when i be very young and stamped on my memory forever i be once call a stupid child in the presence of stranger i have bring the wrong book from my father 's study nothing could be say to I to-day which would give I a tenth part of the hopeless sense of degradation which come from those word another time on the arrival of a unexpected guest to dinner i be send in a great hurry away from the table to make room with the remark that it be not of the least consequence about the child she could just as well have she dinner afterward the child would have be only too happy to help on the hospitality of the sudden emergency if the thing have be differently put but the sting of have it put in that way i never forget yet in both these instance the rudeness be so small in comparison with what we habitually see that it would be too trivial to mention except for the bearing of the fact that the pain it give have last till now when we consider seriously what ought to be the nature of a reproof from a parent to a child and what be its end the answer be simple enough it should be nothing but the superior wisdom and strength explain to inexperience and feebleness wherein they have make a mistake to the end that they may avoid such mistake in future if personal annoyance impatience antagonism enter in the relation be mar and the end endanger most sacred and inalienable of all rights be the right of helplessness to protection from the strong of ignorance to counsel from the wise if we give we protection and counsel grudgingly or in a churlish unkind manner even to the stranger that be in we gate we be no christian and deserve to be strip of what little wisdom and strength we have hoard but there be no word to say what we be or what we deserve if we do thus to the little child whom we have dare for we own pleasure to bring into the peril of this life and whose whole future may be blighted by the mistake of we careless hand break the will this phrase be go out of use it be high time it do if the thing it represent would also cease there would be stronger and freer man and woman but the phrase be still sometimes hear and there be still conscientious father and mother who believe they do god service in set about the thing i have more than once say to a parent who use these word will you tell I just what you mean by that of course you do not mean exactly what you say yes i do i mean that the child 's will be to be once for all break -- that he be to learn that my will be to be he law the sooner he learn this the better but be it to you will simply _ as _ will that he be to yield simply as the weaker yield to the stronger -- almost as matter yield to force for what reason be he to do this why because i know what be best for he and what be right and he do not ah that be a very different thing he be then to do the thing that you tell he to do because that thing be right and be needful for he you be he guide on a road over which you have go and he have not you be a interpreter a helper you know better than he do about all thing and you knowledge be to teach he ignorance certainly that be what i mean a pretty state of thing it would be if child be to be allow to think they know as much as they parent there be no way except to break they will in the beginning but you have just say that it be not to you will as will that he be to yield but to you superior knowledge and experience that surely be not ` break he will ' it be of all thing furthest remove from it it be educate he will it be teach he how to will this sound dangerous but the logic be not easily turn aside and there be little left for the advocate of will-breaking but to fall back on some text in the bible which have be so often misquote in this connection that one can hardly hear they with patience to child obey you parent be add in the lord and because it be right not because they be you parent spare the rod have be quite gratuitously assume to mean spare blow rod mean here as elsewhere simply punishment we be not tell to train up a child to have no will but we own but in the way in which he should go and to the end that when he be old he should not depart from it -- ie that he will should be so educate that he will choose to walk in the right way still suppose a child 's will to be actually break suppose he to be so trained that he have no will but to obey he parent what be to become of this helpless machine which have no central spring of independent action can we stand by each minute of each hour of each day and say to the automata go here or go there can we be sure of live as long as they live can we wind they up like seventy-year clock and leave they but this be idle it be not thank god in the power of any man or any woman to break a child 's will they may kill the child 's body in try like that still unhung clergyman in western new york who whip he three-year-old son to death for refuse to repeat a prayer to he step-mother body be frail thing there be more child-martyrs than will be know until the body terrestrial be do with but by one escape or another the will the soul go free sooner or later every human being come to know and prove in he own estate that freedom of will be the only freedom for which there be no chain possible and that in nature 's whole reign of law nothing be so largely provide for as liberty sooner or later all this must come but if it come later it come through cloud of antagonism and after day of fight and be hard-bought it should come sooner like the kingdom of god which it be -- without observation gracious as sunshine sweet as dew it should begin with the infant 's first dawn of comprehension that there be two course of action two quality of conduct : one wise the other foolish one right the other wrong i be sure for i have see that a child 's moral perception can be so make clear and he will so make strong and upright that before he be ten year old he will see and take he way through all common day rightly and bravely will he always act up to he highest moral perception no do we but one right decision that he make voluntarily unbiassed by the assertion of authority or the threat of punishment be worth more to he in development of moral character than a thousand in which he simply do what he be compel to do by some sort of outside pressure i read once in a book intend for the guidance of mother a story of a little child who in repeat he letter one day suddenly refuse to say a all the other letter he repeat again and again unhesitatingly but a he would not and persist in declare that he could not say he be severely whip but still persist it now become a contest of will he be whip again and again and again in the interval between the whipping the primer be present to he and he be tell that he would be whip again if he do not mind he mother and say a i forget how many time he be whip but it be almost too many time to be believe the fight be a terrible one at last in a paroxysm of he cry under the blow the mother think she hear he sob out a and the victory be consider to be win a little boy whom i know once have a similar contest over a letter of the alphabet but the contest be with himself and he mother be the faithful great heart who help he through the story be so remarkable that i have long want all mother to know it it be as perfect a illustration of what i mean by educate the will as the other one be of what be call break it willy be about four year old he have a large active brain sensitive temperament and indomitable spirit he be and be a uncommon child common method of what be commonly suppose to be discipline would if he have survive they have make a very bad boy of he he have great difficulty in pronounce the letter g -- so much that he have form almost a habit of omit it one day he mother say not dream of any special contest this time you must say g it be a ugly old letter and i be not ever go to try to say it again say willy repeat the alphabet very rapidly from begin to end without the g like a wise mother she do not open at once on a struggle but say pleasantly ah you do not get it in that time try again go more slowly and we will have it it be all in vain and it soon begin to look more like real obstinacy on willy 's part than any thing she have ever see in he she have often tell I how she hesitate before enter on the campaign i always know she say that willy 's first real fight with himself would be no matter of a few hour and it be a particularly inconvenient time for I just then to give up a day to it but it seem on the whole best not to put it off so she say now willy you can not get along without the letter g the longer you put off say it the harder it will be for you to say it at last and we will have it settle now once for all you be never go to let a little bit of a letter like that be stronger than willy we will not go out of this room till you have say it unfortunately willy 's will have already take its stand however the mother make no authoritative demand that he should pronounce the letter as a matter of obedience to she because it be a thing intrinsically necessary for he to do she would see at any cost to herself or to he that he do it but he must do it voluntarily and she would wait till he do the morning wear on she busy herself with other matter and leave willy to himself now and then ask with a smile well be not my little boy stronger than that ugly old letter yet willy be sulky he understand in that early stage all that be involve dinner-time come be not you go to dinner mamma oh no dear not unless you say g so that you can go too mamma will stay by she little boy until he be out of this trouble the dinner be bring up and they eat it together she be cheerful and kind but so serious that he feel the constant pressure of she pain the afternoon drag slowly on to night willy cry now and then and she take he in she lap and say dear you will be happy as soon as you say that letter and mamma will be happy too and we can not either of we be happy until you do oh mamma why do not you _ make _ I say it -lrb- this he say several time before the affair be over -rrb- because dear you must make yourself say it i be help you make yourself say it for i shall not let you go out of this room nor go out myself till you do say it but that be all i shall do to help you i be listen listen all the time and if you say it in ever so little a whisper i shall hear you that be all mamma can do for you bed-time come willy go to bed unkissed and sad the next morning when willy 's mother open she eye she see willy sit up in he crib and look at she steadfastly as soon as he see that she be awake he exclaim mamma i can not say it and you know i can not say it you be a naughty mamma and you do not love I she heart sink within she but she patiently go again and again over yesterday 's ground willy cry he eat very little breakfast he stand at the window in a listless attitude of discourage misery which she say cut she to the heart once in a while he would ask for some plaything which he do not usually have she give he whatever he ask for but he could not play she keep up a appearance of be busy with she sewing but she be far more unhappy than willy dinner be bring up to they willy say mamma this be not a bit good dinner she reply yes it be darling just as good as we ever have it be only because we be eat it alone and poor papa be sad too take he all alone downstairs at this willy burst out into a hysterical fit of cry and sob i shall never see my papa again in this world then he mother break down too and cry as hard as he do but she say oh yes you will dear i think you will say that letter before tea-time and we will have a nice evening downstairs together i can not say it i try all the time and i can not say it and if you keep I here till i die i sha not ever say it the second night settle down dark and gloomy and willy cry himself to sleep he mother be ill from anxiety and confinement but she never falter she tell I she resolve that night that if it be necessary she would stay in that room with willy a month the next morning she say to he more seriously than before now willy you be not only a foolish little boy you be unkind you be make everybody unhappy mamma be very sorry for you but she be also very much displeased with you mamma will stay here with you till you say that letter if it be for the rest of you life but mamma will not talk with you as she do yesterday she try all day yesterday to help you and you would not help yourself to-day you must do it all alone mamma be you sure i shall ever say it ask willy yes dear perfectly sure you will say it some day or other do you think i shall say it to-day i can not tell you be not so strong a little boy as i think i believe you would say it yesterday i be afraid you have some hard work before you willy beg she to go down and leave he alone then he beg she to shut he up in the closet and see if that would not make he good every few minute he would come and stand before she and say very earnestly be you sure i shall say it he look very pale almost as if he have have a fit of illness no wonder it be the whole battle of life fight at the age of four it be late in the afternoon of this the third day willy have be sit in he little chair look steadily at the floor for so long a time that he mother be almost frightened but she hesitate to speak to he for she feel that the crisis have come suddenly he spring up and walk toward she with all the deliberate firmness of a man in he whole bearing she say there be something in he face which she have never see since and do not expect to see till he be thirty year old mamma say he well dear say he mother tremble so that she could hardly speak mamma he repeat in a loud sharp tone g g g g and then he burst into a fit of cry which she have hard work to stop it be over willy be now ten year old from that day to this he mother have never have a contest with he she have always be able to leave all practical question affect he behavior to he own decision merely say willy i think this or that will be better he self-control and gentleness be wonderful to see and the blending in he face of childlike simplicity and purity with manly strength be something which i have only once see equal for a few day he go about the house shout g g g at the top of he voice he be hear ask playmate if they could say g and who show they how for several year he use often to allude to the affair say do you remember mamma that dreadful time when i would not say g he always use the verb would not in speaking of it once when he be sick he say mamma do you think i could have say g any sooner than i do i have never feel certain about that willy she say what do _ you _ think i think i could have say it a few minute sooner i be say it to _ myself _ as long as that say willy it be singular that although up to that time he have never be able to pronounce the letter with any distinctness when he first make up he mind in this instance to say it he enunciate it with perfect clearness and never again go back to the old imperfect pronunciation few mother perhaps would be able to give up two whole day to such a battle as this other child other duty would interfere but the same principle could be carry out without the mother 's remain herself by the child 's side all the time moreover not one child in a thousand would hold out as willy do in all ordinary case a few hour would suffice and after all what would the sacrifice of even two day be in comparison with the time save in year to come if there be no stronger motive than one of policy of desire to take the course easiest to themselves mother might well resolve that they first aim should be to educate they child 's will and make they strong instead of to conquer and break they the reign of archelaus herod 's massacre have after all a certain mercy in it : there be no linger torture the slayer of child go about with naked and bloody sword which mother could see and might at least make effort to flee from into rachel 's refusal to be comfort there need enter no bitter agony of remorse but herod 's death it seem do not make judea a safe place for baby when joseph hear that archelaus do reign in the room of he father herod he be afraid to return thither with the infant jesus and only after repeat command and warning from god would he venture as far as nazareth the reign of archelaus be not yet over he have have many name and rule over more and more country but the spirit of he father herod be still in he to-day he power be at its zenith he be call education and the safest place for the dear holy child be still egypt or some other of the fortunate country call unenlighten some year ago there be symptom of a strong rebellion against he tyranny horace mann lift up he strong hand and voice against it physician and physiologist come out gravely and earnestly and fortify they position with statistics from which there be no appeal thoma wentworth higginson whose word have with the light graceful beauty of the damascus blade its swift sureness in cleave to the heart of thing write a article for the atlantic monthly call the murder of the innocent which we wish could be put into every house in the united state some change in school organization result from these protest in the matter of ventilation of school-room some real improvement be probably effect though we shudder to think how much room remain for further improvement when we read in the report of the superintendent of public school in brooklyn that in the primary department of the grammar school a average daily number of 33275 pupil be crowd into one-half the space provide in the upper department for a average daily attendance of 26359 or compel to occupy badly light inconvenient and ill-ventilated gallery or room in the basement story but in regard to the number of hour of confinement and amount of study require of child it be hard to believe that school have ever be much more murderously exacting than now the substitution of the single session of five hour for the old arrangement of two session of three hour each with a two-hours interval at noon be regard as a great gain so it would be if all the brain-work of the day be do in that time but in most school with the five-hours session there be next to no provision for study in school-hour and the pupil be require to learn two three or four lesson at home now when be you boy to learn these lesson not in the morning before school that be plain school end at two few child live sufficiently near they school to get home to dinner before half past two o'clock we say nothing of the undesirableness of take the hearty meal of the day immediately after five hour of mental fatigue it be probably a less evil than the late dinner at six and we be in a region where we be grateful for _ less _ evil dinner be over at quarter past three we make close estimate in winter there be leave less than two hour before dark this be all the time the child be to have for out-door play two hour and a half -lrb- counting in he recess -rrb- out of twenty-four ask any farmer even the stupidest how well he colt or he lamb would grow if it have but two hour a day of absolute freedom and exercise in the open air and that in the dark and the chill of a late afternoon in spite of the dark and the chill however you boy skate or slide on until he be call in by you who if you be a american mother care a great deal more than he do for the bad mark which will stand on he week 's report if those three lesson be not learn before bed-time he be tired and cold he do not want to study -- who would it be six o'clock before he be fairly at it you work harder than he do and in half a hour one lesson be learn then come tea after tea half a hour or perhaps a hour remain before bed-time in this time which ought to be spend in light cheerful talk or play the rest of the lesson must be learn he be sleepy and discourage word which in the freshness of the morning he would have learn in a very few moment with ease it be now simply out of he power to commit to memory you if you be not superhuman grow impatient at eight o'clock he go to bed he brain excite and weary in no condition for healthful sleep and he heart oppress with the fear of miss in the next day 's recitation and this be one out of the school-year 's two hundred and sixteen day -- all of which will be like this or worse one of the most pitiful sight we have see for month be a little group of four dear child gather round the library lamp try to learn the next day 's lesson in time to have a story read to they before go to bed they have take the precaution to learn one lesson immediately after dinner before go out cut they out-door play down by half a hour the two elder be learn a long spelling-lesson the third be grapple with geographical definition of cape promontory and so forth and the youngest be at work on he primer in spite of all they effort bed-time come before the lesson be learn the little geography student have be nod over she book for some minute and she have the philosophy to say i do not care i be so sleepy i have rather go to bed than hear any kind of a story but the elder one be grieve and unhappy and say there will not _ ever _ be any time we shall have just as much more to learn to-morrow night the next morning however there be a sight still more pitiful : the baby of seven with a little bit of paper and a pencil and three sum in addition to be do and the father vainly endeavor to explain they to he in the hurry moment before breakfast it would be easy to show how fatal to all real mental development how false to all nature 's law of growth such a system must be but that belong to another side of the question we speak now simply of the effect of it on the body and here we quote largely from the admirable article of col higginson 's above refer to no stronger more direct more conclusive word can be write : -- sir walter scott accord to carlyle be the only perfectly healthy literary man who ever live he give it as he deliberate opinion in conversation with basil hall that five and a half hour form the limit of healthful mental labor for a mature person ` this i reckon very good work for a man ' he say ' i can very seldom work six hour a day ' suppose he estimate to be correct and five and a half hour the reasonable limit for the day 's work of a mature intellect it be evident that even this must be altogether too much for a immature one ` to suppose the youthful brain ' say the recent admirable report by dr ray of the providence insane hospital ` to be capable of a amount of work which be consider a ample allowance to a adult brain be simply absurd ' ` it would be wrong therefore to deduct less than a half-hour from scott 's estimate for even the oldest pupil in we highest school leave five hour as the limit of real mental effort for they and reduce this for all younger pupil very much further ' but scott be not the only authority in the case let we ask the physiologist so say horace mann before we in the day when the massachusett school system be in process of formation he ask the physician in 1840 and in he report print the answer of three of the most eminent the late dr woodward of worcester promptly say that child under eight should never be confine more than one hour at a time nor more than four hour a day dr jame jackson of boston allow the child four hour schooling in winter and five in summer but only one hour at a time and heartily express he detestation of give young child lesson to learn at home dr sg howe reasoning elaborately on the whole subject say that child under eight year of age should never be confine more than half a hour at a time by follow which rule with long recess they can study four hour daily child between eight and fourteen should not be confine more than three-quarter of a hour at a time have the last quarter of each hour for exercise on the play-ground indeed the one thing about which doctor do _ not _ disagree be the destructive effect of premature or excessive mental labor i can quote you medical authority for and against every maxim of dietetics beyond the very simplest but i defy you to find one man who ever beg borrow or steal the title of md and yet abused those two honorary letter by assert under they cover that a child could safely study as much as a man or that a man could safely study more than six hour a day the worst danger of it be that the moral be write at the end of the fable not at the begin the organization in youth be so dangerously elastic that the result of these intellectual excess be not see until year after when some young girl incur spinal disease from some slight fall which she ought not to have feel for a hour or some business man break down in the prime of he year from some trifling over-anxiety which should have leave no trace behind the popular verdict may be ` mysterious providence ' but the wiser observer see the retribution for the folly of those misspend day which enfeebled the childish constitution instead of ripen it one of the most striking passage in the report of dr ray before mention be that in which he explain that ` though study at school be rarely the immediate cause of insanity it be the most frequent of its ulterior cause except hereditary tendency ' _ it diminish the conservative power of the animal economy to such a degree that attack of disease which otherwise would have pass off safely destroy life almost before danger be anticipate _ it would be easy to multiply authority on these point it be hard to stop but we limit forbid any thing like a full treatment of the subject yet discussion on this question ought never to cease in the land until a reform be bring about teacher be to blame only in part for the present wrong state of thing they be to blame for yield for acquiesce but the real blame rest on parent here and there individual father and mother teach perhaps by heart-rending experience try to make stand against the current of false ambition and unhealthy standard but these be rare exception parent as a class not only help on but create the pressure to which teacher yield and child be sacrifice the whole responsibility be really theirs they have in they hand the power to regulate the whole school routine to which they child be to be subject this be plain when we once consider what would be the immediate effect in any community large or small if a majority of parent take action together and persistently refuse to allow any child under fourteen to be confine in school more than four hour out of the twenty-four more than one hour at a time or to do more than five hour ' brain-work in a day the law of supply and demand be a first principle in three month the school in that community would be entirely reorganize to accord with the parent ' wish in three year the improve average health of the child in that community would bear its own witness in ruddy bloom along the street and perhaps even in one generation so great gain of vigor might be make that the melancholy statistics of burial would no longer have to record the death under twelve year of age of more than two-fifth of the child who be bear the awkward age the expression define itself at the first sound of the word we all think of some one unhappy soul we know just now whom they suggest nobody be ever without at least one brother sister cousin or friend on hand who be struggle through this social slough of despond and nobody ever will be so long as the world go on take it for grant that the slough be a necessity and that the road must go through it nature never mean any such thing now and then she blunder or get thwart of she intent and turn out a person who be awkward hopelessly and forever awkward body and soul be clumsy together and it be hard to fancy they translate to the spiritual world without too much elbow and ankle however these be rare case and come in under the law of variation but a awkward age -- a necessary crisis or stage of uncouthness through which all human being must pass -- nature be incapable of such a conception law have no place for it development do not know it instinct revolt from it and man be the only animal who have be silly and wrong-headed enough to stumble into it the explanation and the remedy be so simple so close at hand that we have not see they the whole thing lie in a nutshell where do this abnormal uncomfortable period come in between childhood we say and maturity it be the transition from one to the other when human being then be neither boy nor man girl nor woman they must be for a few year anomalous creature must they we might perhaps find a name for the individual in this condition as well as for the condition we must look to du chaillu for it if we do but it be too serious a distress to make light of even for a moment we have all feel it and we know how it feel we all see it every day and we know how it look what be it which the child have and the adult lose from the loss of which come this total change of behavior or be it something which the adult have and the child have not it be both and until the loss and the gain the new and the old be permanently separate and balance the awkward age last the child be overlook contradict thwart snub insult whip not constantly not often -- in many case thank god very seldom but the liability be there and he know it he never forget it if you do one burn be enough to make fire dread the adult once fairly recognize as adult be not overlook contradict thwart snub insult whip at least not with impunity to this gratifying freedom these comfortable exemption when they be once establish in we belief we adjust ourselves and grow contentedly good-manner to the other _ rgime _ while we be yet child we also somewhat adjust ourselves be tolerably well behave and make the best of it but who could bear a mixture of both what genius could rise superior to it could be itself surround by such uncertainty no wonder that you son come into the room with a confused expression of uncomfortable pain on every feature when he do not in the least know whether he will be recognize as a gentleman or overlook as a little boy no wonder he sit down in he chair with movement suggestive of nothing but rheumatism and jack-knife when he be think that perhaps there may be some reason why he should not take that particular chair and that if there be he will be order up no wonder that you tall daughter turn red stammer and say foolish thing on be courteously speak to by stranger at dinner when she be afraid that she may be sharply contradict or interrupt and remember that day before yesterday she be tell that child should be see and not hear i know a very clever girl who have the misfortune to look at fourteen as if she be twenty at home she be the shyest and most awkward of creature away from she mother and sister she be self-possessed and charming she say to I once oh i have such a splendid time away from home i be so tall everybody think i be grow up and everybody be civil to I i know also a man of superb physique charming temperament and uncommon talent who be to this day -- and he be twenty-five year old -- nervous and ill at ease in talk with stranger in the presence of he own family he hesitate stammer and never do justice to he thought he say that he believe he shall never be free from this distress he can not escape from the recollection of the year between fourteen and twenty during which he be so systematically snub that he mother 's parlor be to he worse than the chamber of the inquisition he know that he be now sure of courteous treatment that he friend be all proud of he but the old cloud will never entirely disappear something have be lose which can never be regain and the loss be not he alone it be theirs too they be all poorer for life by reason of the unkind day which be go this then be the explanation of the awkward age i be not afraid of any dissent from my definition of the source whence its misery spring everybody 's consciousness bear witness everybody know in the bottom of he heart that however much may be say about the change of voice the thinness of cheek the sharpness of arm the sudden length in leg and lack of length in trousers and frock -- all these have nothing to do with the real misery the real misery be simply and solely the horrible feeling of not belong anywhere not know what a moment might bring forth in the way of treatment from other never be sure which impulse it would be safer to follow to retreat or to advance to speak or to be silent and often overwhelm with unspeakable mortification at the rebuff of the one or the censure of the other oh how dreadful it all be how dreadful it all be even to remember it would be malicious even to refer to it except to point out the cure the cure be plain it need no experiment to test it merely to mention it ought to be enough if human being be so awkward at this unhappy age and so unhappy at this awkward age simply because they do not know whether they be to be treat as child or as adult suppose we make a rule that child be always to be treat in point of courtesy as if they be adult then this awkward age -- this period of transition from a atmosphere of to say the least negative rudeness to one of gracious politeness -- disappear there can not be a crisis of readjustment of social relation : there be no possibility of such a feeling it would be hard to explain to a young person what it mean now and then we see a young man or young woman who have never know it they be usually only child and be commonly speak of as wonder i know such a boy to-day at seventeen he measure six foot in height he have the foot and the hand of a still larger man and he come of a blood which have far more strength than grace but he manner be and always have be sweet gentle compose -- the very ideal of grave tender frank young manhood people say how strange he never seem to have any awkward age at all it would have be stranger if he have neither he father nor he mother ever depart for a instant in they relation with he from the law of courtesy and kindliness of demeanor which govern they relation with other he know but one atmosphere and that a genial one from he babyhood up and in and of this atmosphere have grow up a sweet strong pure soul for which the quiet self-possessed manner be but the fitting garb this be part of the kingdom that cometh unobserved in this kingdom we be all to be king and priest if we choose and all its way be pleasantness but we be not ready for it till we have become peaceable and easy to be entreat and have learn to understand why it be that one day when jesus call he disciple together he set a little child in they midst a day with a courteous mother during the whole of one of last summer 's hottest day i have the good fortune to be seat in a railway car near a mother and four child whose relation with each other be so beautiful that the pleasure of watch they be quite enough to make one forget the discomfort of the journey it be plain that they be poor they clothes be coarse and old and have be make by inexperienced hand the mother 's bonnet alone would have be enough to have condemn the whole party on any of the world 's thoroughfare i remember afterward with shame that i myself have smile at the first sight of its antiquated ugliness but she face be one which it give you a sense of rest to look upon -- it be so earnest tender true and strong it have little comeliness of shape or color in it it be thin and pale she be not young she have work hard she have evidently be much ill but i have see few face which give I such pleasure i think that she be the wife of a poor clergyman and i think that clergyman must be one of the lord 's best watchman of soul the child -- two boy and two girl -- be all under the age of twelve and the youngest could not speak plainly they have have a rare treat they have be visit the mountain and they be talk over all the wonder they have see with a glow of enthusiastic delight which be to be envy only a word-for-word record would do justice to they conversation no description could give any idea of it -- so free so pleasant so genial no interruption no contradiction and the mother 's part bear all the while with such equal interest and eagerness that no one not see she face would dream that she be any other than a elder sister in the course of the day there be many occasion when it be necessary for she to deny request and to ask service especially from the eldest boy but no young girl anxious to please a lover could have do either with a more tender courtesy she have she reward for no lover could have be more tender and manly than be this boy of twelve they lunch be simple and scanty but it have the grace of a royal banquet at the last the mother produce with much glee three apple and a orange of which the child have not know all eye fasten on the orange it be evidently a great rarity i watch to see if this test would bring out selfishness there be a little silence just the shade of a cloud the mother say how shall i divide this there be one for each of you and i shall be best off of all for i expect big taste from each of you oh give annie the orange annie love orange speak out the oldest boy with a sudden air of a conqueror and at the same time take the smallest and worst apple himself oh yes let annie have the orange echo the second boy nine year old yes annie may have the orange because that be nicer than the apple and she be a lady and she brother be gentleman say the mother quietly then there be a merry contest as to who should feed the mother with largest and most frequent mouthful and so the feast go on then annie pretend to want apple and exchange thin golden strip of orange for bite out of the cheek of baldwin and as i sit watch she intently she suddenly fancy she see longing in my face and spring over to I hold out a quarter of she orange and say do not you want a taste too the mother smile understandingly when i say no i thank you you dear generous little girl i do not care about orange at noon we have a tedious interval of wait at a dreary station we sit for two hour on a narrow platform which the sun have scorch till it smell of heat the oldest boy -- the little lover -- hold the youngest child and talk to she while the tired mother close she eye and rest now and then he look over at she and then back at the baby and at last he say confidentially to I -lrb- for we have become fast friend by this time -rrb- be not it funny to think that i be ever so small as this baby and papa say that then mamma be almost a little girl herself the two other child be toiling up and down the bank of the railroad-track pick ox-eye daisy buttercup and sorrel they work like beaver and soon the bunch be almost too big for they little hand then they come run to give they to they mother oh dear think i how that poor tired woman will hate to open she eye and she never can take those great bunch of common fading flower in addition to all she bundle and bag i be mistaken oh thank you my darling how kind you be poor hot tired little flower how thirsty they look if they will only try and keep alive till we get home we will make they very happy in some water will not we and you shall put one bunch by papa 's plate and one by mine sweet and happy the weary and flush little child stand look up in she face while she talk they heart thrill with compassion for the drooping flower and with delight in the give of they gift then she take great trouble to get a string and tie up the flower and then the train come and we be whirling along again soon it grow dark and little annie 's head nod then i hear the mother say to the oldest boy dear be you too tire to let little annie put she head on you shoulder and take a nap we shall get she home in much better case to see papa if we can manage to give she a little sleep how many boy of twelve hear such word as these from tired overburdened mother soon come the city the final station with its bustle and noise i linger to watch my happy family hope to see the father why papa be not here exclaim one disappointed little voice after another never mind say the mother with a still deeper disappointment in she own tone perhaps he have to go to see some poor body who be sick in the hurry of pick up all the parcel and the sleepy baby the poor daisy and buttercup be leave forget in a corner of the rack i wonder if the mother have not intend this may i be forgive for the injustice a few minute after i pass the little group standing still just outside the station and hear the mother say oh my darling i have forget you pretty bouquet i be so sorry i wonder if i could find they if i go back will you all stand still and not stir from this spot if i go oh mamma do not go do not go we will get you some more do not go cry all the child here be you flower madam say i i see that you have forget they and i take they as memento of you and you sweet child she blush and look disconcerted she be evidently unused to people and shy with all but she child however she thank I sweetly and say -- i be very sorry about they the child take such trouble to get they and i think they will revive in water they can not be quite dead they will _ never _ die say i with a emphasis which go from my heart to hers then all she shyness flee she know I and we shake hand and smile into each other 's eye with the smile of kindred as we part as i follow on i hear the two child who be walk behind say to each other would not that have be too bad mamma like they so much and we never could have get so many all at once again yes we could too next summer say the boy sturdily they be sure of they next summer i think all six of those soul -- child and mother and father they may never again gather so many ox-eye daisy and buttercup all at once perhaps some of the little hand have already pick they last flower nevertheless they summer be certain to such soul as these all tree either here or in god 's larger country be tree of life with twelve manner of fruit and leave for healing and it be but little change from the summer here whose sun burn and make weary to the summer there of which the lamb be the light heaven bless they all wherever they be child in nova scotium nova scotium be a country of gracious surprise instead of the stone which be what stranger chiefly expect at she hand she give we a wealth of fertile meadow instead of stormy wave break on a frown coast she show we smooth basin whose shore be soft and wooded to the water 's edge and into which empty wonderful tidal river whose course where the tide-water have flow out lie like curve band of bright brown satin among the green field she have no barrenness no unsightliness no poverty everywhere beauty everywhere riches she be bide she time but most beautiful among she beauty most wonderful among she wonder be she child during two week ' travel in the province i have be constantly more and more impressed by they superiority in appearance size and health to the child of the new england and middle state in the outset of we journey i be strike by it along all the roadside they look up boy and girl fair broad-cheeked sturdy-legged such as with we be see only now and then i do not however realize at first that this be the universal law of the land and that it point to something more than climate as a cause but the first school that i see _ en masse _ give a startling impetus to the train of observation and inference into which i be unconsciously fall it be a Sunday school in the little town of wolfville which lie between the gaspcreau and cornwalli river just beyond the meadow of the grand pr where live gabriel lajeunesse and benedict bellefontaine and the rest of the simple acadian farmer mist from the mighty atlantic more than look on the happy valley that Sunday morning convict longfellow of a mistake they do descend from they station on solemn blomidon and fall in a slow unpleasant drizzle in the street of wolfville and horton i arrive too early at one of the village church and while i be wait for a sexton a door open and out pour the Sunday school whose service have just end on they come divide in the center and fall to the right and leave about I thirty or forty boy and girl between the age of seven and fifteen i look at they in astonishment they all have fair skin red cheek and clear eye they be all broad-shouldered straight and sturdy the younger one be more than sturdy -- they be fat from the ankle up but perhaps the most noticeable thing of all be the quiet sturdy unharassed expression which they face wear a look which be the greatest charm of a child 's face but which we rarely see in child over two or three year old boy of eleven or twelve be there with shoulder broader than the average of we boy at sixteen and yet with the pure childlike look on they face girl of ten or eleven be there who look almost like woman -- that be like ideal woman -- simply because they look so calm and undisturbed the saxon color prevail three-fourth of the eye be blue with hair of that pale ash-brown which the french call _ blonde cendre _ out of they all there be but one child who look sickly he have evidently meet with some accident and be lame afterward as the congregation assemble i watch the father and mother of these child they too be broad-shouldered tall and straight especially the woman even old woman be straight like the negro one see at the south walking with burden on they head five day later i saw in halifax the celebration of the anniversary of the settlement of the province the child of the city and of some of the neighbor town march in band of hope and procession such as we see in the city of the state on the fourth of July this be just the opportunity i want it be the same here as in the country i count on that day just eleven sickly-looking child no more such brilliant cheek such merry eye such evident strength it be a scene to kindle the dullest soul there be score of little one there whose droll fat leg would have draw a crowd in central park and they all have that same quiet compose well-balanced expression of countenance of which i speak before and of which it would be hard to find a instance in all central park climate undoubtedly have something to do with this the air be moist and the mercury rarely rise above 80  or fall below 10  also the comparative quiet of they life help to make they so beautiful and strong but the most significant fact to my mind be that until the past year there have be in nova scotium no public school comparatively few private one and in these there be no severe pressure bring to bear on the pupil the private school have be expensive consequently it have be very unusual for child to be send to school before they be _ eight or nine _ year of age i could not find a person who have ever know of a child 's be send to school _ under seven _ the school session be on the old plan of six hour per day -- from nine till twelve and from one till four but no learning of lesson out of school have be allow within the last year a system of free public school have be introduce and the people be grumble terribly about it say my informant why i ask because they do not wish to have they child educate oh no say he because they do not like to pay the tax alas i think if it be only they silver which would be tax i must not be understand to argue from the health of the child of nova scotium as contrast with the lack of health among we child that it be best to have no public school only that it be better to have no public school than to have such public school as be now kill off we child the registration system of nova scotium be as yet imperfectly carry out it be almost impossible to obtain exact return from all part of so thinly settle a country but such statistics as have be already establish give sufficient food for reflection in this connection in massachusett more than two-fifth of all the child bear die before they be twelve year old in nova scotium the proportion be less than one-third in nova scotium one out of every fifty-six life to be over ninety year of age and one-twelfth of the entire number of death be between the age of eighty and ninety in massachusett one person out of one hundred and nine life to be over ninety in massachusett the mortality from disease of the brain and nervous system be eleven per cent in nova scotium it be only eight per cent the republic of the family he be lover and friend and son all in one say a friend the other day tell I of a dear boy who out of he first earnings have just send to he mother a beautiful gift cost much more than he could really afford for such a purpose that mother be the wisest sweetest most triumphant mother i have ever know i be restrain by feeling of deepest reverence for she from speak as i might speak of the rare and tender method by which she motherhood have work patiently and alone for nearly twenty year and make of she two son lover and friend i have always feel that she owe it to the world to impart to other mother all that she could of she divine secret to write out even in detail all the process by which she boy have grow to be so strong upright loving and manly but one of she first principle have so direct a bearing on the subject that i wish to speak of here that i venture to attempt a explanation of it she have tell I that she never once even in they childish day take the ground that she have right to require any thing from they simply _ because _ she be they mother this be a position very startling to the average parent it be exactly counter to tradition why must i or why can not i say the child because i say so and i be you father have be the stern authoritative reply ever since we can any of we remember and i presume ever since the christian era since that good apostle paul see enough in the ephesian family where he visit to lead he to write to they from rome father provoke not you child to wrath it seem to I that there be few question of practical moment in every-day living on which a foregone and erroneous conclusion have be adopt so generally and so undoubtingly how it first come about it be hard to see or rather it be easy to see when one reflect and the very clearness of the surface explanation of it only make its injustice more odious it come about because the parent be strong and the child weak helplessness in the hand of power -- that be the whole story suppose for a instant -lrb- and absurd as the supposition be practically it be not logically absurd -rrb- that the child at six be strong enough to whip he father let he have the intellect of a infant the mistake and the fault of a infant -- which the father would feel himself bind and _ would be _ bind to correct -- but the body of a man and then see in how different fashion the father would set himself to work to insure good behavior i never see the heavy impatient hand of a grown man or woman lay with its brute force even for the smallest purpose on a little child without longing for a sudden miracle to give the baby a equal strength to resist when we realize what it be for we to dare for we own pleasure even with solemnest purpose of the holiest of pleasure parenthood to bring into existence a soul which must take for we sake its chance of joy or sorrow how monstrous it seem to assume that the fact that we have do this thing give we arbitrary right to control that soul to set we will as will in place of its will to be law unto its life to try to make of it what it suit we fancy or we convenience to have it to claim that it be under obligation to we the truth be all the obligation in the outset be the other way we owe all to they all that we can do to give they happiness to spare they pain all that we can do to make they wise and good and safe -- all be too little all and more than all can never repay they for the sweetness the blessedness the development that it have be to we to call child ours if we can also so win they love by we loving so deserve they respect by we honorableness so earn they gratitude by we helpfulness that they come to be we lover and friend then ah then we have have enough of heaven here to make we willing to postpone the more for which we hope beyond but all this come not of authority not by command all this be perilled always always impaired and often lose by authoritative arbitrary ruling substitution of law and penalty for influence it will be object by parent who disagree with this theory that only authority can prevent license that without command there will not be control no one have a right to condemn method he have not try i know for i have see i know for i have myself test that command and authority be short-lived that they do not insure the result they aim at that real and permanent control of a child 's behavior even in little thing be gain only by influence by a slow sure educate enlighten and strengthen of a child 's will i know for i have see that it be possible in this way to make a child only ten year old quite as intelligent and trustworthy a free agent as he mother to make he so sensible so gentle so considerate that to say must or must not to he would be as unnecessary and absurd as to say it to she but if it be wiser and better to surround even little child with this atmosphere of freedom how much more essential be it for those who remain under the parental roof long after they have cease to be child just here seem to I to be the fatal rock upon which many household make utter shipwreck of they peace father and mother who have rule by authority -lrb- let it be as loving as you please it will still remain a arbitrary rule -rrb- in the beginning never seem to know when they child be child no longer but have become man and woman in any average family the position of a unmarried daughter after she be twenty year old become less and less what it should be in case of son the question be rarely a practical one in those exceptional instance where invalidism or some other disability keep a man helpless for year under he father 's roof he very helplessness be at once he vindication and he shield and also prevent he feeling manly revolt against the position of unnatural childhood but in the case of daughter it be very different who do not number in he circle of acquaintance many unmarried woman between the age of thirty and forty perhaps even older who have practically little more freedom in the order of they own life than they have when they be eleven the mother or the father continue just as much the autocratic center of the family now as of the nursery thirty year before take into account the chance -- no the certainty -- of great difference between parent and child in matter of temperament and taste it be easy to see that great suffering must result from this suffer too which involve real loss and hindrance to growth it be really a monstrous wrong but it seem to be rarely observe by the world and never suspect by those who be most responsible for it it be perhaps a question whether the real tyranny in this life be those that be accredit as such there be certainly more than even tyrant know every father and mother have it within easy reach to become the intimate friend of the child closest holiest sweetest of all friendship be this one which have the closest holiest tie of blood to underlie the bond of soul we see it in rare case prove itself divine by rise above even the passion of love between man and woman and carry man and woman unwedded to they grave for sake of love of mother or father when we realize what such friendship be it seem incredible that parent can forego it or can risk lose any shade of its perfectness for the sake of any indulgence of the habit of command or of gratify of selfish preference in the ideal household of father and mother and adult child the one great aim of the parent ought to be to supply as far as possible to each child that freedom and independence which they have miss the opportunity of secure in home of they own the loss of this one thing alone be a bitterer drop in the loneliness of many a unmarried woman than parent especially father be apt even to dream -- food and clothes and lodgings be so exalt in unthinking estimate to be without they would be distressingly inconvenient no doubt but one can have luxurious provision of both and remain very wretched even the body itself can not thrive if it have no more than these three pottage mess freedom to come go speak work play -- in short to be one 's self -- be to the body more than meat and gold and to the soul the whole of life just so far as any parent interfere with this freedom of adult child even in the little thing of a single day or a single hour just so far it be tyranny and the child be wrong but just so far as parent help strengthen and bestow this freedom on they child just so far it be justice and kindness and they relation be cement into a supreme and unalterable friendship whose blessedness and whose comfort no word can measure the ready-to-halt mr ready-to-halt must have be the most exasperating pilgrim that great heart ever drag over the road to the celestial city mr feeble mind be bad enough but genuine weakness and organic incapacity appeal all the while to charity and sympathy if people really can not walk they must be carry everybody see that and all strong people be or ought to be ready to lift baby and cripple there be plenty of such in every parish the feeble mind be unfortunately predispose to intermarry and we school be overrun with the little master and miss feeble mind but heavy as they be -lrb- and they be apt to be fat -rrb- they be precious and pleasant friend and neighbor in comparison with the ready-to-halt the ready-to-halt be never ready for any thing else they can walk as well as anybody else if they only would but they be never quite sure on which road they would better go great heart have to go back and go back to look they up they be find standing still helpless and bewildered on all sort of absurd side-path which lead nowhere and they never will confess either that they need help they always think they be do what they call make up they mind but whichever way they make it they wish they have make it the other so they unmake it directly and by this time the crisis of the first hour which they lose have become complicate with that of the second hour for which they be in no wise ready and so the hour stumble on one after another and the day be only a tangle of ineffective cross purpose hundred of such day drift on with they sad burden of waste time year after year they life fail of growth of delight of blessing to other opportunity 's great golden door which never stay long open for any man have always just close when they reach the threshold of a deed and it be hard very hard to see why it would not have be better for they if they have never be bear after all it be not right to be impatient with they for in nine case out of ten they be no more responsible for they mental limp than the poor chinese woman be for she feeble foot from they infancy up to what in we comic caricature of word we call maturity they have be bandage how should they muscle be good for any thing from the day when we give and take and arrange the baby 's plaything for he hour by hour without ever set before he to choose one of two and give up the other to the day when we take it upon ourselves to decide whether he shall be a engineer or a lawyer we persist in do for he the work which he should do for himself this be because we love he more than we love we own life oh if love could but have its eye open and see if we be not blind we should know that whenever a child decide for himself deliberately and without bias from other any question however small he have have just so many minute of mental gymnastics -- just so much strengthening of the one faculty on whose health and firmness he success in life will depend more than upon any other thing so many people do not know the difference between obstinacy and clear-headed firmness of will that it be hardly safe to say much in praise or blame of either without expressly state that you do not mean the other they be as unlike as digestion and indigestion and one would suppose could not be much more easily confound but it be constantly do it have not yet cease to be say among father and mother that it be necessary to break the will of child and it have not yet cease to be see in the land that man by virtue of simple obstinacy be call man of strong character the truth be that the stronger better-trained will a man have the less obstinate he will be will be of reason obstinacy of temper what have they in common for want of strong will kingdom and soul have be lose without it there be no kingdom for any man -- no not even in he own soul it be the one attribute of all we possess which be most god-like by it we say under he law as he say enact those law so far and no further it be not enough that we do not break this grand power it should be strengthen developed trained and as the good teacher of gymnastics give he beginner light weight to lift and swing so should we bring to the child small point to decide to the very little child very little point will you have the apple or the orange you can not have both choose but after you have choose you can not change will you have the horseback ride to-day or the opera to-morrow night you can have but one every day many time a day a child should decide for himself point involve pro and con -- substantial one too let he even decide unwisely and take the consequence that too be good for he no amount of blackstone can give such a idea of law as a month of prison tell he as much as you please of what you know on both side but compel he to decide and also compel he not to be too long about it choose ye this day whom ye will serve be a text good for every morning if man and woman have in they childhood such training of they will as this we should not see so many put they hand to the plough and look back and not fit for the kingdom of heaven nor for any kingdom of earth either unless it be for the wicked little kingdom of the prince of monaco where there be but two thing to be do -- gamble or drown yourself the descendant of nabal the line have never be break and they have marry into respectable family right and leave until to-day there can hardly be find a household which have not at least one to worry it they be not man and woman of great passionate nature who flame out now and then in a outbreak like a volcano from which everybody run this though terrible while it last be soon over and there be great compensation in such soul they love be worth have they tenderness be great one can forgive they seventy time seven for the hasty word and action of which they repent immediately with tear but the nabal be sullen they be grumbler they be never do such son of belial be they to this day that no man can speak peaceably unto they they be as much worse than passionate people as a slow drizzle of rain be than a thunder-storm for the thunder-storm you stay in-door and you can not help have pleasure in its sharp light and dark and echo and when it be over what clear air what a rainbow but in the drizzle you go out you think that with a waterproof a umbrella and overshoe you can manage to get about in spite of it and attend to you business what a state you come home in -- muddy limp chill dishearten the house greet you look also muddy and cold -- for the best of front hall give up in despair and can not look any thing but forlorn in a long drizzling rain all the window be blear with trickle foggy wet on the outside which there be no wipe off nor see through and if one could see through there be no gain the street be more gloomy than the house black slimy mud inch deep on crossing the same black slimy mud in footprint on side-walks hopeless-looking people hurry by so unhappy by reason of the drizzle that a weird sort of family likeness be to be see in all they face this be all that can be see outside it be better not to look for the inside be no redemption except a wood-fire -- a good generous wood-fire -- not in any of the modern compromise call open stove but on a broad stone hearth with a big background of chimney up which the spark can go skip and creep this can redeem a drizzle but this can not redeem a grumbler plump he sit down in the warmth of its very blaze and complain that it snap perhaps or that it be oak and maple when he pay for all hickory you can trust he to put out you wood-fire for you as effectually as a water-spout and if even a wood-fire bless it can not outshine the gloom of he presence what be to happen in the place where there be no wood-fire on the day when real misery big and little be on hand to be make into mountain of torture by he grumble oh who can describe he there be no language which can do justice to he no supernatural foresight which can predict where he next thrust will fall from what unsuspected corner he will send he next arrow like death he have all season for he own he ingenuity be infernal whoever try to forestall or appease he might better be at work in augean stable because after all we must admit that the fact of life be on he side it be not intend that we shall be very comfortable there be a terrible amount of total depravity in animate and inanimate thing from morning till night there be not a hour without its cross to carry the weather thwart we servant landlord driver washerwoman and bosom friend misbehave clothes do not fit tooth ache stomach get out of order newspaper be stupid and child make too much noise if there be not big trouble there be little one if they be not in sight they be hide i have wonder whether the happiest mortal could point to one single moment and say at that moment there be nothing in my life which i would have have change i think not in argument therefore the grumbler have the best of it it be more than probable that thing be as he say but why say it why make four misery out of three if the three be already unbearable so much the worse if he be uncomfortable it be a pity we be sorry but we can not change the course of nature we shall soon have we own little turn of torment and we do not want to be wear out before it come by have listen to he probably too the very thing of which he complain be press just as heavily on we as on he -- be just as unpleasant to everybody as to he suppose everybody do as he do imagine for instance a chorus of grumble from ten people at a breakfast-table all say at once or immediately after each other this coffee be not fit to drink really the attendance in this house be insufferably poor i have sometimes wish to try this homoeopathic treatment in a bad case of grumble it sound as if it might work a cure if you lose you temper with the grumbler and turn upon he suddenly say oh do not spoil all we pleasure do make the best of thing : or at least keep quiet then how aggrieved he be how unjust he think you be to make a personal matter of it you do not surely suppose i think you be responsible for it do you he say with a lofty air of astonishment at you unreasonable sensitiveness of course we do not suppose he think we be to blame we do not take he to be a fool as well as a grumbler but he speak to we at we before we about the cause of he discomfort whatever it may be precisely as he would if we be to blame and that be one thing which make he grumble so insufferable but this he can never be make to see and the worst of it be that grumble be contagious if we live with he we shall sooner or later in spite of we dislike of he way fall into they even sink so low perhaps before the end of a single summer as to be hear complain of butter at boarding-house table which be the lowest deep of vulgarity of grumble there be no help for this i have see it again and again i have catch it myself one grumbler in a family be as pestilent a thing as a diseased animal in a herd : if he be not shut up or kill the herd be lose but the grumbler can not be shut up or kill since grumble be not hold to be a proof of insanity nor a capital offence -- more 's the pity what then be to be do keep out of he way at all cost if he be grow up if it be a child labor day and night as you would with a tendency to paralysis or distortion of limb to prevent this blight on its life it sound extreme to say that a child should never be allow to express a dislike of any thing which can not be help but i think it be true i do not mean that it should be positively forbid or punish but that it should never pass unnoticed he attention should be invariably call to its uselessness and to the annoyance it give to other people child begin by be good-natured little grumbler at every thing which go wrong simply from the outspokenness of they nature all they think they say and act the rudiment of good behavior have to be chiefly negative at the outset like punch 's advice to those about to marry -- do not the race of grumbler would soon die out if all child be so trained that never between the age of five and twelve do they utter a needless complaint without be gently remind that it be foolish and disagreeable how easy for a good-natured and watchful mother to do this it take but a word oh dear i wish it have not rain to-day it be too bad you do not really mean what you say my darling it be of much more consequence that the grass should grow than that you should go out to play and it be so silly to complain when we can not stop its rain mamma i hate this pie oh hush dear do not say so if you do you can leave it you need not eat it but think how disagreeable it sound to hear you say such a thing oh dear oh dear i be too cold yes dear i know you be so be mamma but we shall not feel any warmer for say so we must wait till the fire burn better and the time will seem twice as long if we grumble oh mamma mamma my steam-engine be all spoil it will not run i hate thing that wind up but my dear little boy do not grumble so what would you think if mamma be to say ` oh dear oh dear my little boy 's stocking be full of hole how i hate to mend stocking ' and ` oh dear oh dear my little boy have upset my work-box i hate little boy ' how they look steadily into you eye for a minute -- the honest reasonable little soul -- when you say such thing to they and then run off with a laugh lift up for that time by you fitly speak word of help oh if the world could only stop long enough for one generation of mother to be make all right what a millennium could be begin in thirty year but mamma you be grumble yourself at I because i grumbled say a quick-witted darling not ten year old ah never shall any weak spot in we armor escape the keen eye of these little one yes dear and i shall grumble at you till i cure you of grumble grumbler be the only thing in this world that it be right to grumble at boy not allow it be a conspicuous signboard at least four foot long with large black letter on a white ground : boy not allow i look at it for some moment in a sort of bewildered surprise : i do not quite comprehend the meaning of the word at last i understand it i be wait in a large railway station where many train connect and most of the passenger from the train in which i be be eat dinner in a hotel near by i be entirely alone in the car with the exception of one boy who be perhaps eleven year old i make a involuntary ejaculation as i read the word on the sign and the boy look around at I little boy say i solemnly do you see that sign he turn he head and read the ominous warning nod sullenly but say nothing boy what do it mean say i boy must be allow to come into this railway station there be two now stand in the doorway directly under the sign the latent sympathy in my tone touch he heart he leave he seat and come to mine edge in past I and put he head out of the window read the sentence aloud in a contemptuous tone then he offer I a peanut which i take and he proceed to tell I what he think of the sign boy not allow say he that be just the way ` tis everywhere but i never see the sign up before it do not make any difference though whether they put the sign up or not why in new york -lrb- you live in new york do not you -rrb- they will not even stop the horse-car for a boy to get on nobody think any thing 'll hurt a boy but they be glad enough to ` allow ' we when there be any errand to be do and -- do you live in new york interrupted i for i do not wish to hear the poor little fellow 's list of misery which i know by heart beforehand without he tell I have be hopeless knight-errant of oppressed boyhood all my life yes he live in new york and he go to a grammar school and he have two sister and so we talk on in that sweet ready trustful talk which come naturally only from child 's lip until the twenty minute for refreshment be over and the choke and cram passenger who have eat big dinner in that breath of time come hurry back to they seat among they come the father and mother of my little friend in angry surprise at not find he in the seat where they leave he they exclaim -- now where _ be _ that boy just like he we might have lose every one of these bag here i be mamma he call out pleasantly i could see the bag all the time nobody come into the car i tell you not to leave the seat sir what do you mean by such conduct say the father oh no papa say poor boy you only tell I to take care of the bag and a anxious look of terror come into he face which tell only too well under how severe a _ rgime _ he live i interpose hastily with -- i be afraid i be the cause of you little son 's leave he seat he have sit very still till i speak to he and i believe i ought to take all the blame the parent be evidently uncultured shallow people they irritation with he be merely a surface vexation which have no real foundation in a deep principle they become complaisant and smile at my first word and boy escape with a look of great relief to another seat where they give he a simple luncheon of saleratus gingerbread boy not allow to go in to dinner at the massasoit think i to myself and upon that text i sit sadly meditate all the way from springfield to boston how true it be as the little fellow have say that it do not make any difference whether they put the sign up or not no one can watch carefully any average household where there be boy and not see that there be a thousand little way in which the boy ' comfort freedom preference will be disregard when the girl ' will be consider this be partly intentional partly unconscious something be to be say undoubtedly on the advantage of make the boy realize early and keenly that manhood be to bear and to work and womanhood be to be help and sheltered but this should be inculcate not inflict ask not seize show and explain not command nothing can be surer than the growth in a boy of tender chivalrous regard for he sister and for all woman if the seed of it be rightly sow and gently nurture but the common method be quite other than this it begin too harshly and at once with assertion or assumption mother never think i be of any consequence say a dear boy to I the other day she be all for the girl this be not true but there be truth in it and i be very sure that the selfishness the lack of real courtesy which we see so plainly and pitiably in the behavior of the average young man to-day be the slow certain result of year of just such feeling as this child express the boy have to scramble for he rights naturally he be too busy to think much about the rights of other the man keep up the habit and be negatively selfish without know it take for instance the one point of the minor courtesy -lrb- if we can dare to call any courtesy minor -rrb- of daily intercourse how many people be there who habitually speak to a boy of ten twelve or fourteen with the same civility as to he sister a little younger or older i like miss -- say this same dear boy to I one day for she always bid I good-morning ah never be one such word throw away on a loving open-hearted boy man know that safe through all the wear and tear of life they keep far greener the memory of some woman or some man who be kind to they in they boyhood than of the friend who help or cheer they yesterday dear bless noisy rollick torment comforting boy what should we do without he how much we like without suspect it he breezy presence in the house except for he how would errand be do chair bring nail drive cow stone out of we way letter carry twine and knife keep ready lose thing find luncheon carry to picnic three-year-old that cry lead out of meeting butterfly and bird ' nest and birch-bark get the horse take round to the stable borrow thing send home -- and all with no charge for time dear patient busy boy shall we not sometimes answer he question give he a comfortable seat wait and not reprove he till after the company have go let he wear he best jacket and buy he half as many necktie as he sister have give he some honey even if there be not enough to go round listen tolerantly to he little bragging and help he do he sum with a sudden shrill scream the engine slip off on a side-track and the car glide into the great grim city-station look all the grimmer for its twinkling light the mass of people who be wait and the mass of people who have come surge toward each other like two great wave and mingle in a moment i catch sight of my poor little friend boy follow he father struggle along in the crowd carry two heavy carpet-bag a strapped bundle and two umbrella and be sharply tell to keep up close there ha say i savagely to myself do porter ' work be not one of the thing which ` boy ' be ` not allow ' half a hour in a railway station it be one of those bleak and rainy day which mark the come of spring on new england sea-shore the rain feel and look as if it might at any minute become hail or snow the air prick like needle when it blow against flesh yet the huge railway station be as full of people as ever one could see no difference between this dreariest of day and the sunniest so far as the crowd be concern except that fewer of the people wear fine clothes perhaps also that they face look a little more sombre and weary than usual there be no place in the world where human nature show to such sad disadvantage as in waiting-room at railway station especially in the lady ' room in the gentleman 's room there be less of that ghastly apathetic silence which seem only explainable as a interval between two terrible catastrophe shall we go so far as to confess that even the unsightly spittoon and the uncleanly and loquacious fellowship result from they common use seem here for the moment redeem from a little of they abominableness -- simply because almost any action be better than utter inaction and any thing which make the joyless taciturn american speak to he fellow whom he do not know be for the time be a blessing but in the lady ' room there be not even a community of interest in a single bad habit to break the monotone of weary stillness who have not feel the very soul writhe within she as she have first cross the threshold of one of these dismal antechamber of journey carpetless dingy dusty two or three low sarcophagus of greenish-gray iron in open space surround by blue-lipped woman in different angle and attitude of awkwardness try to keep the sole of they foot in a perpendicular position to be warm at what they have be lead to believe be a steam-heating apparatus a few more woman equally listless and weary-looking standing in equally difficult and awkward position before a counter hold pie in one hand and tea in a cup and saucer in the other take alternate mouthful of each and spilling both the rest wedge bolt upright against the wall in narrow partition seat which only need a length of perforated foot-board in front to make they fit to be patent as the best method of put whole community of citizen into the stock at once all foot warmer pie-eater and those who sit in the red-velvet stock wear so exactly the same expression of vacuity and fatigue that they might almost be take for one gigantic and unhappy family connection on its way to what be call in newspaper a sad event the only wonder be that this stiffened desiccate crowd retain vitality enough to remember the hour at which its several train depart and to rise up and shake itself alive and go on board one be haunt sometimes by the fancy that some day when the air in the room be unusually bad and the train be delay a curious phenomenon will be see the petrifaction will be carry a little farther than usual and when the bell ring and the official call out train make up for babel hinnom and way station no woman will come forth from the lady ' room no eye will move no muscle will stir husband and brother will wait and search vainly for those who should have meet they at the station with bundle of the day 's shopping to be carry out home will be desolate and the history of rare fossil and petrifaction will have a novel addition or again that if some sudden convulsion of nature like those which before now have bury wicked city and the dweller in they be to-day to swallow up the great city of new sodom in america and keep it under ground for a few thousand year nothing in all its circuit would so puzzle the learn archaeologist of ad 5873 as the position of the skeleton in these same waiting-room of railway station think such thought as these sink slowly and surely to the level of the place i wait on this bleak rainy day in just such a lady ' room as i have describe i sit in the red-velvet stock with my eye fix on the floor please ma'am will not you buy a basket say a cheery little voice so near I without my know it have the little tradesman come that i be as startle as if the voice have speak out of the air just above my head he be a sturdy little fellow ten year old irish dirty ragged but he have honest kind gray eye and a smile which ought to have sell more basket than he could carry a few kind word unseal the fountain of he childish confidence there be four child younger than he the mother take in wash and the father who be a cripple from rheumatism make these basket which he carry about to sell where do you sell the most round the depot that be the best place but the basket be rather clumsy to carry almost everybody have he hand full when he set out on a journey yi be but mostly they do not take the basket but they give I a little change say he with a smile half roguish half sad i watch he on in he pathetic pilgrimage round that dreary room seek help from that dreary circle of woman my heart ache to write down here the true record that out of those score of woman only three even smile or speak to the little fellow only one give he money my own sympathy have be so win by he face and manner that i find myself grow hot with resentment as i watch woman after woman wave he off with indifferent or impatient gesture he face be a face which no mother ought to have be able to see without a thrill of pity and affection god forgive I as if any mother ought to be able to see any child ragged dirty poor seek help and finding none but he face be so honest and brave and responsive that it add much to the appeal of he poverty one woman young and pretty come into the room bring in she arm a large toy horse and a little violin oh i say to myself she have a boy of she own for whom she can buy gift freely she will surely give this poor child a penny he think so too for he go toward she with a more confident manner than he have show to some of the other no she brush by he impatiently without a word and walk to the ticket-office he stand look at the violin and the toy horse till she come back to she seat then he lift he eye to she face again but she apparently do not see he and he go away ah she be only half mother who do not see she own child in every child -- she own child 's grief in every pain which make another child weep presently the little basket-boy go out into the great hall i watch he thread he way in and out among the group of man i see one man -- bless he -- pat the little fellow on the head then i lose sight of he after ten minute he come back into the lady ' room with only one basket in he hand and a very happy little face the sterner sex have be kinder to he than we the smile which he give I in answer to my glad recognition of he good luck be the sunniest sunbeam i have see on a human face for many a day he sink down into the red-velvet stock and twirl he remain basket and swing he shabby little foot as idle and unconcerned as if he be some rich man 's son wait for the train to take he home so much do a little lift help the heart of a child even of a beggar child it be a comfort to remember he with that look on he face instead of the wistful plead one which i see at first i leave he lie back on the dusty velvet which no doubt seem to he unquestionable splendor in the car i sit just behind the woman with the toy-horse and the violin i see she glance rest lovingly on they many time as she think of she boy at home and i wonder if the little basket-seller have really produce no impression whatever on she heart i shall remember he long after -lrb- if he live -rrb- he be a man a genius for affection the other day speak superficially and uncharitably i say of a woman whom i know but slightly she disappoint I utterly how could she husband have marry she she be commonplace and stupid yes say my friend reflectively it be strange she be not a brilliant woman she be not even a intellectual one but there be such a thing as a genius for affection and she have it it have be good for she husband that he marry she the word sink into my heart like a great spiritual plummet they drop down to depths not often stir and from those depths come up some shine sand of truth worth keep among treasure have a phosphorescent light in they which can shine in dark place and make they light as day reveal they beauty a genius for affection yes there be such a thing and no other genius be so great the phrase mean something more than a capacity or even a talent for love that be common to all human being more or less a man or woman without it would be a monster such as have probably never be on the earth all man and woman whatever be they shortcoming in other direction have this impulse this faculty in a degree it take shape in family tie : make clumsy and unfortunate work of they in perhaps two case out of three -- wife torment husband husband neglect and humiliating wife parent maltreat and ruin child child disobey and grieve parent and brother and sister quarrel to the point of proverbial mention but under all this in spite of all this the love be there a great trouble or a sudden emergency will bring it out in any common danger hand clasp closely and quarrel be forget over a sick-bed hard way soften into yearning tenderness and by a grave alas what hot tear fall the poor imperfect love which have let itself be wearied and harass by the friction of life or hinder and warped by a body full of diseased nerve come run too late with its effort to make up lose opportunity it have be all the while alive but in a sort of trance little good have come of it but it be something that it be there it be the divine germ of a flower and fruit too precious to mature in the first year after graft in other soil by other water when the healing of the nation be fulfil we shall see its perfection oh what atonement will be there what allowance we shall make for each other then with what love we shall love but the soul who have what my friend mean by a genius for affection be in another atmosphere than that which common man breathe they upper air be clearer more rarefy than any to which mere intellectual genius can soar because to this last always remain higher height which it can not grasp see nor comprehend michel angelo may build he dome of marble and human intellect may see as clearly as if god have say it that no other dome can ever be build so grand so beautiful but above st peter 's hang the blue tent-dome of the sky vaster rounder elastic unfathomable make st peter 's look small as a drinking-cup shut it soon out of sight to north east south and west by the mysterious horizon-fold which no man can lift and beyond this horizon-fold of we sky shut down again other dome which the wisest astronomer may not measure in whose distance we little ball and we with all we spin can hardly show like a star if st peter 's be swallow up to-morrow it would make no real odds to anybody but the pope the probability be that michel angelo himself have forget all about it titian and raphael and all the great brotherhood of painter may kneel reverently as priest before nature 's face and paint picture at sight of which all man 's eye shall fill with grateful tear and yet all man shall go away and find that the green shade of a tree the light on a young girl 's face the sleep of a child the flowering of a flower be to they picture as live life to beautiful death come to art 's two highest sphere -- music of sound and music of speech -- we find that beethoven and mozart and milton and shakespeare have write but the symphony be sacred only because and only so far as it render the joy or the sorrow which we have feel surely the interpretation be less than the thing interpret face to face with a joy a sorrow would a symphony avail we and as for word who shall express they feebleness in midst of strength the fettered helplessness in spite of which they soar to such height the most perfect sentence ever write bear to the thing it mean to say the relation which the chemist 's formulum do to the thing he handle name analyze can destroy perhaps but can not make every element in the crystal the liquid can be weigh assign and rightly call nothing in all science be more wonderful than a exact chemical formulum but after all be do will remain for ever unknown the one subtle secret the vital center of the whole but the soul who have a genius for affection have no outer dome no higher and more vital beauty no subtle secret of creative motive force to elude they grasp mock they endeavor overshadow they life the subtlest essence of the thing they worship and desire they have in they own nature -- they be no school no standard no law can help or hinder they to they the world be as if it be not work and pain and loss be as if they be not these be they to whom it be easy to die any death if good can come that way to one they love these be they who do die daily unnoted on we right hand and on we leave -- father and mother for child husband and wife for each other these be they also who live -- which be often far harder than it be to die -- long life into whose be never enter one thought of self from the rise to the go down of the sun year build on year with unvarying steadfastness the divine temple of they beauty and they sacrifice they create like god the universe which science see study and explain be small be petty beside the one which grow under they spiritual touch for love beget love the wave of eternity itself ripple out in immortal circle under the ceaseless drop of they crystal deed angel desire to look but can not into the mystery of holiness and beauty which such human life reveal only god can see they clearly god be they nearest of kin for he be love rainy day with what subtle and assure tyranny they take possession of the world stoutest heart be make subject plan of conqueror set aside -- the heaven and the earth and man -- all alike at the mercy of the rain come when they may wait long as they will give what warning they can rainy day be always interruption no human being have plan for they then and there if it have be but yesterday if it be only to-morrow be the cry from all lip ah a lucky tyranny for we be theirs be the cloud subject to mortal call or prohibition the season would fail and death get upper hand of all thing before man agree on a hour of common convenience what test they be of people 's soul show I a dozen man and woman in the early morning of a rainy day and i will tell by they word and they face who among they be rich and who be poor -- who have much goods lay up for just such time of want and who have be spend-thrift and foolish that curious shrewd underlie instinct common to all age which take shape in proverb recognize this long ago who know when it be first say of a man lay up money he lay by for a rainy day how close the parallel be between the man who have spend on each day 's live the whole of each day 's income find himself helpless in a emergency of sickness whose expense he have no money to meet and the man who have no intellectual resource no self-reliant habit of occupation find himself shut up in the house idle and wretched for a rainy day i confess that on rainy morning in country house among well-dressed and so-called intelligent and christian people i have be seize with stronger disgust and despair about the capacity and worth of the average human creature than i have ever feel in the worst haunt of ignorant wickedness what be there to do to-day be the question they ask i know they be about to ask it before they speak i have see it in they listless and disconcerted eye at breakfast it be worse to I than the toll of a bell for saddest dead of all be they who have only a name to live the truth be there be more to do on a rainy day than on any other in addition to all the sweet needful possible business of living and work and learn and help which be for all day there be the beauty of the rainy day to see the music of the rainy day to hear it drum on the window-pane chuckle and gurgle at corner of house tinkle in spout make mysterious crescendo and arpeggio chord through the air and all the while drop from the eaves and upper window-ledge be beat time as rhythmical and measure as that of a metronome -- time to which we own soul furnish tune sweet or sorrowful inspiriting or saddening as we will it be a curious experiment to try repeat or chant line in time and cadence follow the patter of raindrop on window it will sometimes be startling in its effect : no metre no accent fail of its response in the low liquid stroke of the tender drop -- there seem a uncanny _ rapport _ between they at once and the beauty of the rain not even love can find word to tell it if it leave but one trace the exquisite shift sheen of pearl on the outer side of the window glass that alone one might watch for a day in all time it have be think worthy of king of they who be royally rich to have garment sow thick in dainty line and shape with fine seed pearl who ever see any such embroidery which could compare with the beauty of one pane of glass work on a single side with the shine white transparent globulet of rain they be million they crowd they blend they become a silver stream they glide slowly down leave tiniest silver thread behind they make of themselves a silver bank of miniature sea at the bottom of the pane and while they do this other million be set pearl-wise at the top to crowd blend glide down in they turn and overflow the miniature sea this be one pane a few inch square and room have many window of many pane and look past this spectacle out of we window how be it that we do not each rainy day weep with pleasure at sight of the glistening show every green thing from tiniest grass-blade lie lowest to highest wave tip of elm also set thick with the water-pearl all toss and catch and toss and catch in fairy game with the wind and with the rain itself always lose always gain change shape and place and number every moment till the twinkling and shift dazzle all eye then at the end come the sun like a magician for whom all have be make ready at sunset perhaps or at sunrise if the storm have last all night in one instant the silver ball begin to disappear by countless thousand at a time he toss they back whence they come but as they go he change they under we eye into prismatic globe hold very light of very light in they tiny circle shredding and sort it into blaze line of rainbow color all the little child shout with delight see these thing and call dull grown-up people to behold they reply yes the storm be over and this be all it mean to most of they this kingdom of heaven they can not enter not be as a little child it would be worth while to know if we only could just what we betters -- the bird and insect and beast -- do on rainy day but we can not find out much it would be a great thing to look inside of a ant-hill in a long rain all we know be that the door be shut tight and a few sentinel who look as if india-rubber coat would be welcome stand outside the stillness and look of intermission in the wood on a really rainy day be something worth get wet to observe it be like Sunday in london or fourth of July in a country town which have go bodily to a picnic in the next village the stray who be out seem like accidentally arrive people who have lose they way one can not fancy a caterpillar 's be otherwise than very uncomfortable in wet hair and what can there be for butterfly and dragon-fly to do in the close corner into which they creep with wing shut up as tight as a umbrella the beast fare better be clothe in hide those whom we oftenest see out in rain -lrb- cow and ox and horse -rrb- keep straight on with they perpetual munch as content wet as dry though occasionally we see they accept the partial shelter of a tree from a particularly hard shower hen be the forlornest of all create animal when it rain who can help laugh at sight of a flock of they huddle up under lee of a barn limp draggled spiritless shift from one leg to the other with they silly head hang inert to right or left look as if they would die for want of a yawn one see just such group of other two-legged creature in parlor under similar circumstance the truth be a hen 's life at best seem poorer than that of any other known animal except when she be set i can not help have a contempt for she this also have be recognize by that common instinct of people which go to the making of proverb for hen 's time be not worth much be a common say among farmer ' wife how she dawdle about all day with she eye not a inch from the ground forever scratch and feed in dirtiest place -- a sort of animated muck-rake with a mouth and a alimentary canal no wonder such a inane creature be wretched when it rain and she soulless business be interrupted she be i think likest of all to the human being man or woman who do not know what to do with themselves on rainy day friend of the prisoner in many of the paris prison be to be see a long dreary room through the middle of which be build two high wall of iron grate enclose a space of some three foot in width a stranger visit the prison for the first time would find it hard to divine for what purpose these wall of grate have be build but on the appoint day when the friend of the prisoner be allow to enter the prison they use be sadly evident it would not be safe to permit wife and husband and mother and son to clasp hand in unrestrained freedom a tiny file a skein of silk can open prison-door and set captive free love 's ingenuity will circumvent tyranny and fetter in spite of all possible precaution therefore the vigilant authority say you may see but not touch there shall be no possible opportunity for a instrument of escape to be give at more than arm 's length the wife the mother must be hold the prisoner be lead in and seat on a bench upon one side of these grating the friend be lead in and seat on a similar bench on the other side jailer be in attendance in both room no word can be speak which the jailer do not hear yearningly eye meet eye face be press against the hard wire loving word be exchange the poor prisoned soul ask eagerly for news from the outer world -- the world from which they be as much hide as if they be dead father hear how the little one have grow sometimes alas how the little one have die small gift of fruit or clothing be bring but must be give first into the hand of the jailer even flower can not be give from loving hand to hand for in the tiniest flower might be hide the secret poison which would give to the weary prisoner surest escape of all all day come and go the sad train of friend linger and turn back after there be no more to be say weep when they mean and try to smile more hungry for closer sight and voice and for touch with every moment that they gaze through the bar and go away at last with a new sense of loss and separation which time with its merciful healing will hardly soften before the visiting-day will come again and the same heart-rending experience of mingled torture and joy will again be bear but to the prisoner these glimpse of friend ' face be like manna from heaven they whole life physical and mental receive a new impetus from they they blood flow more quickly they eye light up they live from one day to the next on a memory and a hope no punishment can be invent so terrible as the deprivation of the sight of they friend on the visiting-day man who be obstinate and immovable before any sort or amount of physical torture be subdue by mere threat of this a friend who tell I of a visit he pay to the prison maza on one of the day say with tear in he eye it be almost more than i could bear to see these poor soul reach out toward each other from either side of the iron railing here a poor old woman totter and weak bring a little fruit in a basket for she son here a wife hold up a baby to look through the grating at its father and the father try in a agony of earnestness to be sure that the baby know he here a little girl look half reproachfully at she brother terror struggle with tenderness in she young face on the side of the friend love and yearning and pity beyond all word to describe on the side of the prisoner love and yearning just as great but with a misery of shame add which give to many face a look of attempt at dogged indifference on the surface constantly betray and contradict however by the flash of the eye and the red of the cheek the story so impressed I that i could not for day lose sight of the picture it raise the double wall of iron grate the cruel inexorable empty space between they -- empty yet crowd with word and look the line of anxious yearning face on either side but presently i say to myself it be after all not so unlike the life we all live who of we be not in prison who of we be not live out he time of punishment law hold we all in its merciless fulfilment of penalty for sin disease danger work separate we wall we bury we that we be not number with the number of a cell clothe in the uniform of a prison lock up at night and count in the morning be only a apparent difference and not so real a one we jailer do not know we but we know they there be no fixed day gleam for we in the future when we term of sentence will expire and we shall regain freedom it may be to-morrow but it may be threescore year away meantime we bear ourselves as if we be not in prison we profess that we choose we keep we fetter out of sight we smile we sing we contrive to be glad of be alive and we take great interest in the change of we jail but no man know where he neighbor 's prison lie how bravely and cheerily most eye look up this be one of the sweetest mercy of life that the heart knoweth its own bitterness and know it can hide it hence we can all be friend for other prisoner stand separate from they by the impassable iron grating and the fix gulf of space which be not inappropriate emblem of the unseen barrier between all human soul we can show kindly face speak kindly word bear to they fruit and food and moral help greater than fruit or food we need not aim at philanthropy we need not have a visiting-day nor seek a prison-house build of stone on every road each man we meet be a prisoner he be die at heart however sound he look he be only wait however well he work if we stop to ask whether he be we brother he be go we one smile would have light up he prison-day alas for we if we smile not as we pass by alas for we if face to face at last with we elder brother we find ourselves say lord when saw we thee sick and in prison a companion for the winter i have engage a companion for the winter it would be simply a superfluous egotism to say this to the public except that i have a philanthropic motive for do so there be many lonely people who be in need of a companion possess just such quality as he and he have brother singularly like himself whose service can be secure i despair of do justice to he by any description in fact thus far i discover new perfection in he daily and believe that i be yet only on the threshold of we friendship in conversation he be more suggestive than any person i have ever know after two or three hour alone with he i be sometimes almost startle to look back and see through what a marvellous train of fancy and reflection he have lead I yet he be never wordy and often convey he subtlest meaning by a look he be a artist too of the rarest sort you watch the process under which he picture grow with incredulous wonder the eastern magic which drop the seed in the mould and bid it shoot up before you eye blossom and bear its fruit in a hour be tardy and clumsy by side of the creative genius of my companion he touch be swift as air he coloring be vivid as light he have learn i know not how the secret of hidden place in all land and he paint now a tufted clump of soft cocoa palm now the spire and wall of a iceberg glittering in yellow sunlight now a desolate sandy waste where black rock and a few crumble ruin be light up by a lurid glow then a cathedral front with carving like lace then the skeleton of a wreck ship with bare rib and broken mast -- and all so exact so minute so life-like that you believe no man could paint thus any thing which he have not see he have a special love for mosaic and a marvellous faculty for make drawing of curious old pattern nothing be too complicate for he memory and he revel in the most fantastic and intricate shape i have know he in a single evening throw off a score of design all beautiful and many of they rare : fiery scorpion on a black ground pale lavender filagree over scarlet white and black square block out as for tile of a pavement and crimson and yellow thread interlace over they odd chinese pattern in brilliant color all angle and surprise with no likeness to any thing in nature and exquisite little bit of landscape in soft gray and whites last night be one of he night of reminiscence of the mosaic-worker a furious snow-storm be rage and as the flaky crystal pile up in drift on the window-ledge he seem to catch the inspiration of they law of structure and draw sheet after sheet of crystalline shape some so delicate and filmy that it seem as if a jar might obliterate they some massive and strong like those in which the earth keep she mineral treasure then at last on a round charcoal disk he trace out a perfect rose in a fragrant white powder which pile up under he finger petal after petal circle after circle till the feathery stamen be bury out of sight then as we hold we breath for fear of disturb it with a good-natured little chuckle he shake it off into the fire and by a few quick stroke of red turn the black charcoal disk into a shield gay enough for a tournament he have talent for modelling but this he exercise more rarely usually he figure be grotesque rather than beautiful and he never allow they to remain longer than for a few moment often change they so rapidly under you eye that it seem like jugglery he be fondest of do this at twilight and love the darkest corner of the room from the half-light he will suddenly thrust out before you a grin gargoyle head to which he will give in a instant more a pair of spider leg and then with one roll stretch it out into a crocodile whose jaw seem so near snap that you involuntarily draw you chair further back next in a freak of ventriloquism he startle you still more by bring from the crocodile 's mouth a sigh so long draw so human that you really shudder and be ready to implore he to play no more trick he know when he have reach this limit and soothe you at once by a tender far-off whisper like the wind through pine sometimes almost like a aeolian harp then he rouse you from you dream by what you be sure be a tap at the door you turn speak listen no one enter the tap again ah it be only a little more of the ventriloquism of this wonderful creature you be alone with he and there be no tap at the door but when there be and the friend come in then my companion 's genius shine out almost always in life the third person be a discord or at least a burden but he be so genial so diffusive so sympathetic that like some tint by which painter know how to bring out all the other color in a picture he force every one to do he best i be indebted to he already for a better knowledge of some man and woman with whom i have talk for year before to little purpose it be most wonderful that he produce this effect because he himself be so silent but there be some secret charm in he very smile which put people _ en rapport _ with each other and with he at once i be almost afraid to go on with the list of the thing my companion can do i have not yet tell the half nor the most wonderful and i believe i have already overtax credulity i will mention only one more -- but that be to I far more inexplicable than all the rest i be sure that it belong with mesmerism and clairvoyance to the domain of the higher psychological mystery he have in rare hour the power of produce the portrait of person whom you have love but whom he have never see for this it be necessary that you should concentrate you whole attention on he as be always needful to secure the best result of mesmeric power it must also be late and still in the day or in a storm i have never know he to succeed in this for these portrait he use only shadowy gray tint he begin with a hesitate outline if you be not tenderly and closely in attention he throw it aside he can do nothing but if you be with he heart and soul and do not take you eye from he he will presently fill out the dear face full life-like and wear a smile which make you sure that they too must have be summon from the other side as you from this to meet on the shadowy boundary between flesh and spirit he must see they as clearly as he see you and it would be little more for he magic to do if he be at the same moment show to they longing eye you face and answer smile but i delay too long the tell of he name a strange hesitancy seize I i shall never be believe by any one who have not sit as i have by he side but if i can only give to one soul the good-cheer and strength of such a presence i shall be reward he name be maple wood-fire and he term be from eight to twelve dollar a month accord to the amount of time he give this price be ridiculously low but it be all that any member of the family ask in fact in some part of the country they can be hire for much less they have connection by the name of hickory whose term be higher but i can not find out that they be any more satisfactory there be also some distant relation name chestnut and pine who can be employ in the same way at a much lower rate but they be all snappish and uncertain in temper to the whole world i commend the good brotherhood of maple and pass on the emphatic indorsement of a bless old black woman who come to my room the other day and standing before the rollick blaze on my hearth say bless yer honey yer 's get a wood-fire i ` se aller say that if yer 's get a wood-fire yer 's get meat a ' drink a ' clo'e choice of color the other day as i be walk on one of the oldest and most picturesque street of the old and picturesque town of newport rus i see a little girl standing before the window of a milliner 's shop it be a very rainy day the pavement of the side-walk on this street be so sunken and irregular that in wet weather unless one walk with very great care he step continually into small well of water up to she ankle in one of these well stand the little girl apparently as unconscious as if she be high and dry before a fire it be a very cold day too i be hurry along wrap in fur and not quite warm enough even so the child be but thinly clothe she wear a old plaid shawl and a ragged knit hood of scarlet worst one little red ear stand out unprotected by the hood and drop of water trickle down over it from she hair she seem to be point with she finger at article in the window and talk to some one inside i watch she for several moment and then cross the street to see what it all mean i steal noiselessly up behind she and she do not hear I the window be full of artificial flower of the cheapest sort but of very gay color here and there a knot of ribbon or a bit of lace have be tastefully add and the whole effect be really remarkably gay and pretty tap tap tap go the small hand against the window-pane and with every tap the unconscious little creature murmur in a half-whispering half-singing voice i choose _ that _ color i choose _ that _ color i choose _ that _ color i stand motionless i could not see she face but there be in she whole attitude and tone the heartiest content and delight i move a little to the right hope to see she face without she see I but the slight movement catch she ear and in a second she have spring aside and turn toward I the spell be break she be no longer the queen of a air-castle deck herself in all the rainbow hue which please she eye she be a poor beggar child out in the rain and a little frightened at the approach of a stranger she do not move away however but stand eye I irresolutely with that pathetic mixture of interrogation and defiance in she face which be so often see in the prematurely develop face of poverty-stricken child be not the color pretty i say she brighten instantly yes be i would like a goon av thit blue but you will take cold standing in the wet say i will not you come under my umbrella she look down at she wet dress suddenly as if it have not occur to she before that it be rain then she draw first one little foot and then the other out of the muddy puddle in which she have be stand and move a little closer to the window say i be not jist goin ' home mem i would like to stop here a bit so i leave she but after i have go a few block the impulse seize I to return by a cross street and see if she be still there tear spring to my eye as i first catch sight of the upright little figure standing in the same spot still point with the rhythmic finger to the blues and red and yellow and half chant under she breath as before i choose _ that _ color i choose _ that _ color i choose _ that _ color i go quietly on my way without disturb she again but i say in my heart little messenger interpreter teacher i will remember you all my life why should day ever be dark life ever be colorless there be always sun there be always blue and scarlet and yellow and purple we can not reach they perhaps but we can see they if it be only through a glass and darkly -- still we can see they we can choose we color it rain perhaps and we be stand in the cold never mind if we look earnestly enough at the brightness which be on the other side of the glass we shall forget the wet and not feel the cold and now and then a passer-by who have roll himself up in fur to keep out the cold but shiver nevertheless -- who have money in he purse to buy many color if he like but nevertheless go grumble because some color be too dear for he -- such a passer-by chance to hear we voice and see the atmosphere of we content may learn a wondrous secret -- that pennilessness be not poverty and ownership be not possession that to be without be not always to lack and to reach be not to attain that sunlight be for all eye that look up and color for those who choose the apostle of beauty he be not of the twelve any more than the golden rule be of the ten a greater commandment i give unto you be say of that also it be call the new commandment yet it be really older than the rest and greater only because it include they all there be those who keep it age before mose go up sinaus : joseph for instance he ancestor and the king 's daughter by whose goodness he live so stand the apostle of beauty greater than the twelve newer and older setting gospel over against law have know law before its beginning live triumphantly free and unconscious of penalty he have have martyrdom and will have he church be never establish the world do not follow he only of wisdom be he know and of she child who be child of light he never speak by they mouth who say shalt not he know that shalt not be illegitimate puny try always to usurp the throne of the true king thou shalt this be delight this be good to see he say of a purity of a fair thing it need not to speak of the impurity of the ugliness leave unmentioned unforbidden who know how soon they might die out of man 's life perhaps even from the earth 's surface man hedge garden have for century set plant under that letter of law which killeth until the very word hedge have become a pain and a offence and all the while there have be stand in every wild country graceful wall of unhindered brier and berry to which the apostle of beauty have be silently point by degree gardener have learn something the best of they now call themselves landscape gardener and that be a concession if it mean as i suppose it do that they will try to copy nature 's landscape in they enclosure i have see also of late that on rich man 's estate tangle growth of native bush be be more let alone and hedge seem to have have some of the weight and harness take off of they this be but one little matter among million with which the apostle of beauty have to do but it serve for instance of the first requisite he demand which be freedom let use take care of itself it will he say there be no beauty without freedom nothing be too high for he nothing too low or small to speak more truly in he eye there be no small no low from a philanthropy down to a gown one catholic necessity one catholic principle gown can be benefaction or injury philanthropy can be well or ill clothe he have a ministry of co-worker -- man woman and guileless little child many of they serve he without know he by name some who serve he best who spread he creed most widely who teach they most eloquently die without dream that they have be missionary to gentile other there be who call he lord lord build temple to he and teach in they who never know he these be they who give they goods to the poor they body to be burn but be each day ungracious unloving hard cruel to man and woman about they these be they also who make bad statue bad picture invent frightful fashion of thing to be worn and make the house and the room in which they live hideous with unsightly adornment the century fight such -- now with a titian a michel angelo now with a great philanthropist who be also peaceable and easy to be entreat now with a florence nightingale know no sect now with a little child by a roadside hold up a marigold in the sun now with a sweet-faced old woman die gracefully in some almshouse who have not hear voice from such apostle to-day my nearest most eloquent apostle of beauty be a poor shoemaker who live in the house where i lodge how poor he must be i dare not even try to understand he have six child : the oldest not more than thirteen the third a deaf-mute the baby puny and ill -- sure i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- to die soon they live in two room on the ground-floor he shop be the right-hand corner of the front room the rest be bedroom and sitting-room behind be the bedroom and kitchen i have never see so much as i might of they way of live for i stand before he window with more reverent fear of intrude by a look than i should have at the door of a king 's chamber a narrow rough ledge add to the window-sill be he bench behind this he sit from six in the morning till seven at night bent over sew slowly and painfully on the coarsest shoe he face look old enough for sixty year but he can not be so old yet he wear glass and walk feebly he have probably never have in any one day of he life enough to eat but i do not know any man and i know only one woman who have such a look of radiant good-cheer and content as have this poor shoemaker anton grasl in he window be coarse wooden box in which be grow the common mallow they be just now in full bloom -- row upon row of gay-striped purple and white bell the window look to the east and be never shut when i go out to my breakfast the sun be streaming in on the flower and anton 's face he look up smile bow low and say good-day good my lady sometimes hold the mallow-stalk back with one hand to see I more plainly i feel as if the day and i have have benediction it be always a better day because anton have say it be good and i be a better woman for sight of he godly contentment almost every day he have beside the mallow in the box a white mug with flower in it -- nasturtium perhaps or a few pink this he set carefully in shade of the thickest mallow and this i have often see he hold down tenderly for the little one to see and to smell when i come home in the evening between eight and nine o'clock anton be always sift in front of the door rest he head against the wall this be he recreation he one bless hour of out-door air and rest he stand with he cap in he hand while i pass and he face shine as if all the concentrated enjoyment of my walk in the wood have descend upon he in my first look if i give he a bunch of fern to add to he nasturtium and pink he be so grateful and delighted that i have to go into the house quickly for fear i shall cry whenever i be come back from a drive i begin to think long before i reach the house how glad anton will look when he see the carriage stop i be as sure as if i have omniscient sight into the depths of he good heart that he have distinct and unenvious joy in every pleasure that he see other people take never have i hear one angry or hasty word one petulant or weary cry from the room in which this father and mother and six child be struggle to live all day long the barefooted and ragged little one play under my south window and do not quarrel i amuse myself by drop grape or plum on they head and then watch they at they feast never have i see they dispute or struggle in the division once i purposely throw a large bunch of grape to the poor little mute and only a few plum to the other i be sorry to say that voiceless carl eat all he grape himself but not a selfish or discontented look could i see on the face of the other -- they all smile and beam up at I like sun it be anton who create and sustain this rare atmosphere the wife be only a common and stupid woman he be educate she as he be the child she be very thin and worn and hungry-looking but always smile be anton 's wife she could not do otherwise sometimes i see people pass the house who give a careless glance of contemptuous pity at anton 's window of mallow and nasturtium then i remember that a apostle write : -- there be it may be so many kind of voice in the world and none of they be without signification therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto he that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto I and i long to call after they as they go grope they way down the beautiful street -- oh ye barbarians blind and deaf how dare you think you can pity anton he soul would melt in compassion for you if he be able to comprehend that life could be so poor as yours he be the rich man and you be poor eat only the husk on which you feed he would starve to death english lodging-house somebody who have write story -lrb- be it dickens -rrb- have give we very wrong idea of the english lodging-house what good american do not go into london with the distinct impression that whatever else he do or do not do he will upon no account live in lodgings that he will even be content with the comfortless coffee-room of a second-rate hotel and fraternize with commercial traveller from all quarter of the globe rather than come into relation with that mixture of vulgarity and dishonesty the lodging-house keeper it be with more than such misgiving that i first cross the threshold of mr -- 's house in bedford place bloomsbury at this distance i smile to remember how welcome would have be any alternative rather than the remain under she roof for a month how persistently for several day i doubt and resist the evidence of all my sens and set myself at work to find the discomfort and shortcoming which i believe must belong to that mode of life to confess the stupidity and obstinacy of my ignorance be small reparation and would be little worth while except for the hope that my account of the comfort and economy in live on the english lodging-house system may be a seed drop in due season which shall spring up sooner or later in the introduction of a similar system in america the gain which it would be to great number of we man and woman who must live on small income can not be estimate it seem hardly too much to say that in the course of one generation it might work in the average public health a change which would be show in statistics and rid we of the stigma of a national disease of dyspepsia for the man and woman whose suffering and ill-health have make of we name a by-word among the nation be not as many suppose the rich man and woman tempt by they riches to over-indulgence of they stomach and pay in they dyspepsia simply the fair price of they folly they be the moderately poor man and woman who be pay cruel penalty for not have be richer -- not have be rich enough to avoid the poison which be cook and serve in american restaurant and in the poorer class of american home mr -- 's lodging-house be not so far as i know any better than the average lodging-house of its grade it be well situated well furnished well keep and its scale of price be moderate for instance the rent of a pleasant parlor and bedroom on the second floor be thirty-four shilling a week include fire and gas -- $ 850 gold then there be a charge of two shilling a week for the use of the kitchen-fire and three shilling a week for service and these be the only charge in addition to the rent thus for $ 975 a week one have all the comfort that can be have in housekeeping so far as room and service be concern there be four good servant -- cook scullery maid and two housemaid oh the pleasant voice and gentle fashion of behavior of those housemaid they be slow it must be own but they result be admirable in spite of london smoke and grime mr -- 's floor and window be clean the grate shone every morning like mirror and the glass and silver be bright each morning the smile cook come up to take we order for the meal of the day each day the grocer and the baker and the butcher stop at the door and leave the sugar for the first floor front the beef for the drawing-room and so on the smallest article which could be require in housekeeping be not overlook the grocery of the different floor never get mixed though how this separateness of store be accomplish will for ever remain a mystery to I but that it be successfully accomplish the smallness of we bill be the best of proof -- unless indeed as we be sometimes almost afraid we do now and then eat up dr a -- 's cheese or drink the milk belong to the b 's below we we be a party of four we fare be of the plain substantial sort but of sufficient variety and abundance and yet we living never cost we include rent service fire and food over $ 60 a week if we have choose to practice closer economy we might have live on less compare for one instant the comfort of such a arrangement as this which really give we every possible advantage to be secure by housekeeping and with almost none of the trouble with any board or lodge possible in new york we have two parlor and two bedroom we meal serve promptly and neatly in we own parlor the same amount of room and service and such a table for four people can not be have in new york for less than $ 150 or $ 200 a week in fact they can not be have in new york for any sum of money the quiet respectfulness of behavior and faithful interest in work of english servant on english soil be not to be find elsewhere we afterward live for some week in another lodging-house in great malvern worcestershire at about the same price per week this house be even better than the london one in some respects the system be precisely the same but the cooking be almost faultless and the table appointment be more than satisfactory -- they be tasteful the china be a pleasure and there be silver and linen and glass which one would be glad to have in one 's own home it may be ask and not unnaturally how do this lodging-house system work for those who keep the house can it be possible that all this comfort and economy for lodger be compatible with profit for landlord i can judge only from the result in these two case which come under my own observation in each of these case the family who keep the house live comfortably and pleasantly in they own apartment which be in the london house almost as good a suite of room as any which they rent they certainly have far more apparent quiet comfort and privacy than be commonly see in the arrangement of the keeper of average boarding-house in the malvern house one whole floor which be less pleasant than the other but still comfortable and well furnished be occupy by the family there be three little boy under ten year of age who have they nursery governess say lesson to she regularly and be lead out decorously to walk by she at appointed season like all the rest of good little english boy in well-regulated family and yet the mother of these child come to the door of we parlor each morning with the respectful air of a old family housekeeper to ask what we would have for dinner and be careful and exact in buy three penn ` orth of herb at a time for we to season we soup i ought to mention that in both these place we make the greater part of we purchase ourselves have weekly bill send in from the shop and in we name exactly as if we be live in we own house all honest lodging-house keeper we be tell prefer this method as leave no opening for any unjust suspicion of they fairness in provide but if one choose to be as absolutely free from trouble as in board the marketing can all be do by the family and the bill still make out in the lodger ' name i have be thus minute in my detail because i think there may be many to whom this system of living be as unknown as it be to I and i can not but hope that it may yet be introduce in america wet the clay once i stand in miss hosmer 's studio look at a statue which she be modelling of the ex-queen of naple face to face with the clay model i always feel the artist 's creative power far more than when i be look at the immovable marble a touch here -- there -- and all be change perhaps under my eye in the twinkling of a eye one trait spring into life and another disappear the queen who be a very beautiful woman be represent in miss hosmer 's statue as stand wear the picturesque cloak that she wear during those hard day of garrison life at gaeta when she show herself so brave and strong that the world say if she instead of that very stupid young man she husband have be king the throne need not have be lose the very cloak make of light cloth showily face with scarlet be drape over a lay figure in one corner of the room in the statue the fold of drapery over the right arm be entirely disarrange simply rough clay the day before they have be apparently finish but that morning miss hosmer have as she laughingly tell we pull it all to piece again as she say this she take up a large syringe and shower the statue from head to foot with water till it drip and shine as if it have be just plunge into a bath now it be in condition to be mould many time a day this process must be repeat or the clay become so dry and hard that it can not be work i have know this before but never do i so realize the significant symbolism of the act as when i look at this lifeless yet lifelike thing to be make into the beauty of a woman call by she name and cherish after she death -- and see that only through this chrysali of the clay so care for moisten and mould could the marble obtain its soul and as all thing i see in life seem to I to have a voice either for or of child so do this instantly suggest to I that most of the failure of mother come from they not keep the clay wet the slightest touch tell on the clay when it be soft and moist and can produce just the effect which be desire but when the clay be too dry it will not yield and often it break and crumble beneath the unskilful hand how perfect the analogy between these two result and the two atmosphere which one often see in the space of one half-hour in the management of the same child one person can win from it instantly a gentle obedience : that person 's smile be a reward that person 's displeasure be a grief it can not bear that person 's opinion have utmost weight with it that person 's presence be a control and subdue influence another alas the mother produce such a opposite effect that it be hard to believe the child can be the same child she simplest command be meet by antagonism or sullen compliance she pleasure and displeasure be plainly of no account to the child and its great desire be to get out of she presence what shape will she make of that child 's soul she do not wet the clay she do not stop to consider before each command whether it be wholly just whether it be the best time to make it and whether she can explain its necessity oh the sweet reasonableness of child when disagreeable necessity be explain to they instead of be enforce as arbitrary tyranny she do not make they so feel that she share all they sorrow and pleasure that they can not help be in turn glad when she be glad and sorry when she be sorry she do not so take they into constant companionship in she interest each day -- the book the papers she read the thing she see -- that they learn to hold she as the representative of much more than nursery discipline clothes and bread and butter she do not kiss they often enough put she arm around they warm soften bathe they in the ineffable sunshine of loving way i can not imagine why child be so much better with you than with I exclaim such a mother no she can not imagine and that be the trouble if she could all would be right it be quite probable that she be a far more anxious self-sacrificing hard-working mother than the neighbor whose child be rosy and frolicking and affectionate and obedient while hers be pale and fretful and selfish and sullen she be all the time work work with endless activity on hard dry clay and the neighbor who perhaps half-unconsciously keep the clay wet be with one-half the labor modelling sweet creature of nature 's own loveliest shape then she say this poor tired mother discourage because she child tell lie and irritated because they seem to she thankless after all child be pretty much alike i suppose i believe most child tell lie when they be little and they never realize until they be grow up what parent do for they here again i find a similitude among the artist who paint or model studio be full of such caricature and the hard-working honest soul who have make they believe that they be true reproduction of nature and life see my cherub be not all cherub such as he and behold these tree and this water and how the sun glow on the day when i walk there and all the while the cherub be like a paper doll and the tree and the water never have any likeness to any thing that be in this beautiful earth but after all this similitude be short and paltry for it be of comparatively small moment that so many man and woman spend they life in make bad cherub in marble and hideous landscape in oil it be industry and it keep they in bread in butter too if they cherub and tree be very bad but when it be a human be that be to be mould how do we dare even with all the help which we can ask and find in earth and in heaven to shape it by we touch clay in the hand of the potter be not more plastic than be the little child 's soul in the hand of those who tend it alas how many shapeless how many ill-formed how many break do we see who do not believe that the image of god could have be beautiful on all sooner or later it will be thank christ but what a pity what a loss not to have have the sweet blessedness of be even here fellow-worker with he in this glorious modelling for eternity the king 's friend we be a gay party summering among the hill new-comer into the little boarding-house where we by reason of prior possession hold a kind of sway be apt to fare hardly at we hand unless they come up to we standard we be not exact in the matter of clothes we be liberal on creed but we have we shibboleth and though we do not drown unlucky ephraimite whose tongue make bad work with s 's i fear we be not quite kind to they they never stay long and so we go on have it much we own way week before last a man appear at dinner of whom we good little landlady say deprecatingly that he would stay only a few day she know by instinct that he presence would not be agreeable to we he be not in the least a intrusive person -- on the contrary there be a sort of mute appeal to we humanity in the very extent of he quiet inoffensiveness but he whole atmosphere be utterly uninteresting he be untrained in manner awkwardly ill at ease in the table routine and altogether it be so uncomfortable to make any attempt to include he in we circle that in a few day he be ignore by every one to a degree which be neither courteous nor christian in all family there be a leader ours be a charming and brilliant married woman whose ready wit and never-failing spirit make she the best of centre for a country party of pleasure-seeker she keen sense of humor have not be able entirely to spare this unfortunate man whose attitude and movement be certainly at time almost irresistible but one morning such a change be apparent in she manner toward he that we all look up in surprise no more gracious and gentle greet could she have give he if he have be a prince of royal line we astonishment almost pass bound when we hear she continue with a kindly inquiry after he health and undeterred by he evident readiness to launch into detailed symptom listen to he with the most respectful attention under the influence of this new and sweet recognition he plain and common face kindle into something almost manly and individual he have never before be so speak to by a well-bred and beautiful woman we be sober in spite of ourselves by a indefinable something in she manner and it be with subdue whisper that we crowd around she on the piazza and beg to know what it all mean it be a rare thing to see mr -- hesitate for a reply the color rise in she face and with a half-nervous attempt at a smile she finally say well girl i suppose you will all laugh at I but the truth be i hear that man say he prayer this morning you know he room be next to mine and there be a great crack in the door i hear he pray this morning for ten minute just before breakfast and i never hear such tone in my life i do not pretend to be religious but i must own it be a wonderful thing to hear a man talk with god as he do and when i see he at table i feel as if i be look in the face of some one who have just come out of the presence of the king of king and have the very air of heaven about he i can not help what the rest of you do or say _ i _ shall always have the same feeling whenever i see he there be a magnetic earnestness in she tone and look which we all feel and which some of we will never forget during the few remain day of he stay with we that untutored uninteresting stupid man know no lack of friendly courtesy at we hand we be the better for he homely presence unaware he minister unto we when we know that he come directly from speak to the master to speak to we we feel that he be greater than we and we remember that it be write if any man serve I he will my father honor learn to speak with what breathless interest we listen for the baby 's first word what a new bond be at once and for ever establish between its soul and ours by this mysterious inexplicable almost incredible fact that be the use of the word that be its only use so far as mere gratification of the ear go many other sound be more pleasurable -- the baby 's laugh for instance or its inarticulate murmur of content or sleepiness but the word be a revelation a sacred sign now we shall know what we beloved one want now we shall know when and why the dear heart sorrow or be glad how reassure we feel how confident now we can not make mistake we shall do all for the best we can give happiness we can communicate wisdom relation be establish the perplexing gulf of silence be bridge the baby speak but it be not of the baby 's learn to speak that we propose to write here all baby learn to speak or if they do not we know that it mean a terrible visitation -- a calamity rare thank god but bitter almost beyond parent ' strength to bear but why have once learn to speak do the baby leave off speak when it become a man or a woman many of we man and woman to-day need almost as much as when they be twenty-four month old to learn to speak we do not mean learn to speak in public we do not mean even learn to speak well -- to pronounce word clearly and accurately though there be need enough of that in this land but that be not the need at which we be aim now we mean something so much simpler so much further back that we hardly know how to say it in word which shall be simple enough and also sufficiently strong we mean learn to speak at all in spite of all which satirical writer have say and say of the loquacious egotism the question curiosity of we people it be true to-day that the average american be a reticent taciturn speechless creature who for he own sake and still more for the sake of all who love he need more than he need any thing else under heaven to learn to speak look at we silent railway and horse-cars steamboat-cabin hotel-table in short all we public place where people be throw together incidentally and where good-will and the habit of speak combine would create a atmosphere of human vitality quite unlike what we see now but it be not of so much consequence after all whether people speak in these public place or not if they do one very unpleasant phase of we national life would be greatly change for the better but it be in we home that this speechlessness tell most fearfully -- on the breakfast and dinner and tea-table at which a silent father and mother sit down in haste and gloom to feed they depressed child this be especially true of man and woman in the rural district they be tire they have more work to do in a year than it be easy to do they life be monotonous -- too much so for the best health of either mind or body if they dream how much this monotony could be break and cheer by the constant habit of talk with each other they would grasp at the slightest chance of a conversation sometimes it almost seem as if complaint and antagonism be better than such stagnant quiet but there need not be complaint and antagonism there be no home so poor so remote from affair that each day do not bring and set ready for family welcome and discussion beautiful sight and sound occasion for helpfulness and gratitude question for decision hope fear regret the element of human life be the same for ever any one heart hold in itself the whole can give all thing to another can bear all thing for another but no give no bearing no not even if it be the give up of a life if it be do without free full loving interchange of speech be half the blessing it might be many a wife go down to she grave a dull and dispirited woman simply because she good and faithful husband have live by she side without talk to she there have be day when one word of praise or one word even of simple good cheer would have gird she up with new strength she do not know very likely what she need or that she need any thing but she droop many a child grow up a hard unimpressionable unloving man or woman simply from the uncheered silence in which the first ten year of life be pass very few father and mother even those who be fluent perhaps in society habitually _ talk _ with they child it be certain that this be one of the worst shortcoming of we home perhaps no other single change would do so much to make they happier and therefore to make we community better as for man and woman to learn to speak private tyrant we recognize tyranny when it wear a crown and sit on a hereditary throne we sympathize with nation that overthrow the throne and in we secret heart we almost canonize individual who slay the tyrant from the day of ehud and eglon down to those of charlotte corday and marat the world have deal tenderly with they name whose hand have be red with the blood of oppressor on moral grounds it would be hard to justify this sentiment murder be murder all the same however great gain it may be to this world to have the murder man put out of it but that there be such a sentiment instinctive and strong in the human soul there be no deny it be so instinctive and so strong that if we watch ourselves closely we shall find it give alarming shape sometimes to we secret thought about we neighbor how many community how many household even be without a tyrant if we could move for return of suffer as that tender and thoughtful man arthur help say we should find a far heavier aggregate of misery inflict by unsuspected unresisted tyranny than by those which be patent to everybody and sure to be overthrow sooner or later a exhaustive sermon on this subject should be set off in three division as follow : -- private tyrant _ 1st _ number of -- _ 2d _ nature of -- _ 3d _ longevity of -- _ first _ they number they be not enumerate in any census not even the most painstaking statistician have meddle with the topic fancy take bold leap at the very suggestion of such a estimate and begin to think at once of all thing in the universe which be usually mention as beyond numbering probably one good way of get at a certain sort of result would be to ask each person of one 's acquaintance do you happen to know a private tyrant how well we know beforehand the reply we should get from _ some _ beloved man and woman -- that be if they speak the truth but they would not that be the saddest thing about these private tyranny they be in many case bear in such divine and uncomplaining silence by they victim perhaps for long year the world never dream that they exist but at last the fine subtle writing which no control no patience no will can thwart become set on the man 's or the woman 's face and tell the whole record who do not know such face cheerful usually even gay brave and ready with line of smile but in repose so marked so scar with unutterable weariness and disappointment that tear spring in the eye and love in the heart of all finely organize person who meet they _ secondly _ nature of private tyrant here also the statistician have not enter the field be vast the analysis difficult selfishness be of course they lead characteristic in fact the very sum and substance of they nature but selfishness be protean it have as many shape as there be minute and as many excuse and wrap of sheep 's clothing as ever ravening wolf possess one of its commonest plea be that of weakness here it often be so inextricably mix with genuine need and legitimate claim that one grow bewildered between sympathy and resentment in this shape however it get its cruelest dominion over strong and generous and tender people this kind of tyranny build up and fortify its bulwark on and out of the very virtue of its victim it gain strength hourly from the very strength of the strength to which it appeal each slow and fatal encroachment never seem at first so much a thing require as a thing offer but like the slow sinking inch by inch of that great beautiful city of stone into the relentless adriatic so be the slow sure go down and loss of the freedom of a strong beautiful soul helpless in the omnipresent circumference of the selfish nature to which it be or believe itself bind that the exaction never or rarely take shape in word be to the unbiassed looker-on only a exasperating feature in they tyranny while it save the conscience of the tyrant -- if such tyrant have any -- it make doubly sure the success of they tyranny and probably nothing short of revelation from heaven in shape of blinding light would ever open they eye to the fact that it be even more selfish to hold a generous spirit fettered hour by hour by a constant fear of give pain than to coerce or threaten or scold they into the desire behavior invalid all invalid stand in deadly peril of become tyrant of this order a chronic invalid who entirely escape it must be so nearly saint or angel that one instinctively feel as if they invalidism would soon end in the health of heaven we know of one invalid woman chained to she bed for long year by a incurable disease who have have the insight and strength to rise triumphant above this danger she constant wish and entreaty be that she husband should go freely into all the work and the pleasure of life whenever he leave she she farewell be not how soon do you think you shall come back at what hour or day may i look for you but now pray stay just as long as you enjoy it if you hurry home one hour sooner for the thought of I i shall be wretched it really seem almost as if the longer he stay away -- hour day week even -- the happier she be by this sweet and wise unselfishness she have succeed in realize the whole blessedness of wifehood far more than most woman who have health but we doubt if any century see more than one such woman as she be another large class next to that of invalid the most difficult to deal with be make up of people who be by nature or by habit uncomfortably sensitive or irritable who have not live at one time or other in he life in daily contact with people of this sort -- person whose outbreak of temper or of wounded feeling still worse than temper be as incalculable as meteoric shower the suppress atmosphere the chronic state of alarm and misgiving in which the victim of this species of tyranny live be wither and exhaust to the stoutest heart they be also harden perpetually have to wonder and watch how people will take thing be apt sooner or later to result in indifference as to whether they take they well or ill but to define all the shape of private tyranny would require whole history it be safe however to say that so far as any human be attempt to set up he own individual need or preference as law to determine the action of any other human being in small matter or great so far forth he be a tyrant the limit of he tyranny may be narrow by lack of power on he part or of response on the part of he fellow but its essence be as purely tyrannous as if he sit on a throne with a executioner within call _ thirdly _ longevity of private tyrant we have not room under this head to do more -- nor if we have all room could we do better -- than to quote a short paragraph from george eliot 's immortal mr poyser : it seem as if they as be not want here be th ' only folk as be not want i ' th ' other world margin wide-margined page please we at first sight we do not stop to ask why it have pass into a accept rule that all elegant book must have broad clear margin to they page we as much recognize such margin among the indication of promise in a book as we do fineness of paper clearness of type and beauty of bind all three of these last even in perfection could not make any book beautiful or sightly whose page have be leave narrow-margined and crowd this be no arbitrary decree of custom no chance preference of a accredit authority it would be dangerous to set limit to the power of fashion in any thing and yet it seem almost safe to say that not even fashion itself can ever make a narrow-margined page look other than shabby and mean this inalienable right of the broad margin to we esteem be significant it lie deep the broad margin mean something which be not measure by inch have nothing to do with fashion of shape it mean room for note query add by any man 's hand who read meaning this it mean also much more than this -- far more than the mere letter of right of way it be a fine courtesy of recognition that no one page shall ever say the whole of its own message be exhaustive or ultimate even of its own topic determine or enforce its own opinion to the shut out of other no matter if the book live and grow old without so much as a interrogation point or a line of enthusiastic admiration draw in it by human hand still the gracious import and suggestion of its broad white space be the same each think invite its neighbor stand fairly to right or left of its opponent and wooe its friend think on this we presently discover that margin mean a species of freedom no wonder the word and the thing it represent wherever we find they delight we we use the word constantly in sens which speak carelessly we should have call secondary and borrow now we see that its application to page or picture or decoration and so forth be the borrow and secondary use and that primarily its meaning be spiritual we must have margin or be uncomfortable in every thing in life we plan for a day for a week for we lifetime must have it -- margin for change of purpose margin for interruption margin for accident make no allowance for these we be fetter we be disturb we be thwart be there a greater misery than to be hurry if we leave ourselves proper margin we never need to be hurry we always shall be if we crowd we plan people pant groan and complain as if hurry be a thing outside of themselves -- a enemy a monster a disease which overtake they and against which they have no shelter it be hard to be patient with such nonsense hurry be almost the only known misery which it be impossible to have bring upon one by other people 's fault if we plan of action for a hour or a day be so fatally spoil by lack of margin what shall we say of the mistake of the man who leave himself no margin in matter of belief no room for a wholesome healthy doubt no provision for a add enlightenment no calculation for the inevitable progress of human knowledge this be in we eye the cry sin and danger of elaborate creed rigid formula of exact statement on difficult and hidden mystery the man who be ready to give pledge that the opinion he will hold to-morrow will be precisely the opinion he hold to-day have either thought very little or to little purpose or have resolve to quit think altogether the fine art of smile some theatrical experiment be be make at this time to show that all possible emotion and all shades and gradation of emotion can be express by facial action and that the method of so express they can be reduce to a system and teach in a give number of lesson it seem a matter of question whether one would be likely to make love or evince sorrow any more successfully by keep in mind all the while the detailed catalogue of he flexor and extensor and contracting and relax no 1 2 or 3 accord to rule the human memory be a treacherous thing and what a enormous disaster would result from a very slight forgetfulness in such a nicely adjusted system the fatal effect of drop the superior maxillary when one intend to drop the inferior or of apply nervous stimulus to the up track instead of the down can easily be conceive art be art after all be it ever so skilful and triumphant and science be only a slow reading of hieroglyph nature sit high and serene above both and smile compassionately on they effort to imitate and understand and this bring we to what we have to say about smile do many people feel what a wonderful thing it be that each human being be bear into the world with he own smile eye nose mouth may be merely average commonplace feature may look take singly very much like anybody 's else eye nose or mouth let whoever doubt this try the simple but endlessly amusing experiment of set half a dozen people behind a perforated curtain and make they put they eye at the hole not one eye in a hundred can be recognize even by most familiar and loving friend but study smile observe even in the most casual way the variety one see in a day and it will soon be feel what subtle revelation they make what infinite individuality they possess the purely natural smile however be seldom see in adult and it be on this point that we wish to dwell very early in life people find out that a smile be a weapon mighty to avail in all sort of crisis hence we see the treacherous smile of the wily the patronize smile of the pompous the obsequious smile of the flatterer the cynical smile of the satirist very few of these have hear of delsarte but they outdo he on he own grounds they smile be four-fifth of they social stock in trade all such smile be hideous the gloomiest blankest look which a human face can wear be welcomer than a trained smile or a smile which if it be not actually and consciously methodize by its perpetrator have become by long repetition so associate with trick and falsity that it partake of they quality what then be the fine art of smile if smile may not be use for weapon or mask of what use be they that be the shape one would think the question take in most man 's mind if we may judge by they behavior there be but two legitimate purpose of the smile but two honest smile on all little child 's face such smile be see woe to we that we so soon waste and lose they the first use of the smile be to express affectionate good-will the second to express mirth why do we not always smile whenever we meet the eye of a fellow-being that be the true intended recognition which ought to pass from soul to soul constantly little child in simple community do this involuntarily unconsciously the honest-hearted german peasant do it it be like magical sunlight all through that simple land the perpetual greet on the right hand and on the leave between stranger as they pass by each other never without a smile this then be the fine art of smile like all fine art true art perfection of art the simplest following of nature now and then one see a face which have keep its smile pure and undefile it be a woman 's face usually often a face which have trace of great sorrow all over it till the smile break such a smile transfigure such a smile if the artful but know it be the greatest weapon a face can have sickness and age can not turn its edge hostility and distrust can not withstand its spell little child know it and smile back even dumb animal come closer and look up for another if one be ask to sum up in one single rule what would most conduce to beauty in the human face one might say therefore never tamper with you smile never once use it for a purpose let it be on you face like the reflection of the sunlight on a lake affectionate good-will to all man must be the sunlight and you face be the lake but unlike the sunlight you good-will must be perpetual and you face must never be overcast what smile perpetually say the realist how silly yes smile perpetually go to delsarte here and learn even from the mechanician of smile that a smile can be indicate by a movement of muscle so slight that neither instrument nor term exist to measure or state it in fact that the subtlest smile be little more than a add brightness to the eye and a tremulousness of the mouth one second of time be more than long enough for it but eternity do not outlast it in that wonderfully wise and tender and poetic book the layman 's breviary leopold schefer say -- a smile suffice to smile death away and love defend thee e ` en from wrath divine then let what may befall thee -- still smile on and howe'er death may rob thee -- still smile on love never have to meet a bitter thing a paradise bloom around he who smile death-bed repentance not long since a congregationalist clergyman who have be for forty-one year in the ministry say in my hearing i have never in all my experience as a pastor know of a single instance in which a repentance on what be suppose to be a death-bed prove to be of any value whatever after the person recover this be strong language i involuntarily exclaim have you know many such case more than i dare to remember and as many more perhaps where the person die yes fully as many more then do not the bitter failure of these death-bed repentance to bear the test of time shake you confidence in they value under the test of eternity it do -- it do say the clergyman with tear in he eye the conversation make a deep impression on my mind it be strong evidence from a quarter in which i least look for it of the utter paltriness and insufficiency of fear as a motive when bring to bear upon decision in spiritual thing there seem to be no word strong enough to stigmatize it in all other affair except spiritual all age all race hold cowardice chief among vice noble barbarian punish it with death even civilization the most cautiously legislate for do the same thing when a soldier show it in face of the enemy language gather itself up and concentrate its force to describe base behavior can do no more than call it cowardly no instinct of all the bless body-guard of instinct bear with we seem in the outset a stronger one than the instinct that to be noble one must be brave almost in the cradle the baby taunt or be taunt by the accusation of be afraid and the sting of the taunt lie in the probability of its truth for in all man alas be bear a certain selfish weakness to which fear can address itself but how strange do it appear that they who wish to inculcate noblest action raise to most exalted spiritual condition should appeal to this lowest of motive to help they we believe that there be many death-bed repentance among hale hearty sinner who be approach by the same method stimulate by the same consideration frighten by the same conception of possible future suffering which so often make the chamber of die man dark with terror fear be fear all the same whether its dread be for the next hour or the next century the closer the enemy the swifter it run that be all the difference let the enemy be surely and plainly remove and in one instance it be no more -- be as if it have never be every thought word and action base upon it have come to end i be forcibly remind of the conversation above quote by some observation i once have opportunity of make at a methodist camp-meeting much of the preaching and exhortation consist simply and solely of urgent impassioned appeal to the people to repent -- not because repentance be right not because god be love and it be base not to love and obey he not even because godliness be in itself great gain and sinfulness be even temporarily loss and ruin but because there be a wrath to come which will inflict terrible and unending suffering on the sinner he be to flee for he life from torment indescribable and eternal he be to call on jesus not to make he holy but to save he from woe to rescue he from frightful danger all and every thing else be subordinate to the one selfish idea of escape future misery the effect of these appeal of these harrowing picture on some of the young man and woman and child be almost too painful to be bear they be in a hysterical condition -- weep from sheer nervous terror when the excitement have reach its highest pitch a elder rise and tell the story of a wicked and impenitent man whom he have visit a few week before the man have assent to all that he tell he of the necessity of repentance but say that he be not at leisure that day to attend the class meeting he resolve and promise however to do so the next week that very night he be take ill with a disease of the brain and after three day of unconsciousness die i would not like to quote here the emphasis of application which be make of this story to the terror of the weep young people under its influence several be lead almost carry by force into the anxious seat it be hard not to fancy the gentle christ look down upon the scene with a pain as great as that with which he yearn over jerusalem i long for some instant miracle to be work on the spot by which there should come float down from the peaceful blue sky through the sweet tree-top some of the loving and serene word of balm from he gospel theologian may theorize and good christian may differ -lrb- they always will -rrb- as to the existence extent and nature of future punishment but the fact remain indisputably clear that whether there be less or more of it whether it be of this sort or of that fear of it be a base motive to appeal to a false motive to act from and a worthless motive to trust in perfect love do not know it spiritual courage resent it the true kingdom of heaven be never take by its violence somewhere -lrb- i wish i know where and i wish i know from whose lip -rrb- i once find this immortal sentence : a woman go through the street of alexandrium bear a jar of water and a light torch and cry aloud ` with this torch i will burn up heaven and with this water i will put out hell that god may be love for himself alone ' the correlation of moral force science have deal and delve

remember no soul be entirely destitute of blessing absolutely without comfort perhaps we have but one very well we can think steadily of that one if we try but the probability be that we have more

with the richest or the plainest table it be not overcrowded by the addition of roast goose and plum-pudding it be not harm by the addition of herr and potato nay it can give flavor and richness to

lose in obscurity that although as we say it have never be print before it have be know in all age that the martyr feast upon it that generation of the poor call bless by christ have lay out banquet by it that exile and prisoner have live on it and the despise and forsake and reject in all country have taste it it be also true that when any great king eat well and thrive on he dinner it be by the

chance be that they will not be allow to come away it be impossible to break up a set and as for that matter half-past ten be two hour and a half past they bed-time they might as well stay a hour longer i wish nobody would ever ask my child to a party i can not keep they at home if they be ask of course i _ might _ but i have not the moral courage to see they so unhappy all the other child go and what can i do this be a tender loving mother whose sweet gentle natural method with she child have make they sweet gentle natural little girl whom it be a delight to know but what can she do the question be by no means one which can be readily answer it be very easy for off-hand severity sweeping condemnation to say do why nothing be plainer keep she child away from such place never let they go to any party which will last later than nine o'clock this be the same thing as say never let they go to party at all there be no party which break up at nine o'clock that be there be not in we city we hope there be such party still in country town and village -- such party as we remember to this day with a vividness which no social enjoyment since then have dim saturday-afternoon party -- _ matines _ they would have be call if the village people have know enough party which begin at three in the afternoon and end in the early dusk while little one could see they way home party at which

though the excited brain have have only five or six hour of sleep if they only would feel tired the next day that would be something of a argument to bring up with they say the poor mother but they always declare that they feel better than ever and so they do but the better be only a deceitful sham keep up by excited and overwrought nerve -- the same thing that we see over and over and over again in all life which be temporarily kindle and stimulate by excitement of any kind this be the worst thing this be the most fatal thing in all we mismanagement and perversion of the physical life of we child they beautiful elasticity and strength rebound instantly to a apparently uninjured fulness and so we go on undermine undermine at point after point until suddenly some day there come a

or in the first strain of they womanhood -- who shall say that they might not have pass safely through the danger have no vital force be unnecessarily waste in they childhood they infancy every hour that a child sleep be just so much investment of physical capital for year to come every hour after dark that a child be awake be just so much capital withdraw every hour that a child live a quiet tranquil joyous life of such sort as kitten live on hearth squirrel in sunshine be just so much investment in strength and steadiness and growth of the nervous system every hour that a child live a life of excited brain-working either in a school-room or in a ball-room be just so much take away from the reserved force which enable nerve to triumph through the sorrow through the labor through the disease of later life every mouthful of wholesome food that a child eat at seasonable hour may be say to tell on every moment of he whole life no matter how long it may be victor hugo the benevolent exile have find out that to be well feed once in seven day at one meal have be enough to transform the apparent health of all the poor child in guernsey who shall say that to take once in seven day or even once in thirty day a unwholesome supper of chicken salad and champagne may not leave as lasting effect on the constitution of a child if nature would only execute she sentence against evil work more speedily evil work would not so thrive the law of continuity be the hardest one for average man and woman to comprehend -- or at any rate to obey seed-time and harvest in garden and field they have learn to understand and profit by when we learn also that in the precious life of these little one we can not reap what we do not sow and we must reap all which we do sow and that the emptiness or the richness of the harvest be not so much for we as for they one of the first among the many thing which we shall reform will be child 's party after-supper talk after-dinner talk have be think of great importance the expression have pass into literature with many record of the good saying it include king and minister condescend to make effort at it poet and philosopher -- greater than king and minister -- do not disdain to attempt to shine in it but nobody have yet show what after-supper talk ought to be we be not speak now of the formal entertainment know as a supper we mean the every-day evening meal in the every-day home -- the meal know heartily and commonly as supper among people who be neither so fashionable nor so foolish as to take still a fourth meal at hour when they ought to be asleep in bed this ought to be the sweetest and most precious hour of the day it be too often neglect and lose in family it ought to be the mother 's hour the mother 's opportunity to undo any mischief the day may have do to forestall any mischief the morrow may threaten there be a instinctive disposition in most family to linger about the supper-table quite unlike the eager haste which be see at breakfast and at dinner work be over for the day everybody be tire even the little one who have do nothing but play the father be ready for slipper and a comfortable chair the child be ready and eager to recount the incident of the day this be the time when all should be cheer rest and also stimulate by just the right sort of conversation just the right sort of amusement the wife and mother must supply this need must create this atmosphere we do not mean that the father do not share the responsibility of this as of every other hour but this particular duty be one require quality which be more essentially feminine than masculine it want a light touch and a _ undertone _ to bring out the full harmony of the ideal home evening it must not be a bear it must not be empty it must not be too much like preach it must not be wholly like play more than all thing it must not be always -- no not if it could be help not even twice -- the same it must be that most indefinable most recognizable thing a good time bless the child for invent the phrase it have like all they phrase a unconscious touch of sacred inspiration in it in the selection of the good word good which lay peculiar benediction on all thing to which it be set if there be no other reason against child 's have lesson assign they to study at home we should consider this a sufficient one that it rob they of the after-supper hour with they parent even if they brain could bear without injury the sixth seventh or eighth hour as it may be of study they heart can not bear the be starve in the average family this be the one only hour of the day when father mother and child can be together free of care and unhurried even to the poorest laborer 's family come now something like peace and rest forerunning the intermission of the night everybody who have any artistic sense recognize this instinctively when they see through the open door of humble house the father and mother and child gather around they simple supper its mention have already pass into triteness in verse so inevitably have poet feel the sacred charm of the hour perhaps there be something deeper than on first thought would appear in the instant sense of pleasure one have in this sight also in the universal feeling that the evening gathering of the family be the most sacred one perhaps there be unconscious recognition that danger be near at hand when night fall and that in this hour lie or should lie the spell to drive they all away there be something almost terrible in the mingling of danger and protection of harm and help of good and bad in that one thing darkness god giveth he beloved sleep in it and in it the devil set he worst lure by help of it gain many a soul which he could never get possession of in sunlight mother father cultivate after-supper talk play after-supper game keep after-supper book take all the good newspaper and magazine you can afford and read they aloud after supper let boy and girl bring they friend home with they at twilight sure of a pleasant and hospitable welcome and of a good time after supper and parent may laugh to scorn all the temptation which town or village can set before they to draw they away from home for they evening these be but hasty hint bare suggestion but if they rouse one heart to a new realization of what evening at home _ ought _ to be and what evening at home too often be they have not be speak in vain nor out of season hysteria in literature physician tell we that there be no known disease no known symptom of disease which hysteria can not and do not counterfeit most skilful surgeon be mislead by its cunning into believe and pronounce able-bodied young woman to be victim of spinal disease stricture of the oesophagus gastrodynium paraplegia hemiplegium and hundred of other affection with longer or shorter name family be throw into disorder and distress friend suffer untold pain of anxiety and sympathy doctor be summon from far and near and all this while the vertebra or the membrane or the muscle as it may be which be so honestly believe to be diseased and which show every symptom of diseased action or inaction be sound and strong and as well able as ever it be to perform its function the common symptom of hysteria everybody be familiar with -- the cry and laugh in inappropriate place the fancied impossibility of breathing and so forth -- which make such trouble and mortification for the embarrassed companion of hysterical person and which moreover can be very easily suppress by a little wholesome severity accompany by judicious threat or sudden use of cold water but few people know or suspect the number of disease and condition suppose to be real serious often incurable which be simply and solely or in a great part undetected hysteria this very ignorance on the part of friend and relative make it almost impossible for surgeon and physician to treat such case properly the probability be in nine case out of ten that the indignant family will dismiss as ignorant or hard-hearted any practitioner who tell they the unvarnished truth and propose to treat the sufferer in accordance with it in the field of literature we find a hysteria as widespread as undetected as unmanageable as the hysteria which skulk and conquer in the field of disease its commoner outbreak everybody know by sight and sound and everybody except the miserably ignorant and silly despise yet there be to be find circle which thrill and weep in sympathetic unison with the ridiculous joy and sorrow grotesque sentiment and preposterous adventure of the hero and heroine of the dime novel and novelette and the flag and blade and gazette among the lowest newspaper but in well-regulated and intelligent household this sort of write be not tolerate any more than the correlative sort of physical phenomenon would be -- the gasp shriek sob giggle kind of behavior in a man or woman but there be another and more dangerous working of the same thing deep unsuspected clothing itself with symptom of the most defiant genuineness it lurk and do its business in every known field of composition man and woman be alike prone to it though its shape be somewhat affect by sex among man it break out often perhaps oftenest in violent illusion on the subject of love they assert declare shout sing scream that they love have love be love do and for ever will love after method and in manners which no decent love ever think of mention and yet so do they weak violence ape the bearing of strength so much do they cheat look like truth that score nay shoal of human being go about repeat and echo they noise and say gratefully yes this be love this be indeed what all true lover must know these be they who proclaim name of beloved on house-top who strip off veil from sacred secret and secret sacredness and set they up naked for the multitude to weigh and compare what punishment be for such beloved love himself only know it must be in store for they somewhere dimly one can suspect what it might be but it will be like all love 's true secret -- secret for ever these man of hysteria also take up specialty of art or science and in they behoof rant and exaggerate and fabricate and twist and lie in such stentorian voice that reasonable people be deafen and bewilder they also tell common tale in such enormous phrase with such gigantic structure of rhetorical flourish that the mere disproportion amount to false-hood and the diseased appetite in listener grow more and more diseased feed on such diseased food it be impossible to predict what it will not be necessary for story-monger to invent at the end of a century or so more of this but the worst manifestation of this disease be find in so-called religious write theology biography especially autobiography didactic essay tale with a moral -- under every one of these title it lift up its hateful head it take so successfully the guise of genuine religious emotion religious experience religious zeal that good people on all hand weep grateful tear as they read its morbid and unwholesome utterance of these be many of the long and short story set forth in melodramatic picture exceptionally good or exceptionally bad child or exceptionally pathetic and romantic career of sweet and refined magdalen minute and prolonged dissection of the process of spiritual growth equally minute and authoritative formula for spiritual exercise of all sort -- manual of drill so to speak or field tactic for soul of these sort of book the good and the bad be almost indistinguishable from each other except by the carefulest attention and the finest insight overwrought unnatural atmosphere and meaningless shallow routine so nearly counterfeit the sound and shape of warm true enthusiasm and wise precept where may be the remedy for this widespread and widely spread disease among writer we do not know it be not easy to keep up courageous faith that there be any remedy still nature abhor noise and haste and sham of all sort quiet and patience be the great secret of she force whether it be a mountain or a soul that she would fashion we must believe that sooner or later there will come a time in which silence shall have its due moderation be crown king of speech and melodramatic spectacular hysterical language be consider as disreputable as it be silly but the most discouraging feature of the disease be its extreme contagiousness all physician know what a disastrous effect one hysterical patient will produce upon a whole ward in a hospital we remember hear a young physician once give a most amusing account of a woman who be take to bellevue hospital for a hysterical cough she lung bronchia throat be all in perfect condition but she cough almost incessantly especially on the approach of the hour for the doctor 's visit to the ward in less than one week half the woman in the ward have similar cough a single -- though it must be confess rather terrific -- application of cold water to the original offender work a simultaneous cure upon she and all of she imitator not long ago a very parallel thing be to be observe in the field of story-writing a clever though morbid and melodramatic writer publish a novel whose heroine have once be a inmate of a house of ill-fame escape and find shelter and christian training in the home of a benevolent woman become a model of womanly delicacy and lead a life of exquisite and artistic refinement as to the animus and intent of this story there could be no doubt both be good but in atmosphere and execution it be essentially unreal overwrought and melodramatic for three or four month after its publication there be a perfect outburst and overflow in newspaper and magazine of the lower order of story all more or less bad some simply outrageous and all treat or rather pretend to treat the same problem which have furnished theme for that novel probably a close observation and collect of the dreary statistics would bring to light a curious proof of the extent and certainty of this sort of contagion reflect on it have it thrust in one 's face at every book-counter railway-stand sunday-school library and parlor centre-table it be hard not to wish for some supernatural authority to come sweep through the ward and prescribe sharp cold-water treatment all around to half drown all such writer and quite drown all they book jog trot there be etymological uncertainty about the phrase but there be no doubt about its meaning no doubt that it represent a good comfortable gait at which nobody go nowadays a hundred year ago it be the fashion : in the day when railroad be not nor telegraph when citizen journey in stage put up prayer in church if they journey be to be so long as from massachusett into connecticut when evil news travel slowly by letter and good news be carry about by man on horse when maiden spin and weave for long quiet silent year at they wedding _ trousseau _ and mother spin and weave all which son and husband wear when newspaper be small and infrequent dingy-typed and wholesomely stupid so that no man could or would learn from they more about other man 's opinion affair or occupation than it concern he practical convenience to know when even war be wage at slow pace -- army sail great distance by chance wind or plod on foot for thousand of mile and fight doggedly hand to hand at sight when fortune also be slowly make by simple honest growth -- no man except freebooter and pirate become rich in a day it would seem treason or idiocy to sigh for these old day -- treason to idea of progress stupid idiocy unaware that it be well off be not to-day brilliant marvellous beautiful have not live become subject to a magician 's presto be we not deck in the whole of color feast on all that shape and sound and flavor can give be we not wiser each moment than we be the moment before do not the blind see the deaf hear and the cripple dance have not nature surrender to we art and science be they not we slave -- coin money and run mill have we not build and multiply religion till each man even the most irreligious can have he own be not what be call the movement of the age go on at the highest rate of speed and of sound shall we complain that we be madden by the racket out of breath with the spin and whirling and die of the strain of it all what be a man more or less what be one hundred and twenty million of man more or less what be quiet in comparison with riches or digestion and long life in comparison with knowledge when we be add up in the universal reckoning of race there will be small mention of individual let we be disinterested let we sacrifice ourselves and above all we child to raise the general average of human invention and attainment to the highest possible mark to be sure we be work in the dark we do not know not even if we be huxley do we know at what point in the grand universal scale we shall ultimately come in we know or think we know about how far below we stand the gorilla and the seal we patronize they kindly for learn to turn hand-organ or eat from porringer let we hope that if we have brethren of higher race on other planet they will be as generously appreciative of we little all when we have do it but meanwhile let we never be deter from we utmost endeavor by any base and envious misgiving that possibly we may not be the last and highest work of the creator and in a fair way to reach very soon the final climax of all which create intelligence can be or become let we make the best of dyspepsia paralysis insanity and the death of we child perhaps we can do as much in forty year work night and day as we could in seventy work only by day and the five out of twelve child that live to grow up can perpetuate the name and the method of they father it be a comfort to believe as we be tell that the world can never lose a iota that it have gain that progress be the great law of the universe it be console to verify this truth by look backward and see how each age have make use of the wreck of the precede one as material for new structure on different plan what be we that we should mention we preference for be put to some other use more immediately remunerative to ourselves we must be all wrong if we be not in sympathy with the age in which we live we might as well be dead as not keep up with it but which of we do not sometimes wish in he heart of heart that he have be bear long enough ago to have be boon companion of he great-grandfather and have go respectably and in due season to he grave at a good jog trot the joyless american it be easy to fancy that a european on first reach these shore might suppose that he have chance to arrive upon a day when some great public calamity have sadden the heart of the nation it would be quite safe to assume that out of the first five hundred face which he see there will not be ten wear a smile and not fifty all tell look as if they ever could smile if this statement sound extravagant to any man let he try the experiment for one week of note down in he walk about town every face he see which have a radiantly cheerful expression the chance be that at the end of he seven day he will not have enter seven face in he note-book without be aware at the moment of some conscientious difficulty in permit himself to call they positively and unmistakably cheerful the truth be this wretched and joyless expression on the american face be so common that we be harden to see it and look for nothing better only when by chance some bless rollick sunshiny boy or girl or man or woman flash the beam of a laughing countenance into the level gloom do we even know that we be in the dark witness the instant effect of the entrance of such a person into a omnibus or a car who have not observe it even the most stolid and apathetic soul relax a little the unconscious intruder simply by smile have set the blood move more quickly in the vein of every human being who see he he be for the moment the personal benefactor of every one if he have hand about money or bread it would have be a philanthropy of less value what be to be do to prevent this acrid look of misery from become a organic characteristic of we people make they play more say one philosophy no doubt they need to play more but when one look at the average expression of a fourth of July crowd one doubt if ever so much multiplication of that kind of holiday would mend the matter no doubt we work for too many day in the year and play for too few but after all it be the heart and the spirit and the expression that we bring to we work and not those that we bring to we play by which we real vitality must be test and by which we face will be stamp if we do not work healthfully reasoningly moderately thankfully joyously we shall have neither moderation nor gratitude nor joy in we play and here be the hopelessness here be the root of the trouble of the joyless american face the worst of all demon the demon of unrest and overwork brood in the very sky of this land blue and clear and crisp and sparkling as we atmosphere be it can not or do not exorcise the spell any old man can count on the finger of one hand the person he have know who lead life of serene unhurried content make for themselves occupation and not task and die at last what might be call natural death what then say the congressional candidate from mettibemp the new contributor to the oceanic magazine mr potiphar from behind she livery and poor dive senior from wall street be we to give up all ambition god forbid but because one have a goal must one be tear by poison spur we see on the corso in the day of the carnival what speed can be make by horse under torture shall we try those method and that pace on we journey so long as the american be resolve to do in one day the work of two to make in one year the fortune of he whole life and he child 's to earn before he be forty the reputation which belong to threescore and ten so long he will go about the street wear he present abject pitiable overwrought joyless look but even without a change of heart or a reform of habit he might better he countenance a little if he would even if he do not feel like smile he might smile if he try and that would be something the muscle be all there they count the same in the american as in the french or the irish face they relax easily in youth the trick can be learn and even a trick of it be better than none of it laugh master might be as well pay as dancing master to help on society smile make easy or the complete art of look good-natured would be as take title on book-seller ' shelf as the complete letter-writer or handbook of behavior and nobody can calculate what might be the moral and spiritual result if it could only become the fashion to pursue this branch of the fine art surliness of heart must melt a little under the simple effort to smile a man will inevitably be a little less of a bear for try to wear the face of a christian he who laugh can commit no deadly sin say the wise and sweet-hearted woman who be mother of goethe spiritual teething milk for babe but when they come to the age for meat of doctrine tooth must be cut it be harder work for soul than for body but the process be wonderfully parallel -- the result too alas if clergyman know the symptom of spiritual disease and death as well as doctor do of disease and death of the flesh and if the list be publish at end of each year and month and week what a record would be show mortality in brooklyn or new york or philadelphium for the week end July 7th we be so use to the curt head of the little paragraph that we eye glance idly away from it and we do not realize its sadness by ten and by score they have go -- the man the woman the baby in hundred new mourner be go about the street week by week we be as familiar with black as with scarlet with the hearse as with the pleasure-carriage and yet so die in human heart the thought of death that we can be merry but if we know as well the record of sick and die and dead soul we heart would break the air would be dark and stifle we should be afraid to move -- lest we might hasten the last hour of some neighbor 's spiritual breath ah how often have we unconsciously speak the one word which be poison to he fever of the spiritual death as of the physical more than half take place in the period of teethe the more one think of the parallelism the closer it look until the likeness seem as droll as dismal oh the sweet unquestioning infancy which take its food from the nearest breast which know but three thing -- hunger and food and sleep there be only a little space for this delight in we seventh month we begin to be wretched we drink we milk but we be aware of a constant desire to bite doubt which we do not know by name need for which there be no ready supply make we restless now come the old-school doctor and thrust in he lancet too soon we suffer we bleed we be suppose to be relieve the tooth be say to be through through oh yes through before its time through to no purpose in a week or a year the wounded flesh or soul have reassert its right shut down on the tooth make a harder surface than ever a cicatrized crust out of which it will take double time and double strength for the tooth to break the gentle doctor give we a rubber ring it have a bad taste or a ivory one it be too hard and hurt we but we gnaw and gnaw and fancy the new pain a little easier to bear than the old probably it be probably the tooth get through a little quicker for the day and night of gnawing but what a picture of patient misery be a baby with its rubber ring really one see sometimes in the little puckered twist face such grotesque prophecy of future conflict such likeness to the soul 's process of grapple with problem that it be uncanny when we come to the analysis of the disease incident to the teething period and the treatment of they the similitude be as close we have sharp sudden inflammation we have subtle and more deadly thing which man do not detect till it be in nine case out of ten too late to cure they -- like water on the brain and we have slow wasting away atrophy which be worse than death leave life enough to prolong death indefinitely be as it be live death who do not know poor soul in all stage of all these -- outbreak of rebellion against all form all creed all propriety secret adoption of perilous delusion fatal error and slow settle down into indifferentism or narrow dogmatism the two worst living death these be they who live shall we say any thing of those of we who die between we seventh and eighteenth spiritual month they never put on baby ' tombstone die of teethe there be always a special name for the special symptom or set of symptom which characterize the last day but the mother believe and the doctor know that if it have not be for the tooth that be come just at that time the fever or the croup would not have kill the child now we come to the treatment and here again the parallelism be so close as to be ludicrous the lancet and the rubber ring fail we be still restless and scream and cry then we self-sacrificing nurse walk with we they rock we they swing we they toss we up and down they jounce we from top to bottom till the wonder be that every organ in we body be not displaced they beat on glass and tin and iron to distract we attention and drown out we noise by a bigger one they shake back and forth before we eye all thing that glitter and blaze they shout and sing song the house and the neighborhood be search and rack for something which will amuse the baby then when we will no longer be amuse and when all this restlessness outside and around we add to the restlessness inside we have drive we more than frantic and the day or the night of they well-meant clamor be nearly over they strength wear out and they wit at end -- then come the soothing syrup deadliest weapon of all this we can not resist if there be they who be mighty enough to pour it down we throat physically or spiritually to sleep we must go and asleep we must stay so long as the effect of the dose last it be of this we oftenest die -- not in a day or a year but after many day and many year when in some sharp crisis we need for we salvation the force which should have be develop in we infancy the muscle or the nerve which should have be steadily grow strong till that moment but the force be not there the muscle be weak the nerve paralyzed and we die at twenty of a light fever we fall down at twenty under sudden grief or temptation because of we long sleep under soothing syrup when we be baby oh good nurse and doctor of soul let they cut they own tooth in the natural way let they scream if they must but keep you still on one side give they no false help let they alone so far as it be possible for love and sympathy to do so man be the only animal that have trouble from the grow of the tooth in he body it must be he own fault somehow that he have that and he have evidently be always conscious of a likeness between this difficulty and perversion of a process natural to he body and the difficulty and perversion of he get sensible and just opinion for it have pass into the immortality of a proverb that a shrewd man be a man who have cut he eye-tooth and the four last tooth which we get late in life and which cost many people day of real illness be call in all tongue all country wisdom tooth glass house who would live in one if he could help it and who want to throw stone but who live in any thing else nowadays and how much better off be they who never throw a stone in they life than the rude mob who throw they all the time really the proverb might as well be blot out from we book and drop from we speech it have no longer use or mean it be become a serious question what shall be do or rather what can be do to secure to fastidious people some show and shadow of privacy in they home the silly and vulgar passion of people for know all about they neighbor ' affair which be bad enough while it take shape merely in idle gossip of mouth be something terrible when it be exalt into a regular market demand of the community and feed by a regular market supply from all who wish to print what the community will read we do not know which be worse in this traffic the buyer or the seller we think on the whole the buyer but then he be again a seller and so there it be -- wheel within wheel cog upon cog and since all these seller must earn they bread and butter the more one search for a fair point of attack the evil the more he be perplex the man who write must if he need pay for he work write what the man who print will buy the man who print must print what the people who read will buy upon whom then shall we lay earnest hand clearly upon the last buyer -- upon he who read but thing have come to such a pass already that to point out to the average american that it be vulgar and also unwholesome to devour with greedy delight all sort of detail about he neighbor ' business seem as hopeless and useless as to point out to the currie-eater or the whiskey-drinker the bad effect of fire and strychnine upon mucous membrane the diseased palate crave what have make it diseased -- crave it more and more and more in case of stomach nature have a few simple invention of she own for bring reckless abuse to a stand-still -- dyspepsia and delirium-tremen and so on but she take no account apparently of the diseased condition of brain incident to the long use of unwholesome or poisonous intellectual food perhaps she never anticipate this class of excess and if there be to be a precisely correlative punishment it be to be fear it would fall more heavily on the least guilty offender it be not hard to fancy a poor soul who have be condemn to do reporter ' duty for some year and have be force to dwell and dilate upon scene and detail which he very soul revolt from mention -- it be not hard to fancy such a soul visit at last by a species of delirium-tremen in which the speech of man who have speak the gown of woman who have dance the face the figure the furniture of celebrity should all be mix up in a grotesque phantasmagoria of torture before which he should writhe as helplessly and agonizingly as the poor whiskey-drinker before he snake but it would be a cruel misplacement of punishment all the while the true guilty would be placidly sit down at still further unsavory banquet which equally helpless provider be drive to furnish the evil be all the harder to deal with also because it be like so many evil -- all perhaps -- only a diseased outgrowth from a legitimate and justifiable thing it be we duty to sympathize it be we privilege and pleasure to admire no man live to himself alone no man can no man ought it be right that we should know about we neighbor all which will help we to help they to be just to they to avoid they if need be in short all which we need to know for they or we reasonable and fair advantage it be right also that we should know about man who be or have be great all which can enable we to understand they greatness to profit to imitate to revere all that will help we to remember whatever be worth remember there be education in this it be experience it be history but how much of what be write print and read to-day about the man and woman of to-day come under these head it be unnecessary to do more than ask the question it be still more unnecessary to do more than ask how many of the man and woman of to-day whose name have become almost as stereotyped a part of public journal as the very title of the journal themselves have any claim to such prominence but all these consideration seem insignificant by side of the intrinsic one of the vulgarity of the thing and its impudent ignore of the most sacred rights of individual that there be here and there weak fool who like to see they name and most trivial movement chronicle in newspaper can not be deny but they be few and they silly pleasure be very small in the aggregate compare with the annoyance and pain suffer by sensitive and refined people from these merciless invasion of they privacy no precaution can forestall they no reticence prevent nothing apparently short of die outright can set one free and even then it be merely leave the torture behind a harrowing legacy to one 's friend for tomb be even less sacred than house memory friendship obligation -- all be lose sight of in the greed of desire to make a effective sketch a surprising revelation a neat analysis or perhaps a adroit implication of honor to one 's self by reason of a old association with greatness private letter and private conversation which may touch live heart in a thousand sore spot be hawk about as coolly as if they have be old clothes leave too long unredeemed in the hand of the pawn-broker dead man tell no tale say the proverb one wish they could we should miss some spicy contribution to magazine and newspaper literature and a sudden silence would fall upon some loud-mouthed living but we despair of any cure for this evil no ridicule no indignation seem to touch it people must make the best they can of they glass house and if the stone come too fast take refuge in the cellar the old-clothes monger in journalism the old-clothes business have never be consider respectable it be suppose to begin and to end with cheating it deal with very dirty thing it would be hard to mention a calling of lower repute from the man who come to you door with tray of abominable china vase on they head and be ready to take any sort of rag in payment for they down -- or up -- to the bigger wretch who advertise that lady and gentleman can obtain the highest price for they cast-off clothing by call at no so and so on such a street they be all alike odious and despicable we wonder when we find anybody who be not a abject jew engage in the business we think we can recognize the stamp of the disgusting traffic on they very face it be by no means uncommon to hear it say of a sorry sneak he look like a old-clothes dealer but what shall we say of the old-clothes monger in journalism by the very name we have define describe they and point they out if only we could make the name such a badge of disgrace that every member of the fraternity should forthwith betake he or herself to some sort of honest labor these be they who crowd the column of we daily newspaper with the dreary monotonous worthless scandalous tale of what other man and woman do be do or will do say say or will say wear wear or will wear think think or will think eat eat or will eat drink drink or will drink : and if there be any other verb come under the head of to do to be to suffer add that to the list and the old-clothes monger will furnish you with something to fill out the phrase these be they who patch out they miserable little sham property for mock representation of life by scrap from private letter bit of conversation overheard on piazza in parlor in bedroom by odds and end of untrustworthy statement pick up at railway-station church-door and office of all sort by impudent inference and supposition and guess about other people 's affair by garbling and partial quoting and if need be by wholesale lying the trade be on the increase -- rapidly fearfully on the increase every large city every summer watering-place be more or less infested with this class of dealer the goods they have to furnish be more and more in demand there be hardly a journal in the country but have column after column full of they tattered wares there be hardly a man or woman in the country but buy they there be perhaps no remedy human nature have not yet shed all the monkey a linger and grovel baseness in the average heart delight in this sort of cast-off clothes of fellow-worm but if the trade must continue can we not insist that the profit be share if a be to receive ten dollar for quote b 's remark at a private dinner yesterday shall not b have a small percentage on the sale clearly this be only justice and in case where the wares be simply steal shall there be no redress here be a opening for a new bureau how well its advertisement would read : -- lady and gentleman wish to dispose of they old opinion sentiment feeling and so forth and also of the more interesting fact in they personal history can obtain good price for the same at no -- tittle-tattle street inquire at the door marked ` regular and special correspondence ' n b -- person willing to be report _ verbatim _ will receive especial consideration we commend this brief suggestion of a new business to all who be anxious to make a living and not particular how they make it perhaps the class of whom we have be speak would find it profitable to set it up as a branch of they own call it be quite possible that nobody else in the country would like to meddle with it the country landlord 's side it be only one side to be sure but it be the side of which we hear least the quarrel be like all quarrel -- it take two to make it but as of those two one be only one and the other be from ten to a hundred it be easy to see which side will do most talk in set forth its grievance it be naught it be naught saith the buyer and when he be go he way then he boasteth we be oftener remind of this text of scripture than of any other when we listen to conversation in regard to boarder in country house oh let I tell you of such a nice place we have find to board in the country it be only -- mile from mt -- or -- lake the drive be delightful and board be only $ 7 a week be the table a good one oh yes very good for the country we have good butter and milk and egg in abundance meat of course be never very good in the country but everybody gain a pound a week and we be go again this year if they have not raise they price then this model of a city woman in search of country lodgings sit down and write to the landlord : -- dear sir -- we would like to secure we old room in you house for the whole of July and August as we shall remain so long a time we hope you may be willing to count all the child at half-price last year you may remember we pay full price for the two eldest the twin who be not yet quite fourteen i hope also that mr -- have better arrangement for wash this summer and will allow we to have we own servant to do the wash for the whole family if these term suit you the price for my family -- eight child myself and servant -- would be $ 3850 a week perhaps if the servant take the entire charge of my room you would call it $ 37 as of course that would save the time of you own servant then the country landlord hesitate he be not positively sure of fill all he room for the season thirty-seven dollar a week would be he think better than nothing in he simplicity he suppose that if he confer as he certainly do a favor on mr -- by receive she great family on such low term she will be thoroughly well disposed toward he and he house and will certainly not be over-exacting in matter of accommodation in a evil hour he consent they come and he begin to reap he reward the twin be stout boy as large as man and much hungrier the baby be a sickly child of eighteen month and require especial diet which must be prepare at especial and inconvenient hour in the crowd little kitchen the other five child be average boy and girl between the age of three and twelve eat certainly as much as five grown people and make twice as much trouble the servant be a slow inefficient impudent irish girl who spend the greater part of four day in do the family wash and make the other servant uncomfortable and cross if this be all but this be not mr -- who write to all she friend boastingly of the cheap summer quarter that she have find and who gain by the village shop-keeper 's scale a pound of flesh a week habitually find fault with the food with the mattress with the chair with the rag-carpet with every thing in short down to the dust and the fly for neither of which last the poor landlord could be legitimately hold responsible this be not a exaggerated picture everybody who have board in country place in the summer have know dozen of such woman every country landlord can produce dozen of such letter and of letter still more exacting and unreasonable the average city man or woman who go to a country house to board go expect what it be in the nature of thing impossible that they should have the man expect to have boot black and hot water ready and a bell to ring for both what experienced country boarder have not laugh in he sleeve to see such a one newly arrive put he head out snappingly like a turtle from he doorway and call to chance passer how d'ye get at anybody in this house if it be a woman she expect that the tea will be of the finest flavor and never boil that steak will be porter-house steak that green pea will be in plenty and that the american girl who be chambermaid for the summer and school-teacher in the winter and who ten to one could put she to the blush in five minute by superior knowledge on many subject will enter and leave she room and wait upon she at the table with the silent respectfulness of a trained city servant this be all very silly but it happen at the end of every summer hundred of disappointed city people go back to they home grumble about country food and country way hundred of tired and discourage wife of country landlord sit down in they house at last empty and vow a vow that never again will they take city folk to board but the great law of supply and demand be too strong for they the city must come out of itself for a few week and get oxygen for its lung sunlight for its eye and rest for its overworked brain the country must open its arm whether it will or not and share its blessing and so the summer and the summering go on and there be always to be hear in the land the voice of murmur boarder and of landlord deprecate vindicate we confess that we sympathy be with the landlord the average country landlord be a honest well-meaning man whose idea of the profit to be make off boarder be so moderate and simple that the keeper of city boarding-house would laugh it and he to scorn if this be not so would he be find undertake to lodge and feed people for one dollar or a dollar and a half a day neither do he dream of ask they even at this low price to fare as he fare the excelsior mattress at which they cry out in disgust be bed of down in comparison with the straw tick on which he and he wife sleep soundly and contentedly he have pay $ 450 for each mattress as a special concession to what he understand city prejudice to require the cheap paint chamber-set be holiday adorning by the side of the cherry and pine in the bedroom of he family he buy fresh meat every day for dinner and nobody can understand the importance of this fact who be not familiar with the habit of salt-pork and codfish in we rural district that the meat be tough pale stringy be not he fault no other be to be buy stetson himself if he deal with this country butcher could do no better vegetable yes he have plant they if we look out of we window we can see they on they wind way they will be ripe by and by he never taste pea in he life before the fourth of July or cucumber before the middle of August he hear that there be such thing but he think they must be dreadful unhealthy they thing force out of season -- and whether healthy or not he can not get they we could not ourselves if we be keep house in the same township to be sure we might send to the city for they and be serve with such as be wilt to begin with and would arrive utterly unfit to be eat at end of they day 's journey cost double they market price in the add express charge we should not do any such thing we should do just as he do make the best of plum sauce or even dry apple we should not make we sauce with molasses probably but he do not know that sugar be better he honestly like molasses best as for saleratus in the bread as for fried meat and fry doughnut and ubiquitous pickle -- all those thing have he and he father before he eat and he think thriven on from time immemorial he will listen incredulously to all we say about the effect of alkali the change of fat to injurious oils by fry the indigestibility of pickle & c for after all the unanswerable fact remain on he side though he may be too polite or too slow to make use of it in the argument that have feed on these poison all he life he can easily thrash we to-day and he wife and daughter can and do work from morning till night while ours must lie down and rest by noon in spite of all this he will do what he can to humor we whim never yet have we see the country boarding-house where kindly and persistent remonstrance would not introduce the gridiron and banish the frying-pan and obtain at least a attempt at yeast-bread good patient long-suffering country people the only wonder to we be that they tolerate so pleasantly make such effort to gratify the preference and prejudice of city man and woman who come and who remain stranger among they and who in so many instance behave from first to last as if they be of a different race and know nothing of any common bond of humanity and christianity the good staff of pleasure in a inn in berchtesgaden bavarium where i dine every day for three week one summer i make the acquaintance of a little maid call gretchen she stand all day long wash dish in a dark passageway which communicate in some mysterious fashion with cellar kitchen dining-room and main hall of the inn from one or other of these quarter gretchen be sharply call so often that it be a puzzle to know how she contrived to wash so much as a cup or a plate in the course of the day poor child i be afraid she do most of she work after dark for i sometimes leave she standing there at ten o'clock at night she be blanch and shrink from fatigue and lack of sunlight i doubt if ever unless perhaps on some exceptional Sunday she know the sensation of a full breath of pure air or a warm sunbeam on she face but whenever i pass she she smile and there be never-failing good-cheer in she voice when she say good-morning she uniform atmosphere of contentedness so impressed and surprised I that at last i say to franz the head waiter -- what make gretchen so happy she have a hard life always stand in that narrow dark place wash dish franz be phlegmatic and speak very little english he shrug he shoulder in sign of assent that gretchen 's life be a hard one and add -- ja ja she like because all must come at she door there will be no one which will say not nothing if they go by that be it almost every hour some human voice say pleasantly to she good-morning gretchen or it be a fine day or if no word be speak there would be a friendly nod and smile for nowhere in kind-hearted simple germany do human being pass by other human being as we do in america without so much as a turn of the head to show recognition of humanity in common this one little pleasure keep gretchen not only alive but comparatively glad she body suffer for want of sun and air there be no help that by any amount of spiritual compensation so long as she must stand year in and year out in a close dark corner and do hard drudgery but if she have stand in that close dark corner do that hard drudgery and have have no pleasure to comfort she she would have be dead in three month if all man and woman could realize the power the might of even a small pleasure how much happier the world would be and how much longer body and soul both would bear up under live sensitive people realize it to the very core of they be they know that often and often it happen to they to be revive kindle strengthen to a degree which they could not describe and which they hardly comprehend by some little thing -- some word of praise some token of remembrance some proof of affection or recognition they know too that strength go out of they just as inexplicably just as fatally when for a space perhaps even a short space all these be want people who be not sensitive also come to find this out if they be tender they be by no means inseparable -- tenderness and sensitiveness if they be human nature would be both more comfortable and more agreeable but tender people alone can be just to sensitive one live in close relation with they they learn what they need and so far as they can supply it even when they wonder a little and perhaps grow a little weary we see a tender and just mother sometimes sigh because one over-sensitive child must be so much more gently restrain or admonish than the rest but she have she reward for every effort to adjust she method to the instrument she do not quite understand if she doubt this she have only to look on the right hand and the left and see the effect of careless brutal deal with finely string sensitive nature we see also many man -- good generous kindly but not sensitive-souled -- who have learn that the sunshine of they home all depend on little thing which it would never have enter into they busy and compose heart to think of do or say or provide if they have not discover that without they they wife droop and with they they keep well people who be neither tender nor sensitive can neither comprehend nor meet these need alas that there be so many such people or that if there must be just so many as i suppose there must they be not distinguishable at first sight by some mark of color or shape or sound so that one might avoid they or at least know what to expect in enter into relation with they woe be to any sensitive soul whose life must in spite of itself take tone and tint from daily and intimate intercourse with such no bravery no philosophy no patience can save it from a slow death but while the subtlest and most stimulating pleasure which the soul know come to it through its affection and be therefore so to speak at every man 's mercy there be still leave a world of possibility of enjoyment to which we can help ourselves and which no man can hinder and just here it be i think that many person especially those who be hard-worked and those who have some special trouble to bear make great mistake they might perhaps say at hasty first sight that it would be selfish to aim at provide themselves with pleasure not at all not one whit more than it be for they to buy a bottle of ayer 's sarsaparilla -lrb- if they do not know better -rrb- to cleanse they blood in the spring probably a dollar 's worth of almost any thing out of any other shop than a druggist 's would cleanse they blood better -- a geranium for instance or a photograph or a concert or a book or even fry oyster -- any thing no matter what so it be innocent which give they a little pleasure break in on the monotony of they work or they trouble and make they have for one half-hour a good time those who have near and dear one to remember these thing for they need no such word as i be write here heaven forgive they if be thus bless they do not thank god daily and take courage but lonely people and people whose kin be not kind or wise in these thing must learn to minister even in such way to themselves it be not selfish it be not foolish it be wise it be generous each contented look on a human face be reflect in every other human face which see it each growth in a human soul be a blessing to every other human soul which come in contact with it here will come in for many people the bitter restriction of poverty there be so many man and woman to whom it would seem simply a taunt to advise they to spend now and then a dollar for a pleasure that the poor must go cold and hungry have never seem to I the hardest feature in they lot there be worse deprivation than that of food or raiment and this very thing be one of they this be a point for charitable people to remember even more than they do we appreciate this when we give some plum-pudding and turkey at christmas instead of all coal and flannel but any day in the year a picture on the wall might perhaps be as comforting as a blanket on the bed and at any rate would be good for twelve month while the blanket would help but six i have see a irish mother in a mud hovel turn red with delight at a rattle for she baby when i be quite sure she would have be indifferently grateful for a pair of sock food and physician and money be and always will be on the earth but a merry heart be a continual feast and doeth good like-a medicine and loving favor be choose rather than gold and silver want -- a home nothing can be meaner than that misery should love company but the proverb be found on a original principle in human nature which it be no use to deny and hard work to conquer i have be uneasily conscious of this sneak sin in my own soul as i have read article after article in the english newspaper and magazine on the decadence of the home spirit in english family life as see in the large town and the metropolis it seem that the english be as badly off as we there also man be wide-awake and gay at club and race and sleepy and morose in they own house son lead life independent of they father and apart from they sister and mother girl run about as they please without care or guidance this state of thing be a spreading social evil and man be at they wit 's end to know what be to be do about it they be ransack national character and custom religion and the particular tendency of the present literary and scientific thought and the teaching and preaching of the public press to find out the root of the trouble one writer ascribe it to the exceed restlessness and the desire to be do something which be predominant and indomitable in the anglo-saxon race another to the passion which almost all family have for seem richer and more fashionable than they means will allow in these and in most of they other theory they be only work round and round as doctor so often do in the dreary circle of symptomatic result without so much as touching or perhaps suspect they real center how many people be blister for spinal disease or blanket for rheumatism when the real trouble be a little fiery spot of inflammation in the lining of the stomach and all these difficulty in the outwork be merely the creaking of the machinery because the central engine do not work properly blister and blanket may go on for seventy year coddling the poor victim but he will stay ill to the last if he stomach be not set right there be a close likeness between the doctor 's high-sounding list of remote symptom which he be treat as primary disease and the hue and outcry about the decadence of the home spirit the prevalence of excessive and improper amusement club-house billiard-room theater and so forth which be the bane of home the trouble be in the home home be stupid home be dreary home be insufferable if one can be pardon for the irishism of such a say home be they own worst bane if home be what they should be nothing under heaven could be invent which could be bane to they which would do more than serve as useful foil to set off they better cheer they pleasanter way they wholesomer joy whose fault be it that they be not so fault be a heavy word it include generation in its pitiless entail sufficient for the day be the evil thereof be but one side of the truth no day be sufficient unto the evil thereof be the other each day have to bear burden pass down from so many other day each person have to bear burden so complicate so interwoven with the burden of other each person 's fault be so fevered and swollen by fault of other that there be no disentangle the question of responsibility every thing be everybody 's fault be the simplest and fairest way of put it it be everybody 's fault that the average home be stupid dreary insufferable -- a place from which father fly to club boy and girl to street but when we ask who can do most to remedy this -- in whose hand it most lie to fight the fight against the tendency to monotony stupidity and instability which be inherent in human nature -- then the answer be clear and loud it be the work of woman this be the true mission of woman they right divine and unquestionable and include most emphatically the right to labor to create and sustain the atmosphere of a home -- it be easily say in a very few word but how many woman have do it how many woman can say to themselves or other that this be they aim to keep house well woman often say they desire but keep house well be another affair -- i have almost say it have nothing to do with create a home that be not true of course comfortable living as regard food and fire and clothes can do much to help on a home nevertheless with one exception the best home i have ever see be in house which be not especially well keep and the very worst i have ever know be preside -lrb- i mean tyrannize -rrb- over by perfect housekeeper all creator be single-aimed never will the painter sculptor writer lose sight of he art even in the interval of rest and diversion which be necessary to he health and growth every thing he see minister to he passion consciously or unconsciously he make each shape color incident he own sooner or later it will enter into he work so it must be with the woman who will create a home there be a evil fashion of speech which say it be a narrowing and narrow life that a woman lead who care only work only for she husband and child that a higher more imperative thing be that she herself be develop to she utmost even so clear and strong a writer as france cobbe in she otherwise admirable essay on the final cause of woman fall into this shallowness of word and speak of woman who live solely for they family as adjective in the family relation so many woman be nothing more so many woman become even less that human conception may perhaps be forgive for lose sight of the truth the ideal yet in woman it be hard to forgive it think clearly she should see that a creator can never be a adjective and that a woman who create and sustain a home and under whose hand child grow up to be strong and pure man and woman be a creator second only to god before she can do this she must have development in and by the do of this come constant development the higher she development the more perfect she work the instant she own development be arrest she creative power stop all science all art all religion all experience of life all knowledge of man -- will help she the star in they course can be win to fight for she could she attain the utmost of knowledge could she have all possible human genius it would be none too much reverence hold its breath and go softly perceive what it be in this woman 's power to do with what divine patience steadfastness and inspiration she must work into the home she will create monotony stupidity antagonism can not come she foresight will provide occupation and amusement she loving and alert diplomacy will fend off dispute unconsciously every member of she family will be as clay in she hand more anxiously than any statesman will she meditate on the wisdom of each measure the bearing of each word the least possible governing which be compatible with order will be she first principle she second the greatest possible influence which be compatible with the growth of individuality will the woman whose brain and heart be work these problem as apply to a household be a adjective be idle she will be no more a adjective than the sun be a adjective in the solar system no more idle than nature be idle she will be perplexed she will be weary she will be dishearten sometimes all creator save one have know these pain and grow strong by they but she will never withdraw she hand for one instant delay and failure will only set she to cast about for new instrumentality she will press all thing into she service she will master science that she boy ' evening need not be dull she will be worldly wise and render to caesar he due that she husband and daughter may have she by they side in all they pleasure she will invent she will surprise she will forestall she will remember she will laugh she will listen she will be young she will be old and she will be three time loving loving loving this be too hard there be the house to be keep and there be poverty and sickness and there be not time yes it be hard and there be the house to be keep and there be poverty and sickness but god be praise there be time a minute be time in one minute may live the essence of all i have see a beggar-woman make half a hour of home on a doorstep with a basket of broken meat and the most perfect home i ever saw be in a little house into the sweet incense of whose fire go no costly thing a thousand dollar serve for a year 's living of father mother and three child but the mother be a creator of a home she relation with she child be the most beautiful i have ever see even a dull and commonplace man be lift up and enable to do good work for soul by the atmosphere which this woman create every inmate of she house involuntarily look into she face for the key-note of the day and it always ring clear from the rose-bud or clover-leaf which in spite of she hard housework she always find time to put by we plate at breakfast down to the essay or story she have on hand to be read or discuss in the evening there be no intermission of she influence she have always be and always will be my ideal of a mother wife home-maker if to she quick brain loving heart and exquisite tact have be add the appliance of wealth and the enlargement of a wider culture hers would have be absolutely the ideal home as it be it be the best i have ever see it be more than twenty year since i cross its threshold i do not know whether she be live or not but as i see house after house in which father and mother and child be drag out they life in a hap-hazard alternation of listless routine and unpleasant collision i always think with a sigh of that poor little cottage by the seashore and of the woman who be the light thereof and i find in the face of many man and child as plainly write and as sad to see as in the newspaper column of personal want -- a home end of project gutenberg 's bit about home matter by helen hunt jackson
