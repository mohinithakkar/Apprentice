four grade -- leading school first-rate school good school and school sedleigh in mike and psmith would i suppose come into the last-named class though not quite as low in it as mr waugh 's llanabba it be one of those small english school with aspiration one day to be able to put the word public before they name and to have they headmaster qualify to attend the annual headmaster 's conference all it need be a few more adair to get thing go and there be this to be note that even at a school one get a excellent education its only drawback be that it do not play the lead school or the first-rate school or even the good school at cricket but to mike fresh from wrykyn -lrb- a first-rate school -rrb- and psmith come from eton -lrb- a lead school -rrb- sedleigh naturally seem something of a comedown it take mike some time to adjust himself to it though psmith the philosopher accept the change of condition with he customary equanimity this be the first appearance of psmith he come into two other book _ psmith in the city _ and _ psmith journalist _ before become happily marry in _ leave it to psmith _ but i have always think that he be most at home in this story of english school life to give full play to he bland clashing with authority he need to have authority to clash with and there be none more absolute than that of the master at a english school psmith have the distinction of be the only one of my numerous character to be draw from a living model a cousin of mine be at eton with the son of d'oyly carte the man who produce the gilbert and sullivan operetta and one night he tell I about this peculiar schoolboy who dress fastidiously and wear a monocle and who when one of the master inquire after he health reply sir i grow thinnah and thinnah it be all the information i require in order to start build he in a star part if anyone be curious as to what become of mike and psmith in later life i can supply the fact mike always devote to country life run a prosperous farm psmith inevitably perhaps become a equally prosperous counselor at the bar like perry mason specialize like perry in appear for the defense i must apologize as i do in the preface to _ mike at wrykyn _ for all the cricket in this book it be unavoidable there be however not quite so much of it this time pg wodehouse 1 mr jackson make up he mind if mike have be in time for breakfast that fatal easter morning he might have gather from the expression on he father 's face as mr jackson open the envelope contain he school report and read the contents that the document in question be not exactly a paean of praise from begin to end but he be late as usual mike always be late for breakfast in the holiday when he come down on this particular morning the meal be nearly over mr jackson have disappear take he correspondence with he mr jackson have go into the kitchen and when mike appear the thing have resolve itself into a mere vulgar brawl between phylli and ellum for the jam while marjory recently affect a grown-up air look on in a detach sort of way as if these juvenile gambol distressed she hello mike she say jump up as he enter here you be -- i have be keep everything hot for you have you thanks awfully i say he eye wander in mild surprise round the table i be a bit late marjory be bustling about fetch and carry for mike as she always do she have adopt he at a early age and do the thing thoroughly she be fond of she other brother especially when they make century in first-class cricket but mike be she favorite she would field out in the deep as a natural thing when mike be batting at the net in the paddock though for the other even for joe who have play in all five test match in the previous summer she would do it only as a favor phylli and ellum finish they dispute and go out marjory sit on the table and watch mike eat you report come this morning mike she say the kidney fail to retain mike 's undivided attention he look up interested what do it say i do not see -- i only catch sight of the wrykyn crest on the envelope father do not say anything mike seem concerned i say that look rather rotten i wonder if it be awfully bad it be the first i have have from appleby it can not be any worse than the horrid one mr blake use to write when you be in he form no that be a comfort say mike philosophically think there be any more tea in that pot i call it a shame say marjory they ought to be jolly glad to have you at wrykyn just for cricket instead of write beastly report that make father angry and do not do any good to anybody last christmas he say he would take I away if i get another one he do not mean it really i _ know _ he do not he could not you be the best bat wrykyn 's ever have what ho interpolate mike you _ be _ everybody say you be why you get you first the very first term you be there -- even joe do not do anything nearly so good as that saunder say you be simply bind to play for england in another year or two saunder be a jolly good chap he bowl I a half volley on the off the first ball i have in a school match by the way i wonder if he be out at the net now let 's go and see saunder the professional be set up the net when they arrive mike put on he pad and go to the wicket while marjory and the dog retire as usual to the far hedge to retrieve she be keep busy saunder be a good sound bowler of the mcc minor match type and there have be a time when he have worry mike considerably but mike have be in the wrykyn team for three season now and each season he have advance tremendously in he batting he have fill out in three year he have always have the style and now he have the strength as well saunder 's bowling on a true wicket seem simple to he it be early in the easter holiday but already he be begin to find he form saunder who look on mike as he own special invention be delighted if you do not be worry by be too anxious now that you be captain master mike he say you 'll make a century every match next term i wish i be not it be a beastly responsibility henfrey the wrykyn cricket captain of the previous season be not return next term and mike be to reign in he stead he like the prospect but it certainly carry with it a rather awe-inspiring responsibility at night sometimes he would lie awake appal by the fear of lose he form or make a hash of thing by choose the wrong man to play for the school and leave the right man out it be no light thing to captain a public school at cricket as he be walk toward the house phylli meet he oh i have be hunting for you mike father want you what for i do not know where he be in the study he seem add phylli throw in the information by a way of a makeweight in a beastly temper mike 's jaw fall slightly i hope the dickens it be nothing to do with that bally report be he muttered exclamation mike 's dealings with he father be as a rule of a most pleasant nature mr jackson be a understanding sort of man who treat he son as companion from time to time however breeze be apt to ruffle the placid sea of good fellowship mike 's end-of-term report be a unfailing wind raiser indeed on the arrival of mr blake 's sarcastic resume of mike 's shortcoming at the end of the previous term there have be something not unlike a typhoon it be on this occasion that mr jackson have solemnly declare he intention of remove mike from wrykyn unless the critic become more flattering and mr jackson be a man of he word it be with a certain amount of apprehension therefore that jackson enter the study come in mike say he father kick the waste-paper basket i want to speak to you mike skilled in omen scented a row in the offing only in moment of emotion be mr jackson in the habit of boot the basket there follow a awkward silence which mike break by remark that he have cart a half volley from saunder over the on-side hedge that morning it be just a bit short and off the leg stump so i step out -- may i bag the paper knife for a jiffy i 'll just show -- never mind about cricket now say mr jackson i want you to listen to this report oh be that my report father say mike with a sort of sickly interest much as a dog about to be wash might evince in he tub it be reply mr jackson in measure tone you report what be more it be without exception the worst report you have ever have oh i say groan the record-breaker ` he conduct ' quote mr jackson ` have be unsatisfactory in the extreme both in and out of school ' it be not anything really i only happen -- remember suddenly that what he have happen to do be to drop a cannonball -lrb- the school weight -rrb- on the form-room floor not once but on several occasion he pause ` french bad conduct disgraceful -- ' everybody rag in french ` mathematics bad inattentive and idle ' nobody do much work in math ` latin poor greek very poor ' we be do thucydide book two last term -- all speech and doubtful reading and crux and thing -- beastly hard everybody say so here be mr appleby 's remark : ` the boy have genuine ability which he decline to use in the smallest degree ' mike moan a moan of righteous indignation ` a abnormal proficiency at game have apparently destroy all desire in he to realize the more serious issue of life ' there be more to the same effect mr appleby be a master with very definite idea as to what constitute a public-school master 's duty as a man he be distinctly pro-mike he understand cricket and some of mike 's stroke on the off give he thrill of pure aesthetic joy but as a master he always make it he habit to regard the manners and custom of the boy in he form with a unbiased eye and to a unbiased eye mike in a form room be about as near the extreme edge as a boy could be and mr appleby say as much in a clear firm hand you remember what i say to you about you report at christmas mike say mr jackson folding the lethal document and replace it in its envelope mike say nothing there be a sink feeling in he interior i shall abide by what i say mike 's heart thump you will not go back to wrykyn next term somewhere in the world the sun be shine bird be twitter somewhere in the world lambkin frisk and peasant sing blithely at they toil -lrb- flat perhaps but still blithely -rrb- but to mike at that moment the sky be black and a icy wind blow over the face of the earth the tragedy have happen and there be a end of it he make no attempt to appeal against the sentence he know it would be useless he father when he make up he mind have all the unbending tenacity of the normally easygoing man mr jackson be sorry for mike he understand he and for that reason he say very little now i be send you to sedleigh be he next remark sedleigh mike sit up with a jerk he know sedleigh by name -- one of those school with about a hundred boy which you never hear of except when they send up they gym team to aldershot or they eight to bisley mike 's outlook on life be that of a cricketer pure and simple what have sedleigh ever do what be they ever likely to do whom do they play what old sedleighan have ever do anything at cricket perhaps they do not even _ play _ cricket but it be a awful hole he say blankly mr jackson could read mike 's mind like a book mike 's point of view be plain to he he do not approve of it but he know that in mike 's place and at mike 's age he would have feel the same he speak dryly to hide he sympathy it be not a large school he say and i do not suppose it could play wrykyn at cricket but it have one merit -- boy work there young barlitt win a balliol scholarship from sedleigh last year barlitt be the vicar 's son a silent spectacled youth who do not enter very largely into mike 's world they have meet occasionally at tennis party but not much conversation have ensue barlitt 's mind be massive but he topic of conversation be not mike 's mr barlitt speak very highly of sedleigh add mr jackson mike say nothing which be a good deal better than say what he would have like to have say 2 sedleigh the train which have be stop everywhere for the last half hour pull up again and mike see the name of the station get up open the door and hurl a bag out on to the platform in a emphatic and vindictive manner then he get out himself and look about he for the school sir inquire the solitary porter bustling up as if he hope by sheer energy to deceive the traveler into think that sedleigh station be staff by a great army of porter mike nod a somber nod the nod napoleon might have give if somebody have meet he in 1812 and say so you be back from moscow eh mike be feel thoroughly jaundice the future seem wholly gloomy and so far from attempt to make the best of thing he have set himself deliberately to look on the dark side he think for instance that he have never see a more repulsive porter or one more obviously incompetent than the man who have attach himself with a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he stride off in the direction of the luggage van he dislike he voice he appearance and the color of he hair also the boot he wear he hate the station and the man who take he ticket young gent at the school sir say the porter perceive from mike 's _ distrait _ air that the boy be a stranger to the place go up in the bus mostly it be wait here sir hi george i 'll walk thanks say mike frigidly it be a goodish step sir here you be thank you sir i 'll send up you luggage by the bus sir which ` ouse be it you be go to outwood 's right sir it be straight on up this road to the school you can not miss it sir worse luck say mike he walk off up the road sorrier for himself than ever it be such absolutely rotten luck about now instead of be on he way to a place where they probably run a halma team instead of a cricket eleven and play hunt-the-slipper in winter he would be on the point of arrive at wrykyn and as captain of cricket at that which be the bitter part of it he have never be in command for the last two season he have be the star man go in first and head the average easily at the end of the season and the three captain under whom he have play during he career as a wrykynian burgess enderby and henfrey have always be sportsman to he but it be not the same thing he have mean to do such a lot for wrykyn cricket this term he have have a entirely new system of coaching in he mind now it might never be use he have hand it on in a letter to strachan who would be captain in he place but probably strachan would have some scheme of he own there be nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way and there be nobody who have not a theory of he own about cricket coaching at school wrykyn too would be weak this year now that he be no longer there strachan be a good free bat on he day and if he survive a few over might make a century in a hour but he be not to be depend upon there be no doubt that mike 's sudden withdrawal mean that wrykyn would have a bad time that season and it have be such a wretched athletic year for the school the football fifteen have be hopeless and have lose both the ripton match the return by over sixty point sheen 's victory in the light weight at aldershot have be they one success and now on top of all this the captain of cricket be remove during the easter holiday mike 's heart bleed for wrykyn and he find himself loathing sedleigh and all its work with a great loathing the only thing he could find in its favor be the fact that it be set in a very pretty country of a different type from the wrykyn country but almost as good for three mile mike make he way through wood and past field once he cross a river it be soon after this that he catch sight from the top of a hill of a group of building that wear a unmistakably schoollike look this must be sedleigh ten minute ' walk bring he to the school gate and a baker 's boy direct he to mr outwood 's there be three house in a row separate from the school building by a cricket field outwood 's be the middle one of these mike go to the front door and knock at wrykyn he have always charge in at the beginning of term at the boy ' entrance but this formal reporting of himself at sedleigh suit he mood he inquire for mr outwood and be show into a room line with book presently the door open and the housemaster appear there be something pleasant and homely about mr outwood in appearance he remind mike of smee in _ peter pan _ he have the same eyebrow and pince-nez and the same motherly look jackson he say mildly yes sir i be very glad to see you very glad indeed perhaps you would like a cup of tea after you journey i think you might like a cup of tea you come from crofton in shropshire i understand jackson near brindleford it be a part of the country which i have always wish to visit i dare say you have frequently see the cluniac priory of st ambrose at brindleford mike who would not have recognize a cluniac priory if you have hand he one on a tray say he have not dear I you have miss a opportunity which i should have be glad to have i be prepare a book on ruin abbey and priory of england and it have always be my wish to see the cluniac priory of st ambrose a deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century bishop geoffrey 1133-40 -- shall i go across to the boy ' part sir what yes oh yes quite so and perhaps you would like a cup of tea after you journey no quite so quite so you should make a point of visit the remains of the cluniac priory in the summer holiday jackson you will find the matron in she room in many respects it be unique the northern altar be in a state of really wonderful preservation it consist of a solid block of masonry five foot long and two and a half wide with chamfered plinth standing quite free from the apse wall it will well repay a visit good-bye for the present jackson good-bye mike wander across to the other side of the house he gloom visibly deepen all alone in a strange school where they probably play hopscotch with a housemaster who offer one cup of tea after one 's journey and talk about chamfered plinth and apse it be a little hard he stray about find he bearing and finally come to a room which he take to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a wrykyn house everywhere else he have find nothing but emptiness evidently he have come by a earlier train than be usual but this room be occupy a very long thin youth with a solemn face and immaculate clothes be lean against the mantelpiece as mike enter he fumble in he top left waistcoat pocket produce a eyeglass attach to a cord and fix it in he right eye with the help of this aid to vision he inspect mike in silence for a while then have flick a invisible speck of dust from the left sleeve of he coat he speak hello he say he speak in a tired voice hello say mike take a seat say the immaculate one if you do not mind dirty you bag that be to say personally i do not see any prospect of ever sit down in this place it look to I as if they mean to use these chair as mustard-and-cress bed a nursery garden in the home that sort of idea my name he add pensively be smith what be yours 3 psmith jackson say mike be you the bully the pride of the school or the boy who be lead astray and take to drink in chapter sixteen the last for choice say mike but i have only just arrive so i do not know the boy -- what will he become be you new here too then yes why be you new do i look as if i belong here i be the latest import sit down on yonder settee and i will tell you the painful story of my life by the way before i start there be just one thing if you ever have occasion to write to I would you mind stick a p at the beginning of my name p-s-m-i-t-h see there be too many smith and i do not care for smythe my father 's content to worry along in the old-fashioned way but i have decide to strike out a fresh line i shall find a new dynasty the resolve come to I unexpectedly this morning i jot it down on the back of a envelope in conversation you may address I as rupert -lrb- though i hope you will not -rrb- or simply smith the _ p _ not be sound compare the name zbysco in which the z be give a similar miss-in-balk see mike say he see psmith thank he with a certain stately old world courtesy let we start at the beginning he resume my infancy when i be but a babe my eldest sister be bribe with a shill a hour by my nurse to keep a eye on I and see that i do not raise cain at the end of the first day she strike for one-and-six and get it we now pass to my boyhood at a early age i be send to eton everybody predict a bright career for I but say psmith solemnly fix a owl-like gaze on mike through the eyeglass it be not to be no say mike no i be superannuate last term bad luck for eton yes but what eton lose sedleigh gain but why sedleigh of all place this be the most painful part of my narrative it seem that a certain scug in the next village to ours happen last year to collar a balliol -- not barlitt exclaim mike that be the man the son of the vicar the vicar tell the curate who tell we curate who tell we vicar who tell my father who send I off here to get a balliol too do _ you _ know barlitt he father 's vicar of we village it be because he son get a balliol that i be send here do you come from crofton yes i have live at lower benford all my life we be practically long-lost brother cheer a little will you mike feel as robinson crusoe feel when he meet Friday here be a fellow human being in this desert place he could almost have embrace psmith the very sound of the name lower benford be hearten he dislike for he new school be not diminish but now he feel that life there might at least be tolerable where be you before you come here ask psmith you have hear my painful story now tell I yours wrykyn my father take I away because i get such a lot of bad report my report from eton be simply scurrilous there be a libel action in every sentence how do you like this place from what you have see of it rotten i be with you comrade jackson you will not mind my call you comrade will you i have just become a socialist it be a great scheme you ought to be one you work for the equal distribution of property and start by collar all you can and sit on it we must stick together we be companion in misfortune lose lamb sheep that have go astray divide we fall together we may worry through have you see professor radium yet i should say mr outwood what do you think of he he do not seem a bad sort of chap bit off he nut jaw about apse and thing and thereby say psmith hang a tale i have be make inquiry of a stout sportsman in a sort of salvation army uniform whom i meet in the grounds -- he be the school sergeant or something quite a solid man -- and i hear that comrade outwood 's a archaeological cove go about the country beat up old ruin and fossil and thing there be a archaeological society in the school run by he it go out on half-holiday prowl about and be allow to break bound and generally steep itself to the eyebrow in reckless devilry and mark you laddie if you belong to the archaeological society you get off cricket to get off cricket say psmith dust he right trouser leg be the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper year a noble game but a bit too thick for I at eton i use to have to field out at the net till the sole of my boot wear through i suppose you be a blood at the game play for the school against loamshire and so on i be not go to play here at any rate say mike he have make up he mind on this point in the train there be a certain fascination about make the very worst of a bad job achille know he business when he sit in he tent the determination not to play cricket for sedleigh as he could not play for wrykyn give mike a sort of pleasure to stand by with fold arm and a somber frown as it be be one way of treat the situation and one not without its meed of comfort psmith approve the resolve stout fellow he say ` tis well you and i hand in hand will search the countryside for ruin abbey we will snare the elusive fossil together above all we will go out of bound we shall thus improve we mind and have a jolly good time as well i should not wonder if one might not borrow a gun from some friendly native and do a bit of rabbit shooting here and there from what i saw of comrade outwood during we brief interview i should not think he be one of the lynx-eyed contingent with tact we ought to be able to slip away from the merry throng of fossil chaser and do a bit on we own account good idea say mike we will a chap at wrykyn call wyatt use to break out at night and shoot at cat with a air pistol it would take a lot to make I do that i be all against anything that interfere with my sleep but rabbit in the daytime be a scheme we 'll nose about for a gun at the earliest opp meanwhile we would better go up to comrade outwood and get we name shove down for the society i vote we get some tea first somewhere then let 's beat up a study i suppose they have study here let 's go and look they go upstairs on the first floor there be a passage with door on either side psmith open the first of these this 'll do we well he say it be a biggish room look out over the school grounds there be a couple of deal table two empty bookcase and a look glass hang on a nail might have be make for we say psmith approvingly i suppose it belong to some rotter not now you be not go to collar it that say psmith look at himself earnestly in the mirror and straighten he tie be the exact program we must stake out we claim this be practical socialism but the real owner 's bind to turn up some time or other he misfortune not ours you can not expect two mastermind like we to pig it in that room downstairs there be moment when one want to be alone it be imperative that we have a place to retire to after a fatiguing day and now if you want to be really useful come and help I fetch up my box from downstairs it be get a gas ring and various thing in it 4 stake out a claim psmith in the matter of decorate a study and prepare tea in it be rather a critic than a executant he be full of idea but he prefer to allow mike to carry they out it be he who suggest that the wooden bar which run across the window be unnecessary but it be mike who wrench it from its place similarly it be mike who abstract the key from the door of the next study though the idea be psmith 's privacy say psmith as he watch mike light the gas ring be what we chiefly need in this age of publicity if you leave a study door unlock in these strenuous time the first thing you know be somebody come right in sit down and begin to talk about himself i think with a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently comfortable that putrid calendar must come down though do you think you could make a long arm and haul it off the parent tintack thanks we make progress we make progress we shall jolly well make it out of the window say mike spoon up tea from a paperbag with a postcard if a sort of young hackenschmidt turn up and claim the study what be you go to do about it do not let we worry about it i have a presentiment that he will be a insignificant-looking little weed how be you get on with the evening meal just ready what would you give to be at eton now i would give something to be at wrykyn these school report say psmith sympathetically be the very dickens many a bright young lad have be sour by they hello what be this i wonder a heavy body have plunge against the door evidently without a suspicion that there would be any resistance a rattle of the handle follow and a voice outside say dash the door hackenschmidt say mike the weed say psmith you could not make a long arm could you and turn the key we have better give this merchant audience remind I later to go on with my remark on school report i have several bright thing to say on the subject mike unlock the door and fling it open frame in the entrance be a smallish freckled boy wear a pork-pie hat and carry a bag on he face be a expression of mingled wrath and astonishment psmith rise courteously from he chair and move forward with slow stateliness to do the honor what the dickens inquire the newcomer be you do here we be have a little tea say psmith to restore we tissue after we journey come in and join we we keep open house we psmith let I introduce you to comrade jackson a stout fellow homely in appearance perhaps but one of we i be psmith you own name will doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the teacup my name 's spiller and this be my study psmith lean against the mantelpiece put up he eyeglass and harangue spiller in a philosophical vein of all sad word of tongue or pen say he the saddest be these : ` it might have be ' too late that be the bitter cry if you have tear yourself from the bosom of the spiller family by a earlier train all might have be well but no you father hold you hand and say huskily ` edwin do not leave we ' you mother cling to you weep and say ` edwin stay ' you sister -- i want to know what -- you sister freeze on to you knee like little octopus -lrb- or octopus -rrb- and scream ` do not go edwin ' and so say psmith deeply affect by he recital you stay on till the later train and on arrival you find strange face in the familiar room a people that know not spiller psmith go to the table and cheer himself with a sip of tea spiller 's sad case have move he greatly the victim of fate seem in no way console it be beastly cheek that be what i call it be you new chap the very latest thing say psmith well it be beastly cheek mike 's outlook on life be of the solid practical order he go straight to the root of the matter what be you go to do about it he ask spiller evade the question it be beastly cheek he repeat you can not go about the place bagging study but we do say psmith in this life comrade spiller we must be prepare for every emergency we must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible it be unusual for people to go about the place bagging study so you have rashly order you life on the assumption that it be impossible error ah spiller spiller let this be a lesson to you look here i tell you what it -- i be in a car with a man once i say to he : ` what would happen if you tread on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing ' he say ' i could not one 's the foot brake and the other 's the accelerator ' ` but suppose you do ' i say ' i would not ' he say ` now we 'll let she rip ' so he stamp on the accelerator only it turn out to be the foot brake after all and we stop dead and skid into a ditch the advice i give to every young man start life be : ` never confuse the unusual and the impossible ' take the present case if you have only realize the possibility of somebody someday collar you study you might have think out dozen of sound scheme for deal with the matter as it be you be unprepared the thing come on you as a surprise the cry go round : ` spiller have be take unawares he can not cope with the situation ' can not i i 'll -- what _ be _ you go to do about it say mike all i know be i be go to have it it be simpson 's last term and simpson 's left and i be next on the house list so of course it be my study but what step say psmith be you go to take spiller the man of logic we know but what of spiller the man of action how do you intend to set about it force be useless i be say to comrade jackson before you come in that i do not mind bet you be a insignificant-looking little weed and you _ be _ a insignificant-looking little weed we 'll see what outwood say about it not a unsound scheme by no mean a scaly project comrade jackson and myself be about to interview he upon another point we may as well all go together the trio make they way to the presence spiller pink and determine mike sullen psmith particularly debonair he hum lightly as he walk and now and then point out to spiller object of interest by the wayside mr outwood receive they with the motherly warmth which be evidently the lead characteristic of he normal manner ah spiller he say and smith and jackson i be glad to see you have already make friend spiller 's sir say psmith lay a hand patronizingly on the study-claimer 's shoulder -- a proceeding violently resent by spiller -- be a character one can not help but respect he nature expand before one like some beautiful flower mr outwood receive this eulogy with rather a startled expression and gaze at the object of the tribute in a surprised way er -- quite so smith quite so he say at last i like to see boy in my house friendly toward one another there be no vice in spiller pursued psmith earnestly he heart be the heart of a little child please sir burst out this paragon of all the virtue i -- but it be not entirely with regard to spiller that i wish to speak to you sir if you be not too busy not at all smith not at all be there anything please sir -- begin spiller i understand sir say psmith that there be a archaeological society in the school mr outwood 's eye sparkle behind they pince-nez it be a disappointment to he that so few boy seem to wish to belong to he chosen band cricket and football game that leave he cold appear to be the main interest in they life it be but rarely that he could induce new boy to join he colleague mr downing who preside over the school fire brigade never have any difficulty in find support boy come readily at he call mr outwood ponder wistfully on this at time not know that the fire brigade owe its support to the fact that it provide its lighthearted member with perfectly unparalleled opportunity for rag while he own band though small be in the main earnest yes smith he say yes we have a small archaeological society i -- er -- in a measure look after it perhaps you would care to become a member please sir -- say spiller one moment spiller do you want to join smith intensely sir archaeology fascinate I a grand pursuit sir undoubtedly smith i be very pleased very pleased indeed i will put down you name at once and jackson 's sir jackson too mr outwood beam i be delighted most delighted this be capital this enthusiasm be most capital spiller sir

somebody have bag you study make it jolly hot for they so will comrade spiller i take it that he will collect a gang and make a offensive movement against we directly he can to all appearance we be in a fairly tight place it all depend on how big comrade spiller 's gang will be i do not like row but i be prepared to take on a reasonable number of assailant in defense of the home mike intimate that he be with he on the point the difficulty be though he say about when we leave this room i mean we be all right while we stick here but we can not stay all night that be just what i be about to point out when you put it with such admirable clearness here we be in a stronghold they can only get at we through the door and we can lock that and jam a chair against it _ and _ as you rightly remark jam a chair against it but what of the nightfall what of the time when we retire to we dormitory or dormitory i say if we be in separate room we shall be in the cart psmith eye mike with approval he think of everything you be the man comrade jackson to conduct a affair of this kind -- such foresight such resource we must see to this at once if they put we in different room we be do -- we shall be destroy singly in the watch of the night we have better nip down to the matron right off not the matron -- comrade outwood be the man we be as son to he there be nothing he can deny we i be afraid we be quite spoil he afternoon by these interruption but we must rout he out once more as they get up the door handle rattle again and this time there follow a knock this must be a emissary of comrade spiller 's say psmith let we parley with the man mike unlock the door a light-haired youth with a cheerful rather vacant face and a recede chin stroll into the room and stand giggle with he hand in he pocket i just come up to have a look at you he explain if you move a little to the left say psmith you will catch the light-and-shade effect on jackson 's face better the newcomer giggle with renew vigor be you the chap with the eyeglass who jaw all the time i _ do _ wear a eyeglass say psmith as to the rest of the description -- my name 's jellicoe mine be psmith -- p-s-m-i-t-h -- one of the shropshire psmith the object on the skyline be comrade jackson old spiller giggle jellicoe be cursing you like anything downstairs you _ be _ chap do you mean to say you simply bag he study he be make no end of a row about it spiller 's fiery nature be a byword say psmith what be he go to do asked mike in he practical way he be go to get the chap to turn you out as i suspect sigh psmith as one mourning over the frailty of human nature about how many horny-handed assistant should you say that he would be likely to bring will you for instance join the glad throng I no fear i think spiller 's a ass there be nothing like a common thought for bind people together _ i _ think spiller 's a ass how many _ will _ there be then ask mike he might get about half a dozen not more because most of the chap do not see why they should sweat themselves just because spiller 's study have be bag sturdy common sense say psmith approvingly seem to be the chief virtue of the sedleigh character we shall be able to tackle a crowd like that say mike the only thing be we must get into the same dormitory this be where comrade jellicoe 's knowledge of the local geography will come in useful do you happen to know of any snug little room with say about four bed in it how many dormitory be there five -- there be one with three bed in it only it belong to three chap i believe in the equal distribution of property we will go to comrade outwood and stake out another claim mr outwood receive they even more beamingly than before yes smith he say we must apologize for disturbing you sir -- not at all smith not at all i like the boy in my house to come to I when they wish for my advice or help we be wonder sir if you would have any objection to jackson jellicoe and myself share the dormitory with the three bed in it a very warm friendship explain psmith pat the gurgle jellicoe kindly on the shoulder have spring up between jackson jellicoe and myself you make friend easily smith i like to see it -- i like to see it and we can have the room sir certainly -- certainly tell the matron as you go down and now say psmith as they return to the study we may say that we be in a fairly win position a vote of thanks to comrade jellicoe for he valuable assistance you _ be _ a chap say jellicoe the handle begin to revolve again that door say psmith be get a perfect incubus it cut into one 's leisure cruelly this time it be a small boy they tell I to come up and tell you to come down he say psmith look at he searchingly through he eyeglass who the senior day room chap spiller spiller and robinson and stone and some other chap they want we to speak to they they tell I to come up and tell you to come down go and give comrade spiller we compliment and say that we can not come down but shall be delighted to see he up here thing he say as the messenger depart be begin to move better leave the door open i think it will save trouble ah come in comrade spiller what can we do for you spiller advance into the study the other wait outside crowding in the doorway look here say spiller be you go to clear out of here or not after mr outwood 's kindly think in give we the room you suggest a black and ungrateful action comrade spiller you 'll get it hot if you do not we 'll risk it say mike jellicoe giggle in the background the drama in the atmosphere appeal to he he be a simple and appreciative mind come on you chap cry spiller suddenly there be a inward rush on the enemy 's part but mike have be watch he grab spiller by the shoulder and run he back against the advance crowd for a moment the doorway be block then the weight and impetus of mike and spiller prevail the enemy give back and mike step into the room again slam the door and lock it a neat piece of work say psmith approvingly adjust he tie at the look glass the preliminary may now be consider over the first shot have be fire the dog of war be now loose a heavy body crash against the door they 'll have it down say jellicoe we must act comrade jackson might i trouble you just to turn that key quietly and the handle and then to stand by for the next attack there be a scramble of foot in the passage outside and then a repetition of the onslaught on the door this time however the door instead of resist swing open and the human batter ram stagger through into the study mike turn after relock the door be just in time to see psmith with a display of energy of which one would not have believe he capable grip the invader scientifically by a arm and a leg mike jump to help but it be needless the captive be already on the windowsill as mike arrive psmith drop he onto the flowerb below psmith close the window gently and turn to jellicoe who be we guest he ask dust the knee of he trousers where they have press against the wall robinson i say you _ be _ a chap robinson be it well we be always glad to see comrade robinson always i wonder if anybody else be think of call apparently frontal attack have be abandon whispering could be hear in the corridor somebody hammer on the door yes call psmith patiently you would better come out you know you 'll only get it hotter if you do not leave we spiller we would be alone a bell ring in the distance tea say jellicoe we shall have to go now they will not do anything till after tea i should not think say mike there be no harm in go out the passage be empty when they open the door the call to food be evidently a thing not to be treat lightly by the enemy in the dining room the beleaguered garrison be the object of general attention everybody turn to look at they as they come in it be plain that the study episode have be a topic of conversation spiller 's face be crimson and robinson 's coat sleeve still bear trace of garden mold mike feel rather conscious of the eye but psmith be in he element he demeanor throughout the meal be that of some whimsical monarch condescend for a freak to revel with he humble subject toward the end of the meal psmith scribble a note and pass it to mike it read : directly this be over nip upstairs as quickly as you can mike follow the advice they be first out of the room when they have be in the study a few moment jellicoe knock at the door lucky you two cut away so quick he say they be go to try and get you into the senior day room and scrag you there this say psmith lean against the mantelpiece be exciting but it can not go on we have get for we sin to be in this place for a whole term and if we be go to do the hunt fawn business all the time life in the true sense of the word will become a impossibility my nerve be so delicately attuned that the strain would simply reduce they to hash we be not prepare to carry on a long campaign -- the thing must be settle at once shall we go down to the senior day room and have it out say mike no we will play the fixture on we own ground i think we may take it as tolerably certain that comrade spiller and he hire ruffian will try to corner we in the dormitory tonight well of course we could fake up some sort of barricade for the door but then we should have all the trouble over again tomorrow and the day after that personally i do not propose to be chivy about indefinitely like this so i propose that we let they come into the dormitory and see what happen be this meeting with I i think that be sound say mike we need not drag jellicoe into it as a matter of fact -- if you do not mind begin that man of peace quite right say psmith this be not comrade jellicoe 's scene at all he have get to spend the term in the senior day room whereas we have we little wooden _ châlet _ to retire to in time of stress comrade jellicoe must stand out of the game altogether we shall be glad of he moral support but otherwise _ ne pas _ and now as there will not be anything do till bedtime i think i 'll collar this table and write home and tell my people that all be well with they rupert 6 unpleasantness in the small hour jellicoe that human encyclopedia consult on the probable movement of the enemy depose that spiller retire at ten would make for dormitory one in the same passage where robinson also have a bed the rest of the opposing force be distribute among other and more distant room it be probable therefore that dormitory one would be the rendezvous as to the time when a attack might be expect it be unlikely that it would occur before half past eleven mr outwood go the round of the dormitory at eleven and touch say psmith the matter of noise must this business be conduct in a subdue and _ sotto voce _ manner or may we let ourselves go a bit here and there i should not think old outwood 's likely to hear you -- he sleep mile away on the other side of the house he never hear anything we often rag half the night and nothing happen this appear to be a thoroughly nice well-conducted establishment what would my mother say if she could see she rupert in the midst of these reckless youth all the better say mike we do not want anybody butting in and stop the show before it be half start comrade jackson 's berserk blood be up -- i can hear it sizzle i quite agree these thing be all very disturbing and painful but it be as well to do they thoroughly when one 's once in for they be there nobody else who might interfere with we gambol barne might say jellicoe only he will not who be barnes head of the house -- a rotter he be in a funk of stone and robinson they rag he he 'll simply sit tight then i think say psmith placidly we may look forward to a very pleasant evening shall we be move mr outwood pay he visit at eleven as predict by jellicoe beam vaguely into the darkness over a torch and disappear again close the door how about that door say mike shall we leave it open for they not so but far otherwise if it be shut we shall hear they at it when they come subject to you approval comrade jackson i have evolve the follow plan of action i always ask myself on these occasion ` what would napoleon have do ' i think napoleon would have sit in a chair by he washhand stand which be close to the door he would have post you by you washhand stand and he would have instruct comrade jellicoe directly he hear the door handle turn to give he celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep he would then -- i tell you what say mike how about tie a string at the top of the step yes napoleon would have do that too hat off to comrade jackson the man with the big brain the floor of the dormitory be below the level of the door there be three step lead down to it psmith switch on he torch and they examine the ground the leg of a wardrobe and the leg of jellicoe 's bed make it possible for the string to be fasten in a satisfactory manner across the lower step psmith survey the result with approval dash neat he say practically the sunken road which dish the cuirassier at waterloo i seem to see comrade spiller come one of the finest purler in the world 's history if they have get a torch -- they will not have if they have stand by and grab it at once then they 'll charge forward and all will be well if they have no light fire into the brown with a jug of water lest we forget i 'll collar comrade jellicoe 's jug now and keep it handy a couple of sheet would also not be amiss -- we will enmesh the enemy right ho say mike these humane preparation be conclude say psmith we will retire to we post and wait comrade jellicoe do not forget to breathe like a asthmatic sheep when you hear the door open they may wait at the top of the step listen you _ be _ a lad say jellicoe wait in the dark for something to happen be always a try experience especially if as on this occasion silence be essential mike be tire after he journey and he have begin to doze when he be jerk back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the door handle the faintest rustle from psmith 's direction follow and a slight giggle succeed by a series of deep breath show that jellicoe too have hear the noise there be a creaking sound it be pitch-dark in the dormitory but mike could follow the invader ' movement as clearly as if it have be broad daylight they have open the door and be listen jellicoe 's breathing grow more asthmatic he be fling himself into he part with the wholeheartedness of the true artist the creak be follow by a sound of whispering then another creak the enemy have advance to the top step another creak the vanguard have reach the second step in another moment -- crash and at that point the proceedings may be say to have formally open a struggle mass bump against mike 's shin as he rise from he chair he empty he jug onto this mass and a yell of anguish show that the contents have get to the right address then a hand grab he ankle and he go down a million spark dancing before he eye as a fist fly out at a venture catch he on the nose mike have not be well disposed toward the invader before but now he run amok hit out right and left at random he right miss but he left go home hard on some portion of somebody 's anatomy a kick free he ankle and he stagger to he foot at the same moment a sudden increase in the general volume of noise speak eloquently of good work that be be put in by psmith even at that crisis mike could not help feeling that if a row of this caliber do not draw mr outwood from he bed he must be a unusual kind of housemaster he plunge forward again with outstretched arm and stumble and fall over one of the on-the-floor section of the oppose force they seize each other earnestly and roll across the room till mike contrive to secure he adversary 's head bump it on the floor with such abandon that with a muffle yell the other let go and for the second time he rise as he do so he be conscious of a curious thudding sound that make itself hear through the other assorted noise of the battle all this time the fight have go on in the blackest darkness but now a light shone on the proceedings interested occupant of other dormitory rouse from they slumber have come to observe the sport they have switch on the light and be crowd in the doorway by the light of this mike get a swift view of the theater of war the enemy appear to number five the warrior whose head mike have bump on the floor be robinson who be sit up feel he skull in a gingerly fashion to mike 's right almost touch he be stone in the direction of the door psmith wield in he right hand the cord of a dress gown be engage the remain three with a patient smile they be clothe in pajamas and appear to be feel the dressing-gown cord acutely the sudden light daze both side momentarily the defense be the first to recover mike with a swing upset stone and psmith have seize and empty jellicoe 's jug over spiller get to work again with the cord in a manner that rouse the utmost enthusiasm of the spectator agility seem to be the lead feature of psmith 's tactic he be everywhere -- on mike 's bed on he own on jellicoe 's -lrb- draw a passionate complaint from that noncombatant on whose face he inadvertently tread -rrb- on the floor -- he range the room sowing destruction the enemy be dishearten they have start with the idea that this be to be a surprise attack and it be disconcert to find the garrison arm at all point gradually they edge to the door and a final rush send they through hold the door for a second cry psmith and vanish mike be alone in the doorway it be a situation which exactly suit he frame of mind he stand alone in direct opposition to the community into which fate have pitchfork he so abruptly he like the feeling for the first time since he father have give he he view upon school report that morning in the easter holiday he feel satisfied with life he hope outnumber as he be that the enemy would come on again and not give the thing up in disgust he want more on a occasion like this there be rarely anything approach concerted action on the part of the aggressor when the attack come it be not a combined attack stone who be nearest to the door make a sudden dash forward and mike hit he under the chin stone draw back and there be another interval for rest and reflection it be interrupt by the reappearance of psmith who stroll back along the passage swing he dressing-gown cord as if it be some clouded cane sorry to keep you wait comrade jackson he say politely duty call I elsewhere with the kindly aid of a guide who know the lie of the land i have be make a short tour of the dormitory i have pour diver jugful of water over comrade spiller 's bed comrade robinson 's bed comrade stone 's -- spiller spiller these be harsh word where you pick they up i can not think -- not from I well well i suppose there must be a end to the pleasantest of function good night good night the door close behind mike and himself for ten minute shuffling and whispering go on in the corridor but nobody touch the handle then there be a sound of retreat footstep and silence reign on the follow morning there be a notice on the house board it run : indoor game _ dormitory raider be inform that in future neither mr psmith nor mr jackson will be at home to visitor this nuisance must now cease _ r psmith m jackson 7 adair on the same morning mike meet adair for the first time he be go across to school with psmith and jellicoe when a group of three come out of the gate of the house next door that be adair say jellicoe in the middle he voice have assume a tone almost of awe who be adair ask mike captain of cricket and lot of other thing mike could only see the celebrity 's back he have broad shoulder and wiry light hair almost white he walk well as if he be use to run altogether a fit-looking sort of man even mike 's jaundiced eye see that as a matter of fact adair deserve more than a casual glance he be that rare type the natural leader many boy and man if accident or the passage of time place they in a position where they be expect to lead can handle the job without disaster but that be a very different thing from be a bear leader adair be of the sort that come to the top by sheer force of character and determination he be not naturally clever at work but he have go at it with a dogged resolution which have carry he up the school and land he high in the sixth as a cricketer he be almost entirely self-taught nature have give he a good eye and leave the thing at that adair 's doggedness have triumph over she failure to do she work thoroughly at the cost of more trouble than most people give to they life work he have make himself into a bowler he read the authority and watch first-class player and think the thing out on he own account and he divide the art of bowling into three section first and most important -- pitch second on the list -- break third -- pace he set himself to acquire pitch he acquire it bowl at he own pace and without any attempt at break he could now drop the ball on a envelope seven time out of ten break be a more uncertain quantity sometimes he could get it at the expense of pitch sometimes at the expense of pace some day he could get all three and then he be a uncommonly bad man to face on anything but a plumb wicket run he have acquire in a similar manner he have nothing approach style but he have twice win the mile and half mile at the sport off elegant runner who know all about stride and the correct timing of the sprint and all the rest of it briefly he be a worker he have heart a boy of adair 's type be always a force in a school in a big public school or six or seven hundred he influence be feel less but in a small school like sedleigh he be like a tidal wave sweep all before he there be two hundred boy at sedleigh and there be not one of they in all probability who have not directly or indirectly be influence by adair as a small boy he sphere be not large but the effect of he work begin to be apparent even then it be human nature to want to get something which somebody else obviously value very much and when it be observe by member of he form that adair be go to great trouble and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven or fifteen they naturally begin to think too that it be worth be in those team the consequence be that he form always play hard this make other form play hard and the net result be that when adair succeed to the captaincy of rugger and cricket in the same year sedleigh as mr down adair 's housemaster and the nearest approach to a cricket master that sedleigh possess have a fondness for say be a keen school as a whole it both work and play with energy all it want now be opportunity this adair be determine to give it he have that passionate fondness for he school which every boy be popularly suppose to have but which really be implant in about one in every thousand the average public-school boy _ like _ he school he hope it will lick bedford at rugger and malvern at cricket but he rather bet it will not he be sorry to leave and he like go back at the end of the holiday but as for any passionate deep-seated love of the place he would think it rather bad form than otherwise if anybody come up to he slap he on the back and cry come along jenkin my boy play up for the old school jenkin the dear old school the old place you love so he would feel seriously ill adair be the exception to adair sedleigh be almost a religion both he parent be dead he guardian with whom he spend the holiday be a man with neuralgia at one end of he and gout at the other and the only really pleasant time adair have have as far back as he could remember he owe to sedleigh the place have grow on he absorb he where mike violently transplant from wrykyn see only a wretched little hole not to be mention in the same breath with wrykyn adair dream of the future see a colossal establishment a public school among public school a lump of human radium shoot out blues and balliol scholar year after year without cease it would not be so till long after he be go and forget but he do not mind that he devotion to sedleigh be purely unselfish he do not want fame all he work for be that the school should grow and grow keener and better at game and more prosperous year by year till it should take its rank among _ the _ school and to be a old sedleighan should be a badge pass its owner everywhere he be captain of cricket and rugger say jellicoe impressively he be in the shooting eight he be win the mile and half mile two year run he would have box at aldershot last term only he sprain he wrist and he play fives jolly well sort of little tin god say mike take a violent dislike to adair from that moment mike 's actual acquaintance with this all-round man date from the dinner hour that day mike be walk to the house with psmith psmith be a little ruffle on account of a slight passage-of-arm he have have with he form master during morning school ` there be a p before the smith ' i say to he ` ah p smith i see ' reply the goat ` not peasmith ' i reply exercise wonderful self-restraint ` just psmith ' it take I ten minute to drive the thing into the man 's head and when i _ have _ drive it in he send I out of the room for look at he through my eyeglass comrade jackson i fear I we have fall among bad man i suspect that we be go to be much persecute by scoundrel both you chap play cricket i suppose they turn it be adair see he face to face mike be aware of a pair of very bright blue eye and a square jaw in any other place and mood he would have like adair at sight he prejudice however against all thing sedleighan be too much for he i do not he say shortly have not you _ ever _ play my little sister and i sometimes play with a soft ball at home adair look sharply at he a temper be evidently one of he numerous quality oh he say well perhaps you would not mind turn out this afternoon and see what you can do with a hard ball -- if you can manage without you little sister i should think the form at this place would be about on a level with hers but i do not happen to be play cricket as i think i tell you adair 's jaw grow squarer than ever mike be wear a gloomy scowl psmith join suavely in the dialogue my dear old comrade he say do not let we brawl over this matter this be a time for the honeyed word the kindly eye and the pleasant smile let I explain to comrade adair speak for comrade jackson and myself we should both be delight to join in the mimic warfare of we national game as you suggest only the fact be we happen to be the young archaeologist we give in we name last night when you be be carry back to the pavilion after you century against loamshire -- do you play loamshire -- we shall be grub in the hard ground for ruin abbey the old choice between pleasure and duty comrade adair a boy 's crossroads then you will not play no say mike archaeology say psmith with a deprecatory wave of the hand will brook no divide allegiance from she devotee adair turn and walk on scarcely have he go when another voice hail they with precisely the same question both you fellow be go to play cricket eh it be a master a short wiry little man with a sharp nose and a general resemblance both in manner and appearance to a excitable bullfinch i see adair speak to you i suppose you will both play i like every new boy to begin at once the more new blood we have the better we want keenness here we be above all a keen school i want every boy to be keen we be sir say psmith with fervor excellent on archaeology mr downing -- for it be no less a celebrity -- start as one who perceive a loathly caterpillar in he salad archaeology we give in we name to mr outwood last night sir archaeology be a passion with we sir when we hear that there be a society here we go singing about the house i call it a unnatural pursuit for boy say mr down vehemently i do not like it i tell you i do not like it it be not for I to interfere with one of my colleague on the staff but i tell you frankly that in my opinion it be a abominable waste of time for a boy it get he into idle loafing habit i never loaf sir say psmith i be not allude to you in particular i be refer to the principle of the thing a boy ought to be play cricket with other boy not wander at large about the country probably smoking and go into low public house a very wild lot sir i fear the archaeological society here sigh psmith shake he head if you choose to waste you time i suppose i can not hinder you but in my opinion it be foolery nothing else he stump off now _ he be _ cross say psmith look after he i be afraid we be get ourselves dislike here good job too at any rate comrade outwood love we let 's go on and see what sort of a lunch that large-hearted fossil fancier be go to give we 8 mike find occupation there be more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when mike find himself regret the attitude he have impose upon himself with regard to sedleighan cricket he begin to realize the eternal truth of the proverb about half a loaf and no bread in the first flush of he resentment against he new surroundings he have refuse to play cricket and now he positively ache for a game any sort of a game a inning for a kindergarten _ v _ the second eleven of a home of rest for centenarian would have soothe he there be time when the sun shone and he catch sight of white flannel on a green ground and hear the plonk of bat striking ball when he feel like rush to adair and shout i _ will _ be good i be in the wrykyn team three year and have a average of over fifty the last two season lead I to the nearest net and let I feel a bat in my hand again but every time he shrink from such a climb down it could not be do what make it worse be that he see after watch behind the net once or twice that sedleigh cricket be not the childish burlesque of the game which he have be rash enough to assume that it must be number do not make good cricket they only make the presence of good cricketer more likely by the law of average mike soon see that cricket be by no mean a unknown art at sedleigh adair to begin with be a very good bowler indeed he be not a burgess but burgess be the only wrykyn bowler whom in he three year ' experience of the school mike would have place above he he be a long way better than neville-smith and wyatt and milton and the other who have take wicket for wrykyn the batting be not so good but there be some quite capable man barne the head of outwood 's he who prefer not to interfere with stone and robinson be a mild rather timid-looking youth -- not unlike what mr outwood must have be as a boy -- but he know how to keep ball out of he wicket he be a good bat of the old plodding type stone and robinson themselves that swashbuckle pair who now treat mike and psmith with cold but consistent politeness be both fair batsman and stone be a good slow bowler there be other exponent of the game mostly in downing 's house altogether quite worthy colleague even for a man who have be a star at wrykyn \* \* \* \* \* one solitary overture mike make during that first fortnight he do not repeat the experiment it be on a Thursday afternoon after school the day be warm but freshen by a almost imperceptible breeze the air be full of the scent of the cut grass which lay in little heap behind the net this be the real cricket scent which call to one like the very voice of the game mike as he sit there watch could stand it no longer he go up to adair may i have a inning at this net he ask he be embarrassed and nervous and be try not to show it the natural result be that he manner be offensively abrupt adair be take off he pad after he inning he look up this net it may be observe be the first eleven net what he say mike repeat he request more abruptly this time from increase embarrassment this be the first eleven net say adair coldly go in after lodge over there over there be the end net where frenzied novice be bowl on a corrugated pitch to a red-haired youth with enormous foot who look as if he be take he first lesson at the game mike walk away without a word \* \* \* \* \* the archaeological society expedition even though they carry with they the privilege of listen to psmith 's view of life prove but a poor substitute for cricket psmith who have no counterattraction shout to he that he ought to be elsewhere seem to enjoy they hugely but mike almost cry sometimes from boredom it be not always possible to slip away from the throng for mr outwood evidently look upon they as among the very faithful and keep they by he side mike on these occasion be silent and jumpy he brow sickly o'er with the pale cast of care but psmith follow he leader with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son be show he round the garden psmith 's attitude toward archaeological research strike a new note in the history of that neglect science he be amiable but patronize he patronize fossil and he patronize ruin if he have be confront with the great pyramid he would have patronize that he seem to be consume by a thirst for knowledge that this be not altogether a genuine thirst be prove in the third expedition mr outwood and he band be peck away at the site of a old roman camp psmith approach mike have inspire confidence he say by the docility of we demeanor let we slip away and brood apart for awhile roman camp to be absolutely accurate give I the pip and i never want to see another putrid fossil in my life let we find some shady nook where a man may lie on he back for a bit mike over whom the proceedings connect with the roman camp have long since begin to shed a blue depression offer no opposition and they stroll away down the hill look back they see that the archaeologist be still hard at it they departure have pass unnoticed a fatiguing pursuit this grub for memento of the past say psmith and above all dash bad for the knee of the trousers mine be like some furrowed field it be a great grief to a man of refinement i can tell you comrade jackson ah this look a likely spot they have pass through a gate into the field beyond at the farther end there be a brook shaded by tree and run with a pleasant sound over pebble

and begin to explore the wood on the other side he have not go many yard when a dog emerge suddenly from the undergrowth and begin to bark vigorously at he mike like dog and on acquaintance they

dislike to mr downing mike be simply a unamiable loafer who do nothing for the school and apparently have none of the healthy instinct which should be implant in the healthy boy mr downing be rather strong on the healthy boy the two live in a state of simmer hostility punctuate at interval by crisis which usually result in lower borlock have to play some unskilled laborer in place of they star

out for little borlock against claythorpe the return match in the previous game he have score ninety-eight and there be a lob bowler in the claythorpe rank whom he be particularly anxious to meet again have to yield a sovereign to jellicoe -- why on earth do the man want all that -- mean that unless a carefully word letter to he brother bob at oxford have the desire effect he would be practically penniless for week in a gloomy frame of mind he sit down to write to bob who be play regularly for the varsity this season and only the previous week have make a century against sussex so might be expect to be in a sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful -lrb- which it may be state at once he do by return of post -rrb- mike be struggle with the opening sentence of this letter -- he be never a very ready writer -- when stone and robinson burst into the room mike put down he pen and get up he be in warlike mood and welcome the intrusion if stone and robinson want battle they should have it but the motive of the expedition be obviously friendly stone beam robinson be laugh you be a sportsman say robinson what do he give you ask stone they sit down robinson on the table stone in psmith 's deck chair mike 's heart warm to they the little disturbance in the dormitory be a thing of the past do with forget contemporary with julius caesar he feel that he stone and robinson must learn to know and appreciate one another there be as a matter of fact nothing much wrong with stone and robinson they be just ordinary ragger of the type find at every public school small and large they be absolutely free from brain they have a certain amount of muscle and a vast store of animal spirit they look on school life purely as a vehicle for rag the stone and robinson be the swashbuckler of the school world they go about loud and boisterous with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to other people 's feeling tread on the toe of they neighbor and shove he off the pavement and always with a eye wide open for any adventure as to the kind of adventure they be not particular so long as it promise excitement sometimes they go through they whole school career without accident more often they run up against a snag in the shape of some serious-minded and muscular person who object to have he toe trodden on and be shove off the pavement and then they usually sober down to the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest of the community one 's opinion of this type of youth vary accord to one 's point of view small boy whom they have occasion to kick either from pure high spirit or as a punishment for some slip from the narrow path which the ideal small boy should tread regard stone and robinson as bully of the genuine eric and st winifr 's brand master be rather afraid of they adair have a smoulder dislike for they they be useful at cricket but apt not to take sedleigh as seriously as he could have wish as for mike he now find they pleasant company and begin to get out the tea thing those fire brigade meeting say stone be a rag you can do what you like and you never get more than a hundred line do not you say mike i get Saturday afternoon what be wilson in too no he get a hundred line stone and robinson be quite concerned what a beastly swindle that be because you do not play cricket old downing let you do what you like if you join the fire brigade and play cricket ` we be above all a keen school ' quote stone do not you ever play i have play a bit say mike well why do not you have a shot we be not such flyer here if you know one end of a bat from the other you could get into some sort of a team be you at school anywhere before you come here i be at wrykyn why on earth do you leave ask stone be you sack no my father take I away wrykyn say robinson be you any relation of the jackson there -- jw and the other brother what well do not you play at all there yes say mike i do i be in the team three year and i should have be captain this year if i would stop on there be a profound and gratifying sensation stone gape and robinson nearly drop he teacup stone break the silence but i mean to say -- look here what i mean be why be not you play why do not you play now i do i play for a village near here place call lower borlock a man who play against wrykyn for the free forester captain they he ask I if i would like some game for they but why not for the school why should i it be much better fun for the village you do not get order about by adair for a start adair stick on side say stone enough for six agree robinson by jove say stone i have get a idea my word what a rag what be wrong now inquire mike politely why look here tomorrow 's mid-term service day it be nowhere near the middle of the term but they always have it in the fourth week there be chapel at half past nine till half past ten then the rest of the day 's a whole holiday there be always house match we be play downing 's why do not you play and let 's smash they by jove yes say robinson why do not you they be always stick on side because they have win the house cup three year run i say do you bat or bowl bat why robinson rock on the table why old downing fancy himself as a bowler you _ must _ play and knock the cover off he master do not play in house match surely this be not a real house match only a friendly downing always turn out on mid-term service day i say do play think of the rag but the team 's full say mike the list be not up yet we 'll nip across to barne 's study and make he alter it they dash out of the room from down the passage mike hear yell of _ barne _ the closing of a door and a murmur of excited conversation then footstep return down the passage barne appear on he face the look of one who have see vision i say he say be it true or be stone rot about wrykyn i mean yes i be in the team barne be a enthusiastic cricketer he study he _ wisden _ and he have a immense respect for wrykyn cricket be you the m jackson then who have a average of fifty-one point naught three last year yes barne 's manner become like that of a curate talk to a bishop i say he say then -- er -- will you play against downing 's tomorrow rather say mike thanks awfully have some tea 11 the match with downing 's it be the curious instinct which prompt most people to rub a thing in that make the lot of the average convert a unhappy one only the very self-controlled can refrain from improve the occasion and score off the convert most leap at the opportunity it be so in mike 's case mike be not a genuine convert but to mr down he have the outward aspect of one when you have be impress upon a noncricketing boy for nearly a month that -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- the school be above all a keen school -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- that all member of it should play cricket and -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- that by not play cricket he be ruin he chance in this world and imperil they in the next and when quite unexpectedly you come upon this boy dress in cricket flannel wear cricket boot and carry a cricket bag it seem only natural to assume that you have convert he that the seed of you eloquence have fall on fruitful soil and sprout mr down assume it he be walk to the field with adair and another member of he team when he come upon mike what he cry we jackson clothe in suit of mail and arm for the fray this be mr downing 's no 2 manner -- the playful this be indeed saul among the prophet why this sudden enthusiasm for a game which i understand that you despise be we opponent so reduce psmith who be with mike take charge of the affair with a languid grace which have madden hundred in its time and which never fail to ruffle mr downing we be above all sir he say a keen house drone be not welcome by we we be essentially versatile jackson the archaeologist of yesterday become the cricketer of today it be the right spirit sir say psmith earnestly i like to see it indeed smith you be not play yourself i notice you enthusiasm have bound in we house sir competition be fierce and the selection committee unfortunately pass I over \* \* \* \* \* there be a number of pitch dot about over the field for there be always a touch of the london park about it on mid-term service day adair as captain of cricket have naturally select the best for he own match it be a good wicket mike see as a matter of fact the wicket at sedleigh be nearly always good adair have infect the groundsman with some of he own keenness with the result that that once-leisurely official now find himself sometimes with a kind of mild surprise work really hard at the beginning of the previous season sedleigh have play a scratch team from a neighboring town on a wicket which except for the crease be absolutely undistinguishable from the surround turf and behind the pavilion after the match adair have speak certain home truth to the groundsman the latter 's reformation have date from that moment \* \* \* \* \* barne timidly jubilant come up to mike with the news that he have win the toss and the request that mike would go in first with he in story of the not really a duffer type where the nervous new boy who have be find cry in the change room over the photograph of he sister contrive to get a inning in a game nobody suspect that he be really a prodigy till he hit the bully 's first ball out of the ground for six with mike it be different there be no pity smile on adair 's face as he start he run preparatory to send down the first ball mike on the cricket field could not have look anything but a cricketer if he have turn out in a tweed suit and hobnail boot cricketer be write all over he -- in he walk in the way he take guard in he stand at the wicket adair start to bowl with the feeling that this be somebody who have more than a little knowledge of how to deal with good bowling and punish bad mike start cautiously he be more than usually anxious to make run today and he mean to take no risk till he could afford to do so he have see adair bowl at the net and he know that he be good the first over be a maiden six dangerous ball beautifully play the fieldsman change over the general interest have now settle on the match between outwood 's and downing 's the fact in mike 's case have go around the field and as several of the other game have not yet begin quite a large crowd have collect near the pavilion to watch mike 's masterly treatment of the opening over have impress the spectator and there be a popular desire to see how he would deal with mr downing 's slow it be generally anticipate that he would do something special with they off the first ball of the master 's over a leg-bye be run mike take guard mr downing be a bowler with a style of he own he take two short step two long step give a jump take three more short step and end with a combination of step and jump during which the ball emerge from behind he back and start on its slow career to the wicket the whole business have some of the dignity of the old-fashioned minuet subtly blended with the careless vigor of a cakewalk the ball when deliver be bill to break from leg but the program be subject to alteration if the spectator have expect mike to begin any firework effect with the first ball they be disappoint he play the over through with a grace worthy of he brother joe the last ball he turn to leg for a single he treatment of adair 's next over be freer he have get a sight of the ball now halfway through the over a beautiful square cut force a passage through the crowd by the pavilion and dash up against the rail he drive the sixth ball past cover for three the crowd be now reluctantly disperse to its own game but it stop as mr down start he minuet-cakewalk in the hope that it might see something more sensational this time the hope be fulfil the ball be well up slow and off the wicket on the on-side perhaps if it have be allow to pitch it might have break in and become quite dangerous mike go out at it and hit it a couple of foot from the ground the ball drop with a thud and a spurting of dust in the road that run along one side of the cricket field it be return on the installment system by helper from other game and the bowler begin he maneuver again a half volley this time mike slam it back and mid on whose heart be obviously not in the thing fail to stop it get to they jenkin say mr down irritably as the ball come back from the boundary get to they sir please sir -- do not talk in the field jenkin have have a full pitch hit for six and a half volley for four there be a strong probability that mr downing would pitch he next ball short the expect happen the third ball be a slow long hop and hit the road at about the same spot where the first have land a howl of untuneful applause rise from the watcher in the pavilion and mike with the feeling that this sort of bowling be too good to be true wait in position for number four there be moment when a sort of panic seize a bowler this happen now with mr downing he suddenly abandon science and run amok he run lose its stateliness and increase its vigor he charge up to the wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes charge a gun he whole idea now be to bowl fast when a slow bowler start to bowl fast it be usually as well to be batting if you can manage it by the time the over be finish mike 's score have be increase by sixteen and the total of he side in addition by three wide and a shrill small voice from the neighborhood of the pavilion utter with painful distinctness the word take he off that be how the most sensational day 's cricket begin that sedleigh have know a description of the detail of the morning 's play would be monotonous it be enough to say that they run on much the same line as the third and fourth over of the match mr down bowl one more over off which mike help himself to sixteen run and then retire moodily to cover point where in adair 's fifth over he miss barne -- the first occasion since the game begin on which that mild batsman have attempt to score more than a single scare by this escape outwood 's captain shrink back into he shell sit on the splice like a limpet and offering no more chance be not out at lunchtime with a score of eleven mike have then make a hundred and three \* \* \* \* \* as mike be take off he pad in the pavilion adair come up why do you say you do not play cricket he ask abruptly when one have be bowl the whole morning and bowling well without the slightest success one be incline to be abrupt mike finish unfasten a obstinate strap then he look up i do not say anything of the kind i say i be not go to play here there be a difference as a matter of fact i be in the wrykyn team before i come here three year adair be silent for a moment will you play for we against the old sedleighan tomorrow he say at length mike toss he pad into he bag and get up no thanks there be a silence above it i suppose not a bit not up to it i shall want a lot of coaching at that end net of yours before i be fit to play for sedleigh there be another pause then you will not play asked adair i be not keep you be i say mike politely it be remarkable what a number of member of outwood 's house appear to cherish a personal grudge against mr down it have be that master 's somewhat injudicious practice for many year to treat he own house as a sort of choose people of all master the most unpopular be he who by the silent tribunal of a school be convict of favoritism and the dislike deepen if it be a house which he favor and not merely individual on occasion when boy in he own house and boy from other house be accomplice and partner in wrongdoing mr down distribute he thunderbolt unequally and the school notice it the result be that not only he himself but also -- which be rather unfair -- he house too have acquire a good deal of unpopularity the general consensus of opinion in outwood 's during the luncheon interval be that have get downing 's up a tree they would be fool not to make the most of the situation barne 's remark that he suppose unless anything happen and wicket begin to fall a bit faster they have better think of declare somewhere about half past three or four be meet with a storm of opposition declare say robinson great scot what on earth be you talk about declare stone 's voice be almost a wail of indignation i never see such a chump they 'll be rather sick if we do not will not they suggest barne sick i should think they would say stone that be just the gay idea can not you see that by a miracle we have get a chance of get a jolly good bit of we own back against those down 's tick what we have get to do be to jolly well keep they in the field all day if we can and be jolly glad it be so beastly hot if they lose about a dozen pound each through sweating about in the sun after jackson 's drive perhaps they 'll stick on less side about thing in general in future besides i want a inning against that bilge of old downing 's if i can get it so do i say robinson if you declare i swear i will not field nor will robinson rather not well i will not then say barne unhappily only you know they be rather sick already do not you worry about that say stone with a wide grin they 'll be a lot sicker before we have finish and so it come about that that particular mid-term service-day match make history big score have often be put up on mid-term service day game have frequently be one-sided but it have never happen before in the annals of the school that one side go in first early in the morning have neither complete its inning nor declare it close when stump be draw at 630 in no previous sedleigh match after a full day 's play have the pathetic word do not bat be write against the whole of one of the contend team these be the thing which mark epoch play be resume at 215 for a quarter of a hour mike be comparatively quiet adair fortify by food and rest be bowl really well and he first half dozen over have to be watch carefully but the wicket be too good to give he a chance and mike playing himself in again proceed to get to business once more bowler come and go adair pound away at one end with brief interval between the attack mr down take a couple more over in one of which a horse passing in the road nearly have its useful life cut suddenly short change bowler of various action and pace each weirder and more futile than the last try they luck but still the first-wicket stand continue the bowling of a house team be all head and no body the first pair probably have some idea of length and break the first-change pair be poor and the rest the small change be simply the sort of thing one see in dream after a heavy supper or when one be out without one 's gun time mercifully generally break up a big stand at cricket before the field have suffer too much and that be what happen now at four o'clock when the score stand at two hundred and twenty for no wicket barne greatly daring smote lustily at a rather wide half volley and be catch at short slip for thirty-three he retire blushfully to the pavilion amidst applause and stone come out as mike have then make a hundred and eighty-seven it be assume by the field that directly he have top he second century the closure would be apply and they ordeal finish there be almost a sigh of relief when frantic cheer from the crowd tell that the feat have be accomplish the fieldsman clap in quite a indulgent sort of way as who should say capital capital and now let 's start _ we _ inning some even begin to edge toward the pavilion but the next ball be bowl and the next over and the next after that and still barne make no sign -lrb- the conscience stricken captain of outwood 's be as a matter of fact be practically hold down by robinson and other ruffian by force -rrb- a gray dismay settle on the field the bowling have now become almost unbelievably bad lob be be try and stone nearly weep with pure joy be play a inning of the how-to-brighten-cricket type he have a unorthodox style but a excellent eye and the road at this period of the game become absolutely unsafe for pedestrian and traffic mike 's pace have become slower as be only natural but he score too be mount steadily this be foolery snapped mr downing as the three hundred and fifty go up on the board barne he call there be no reply a committee of three be at that moment engage in sit on barne 's head in the first eleven change room in order to correct a more than usually feverish attack of conscience barne please sir say stone some species of telepathy tell he what be detain he captain i think barne must have leave the field he have probably go over to the house to fetch something this be absurd you must declare you inning close the game have become a farce declare sir we can not unless barne do he might be awfully annoyed if we do anything like that without consult he absurd he be very touchy sir it be perfect foolery i think jenkin be just go to bowl sir mr down walk moodily to he place in a neat wooden frame in the senior day room at outwood 's just above the mantlepiece there be on view a week later a slip of paper the write on it be as follow : outwood 's _ v _ downing 's _ outwood 's first inning _ jp barne _ c _ hammond _ b _ hassall 33 m jackson not out 277 wj stone not out 124 extra 37 total -lrb- for one wicket -rrb- 471 downing 's do not bat 12 the singular behavior of jellicoe outwood 's rollick considerably that night mike if he have care to take the part could have be the petted hero but a cordial invitation from the senior day room to be the guest of the evening at about the biggest rag of the century have be refuse on the plea of fatigue one do not make two hundred and seventy-seven run on a hot day without feel the effect even if one have score mainly by the medium of boundary and mike as he lay back in psmith 's deck chair feel that all he want be to go to bed and stay there for a week he hand and arm burn as if they be red-hot and he eye be so tired that he could not keep they open psmith lean against the mantlepiece discourse in a desultory way on the day 's happening -- the score off mr down the undeniable annoyance of that batter bowler and the probability of he vent he annoyance on mike next day in theory say he the manly what-d'you-call-it of cricket and all that sort of thing ought to make he fall on you neck tomorrow and weep over you as a foeman worthy of he steel but i be prepare to bet a reasonable sum that he will give no jujitsu exhibition of this kind in fact from what i have see of we bright little friend i should say that in a small way he will do he best to make it distinctly hot for you here and there i do not care murmured mike shift he ache limb in the chair in a ordinary way i suppose a man can put up with have he bowling hit a little but you performance be cruelty to animal twenty-eight off one over not to mention three wide would have make job foam at the mouth you will probably get sack on the other hand it be worth it you have light a candle this day which can never be blow out you have show the lad of the village how comrade downing 's bowling ought to be treat i do not suppose he 'll ever take another wicket he do not deserve to psmith smooth he hair at the glass and turn round again the only blot on this day of mirth and goodwill be he say the singular conduct of we friend jellicoe when all the place be ring with song and merriment comrade jellicoe creep to my side and slip he little hand in mine touch I for three quid this interested mike tire as he be what three quid three crisp crackle quid he want four but the man must be live at the rate of i do not know what it be only yesterday that he borrow a quid from _ I _ he must be save money fast there appear to be the makings of a financier about comrade jellicoe well i hope when he be collect enough for he need he 'll pay I back a bit i be pretty well clean out i get some from my brother at oxford perhaps he be save up to get marry we may be help toward furnish the home there be a siamese prince fellow at my dame 's at eton who have four wife when he arrive and gather in a fifth during he first summer holiday it be do on the correspondence system he prime minister fix it up at the other end and send he the glad news on a picture post card i think a eye ought to be keep on comrade jellicoe \* \* \* \* \* mike tumble into bed that night like a log but he could not sleep he ache all over psmith chat for a time on human affair in general and then drop gently off jellicoe who appear to be wrap in gloom contribute nothing to the conversation after psmith have go to sleep mike lay for some time run over in he mind as the best substitute for sleep the various point of he inning that day he feel very hot and uncomfortable just as he be wonder whether it would not be a good idea to get up and have a cold bath a voice speak from the darkness at he side be you asleep jackson who be that I -- jellicoe i can not get to sleep nor can i i be stiff all over i 'll come over and sit on you bed there be a creaking and then a weight descend in the neighborhood of mike 's toe jellicoe be apparently not in conversational mood he utter no word for quite three minute at the end of which time he give a sound midway between a snort and a sigh i say jackson he say yes have you -- oh nothing silence again jackson hello i say what would you people say if you get sack all sort of thing especially my father why oh i do not know so would mine everybody 's would i expect yes the bed creak as jellicoe digest these great thought then he speak again it would be a jolly beastly thing to get sack mike be too tired to give he mind to the subject he be not really listen jellicoe drone on in a depressed sort of way you would get home in the middle of the afternoon i suppose and you would drive up to the house and the servant would open the door and you would go in they might all be out and then you would have to hang about and wait and presently you would hear they come in and you would go out into the passage and they would say ` hello ' jellicoe in order to give verisimilitude as it be to a otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative fling so much agitate surprise into the last word that it wake mike from a troubled doze into which he have fall hello he say what be up then you would say ` hello ' and then they would say ` what be you do here ' and you would say -- what on earth be you talk about about what would happen happen when when you get home after be sack you know who be be sack mike 's mind be still under a cloud nobody but if you be i mean and then i suppose there would be a awful row and general sickness and all that and then you would be send into a bank or to australia or something mike doze off again my father would be frightfully sick my mater would be sick my sister would be jolly sick too have you get any sister jackson i say jackson hello what be the matter who be that I -- jellicoe what be up i ask you if you would get any sister any _ what _ sister whose sister yours i ask if you would get any any what sister what about they the conversation be become too intricate for jellicoe he change the subject i say jackson well i say you do not know anyone who could lend I a pound do you what cry mike sit up in bed and stare through the darkness in the direction whence the numismatist 's voice be proceed do _ what _ i say look out you 'll wake psmith do you say you want someone to lend you a quid yes say jellicoe eagerly do you know anyone mike 's head throb this thing be too much the human brain could not be expect to cope with it here be a youth who have borrow a pound from one friend the day before and three pound from another friend that very afternoon already look about he for further loan be it a hobby or be he save up to buy a airplane what on earth do you want a pound for i do not want to tell anybody but it be jolly serious i shall get sack if i do not get it mike ponder those who have follow mike 's career as set forth by the present historian will have realize by this time that he be a good long way from be perfect as the blue-eyed hero he would have be a rank failure except on the cricket field where he be a natural genius he be just ordinary he resemble ninety percent of other member of english public school he have some virtue and a good many defect he be as obstinate as a mule though people whom he like could do as they please with he he be good-natured as a general thing but on occasion he temper could be of the worst and have in he childhood be the subject of much adverse comment among he aunt he be rigidly truthful where the issue concern only himself where it be a case of save a friend he be prepare to act in a manner reminiscent of a american expert witness he have in addition one good quality without any defect to balance it he be always ready to help people and when he set himself to do this he be never put off by discomfort or risk he go at the thing with a singleness of purpose that ask no question bob 's postal order which have arrive that evening be repose in the breast pocket of he coat it be a wrench but if the situation be so serious with jellicoe it have to be do two minute later the night be be make hideous by jellicoe 's almost tearful protestation of gratitude and the postal order have move from one side of the dormitory to the other 13 jellicoe go on the sick list mike wake next morning with a confused memory of have listen to a great deal of incoherent conversation from jellicoe and a painfully vivid recollection of hand over the bulk of he worldly wealth to he the thought depress he though it seem to please jellicoe for the latter carol in a gay undertone as he dress till psmith who have a sensitive ear ask as a favor that these farmyard imitation might cease until he be out of the room there be other thing to make mike low-spirited that morning to begin with he be in detention which in itself be enough to spoil a day it be a particularly fine day which make the matter worse in addition to this he have never feel stiffer in he life it seem to he that the creaking of he joint as he walk must be audible to everyone within a radius of several yard finally there be the interview with mr downing to come that would probably be unpleasant as psmith have say mr downing be the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble the great match have not be a ordinary match mr downing be a curious man in many way but he do not make a fuss on ordinary occasion when he bowling prove expensive yesterday 's performance however stand in a class by itself it stand forth without disguise as a deliberate rag one side do not keep another in the field the whole day in a one-day match except as a grisly kind of practical joke and mr downing and he house realize this the house 's way of signify its comprehension of the fact be to be cold and distant as far as the senior be concerned and abusive and pugnacious as regard the junior young blood have be shed overnight and more flow during the eleven-o ' - clock interval that morning to avenge the insult mr downing 's method of retaliation would have to be of necessity more elusive but mike do not doubt that in some way or other he form master would endeavor to get a bit of he own back as event turn out he be perfectly right when a master have get he knife into a boy especially a master who allow himself to be influence by he likes and dislike he be incline to single he out in time of stress and savage he as if he be the official representative of the evildoer just as at sea the skipper when he have trouble with the crew work it off on the boy mr downing be in a sarcastic mood when he meet mike that be to say he begin in a sarcastic strain but this sort of thing be difficult to keep up by the time he have reach he peroration the rapier have give place to the bludgeon for sarcasm to be effective the user of it must be meet halfway he hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm and move by it mike when master wax sarcastic toward he always assume a air of stolid stupidity which be as a suit of mail against satire so mr downing come down from the height with a run and begin to express himself with a simple strength which it do he form good to listen to veteran who have be in the form for term say afterward that there have be nothing to touch it in they experience of the orator since the glorious day when dunster that prince of ragger who have leave at christmas to go to a crammer 's have introduce three lively grass snake into the room during a latin lesson you be surround conclude mr down snap he pencil in two in he emotion by a impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and selfishness it do not occur to you to admit you capability as a cricketer in a open straightforward way and place they at the disposal of the school no that would not be dramatic enough for you it would be too commonplace altogether far too commonplace mr down laugh bitterly no you must conceal you capability you must act a lie you must -- who be that shuffling he foot i will not have it i _ will _ have silence -- you must hang back in order to make a more effective entrance like some wretched actor who -- i will _ not _ have this shuffling i have speak of this before macpherson be you shuffling you foot sir no sir please sir well parson i think it be the noise of the draft under the door sir instant departure of parson for the outer region and in the excitement of this side issue the speaker lose he inspiration and abruptly conclude he remark by put mike on to translate in cicero which mike who happen to have prepare the first half-page do with much success the old boy ' match be time to begin shortly after eleven o'clock during the interval most of the school walk across the field to look at the pitch one or two of the old boy have already change and be practice in front of the pavilion it be through one of these batsman that a accident occur which have a good deal of influence on mike 's affair mike have stroll out by himself halfway across the field jellicoe join he jellicoe be cheerful and rather embarrassingly grateful he be just in the middle of he harangue when the accident happen to they leave as they cross the field a long youth with the faint beginning of a moustache and a blazer that light up the surround landscape like a glowing beacon be lash out recklessly at a friend 's bowling already he have go within a ace of slaying a small boy as mike and jellicoe proceed on they way there be a shout of head the almost universal habit of batsman of shout head at whatever height from the ground the ball may be be not a little confuse the average person on hear the shout put he hand over he skull crouch down and trust to luck this be a excellent plan if the ball be fall but be not much protection against a skim drive along the ground when head be call on the present occasion mike and jellicoe instantly assume the crouching attitude jellicoe be the first to abandon it he utter a yell and spring into the air after which he sit down and begin to nurse he ankle the bright-blazered youth walk up awfully sorry you know hurt jellicoe be press the injured spot tenderly with he fingertip utter sharp howl whenever zeal outrun discretion he prod himself too energetically silly ass dunster he groan slam about like that awfully sorry but i do yell it be swell up rather say mike you would better get over to the house and have it look at can you walk jellicoe try but sit down again with a loud ow at that moment the bell ring i shall have to be go in say mike or i would have help you over i 'll give you a hand say dunster he help the sufferer to he foot and they stagger off together jellicoe hop dunster advance with a sort of polka step mike watch they start and then turn to go in 14 mike receive a commission there be only one thing to be say in favor of detention on a fine summer 's afternoon and that be that it be very pleasant to come out of the sun never seem so bright or the turf so green as during the first five minute after one have come out of the detention room one feel as if one be enter a new and very delightful world there be also a touch of the rip van winkle feeling everything seem to have go on and leave one behind mike as he walk to the cricket field feel very much behind the time arrive on the field he find the old boy batting he stop and watch a over of adair 's the fifth ball bowl a man mike make he way toward the pavilion before he get there he hear he name call and turn find psmith seat under a tree with the bright-blazered dunster return of the exile say psmith a joyful occasion tinge with melancholy have a cherry -- take one or two these little act of unremembered kindness be what one need after a couple of hour in extra pupil room restore you tissue comrade jackson and when you have finish those apply again be you name jackson inquire dunster because jellicoe want to see you alas poor jellicoe say psmith he be now prone on he bed in the dormitory -- there a sheer hulk lie poor tom jellicoe the darling of the crew faithful below he do he duty but comrade dunster have broach he to i have just be hear the melancholy detail old smith and i say dunster be at prep school together i would no idea i should find he here it be a wonderfully stir sight when we meet say psmith not unlike the meeting of ulyss and the hound argo of whom you have doubtless read in the course of you dabbling in the classic i be ulyss dunster give a lifelike representation of the faithful dawg you still jaw as much as ever i notice say the animal delineator fondle the beginning of he moustache more sigh psmith more be anything irritating you he add eye the other 's maneuver with interest you need not be a funny ass man say dunster pained heap of people tell I i ought to have it wax what it really want be top-dress with guano hello another man out adair 's bowling better today than he do yesterday i hear about yesterday say dunster it must have be a rag could not we work off some other rag on somebody before i go i shall be stop here till Monday in the village well hit sir -- adair 's bowling be perfectly simple if you go out to it comrade dunster go out to it first ball say psmith to mike oh chuck it man the sun be in my eye i hear adair 's get a match on with the mcc at last have he say psmith i have not hear archaeology claim so much of my time that i have little leisure for listen to cricket chitchat what be it jellicoe want ask mike be it anything important he seem to think so -- he keep tell I to tell you to go and see he i fear comrade jellicoe be a bit of a weak-minded blitherer -- do you ever hear of a rag we work off on jellicoe once ask dunster the man have absolutely no sense of humor -- can not see when he be be rot well it be like this -- hello we be all out -- i shall have to be go out to field again i suppose dash it i 'll tell you when i see you again i shall count the minute say psmith mike stretch himself the sun be very soothing after he two hour in the detention room he feel disincline for exertion i do not suppose it be anything special about jellicoe do you he say i mean it 'll keep till teatime it be no catch have to sweat across to the house now do not dream of move say psmith i have several rather profound observation on life to make and i can not make they without a audience soliloquy be a knack hamlet have get it but probably only after year of patient practice personally i need someone to listen when i talk i like to feel that i be do good you stay where you be -- do not interrupt too much mike tilted he hat over he eye and abandon jellicoe it be not until the lock-up bell ring that he remember he he go over to the house and make he way to the dormitory where he find the injured one in a parlous state not so much physical as mental the doctor have see he ankle and report that it would be on the active list in a couple of day it be jellicoe 's mind that need attention now mike find he in a condition border on collapse i say you might have come before say jellicoe what be up i do not know there be such a hurry about it -- what do you want it be no good now say jellicoe gloomily it be too late i shall get sack what on earth be you talk about what be the row it be about that money what about it i have to pay it to a man today or he say he would write to the head -- then of course i should get sack i be go to take the money to he this afternoon only i get crock so i could not move i want to get hold of you to ask you to take it for I -- it be too late now mike 's face fall oh hang it he say i be awfully sorry i would no idea it be anything like that -- what a fool i be dunster do say he think it be something important only like a ass i think it would do if i come over at lockup it do not matter say jellicoe miserably it can not be help yes it can say mike i know what i 'll do -- it be all right i 'll get out of the house after lights-out jellicoe sit up you can not you would get sack if you be catch who would catch I there be a chap at wrykyn i know who use to break out every night nearly and go and pot at cat with a air pistol it be as easy as anything the toad-under-the-harrow expression begin to fade from jellicoe 's face i say do you think you could really of course i can it 'll be rather a rag i say it be frightfully decent of you what absolute rot but look here be you certain -- i shall be all right where do you want I to go it be a place about a mile or two from here call lower borlock lower borlock yes do you know it rather i have be play cricket for they all the term i say have you do you know a man call barley barley rather -- he run the white boar he be the chap i owe the money to old barley mike know the landlord of the white boar well he be the wag of the village team every village team for some mysterious reason have its comic man in the lower borlock eleven mr barley fill the post he be a large stout man with a red and cheerful face who look exactly like the jovial innkeeper of melodrama he be the last man mike would have expect to do the money by monday-week or i write to the headmaster business but he reflect that he have only see he in he leisure moment when he might naturally be expect to unbend and be full of the milk of human kindness probably in business hour he be quite different after all pleasure be one thing and business another besides five pound be a large sum of money and if jellicoe owe it there be nothing strange in mr barley 's do everything he could to recover it he wonder a little what jellicoe could have be do to run up a bill as big as that but it do not occur to he to ask which be unfortunate as it might have save he a good deal of inconvenience it seem to he that it be none of he business to inquire into jellicoe 's private affair he take the envelope contain the money without question i shall bike there i think he say if i can get into the shed the school 's bicycle be store in a shed by the pavilion you can manage that say jellicoe it be lock up at night but i have a key make to fit it last summer because i use to get out in the early morning sometimes before it be open get it on you smith 's get it i 'll get it from he i say well do not tell smith why you want it will you i do not want anybody to know -- if a thing once start get about it be all over the place in no time all right i will not tell he i say thanks most awfully i do not know what i should have do i -- oh chuck it say mike 15 and fulfil it mike start on he ride to lower borlock with mixed feeling it be pleasant to be out on a fine night in summer but the pleasure be to a certain extent modify when one feel that to be detect will mean expulsion mike do not want to be expel for many reason now that he have grow use to the place he be enjoy himself at sedleigh to a certain extent he still harbor a feeling of resentment against the school in general and adair in particular but it be pleasant in outwood 's now that he have get to know some of the member of the house and he like play cricket for lower borlock also he be fairly certain that he father would not let he go to cambridge if he be expel from sedleigh mr jackson be easygoing with he family but occasionally he foot come down like a steam hammer as witness the wrykyn school-report affair so mike pedal along rapidly be wishful to get the job do without delay psmith have yield up the key but he inquiry as to why it be need have be embarrassing mike 's statement that he want to get up early and have a ride have be receive by psmith with whom early rise be not a hobby with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on the subject one of the george say psmith i forget which once say that a certain number of hour ' sleep a day -- i can not recall for the moment how many -- make a man something which for the time be have slip my memory however there you be i have give you the main idea of the thing and a german doctor say that early rising cause insanity still if you be bent on it after which he have hand over the key mike wish he could have take psmith into he confidence probably he would have volunteer to come too mike would have be glad of a companion it do not take he long to reach lower borlock the white boar stand at the far end of the village by the cricket field he ride past the church -- stand out black and mysterious against the light sky -- and the row of silent cottage until he come to the inn the place be shut of course and all the light be out -- it be sometime past eleven the advantage a inn have over a private house from the point of view of the person who want to get into it when it have be lock up be that a nocturnal visit be not so unexpected in the case of the former preparation have be make to meet such a emergency where with a private house you would probably have to wander around heave rock and end by climb up a waterspout when you want to get into a inn you simply ring the night bell which communicate with the boot ' room have that hard-worked menial up and do in no time after mike have wait for a few minute there be a rattle of chain and a shooting of bolt and the door open yes sir say the boot appear in he shirt sleeve why ` ello mr jackson sir mike be well know to all dweller in lower borlock he score be the chief topic of conversation when the day 's labor be over i want to see mr barley jack he be bin ' in bed this half hour back mr jackson i must see he can you get he down the boot look doubtful roust the guv ` nor outer bed he say mike quite admit the gravity of the task the landlord of the white boar be one of those man who need a beauty sleep i wish you would -- it be a thing that can not wait i have get some money to give to he oh if it be _ that _ say the boot five minute later mine host appear in person look more than usually portly in a check dress gown and red bedroom slipper you can pop off jack exit boot to he slumber once more well mr jackson what be it all about jellicoe ask I to come and bring you the money the money what money what he owe you the five pound of course the five -- mr barley stare openmouthe at mike for a moment then he break into a roar of laughter which shake the sport print on the wall and draw bark from dog in some distant part of the house he stagger about laugh and cough till mike begin to expect a fit of some kind then he collapse into a chair which creak under he and wipe he eye oh dear he say oh dear the five pound mike be not always abreast of the rustic idea of humor and now he feel particularly fog for the life of he he could not see what there be to amuse anyone so much in the fact that a person who owe five pound be ready to pay it back it be a occasion for rejoice perhaps but rather for a solemn thankful eyes-raised-to-heaven kind of rejoice what be up he ask five pound you might tell we the joke mr barley open the letter read it and have another attack when this be finish he hand the letter to mike who be wait patiently by hope for light and request he to read it dear dear chuckle mr barley five pound they may teach you young gentleman to talk latin and greek and what-not at you school but it ` ud do a lot more good if they would teach you how many bean make five it ` ud do a lot more good if they would teach you to come in when it rain it ` ud do mike be read the letter dear mr barley it run i send the # 5 which i could not get before i hope it be in time because i do not want you to write to the headmaster i be sorry jane and john eat you wife 's hat and the chicken and break the vase there be some more to the same effect it be sign tg jellicoe what on earth 's it all about say mike finish this curious document mr barley slap he leg why mr jellicoe keep two dog here i keep 'em for he till the young gentleman go home for they holiday aberdeen terrier they be and as sharp as mustard mischief i believe you but love we they do not do no harm bite up a old shoe sometimes and such sort of thing the other day last Wednesday it be about ` ar parse five jane -- she be the worst of the two always up to it she be -- she get hold of my old hat and have it in bit before you could say knife john upset a china vase in one of the bedroom chase a mouse and they get on the coffee-room table and eat half a cold chicken what have be leave there so i say to myself ` i 'll have a game with mr jellicoe over this ' and i sit down and write off say the little dog have eat a valuable hat and a chicken and what not and the damage 'll be five pound and will he kindly remit same by Saturday night at the latest or i write to he headmaster love we mr barley slap he thigh he take it all in every word -- and here be the five pound in cash in this envelope here i have not have such a laugh since we get old tom raxley out of bed at twelve of a winter 's night by tell he he house be afire it be not always easy to appreciate a joke of the practical order if one have be make even merely part victim of it mike as he reflect that he have be drag out of he house in the middle of the night in contravention of all school rule and discipline simply in order to satisfy mr barley 's sense of humor be more inclined to be abusive than mirthful run risk be all very well when they be necessary or if one choose to run they for one 's own amusement but to be place in a dangerous position a position imperil one 's chance of go to the ` varsity be another matter altogether but it be impossible to abuse the barley type of man barley 's enjoyment of the whole thing be so honest and childlike probably it have give he the happiest quarter of a hour he have know for year since in fact the affair of old tom raxley it would have be cruel to damp the man so mike laugh perfunctorily take back the envelope with the five pound accept a ginger beer and a plateful of biscuit and ride off on he return journey \* \* \* \* \* mention have be make above of the difference which exist between get into a inn after lockup and into a private house mike be to find this out for himself he first act on arrive at sedleigh be to replace he bicycle in the shed this he accomplish with success it be pitch-dark in the shed and as he wheel he machine in he foot touch something on the floor without wait to discover what this might be he lean he bicycle against the wall go out and lock the door after which he run across to outwood 's fortune have favor he undertaking by decree that a stout drainpipe should pass up the wall within a few inch of he and psmith 's study on the first day of term it may be remember he have wrench away the wooden bar which bisect the window frame thus render exit and entrance almost as simple as they have be for wyatt during mike 's first term at wrykyn he proceed to scale this water pipe he have get about halfway up when a voice from somewhere below cry who be that 16 pursuit these thing be life 's little difficulty one can never tell precisely how one will act in a sudden emergency the right thing for mike to have do at this crisis be to have ignore the voice carry on up the water pipe and through the study window and go to bed it be extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognize he at night against the dark background of the house the position then would have be that somebody in mr outwood 's house have be see break in after lights-out but it would have be very difficult for the authority to have narrow the search down any further than that there be thirty-four boy in outwood 's of whom about fourteen be much the same size and build as mike the suddenness however of the call cause mike to lose he head he make the strategic error of slide rapidly down the pipe and run there be two gate to mr outwood 's front garden the drive run in a semicircle of which the house be the center it be from the right-hand gate nearest to mr downing 's house that the voice have come and as mike come to the ground he see a stout figure gallop toward he from that direction he bolt like a rabbit for the other gate as he do so he pursuer again give tongue oo-oo-oo yer be the exact remark whereby mike recognize he as the school sergeant oo-oo-oo yer be that militant gentleman 's habitual way of begin a conversation with this knowledge mike feel easier in he mind sergeant collard be a man of many fine quality -lrb- notably a talent for what he be wont to call spott 'n a mysterious gift which he exercise on the rifle range -rrb- but he could not run there have be a time in he hot youth when he have sprint like a untame mustang in pursuit of volatile pathan in indian hill war but time increase he girth have take from he the taste for such exercise when he move now it be at a stately walk the fact that he run tonight show how the excitement of the chase have enter into he blood oo-oo-oo yer he shout again as mike pass through the gate turn into the road that lead to the school mike 's attentive ear note that the bright speech be a shade more puffily deliver this time he begin to feel that this be not such bad fun after all he would have like to be in bed but if that be out of the question this be certainly the next-best thing he run on take thing easily with the sergeant panting in he wake till he reach the entrance to the school grounds he dash in and take cover behind a tree presently the sergeant turn the corner go badly and evidently cure of a good deal of the fever of the chase mike hear he toil on for a few yard and then stop a sound of panting be bear to he then the sound of footstep return this time at a walk they pass the gate and go on down the road the pursuer have give the thing up mike wait for several minute behind he tree he program now be simple he would give sergeant collard about half a hour in case the latter take it into he head to guard home by wait at the gate then he would trot softly back shoot up the water pipe once more and so to bed it have just strike a quarter to something -- twelve he suppose -- on the school clock he would wait till a quarter past meanwhile there be nothing to be gain from lurk behind a tree he leave he cover and start to stroll in the direction of the pavilion have arrive there he sit on the step look out onto the cricket field he thought be mile away at wrykyn when he be recall to sedleigh by the sound of somebody run focus he gaze he see a dim figure move rapidly across the cricket field straight for he he first impression that he have be see and follow disappear as the runner instead of make for the pavilion turn aside and stop at the door of the bicycle shed like mike he be evidently possess of a key for mike hear it grate in the lock at this point he leave the pavilion and hail he fellow rambler by night in a cautious undertone the other appear startle who the dickens be that he ask be that you jackson mike recognize adair 's voice the last person he would have expect to meet at midnight obviously on the point of go for a bicycle ride what be you do out here jackson what be you if it come to that adair be adjust he front light i be go for the doctor one of the chap in we house be bad oh what be you do out here just be for a stroll have not you better be get back plenty of time i suppose you think you be do something tremendously brave and dash have not you better be go to the doctor if you want to know what i think -- i do not so long mike turn away whistle between he tooth after a moment 's pause adair ride off mike see he light pass across the field and through the gate the school clock strike the quarter it seem to mike that sergeant collard even if he have start to wait for he at the house would not keep up the vigil for more than half a hour he would be safe now in try for home again he walk in that direction now it happen that mr downing arouse from he first sleep by the news convey to he by adair that macphee one of the junior member of adair 's dormitory be groan and exhibit other symptom of acute illness be disturb in he mind most housemaster feel uneasy in the event of illness in they house and mr downing be apt to get jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasion all that be wrong with macphee as a matter of fact be a very fair stomachache the direct and legitimate result of eat six bun half a coconut three doughnut two ice a apple and a pound of cherry and wash the lot down with tea but mr downing see in he attack the beginning of some deadly scourge which would sweep through and decimate the house he have dispatch adair for the doctor and after spend a few minute prowl restlessly about he room be now stand at he front gate wait for adair 's return it come about therefore that mike sprint lightly in the direction of home and safety have he already shake nerve further maltreat by be hail at a range of about two yard with a cry of be that you adair the next moment mr down emerge from he gate mike stand not upon the order of he go he be off like a arrow -- a fly figure of guilt mr down after the first surprise seem to grasp the situation ejaculate at interval the word who be that stop who be that stop he dash after the much-enduring wrykynian at a extremely creditable rate of speed mr downing be by way of be a sprinter he have win handicap event at college sport at oxford and if mike have not get such a good start the race might have be over in the first fifty yard as it be that victim of fate go well keep ahead at the entrance to the school grounds he lead by a dozen yard the procession pass into the field mike head as before for the pavilion as they race across the soft turf a idea occur to mike which he be accustom in after year to attribute to genius the one flash of it which have ever illumine he life it be this one of mr downing 's first act on start the fire brigade at sedleigh have be to institute a alarm bell it have be rub into the school officially -- in speech from the dais -- by the headmaster and unofficially -- in earnest private conversation -- by mr downing that at the sound of this bell at whatever hour of day or night every member of the school must leave he house in the quickest possible way and make for the open the bell might mean that the school be on fire or it might mean that one of the house be on fire in any case the school have its order -- to get out into the open at once nor must it be suppose that the school be without practice at this feat every now and then a notice would be find post up on the board to the effect that there would be fire drill during the dinner hour that day sometimes the performance be bright and interesting as on the occasion when mr down marshal the brigade at he front gate have say my house be suppose to be on fire now let 's do a record which the brigade head by stone and robinson obligingly do they fasten the hose to the hydrant smash a window on the ground floor -lrb- mr downing have retire for a moment to talk with the headmaster -rrb- and pour a stream of water into the room when mr downing be at liberty to turn he attention to the matter he find that the room select be he private study most of the light furniture of which be float in a miniature lake that episode have rather discourage he passion for realism and fire drill since then have take the form for the most part of practice escape this be do by means of canvas chute keep in the dormitory at the sound of the bell the prefect of the dormitory would heave one end of the chute out of the window the other end be fasten to the sill he would then go down it himself use he elbow as a brake then the second man would follow he example and these two standing below would hold the end of the chute so that the rest of the dormitory could fly rapidly down it without injury except to they digestion after the first novelty of the thing have wear off the school have take a rooted dislike to fire drill it be a matter for self-congratulation among they that mr downing have never be able to induce the headmaster to allow the alarm bell to be sound for fire drill at night the headmaster a man who have he view on the amount of sleep necessary for the grow boy have draw the line at night operation sufficient unto the day have be the gist of he reply if the alarm bell be to ring at night when there be no fire the school might mistake a genuine alarm of fire for a bogus one and refuse to hurry themselves so mr downing have have to be content with day drill the alarm bell hang in the archway lead into the school grounds the end of the rope when not in use be fasten to a hook halfway up the wall mike as he race over the cricket field make up he mind in a flash that he only chance of get out of this tangle be to shake he pursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable he to get to the rope and tug it then the school would come out he would mix with they and in the subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed the task be easier than it would have seem at the beginning of the chase mr down owe to the two fact that he be not in the strictest training and that it be only a bannister who can run for any length of time at top speed shout who be that stop who be that stop be begin to feel distressed there be bellows to mend in the down camp mike perceive this and force the pace he round the pavilion ten yard to the good then head for the gate he put all he know into one last sprint mr downing be not equal to the effort he work gamely for a few stride then fall behind when mike reach the gate a good forty yard separate they as far as mike could judge -- he be not in a condition to make nice calculation -- he have about four seconds in which to get busy with that bell rope probably nobody have ever cram more energetic work into four seconds than he do then the night be as still as only a english summer night can be and the first clang of the clapper sound like a million iron girder fall from a height onto a sheet of tin he tug away furiously with a eye on the now rapidly advance and loudly shout figure of the housemaster and from the darkened house beyond there come a gradually swell hum as if a vast hive of bee have be disturb the school be awake 17 the decoration of sammy psmith lean against the mantelpiece in the senior day room at outwood 's -- since mike 's inning against down 's the lose lamb have be receive as brother by the center of disorder so that even spiller be compel to look on the hatchet as bury -- and give he view on the event of the precede night or rather of that morning for it be nearer one than twelve when peace have once more fall on the school nothing that happen in this loony bin say psmith have power to surprise I now there be a time when i might have think it a little unusual to have to leave the house through a canvas chute at one o'clock in the morning but i suppose it be quite the regular thing here old school tradition etc man leave the school and find that they have get so accustomed to jump out of window that they look on it as a sort of affectation to go out by the door i suppose none of you merchant can give I any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind be likely to take place i wonder who ring that bell say stone jolly sport idea i believe it be down himself if it be i hope he be satisfied jellicoe who be appear in society support by a stick look meaningly at mike and giggle receive in answer a stony stare mike have inform jellicoe of the detail of he interview with mr barley at the white boar and jellicoe after a momentary splutter of wrath against the practical joker be now in a particular lighthearted mood he hobble about giggle at nothing and at peace with all the world it be a stir scene say psmith the agility with which comrade jellicoe boost himself down the chute be a triumph of mind over matter he seem to forget he ankle it be the nearest thing to a boneless acrobatic wonder that i have ever see i be in a beastly funk i can tell you stone gurgle so be i he say for a bit then when i see that it be all a rag i begin to look about for way of do the thing really well i empty about six jug of water on a gang of kid under my window i rush into downing 's and ragged some of the bed say robinson it be a invigorating time say psmith a sort of pageant i be particularly strike with the way some of the bright lad catch hold of the idea there be no skimp some of the kid to my certain knowledge go down the chute a dozen time there be nothing like do a thing thoroughly i see they come down rush upstairs and be save again time after time the thing become chronic with they i should say comrade down ought to be satisfy with the high state of efficiency to which he have bring we at any rate i hope -- there be a sound of hurry footstep outside the door and sharpe a member of the senior day room burst excitedly in he seem amuse i say have you chap see sammy see who say stone sammy why you 'll know in a second he be just outside here sammy sammy sammy sam sam a bark and a patter of foot outside come on sammy good dog there be a moment 's silence then a great yell of laughter burst forth even psmith 's massive calm be shatter as for jellicoe he sob in a corner sammy 's beautiful white coat be almost entirely conceal by a thick covering of bright-red paint he head with the exception of the ear be untouched and he serious friendly eye seem to emphasise the weirdness of he appearance he stand in the doorway bark and wag he tail plainly puzzle at he reception he be a popular dog and be always well receive when he visit any of the house but he have never before meet with enthusiasm like this good old sammy what on earth 's be happen to he who do it sharpe the introducer have no view on the matter i find he outside down 's with a crowd round he everybody seem to have see he i wonder who on earth have go and muck he up like that mike be the first to show any sympathy for the maltreat animal poor old sammy he say kneel on the floor beside the victim and scratch he under the ear what a beastly shame it 'll take hour to wash all that off he and he 'll hate it it seem to I say psmith regard sammy dispassionately through he eyeglass that it be not a case for mere wash they 'll either have to skin he bodily or leave the thing to time time the great healer in a year or two he 'll fade to a delicate pink i do not see why you should not have a pink bull terrier it would lend a touch of distinction to the place crowd would come in excursion train to see he by charge a small fee you might make he self-supporting i think i 'll suggest it to comrade downing there 'll be a row about this say stone row be rather sport when you be not mix up in they say robinson philosophically there 'll be another if we do not start off for chapel soon it be a quarter to there be a general move mike be the last to leave the room as he be go jellicoe stop he jellicoe be stay in that Sunday owe to he ankle i say say jellicoe i just want to thank you again about that -- oh that be all right no but it really be awfully decent of you you might have get into a frightful row be you nearly catch jolly nearly it _ be _ you who ring the bell be not it yes it be but for goodness ' sake do not go gas about it or somebody will get to hear who ought not to and i shall be sack all right but i say you _ be _ a chap what be the matter now i mean about sammy you know it be a jolly good score off old downing he 'll be frightfully sick sammy cry mike my good man you do not think i do that do you what absolute rot i never touch the poor brute oh all right say jellicoe but i be not go to tell anyone of course what do you mean you _ be _ a chap giggle jellicoe mike walk to chapel rather thoughtfully 18 mr downing on the scent there be just one moment the moment in which on go down to the junior day room of he house to quell a unseemly disturbance he be boisterously greet by a vermilion bull terrier when mr downing be seize with a hideous fear lest he have lose he sens glare down at the crimson animal that be paw at he knee he clutch at he reason for one second as a drown man clutch at a life belt then the happy laughter of the young onlooker reassure he who -- he shout who have do this please sir we do not know shrill the chorus please sir he come in like that please sir we be sit here when he suddenly run in all red a voice from the crowd : look at old sammy the situation be impossible there be nothing to be do he could not find out by verbal inquiry who have paint the dog the possibility of sammy be paint red during the night have never occur to mr downing and now that the thing have happen he have no scheme of action as psmith would have say he have confuse the unusual with the impossible and the result be that he be take by surprise while he be ponder on this the situation be render still more difficult by sammy who take advantage of the door be open escape and rush into the road thus publish he condition to all and sundry you can hush up a paint dog while it confines itself to you own premise but once it have mix with the great public this become out of the question sammy 's state advance from a private trouble into a row mr downing 's next move be in the same direction that sammy have take only instead of run about the road he go straight to the headmaster the head who have have to leave he house in the small hour in he pajamas and a dress gown be not in the best of temper he have a cold in the head and also a rooted conviction that mr downing in spite of he strict order have ring the bell himself on the previous night in order to test the efficiency of the school in save themselves in the event of fire he receive the housemaster frostily but thaw as the latter related the event which have lead up to the ringing of the bell dear I he say deeply interested one of the boy at the school you think i be certain of it say mr downing be he wear a school cap he be barehead a boy who break out of he house at night would hardly run the risk of wear a distinguish cap no no i suppose not a big boy you say very big you do not see he face it be dark and he never look back -- he be in front of I all the time dear I there be another matter yes this boy whoever he be have do something before he ring the bell -- he have paint my dog sampson red the headmaster 's eye protrude from they socket he -- he -- _ what _ mr down he paint my dog red -- bright red mr downing be too angry to see anything humorous in the incident since the previous night he have be wound in he tenderest feeling he fire brigade system have be most shamefully abuse by be turn into a mere instrument in the hand of a malefactor for escape justice and he dog have be hold up to ridicule to all the world he do not want to smile he want revenge the headmaster on the other hand do want to smile it be not he dog he could look on the affair with a unbiased eye and to he there be something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly appear as a red dog it be a scandalous thing say mr down quite so quite so say the headmaster hastily i shall punish the boy who do it most severely i will speak to the school in the hall after chapel which he do but without result a cordial invitation to the criminal to come forward and be execute be receive in wooden silence by the school with the exception of johnson iii of outwood 's who suddenly remind of sammy 's appearance by the headmaster 's word break into a wild screech of laughter and be instantly award two hundred line the school file out of the hall to they various lunch and mr downing be leave with the conviction that if he want the criminal discover he would have to discover he for himself the great thing in affair of this kind be to get a good start and fate feeling perhaps that it have be a little hard upon mr downing give he a most magnificent start instead of have to hunt for a needle in a haystack he find himself in a moment in the position of be set to find it in a mere truss of straw it be mr outwood who help he sergeant collard have waylay the archaeological expert on he way to chapel and inform he that at close on twelve the night before he have observe a youth unidentified attempt to get into he house _ via _ the water pipe mr outwood whose thought be occupy with apse and plinth not to mention cromlech at the time thank the sergeant with absent mind politeness and pass on later he remember the fact apropo of some reflection on the subject of burglar in medieval england and pass it on to mr down as they walk back to lunch then the boy be in you house exclaim mr down not actually in as far as i understand i gather from the sergeant that he interrupt he before -- i mean he must have be one of the boy in you house but what be he do out at that hour he have break out impossible i think oh yes quite impossible i go around the dormitory as usual at eleven o'clock last night and all the boy be asleep -- all of they mr down be not listen he be in a state of suppress excitement and exultation which make it hard for he to attend to he colleague 's slow utterance he have a clue now that the search have narrow itself down to outwood 's house the rest be comparatively easy perhaps sergeant collard have actually recognize the boy on reflection he dismiss this as unlikely for the sergeant would scarcely have keep a thing like that to himself but he might very well have see more of he than he down have see it be only with a effort that he could keep himself from rush to the sergeant then and there and leave the house lunch to look after itself he resolve to go the moment that meal be at a end Sunday lunch at a public-school house be probably one of the longest function in existence it drag its slow length along like a languid snake but it finish in time in due course mr down after sit still and eye with acute dislike everybody who ask for a second help find himself at liberty regardless of the claim of digestion he rush forth on the trail sergeant collard live with he wife and a family of unknown dimension in the lodge at the school front gate dinner be just over when mr down arrive as a blind man could have tell the sergeant receive he visitor with dignity eject the family who be torpid after roast beef and resent have to move in order to ensure privacy have request he host to smoke which the latter be about to do unasked mr down state he case mr outwood he say tell I that last night sergeant you see a boy endeavor to enter he house the sergeant blow a cloud of smoke oo-oo-oo yer he say i do sir -- spotted ` im i do feeflee good at spottin ' i be sir dook of connaught he use to say '' ere come sergeant collard ' ' e use to say '' e 's feeflee good at spottin '' what do you do do oo-oo-oo i shout ` oo-oo-oo yer yer young monkey what yer doin ' there ' yes but ' e be off in a flash and i double after ` im prompt but you do not catch he no sir admit the sergeant reluctantly do you catch sight of he face sergeant no sir ' e be doublin ' away in the opposite direction do you notice anything at all about he appearance ' e be a long young chap sir with a pair of leg on he -- feeflee fast ' e run sir oo-oo-oo feeflee you notice nothing else ' e be not wear no cap of any sort sir ah bare'ead sir add the sergeant rub the point in it be undoubtedly the same boy undoubtedly i wish you could have catch a glimpse of he face sergeant so do i sir you would not be able to recognize he again if you see he you think oo-oo-oo would not go as far as to say that sir ` cos yer see i be feeflee good at spottin ' but it be a dark night mr downing rise to go well he say the search be now considerably narrow down considerably it be certain that the boy be one of the boy in mr outwood 's house young monkey interject the sergeant helpfully good afternoon sergeant good afternoon to you sir pray do not move sergeant the sergeant have not show the slightest inclination of do anything of the kind i will find my way out very hot today be it not feeflee warm sir weather 's goin ' to break ' workin ' up for thunder i hope not the school play the mcc on Wednesday and it would be a pity if rain be to spoil we first fixture with they good afternoon and mr downing go out into the baking sunlight while sergeant collard have request mr collard to take the child out for a walk at once and furthermore to give young ernie a clip side of the ` ead if he persist in make so much noise put a handkerchief over he face rest he foot on the table and sleep the sleep of the just 19 the sleuth-hound for the doctor watson of this world as oppose to the sherlock holmese success in the province of detective work must be to a very large extent the result of luck sherlock holme can extract a clue from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash but doctor watson have get to have it take out for he and dust and exhibit clearly with a label attach the average man be a doctor watson we be wont to scoff in a patronize manner at that humbler follower of the great investigator but as a matter of fact we should have be just as dull ourselves we should not even have rise to the modest level of a scotland yard bungler we should simply have hang around say : my dear holme how and all the rest of it just as the downtrodden medico do it be not often that the ordinary person have any need to see what he can do in the way of detection he get along very comfortably in the humdrum round of life without have to measure footprint and smile quiet tight-lipped smile but if ever the emergency do arise he think naturally of sherlock holme and he method mr downing have read all the holme story with great attention and have think many time what a incompetent ass doctor watson be but now that he have start to handle he own first case he be compel to admit that there be a good deal to be say in extenuation of watson 's inability to unravel tangle it certainly be uncommonly hard he think as he pace the cricket field after leave sergeant collard to detect anybody unless you know who have really do the crime as he brood over the case in hand he sympathy for doctor watson increase with every minute and he begin to feel a certain resentment against sir arthur conan doyle it be all very well for sir arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about trace a mystery to its source but he know perfectly well who have do the thing before he start now that he begin really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and the painting of sammy the conviction be creep over he that the problem be more difficult than a casual observer might imagine he have get as far as find that he quarry of the previous night be a boy in mr outwood 's house but how be he to get any further that be the thing there be of course only a limited number of boy in mr outwood 's house as tall as the one he have pursue but even if there have be only one other it would have complicate matter if you go to a boy and say either you or jone be out of you house last night at twelve o'clock the boy do not reply sir i can not tell a lie -- i be out of my house last night at twelve o'clock he simply assume the animated expression of a stuff fish and leave the next move to you it be practically stalemate all these thing pass through mr downing 's mind as he walk up and down the cricket field that afternoon what he want be a clue but it be so hard for the novice to tell what be a clue and what be not probably if he only know there be clue lie all over the place shout to he to pick they up what with the oppressive heat of the day and the fatigue of hard think mr downing be work up for a brainstorm when fate once more intervene this time in the shape of riglett a junior member of he house riglett slink up in the shamefaced way peculiar to some boy even when they have do nothing wrong and have cap mr down with the air of one who have be catch in the act of do something particularly shady request that he might be allow to fetch he bicycle from the shed you bicycle snap mr down much thinking have make he irritable what do you want with you bicycle riglett shuffle stand first on he left foot then on he right blush and finally remark as if it be not so much a sound reason as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly fact that he want he bicycle that he have get leave for tea that afternoon then mr down remembered riglett have a aunt resident about three mile from the school whom he be accustom to visit occasionally on Sunday afternoon during the term he feel for he bunch of key and make he way to the shed riglett shamble behind at a interval of two yard mr down unlock the door and there on the floor be the clue a clue that even doctor watson could not have overlook mr down see it but do not immediately recognize it for what it be what he see at first be not a clue but just a mess he have a tidy soul and abhor mess and this be a particularly messy mess the greater part of the flooring in the neighborhood of the door be a sea of red paint the tin from which it have flow be lie on its side in the middle of the shed the air be full of the pungent scent pah say mr downing then suddenly beneath the disguise of the mess he see the clue a footmark no less a crimson footmark on the gray concrete riglett who have be wait patiently two yard away now cough plaintively the sound recall mr down to mundane matter get you bicycle riglett he say and be careful where you tread somebody have upset a pot of paint on the floor riglett walk delicately through dry place extract he bicycle from the rack and presently depart to gladden the heart of he aunt leave mr down he brain fizz with the enthusiasm of the detective to lock the door and resume he perambulation of the cricket field give doctor watson a fair start and he be a demon at the game mr downing 's brain be now work with a rapidity and clearness which a professional sleuth might have envy paint red paint obviously the same paint with which sammy have be decorate a footmark whose footmark plainly that of the criminal who have do the deed of decoration yoick there be two thing however to be consider you careful detective must consider everything in the first place the paint might have be upset by the groundsman it be the groundsman 's paint he have be give a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the pavilion score box at the conclusion of yesterday 's match -lrb- a labor of love which be the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which adair have instil into he -rrb- in that case the footmark might be he _ note one _ : interview the groundsman on this point in the second place adair might have upset the tin and trodden in its contents when he go to get he bicycle in order to fetch the doctor for the suffering macphee this be the more probable of the two contingency for it would have be dark in the shed when adair go into it _ note two _ : interview adair as to whether he find on return to the house that there be paint on he shoe thing be move \* \* \* \* \* he resolve to take adair first he could get the groundsman 's address from he pass by the tree under whose shade mike and psmith and dunster have watch the match on the previous day he come upon the head of he house in a deck chair read a book a summer Sunday afternoon be the time for reading in deck chair oh adair he say no do not get up i merely wish to ask you if you find any paint on you shoe when you return to the house last night paint sir adair be plainly puzzle he book have be interesting and have drive the sammy incident out of he head i see somebody have spill some paint on the floor of the bicycle shed you do not do that i suppose when you go to fetch you bicycle no sir it be spill all over the floor i wonder whether you have happen to tread in it but you say you find no paint on you shoe this morning no sir my bicycle be always quite near the door of the shed i do not go into the shed at all i see quite so thank you adair oh by the way adair where do markby live i forget the name of he cottage sir but i could show you in a second it be one of those cottage just past the school gate on the right as you turn out into the road there be three in a row he be the first you come to there be a barn just before you get to they thank you i shall be able to find they i should like to speak to markby for a moment on a small matter a sharp walk take he to the cottage adair have mention he rap at the door of the first and the groundsman come out in he shirt sleeve blinking as if he have just wake up as be indeed the case oh markby sir you remember that you be paint the score box in the pavilion last night after the match yes sir it want a lick of paint bad the young gentleman will scramble about and get through the window make it look shabby sir so i think i would better give it a coating so as to look shipshape when the marylebone come down just so a excellent idea tell I markby what do you do with the pot of paint when you have finish put it in the bicycle shed sir on the floor on the floor sir no on the shelf at the far end with the can of whitening what i use for mark out the wicket sir of course yes quite so just as i think do you want it sir no thank you markby no thank you the fact be somebody who have no business to do so have move the pot of paint from the shelf to the floor with the result that it have be kick over and spill you have better get some more tomorrow thank you markby that be all i wish to know mr downing walk back to the school thoroughly excite he be hot on the scent now the only other possible theory have be test and successfully explode the thing have become simple to a degree all he have to do be to go to mr outwood 's house -- the idea of search a fellow master 's house do not appear to he at all a delicate task somehow one grow unconsciously to feel that mr outwood do not really exist as a man capable of resent liberty -- find the paint-splashed shoe ascertain its owner and denounce he to the headmaster there could be no doubt that a paint-splashed shoe must be in mr outwood 's house somewhere a boy can not tread in a pool of paint without show some sign of have do so it be Sunday too so that the shoe would not yet have be clean yoick also tally-ho this really be begin to be something like business regardless of the heat the sleuth-hound hurry across to outwood 's as fast as he could walk 20 a check the only two member of the house not out in the grounds when he arrive be mike and psmith they be stand on the gravel drive in front of the boy ' entrance mike have a deck chair in one hand and a book in the other psmith -- for even the greatest mind will sometimes unbend -- be wrestle with a yo-yo that be to say he be try without success to keep the spool spin he smooth a crease out of he waistcoat and try again he have just succeed in get the thing to spin when mr down arrive the sound of he footstep disturbed psmith and bring the effort to nothing enough of this spoolery say he fling the spool through the open window of the senior day room i be a ass ever to try it the philosophical mind need complete repose in its hour of leisure hello he stare after the sleuth-hound who have just enter the house what the dickens say mike do he mean by barge in as if he would buy the place comrade down look pleased with himself what bring he around in this direction i wonder still no matter the few article which he may sneak from we study be of inconsiderable value he be welcome to they do you feel inclined to wait awhile till i have fetch a chair and book i 'll be go on i shall be under the tree at the far end of the ground ` tis well i will be with you in about two tick mike walk on toward the field and psmith stroll upstairs to fetch he novel find mr down standing in the passage with the air of one who have lose he bearing a warm afternoon sir murmur psmith courteously as he pass er -- smith sir i -- er -- wish to go round the dormitory it be psmith 's guide rule in life never to be surprise at anything so he merely incline he head gracefully and say nothing i should be glad if you would fetch the key and show I where the room be with acute pleasure sir say psmith or shall i fetch mr outwood sir do as i tell you smith snapped mr down psmith say no more but go down to the matron 's room the matron be out he abstract the bunch of key from she table and rejoin the master shall i lead the way sir he ask mr down nod here sir say psmith open the door we have barne 's dormitory a airy room construct on the soundest hygienic principle each boy i understand have quite a considerable number of cubic foot of air all to himself it be mr outwood 's boast that no boy have ever ask for a cubic foot of air in vain he argue justly -- he break off abruptly and begin to watch the other 's maneuver in silence mr downing be peer rapidly beneath each bed in turn be you look for barne sir inquire psmith politely i think he be out in the field mr downing rise have examine the last bed crimson in the face with the exercise show I the next dormitory smith he say panting slightly this say psmith open the next door and sink he voice to a awed whisper be where _ i _ sleep mr down glance swiftly beneath the three bed excuse I sir say psmith but be we chase anything be good enough smith say mr down with asperity to keep you remark to yourself i be only wonder sir shall i show you the next in order certainly they move on up the passage draw blank at the last dormitory mr down pause baffled psmith wait patiently by a idea strike the master the study smith he cry aha say psmith i beg you pardon sir the observation escape I unaware the frenzy of the chase be begin to enter into my blood here we have -- mr down stop short be this impertinence study smith ferguson 's study sir no sir that be farther down the passage this be barne 's mr downing look at he closely psmith 's face be wooden in its gravity the master snort suspiciously then move on whose be this he ask rap a door this sir be mine and jackson 's what have you a study you be low down in the school for it i think sir that mr outwood give it we rather as a testimonial to we general worth than to we proficiency in schoolwork mr down rake the room with a keen eye the absence of bar from the window attract he attention have you no bar to you window here such as there be in my house there appear to be no bar sir say psmith put up he eyeglass mr downing be lean out of the window a lovely view be it not sir say psmith the tree the field the distant hill mr downing suddenly start he eye have be catch by the water pipe at the side of the window the boy whom sergeant collard have see climb the pipe must have be make for this study he spin around and meet psmith 's blandly inquire gaze he look at psmith carefully for a moment no the boy he have chase last night have not be psmith that exquisite 's figure and general appearance be unmistakable even in the dusk whom do you say you share this study with smith jackson sir the cricketer never mind about he cricket smith say mr down with irritation no sir he be the only other occupant of the room yes sir nobody else come into it if they do they go out extremely quickly sir ah thank you smith not at all sir mr downing ponder jackson the boy bear he a grudge the boy be precisely the sort of boy to revenge himself by paint the dog sammy and gadzook the boy whom he have pursue last night have be just about jackson 's size and build mr downing be as firmly convince at that moment that mike 's have be the hand to wield the paintbrush as he have ever be of anything in he life smith he say excitedly on the spot sir say psmith affably where be jackson 's shoe there be moment when the giddy excitement of be right on the trail cause the amateur -lrb- or watsonian -rrb- detective to be incautious such a moment come to mr downing then if he have be wise he would have achieve he object the get a glimpse of mike 's shoe by a devious and snaky route as it be he rush straight on he shoe sir he have they on i notice they as he go out just now where be the pair he wear yesterday where be the shoe of yesteryear murmured psmith to himself i should say at a venture sir that they would be in the basket downstairs edmund we genial knife-and-boot boy collect they i believe at early dawn would they have be clean yet if i know edmund sir -- no smith say mr down tremble with excitement go and bring that basket to I here psmith 's brain be work rapidly as he go downstairs what exactly be at the back of the sleuth 's mind prompt these maneuver he do not know but that there be something and that that something be direct in a hostile manner against mike probably in connection with last night 's wild happening he be certain psmith have notice on leave he bed at the sound of the alarm bell that he and jellicoe be alone in the room that might mean that mike have go out through the door when the bell sound or it might mean that he have be out all the time it begin to look as if the latter solution be the correct one he stagger back with the basket painfully conscious all the while that it be crease he waistcoat and dump it down on the study floor mr down stooped eagerly over it psmith lean against the wall and straighten out the damage garment we have here sir he say a fair selection of we various booting mr downing look up you drop none of the shoe on you way up smith not one sir it be a fine performance mr down utter a grunt of satisfaction and bent once more to he task shoe fly about the room mr down knelt on the floor beside the basket and dig like a terrier at a rathole at last he make a dive and with a exclamation of triumph rise to he foot in he hand he hold a shoe put those back again smith he say the ex-etonian wear a expression such as a martyr might have worn on be tell off for the stake begin to pick up the scatter footgear whistle softly the tune of i do all the dirty work as he do so that be the lot sir he say rise ah now come across with I to the headmaster 's house leave the basket here you can carry it back when you return shall i put back that shoe sir certainly not i shall take this with I of course shall i carry it sir mr downing reflect yes smith he say i think it would be best it occur to he that the spectacle of a house master wander abroad on the public highway carry a dirty shoe might be a trifle undignified you never know whom you might meet on Sunday afternoon psmith take the shoe and do so understand what before have puzzle he across the toe of the shoe be a broad splash of red paint he know nothing of course of the upset tin in the bicycle shed but when a housemaster 's dog have be paint red in the night and when on the follow day the housemaster go about in search of a paint splash shoe one put two and two together psmith look at the name inside the shoe it be brown bootmaker bridgnorth bridgnorth be only a few mile from he own home and mike 's undoubtedly it be mike 's shoe can you tell I whose shoe that be ask mr down psmith look at it again no sir i can not say the little chap 's familiar to I come with I then mr down leave the room after a moment psmith follow he the headmaster be in he garden thither mr down make he way the shoe-bearing psmith in close attendance the head listen to the amateur detective 's statement with interest indeed he say when mr downing have finish indeed dear I it certainly seem it be a curiously well-connected thread of evidence you be certain that there be red paint on this shoe you discover in mr outwood 's house i have it with I i bring it on purpose to show to you smith sir you have the shoe ah say the headmaster put on a pair of pince-nez now let I look at -- this you say be the -- just so just so just but er mr down it may be that i have not examine this shoe with sufficient care but -- can _ you _ point out to I exactly where this paint be that you speak of mr downing stand stare at the shoe with a wild fixed stare of any suspicion of paint red or otherwise it be absolutely and entirely innocent 21 the destroyer of evidence the shoe become the center of attention the cynosure of all eye mr down fix it with the pierce stare of one who feel that he brain be totter the headmaster look at it with a mildly puzzle expression psmith put up he eyeglass gaze at it with a sort of affectionate interest as if he be wait for it to do a trick of some kind mr downing be the first to break the silence there be paint on this shoe he say vehemently i tell you there be a splash of red paint across the toe smith will bear I out in this smith you see the paint on this shoe paint sir what do you mean to tell I that you do _ not _ see it no sir there be no paint on this shoe this be foolery i see it with my own eye it be a broad splash right across the toe the headmaster interpose you must have make a mistake mr down there be certainly no trace of paint on this shoe these momentary optical delusion be i fancy not uncommon any doctor will tell you -- i have a aunt sir say psmith chattily who be remarkably subject -- it be absurd i can not have be mistake say mr downing i be positively certain the toe of this shoe be red when i find it it be undoubtedly black now mr down a sort of chameleon shoe murmur psmith the goad housemaster turn on he what do you say smith do i speak sir say psmith with the start of one come suddenly out of a trance mr downing look searchingly at he you have better be careful smith yes sir i strongly suspect you of have something to do with this really mr downing say the headmaster this be surely improbable smith could scarcely have clean the shoe on he way to my house on one occasion i inadvertently spill some paint on a shoe of my own i can assure you that it do not brush off it need a very systematic cleaning before all trace be remove exactly sir say psmith my theory if i may certainly smith psmith bow courteously and proceed my theory sir be that mr downing be deceive by the light-and-shade effect on the toe of the shoe the afternoon sun streaming in through the window must have shine on the shoe in such a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of redness if mr down recollect he do not look long at the shoe the picture on the retina of the eye consequently have not time to fade i remember think myself at the moment that the shoe appear to have a certain reddish tint the mistake bag say mr down shortly well really say the headmaster it seem to I that that be the only explanation that will square with the fact a shoe that be really smear with red paint do not become black of itself in the course of a few minute you be very right sir say psmith with benevolent approval may i go now sir i be in the middle of a singularly impressive passage of cicero 's speech _ de senectute _ i be sorry that you should leave you preparation till Sunday smith it be a habit of which i altogether disapprove i be read it sir say psmith with simple dignity for pleasure shall i take the shoe with I sir if mr downing do not want it the housemaster pass the fraudulent piece of evidence to psmith without a word and the latter have include both master in a kindly smile leave the garden pedestrian who have the good fortune to be pass along the road between the headmaster 's house and mr outwood 's at that moment see what if they have but know it be a most unusual sight the spectacle of psmith run psmith 's usual mode of progression be a dignified walk he believe in the contemplative style rather than the hustle on this occasion however reckless of possible injury to the crease of he trousers he race down the road and turn in at outwood 's gate bound upstairs like a highly train professional athlete on arrive at the study he first act be to remove a shoe from the top of the pile in the basket place it in the small cupboard under the bookshelf and lock the cupboard then he fling himself into a chair and pant brain he say to himself approvingly be what one chiefly need in matter of this kind without brain where be we in the soup every time the next development will be when comrade down think it over and be strike with the brilliant idea that it be just possible that the shoe he give I to carry and the shoe i do carry be not one shoe but two shoe meanwhile he drag up another chair for he foot and pick up he novel he have not be read long when there be a footstep in the passage and mr downing appear the possibility in fact the probability of psmith 's have substitute another shoe for the one with the incriminate splash of paint on it have occur to he almost immediately on leave the headmaster 's garden psmith and mike he reflect be friend psmith 's impulse would be to do all that lay in he power to shield mike feeling aggrieve with himself that he have not think of this before he too hurry over to outwood 's mr downing be brisk and peremptory i wish to look at these shoe again he say psmith with a sigh lay down he novel and rise to assist he sit down smith say the housemaster i can manage without you help psmith sit down again carefully tuck up the knee of he trousers and watch he with silent interest through he eyeglass the scrutiny irritated mr down put that thing away smith he say that thing sir yes that ridiculous glass put it away why sir why because i tell you to do so i guess that that be the reason sir sigh psmith replace the eyeglass in he waistcoat pocket he rest he elbow on he knee and he chin on he hand and resume he contemplative inspection of the shoe expert who after fidget for a few moment lodge another complaint do not sit there stare at I smith i be interested in what you be do sir never mind do not stare at I in that idiotic way may i read sir ask psmith patiently yes read if you like thank you sir psmith take up he book again and mr downing now thoroughly irritated pursue he investigation in the boot basket he go through it twice but each time without success after the second search he stand up and look wildly round the room he be as certain as he could be of anything that the miss piece of evidence be somewhere in the study it be no use ask psmith point-blank where it be for psmith 's ability to parry dangerous question with evasive answer be quite out of the common he eye roam about the room there be very little cover there even for so small a fugitive as a number nine shoe the floor could be acquit on sight of harbor the quarry then he catch sight of the cupboard and something seem to tell he that there be the place to look smith he say psmith have be read placidly all the while yes sir what be in this cupboard that cupboard sir yes this cupboard mr down rap the door irritably just a few odd trifle sir we do not often use it a ball of string perhaps possibly a old notebook nothing of value or interest open it i think you will find that it be lock sir unlock it but where be the key sir have you not get the key if the key be not in the lock sir you may depend upon it that it will take a long search to find it where do you see it last it be in the lock yesterday morning jackson might have take it where be jackson out in the field somewhere sir mr down thought for a moment i do not believe a word of it he say shortly i have my reason for think that you be deliberately keep the contents of that cupboard from I i shall break open the door psmith get up i be afraid you must not do that sir mr down stare amaze be you aware whom you be talk to smith he inquire icily yes sir and i know it be not mr outwood to whom that cupboard happen to belong if you wish to break it open you must get he permission he be the sole lessee and proprietor of that cupboard i be only the act manager mr down pause he also reflect mr outwood in the general rule do not count much in the scheme of thing but possibly there be limit to the treat of he as if he do not exist to enter he house without he permission and search it to a certain extent be all very well but when it come to break up he furniture perhaps on the other hand there be the maddening thought that if he leave the study in search of mr outwood in order to obtain he sanction for the house-breaking work which he propose to carry through smith would be alone in the room and he know that if smith be leave alone in the room he would instantly remove the shoe to some other hide place he thoroughly disbelieve the story of the lose key he be perfectly convince that the miss shoe be in the cupboard he stand chew these thought for a while psmith in the meantime standing in a graceful attitude in front of the cupboard stare into vacancy then he be seize with a happy idea why should he leave the room at all if he send smith then he himself could wait and make certain that the cupboard be not tamper with smith he say go and find mr outwood and ask he to be good enough to come here for a moment 22 mainly about shoe be quick smith he say as the latter stand look at he without make any movement in the direction of the door _ quick _ sir say psmith meditatively as if he have be ask a conundrum go and find mr outwood at once psmith still make no move do you intend to disobey I smith mr downing 's voice be steely yes sir what yes sir there be one of those you-could-have-heard-a-pin-drop silence psmith be stare reflectively at the ceiling mr downing be look as if at any moment he might say thwart to I face ha ha and by a very striple it be psmith however who resume the conversation he manner be almost too respectful which make it all the more a pity that what he say do not keep up the standard of docility i take my stand he say on a technical point i say to myself ` mr downing be a man i admire as a human being and respect as a master in -- ' this impertinence be do you no good smith psmith wave a hand deprecatingly if you will let I explain sir i be about to say that in any other place but mr outwood 's house you word would be law i would fly to do you bidding if you press a button i would do the rest but in mr outwood 's house i can not do anything except what please I or what be order by mr outwood i ought to have remember that before one can not he continue as who should say let we be reasonable one can not to take a parallel case imagine the colonel command the garrison at a naval station go on board a battleship and order the crew to splice the jibboom spanker it might be a admirable thing for the empire that the jibboom spanker _ should _ be splice at that particular juncture but the crew would naturally decline to move in the matter until the order come from the commander of the ship so in my case if you will go to mr outwood explain to he how matter stand and come back and say to I ` psmith mr outwood wish you to ask he to be good enough to come to this study ' then i shall be only too glad to go and find he you see my difficulty sir go and fetch mr outwood smith i shall not tell you again psmith flick a speck of dust from he coat sleeve very well smith i can assure you sir at any rate that if there be a shoe in that cupboard now there will be a shoe there when you return mr down stalk out of the room but add psmith pensively to himself as the footstep die away i do not promise that it would be the same shoe he take the key from he pocket unlock the cupboard and take out the shoe then he select from the basket a particularly batter specimen place this in the cupboard he relock the door he next act be to take from the shelf a piece of string attach one end of this to the shoe that he have take from the cupboard he go to the window he first act be to fling the cupboard key out into the bush then he turn to the shoe on a level with the sill the water pipe up which mike have start to climb the night before be fasten to the wall by a iron band he tie the other end of the string to this and let the shoe swing free he notice with approval when it have stop swing that it be hide from above by the windowsill he return to he place at the mantelpiece as a afterthought he take another shoe from the basket and thrust it up the chimney a shower of soot fall into the grate blacken he hand the bathroom be a few yard down the corridor he go there and wash off the soot when he return mr downing be in the study and with he mr outwood the latter look daze as if he be not quite equal to the intellectual pressure of the situation where have you be smith ask mr down sharply i have be wash my hand sir h be say mr down suspiciously yes i see smith go into the bathroom say mr outwood smith i can not quite understand what it be mr down wish I to do my dear outwood snap the sleuth i think i have make it perfectly clear where be the difficulty i can not understand why you should suspect smith of keep he shoe in a cupboard and add mr outwood with spirit catch sight of a good-gracious-has-the-man - _ no _ - sense look on the other 's face why he should not do so if he wish it exactly sir say psmith approvingly you have touch the spot if i must explain again my dear outwood will you kindly give I you attention for a moment last night a boy break out of you house and paint my dog sampson red he paint say mr outwood round-eyed why i do not know why at any rate he do during the escapade one of he shoe be splash with the paint it be that shoe which i believe smith to be conceal in this cupboard now do you understand mr outwood look amazedly at psmith and psmith shake he head sorrowfully at mr outwood psmith 's expression say as plainly as if he have speak the word we must humor he so with you permission as smith declare that he have lose the key i propose to break open the door of this cupboard have you any objection mr outwood start objection none at all my dear fellow none at all let I see _ what _ be it you wish to do this say mr down shortly there be a pair of dumbbell on the floor belong to mike he never use they but they always manage to get themselves pack with the rest of he belongings on the last day of the holiday mr downing seize one of these and deliver two rapid blow at the cupboard door the wood splintered a third blow smash the flimsy lock the cupboard with any skeleton it might contain be open for all to view mr down utter a cry of triumph and tear the shoe from its rest place i tell you he say i tell you i wonder where that shoe have get to say psmith i have be look for it for day mr downing be examine he find he look up with a exclamation of surprise and wrath this shoe have no paint on it he say glaring at psmith this be not the shoe it certainly appear sir say psmith sympathetically to be free from paint there be a sort of reddish glow just there if you look at it sideways he add helpfully do you place that shoe there smith i must have do then when i lose the key -- be you satisfy now down interrupted mr outwood with asperity or be there any more furniture you wish to break the excitement of see he household goods smash with a dumbbell have make the archaeological student quite a swashbuckler for the moment a little more and one could imagine he give mr down a good hard knock the sleuth-hound stand still for a moment baffle but he brain be work with the rapidity of a buzz see a chance remark of mr outwood 's set he fizz off on the trail once more mr outwood have catch sight of the little pile of soot in the grate he bent down to inspect it dear I he say i must remember to have the chimney sweep it should have be do before mr downing 's eye roll in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth from earth to heaven also focus itself on the pile of soot and a thrill go through he soot in the fireplace smith wash he hand -lrb- you know my method my dear watson apply they -rrb- mr downing 's mind at that moment contain one single thought and that thought be what ho for the chimney he dive forward with a rush nearly knock mr outwood off he foot and thrust a arm up into the unknown a avalanche of soot fall upon he hand and wrist but he ignore it for at the same instant he finger have close upon what he be seek ah he say i think as much you be not quite clever enough after all smith no sir say psmith patiently we all make mistake you would have do better smith not to have give I all this trouble you have do yourself no good by it it be be great fun though sir argue psmith fun mr down laugh grimly you may have reason to change you opinion of what constitute -- he voice fail as he eye fall on the all-black toe of the shoe he look up and catch psmith 's benevolent gaze he straighten himself and brush a bead of perspiration from he face with the back of he hand unfortunately he use the sooty hand and the result be that he look like a chimney sweep at work do -- you -- put -- that -- shoe -- there smith he ask slowly yes sir then what do you _ mean _ by put it there roar mr down animal spirit sir say psmith what animal spirit sir what mr downing would have reply to this one can not tell though one can guess roughly for just as he be open he mouth mr outwood catch sight of he soot-covered countenance intervene my dear down he say you face it be positively cover with soot positively you must come and wash it you be quite black really you present a most curious appearance most let I show you the way to my room in all time of storm and tribulation there come a breaking point a point where the spirit definitely refuse to battle any longer against the sling and arrow of outrageous fortune mr downing could not bear up against this crowning blow he go down beneath it in the language of the ring he take the count it be the knockout soot he murmur weakly soot you face be cover my dear fellow quite cover it certainly have a faintly sooty aspect sir say psmith he voice rouse the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit you will hear more of this smith he say i say you will hear more of it then he allow mr outwood to lead he out to a place where there be towel soap and sponge \* \* \* \* \* when they have go psmith go to the window and haul in the string he feel the calm afterglow which come to the general after a successfully conduct battle it have be try of course for a man of refinement and it have cut into he afternoon but on the whole it have be worth it the problem now be what to do with the paint shoe it would take a lot of cleaning he see even if he could get hold of the necessary implement for clean it and he rather doubt if he would be able to do so edmund the boot-boy work in some mysterious cell far from the madding crowd at the back of the house in the boot cupboard downstairs there would probably be nothing likely to be of any use he fear be realize the boot cupboard be empty it seem to he that for the time be the best thing he could do would be to place the shoe in safe hiding until he would have think out a scheme have restore the basket to its proper place accordingly he go up to the study again and place the red-toed shoe in the chimney at about the same height where mr downing have find the other nobody would think of look there a second time and it be improbable that mr outwood really would have the chimney sweep as he have say the odds be that he have forget about it already psmith go to the bathroom to wash he hand again with the feeling that he have do a good day 's work 23 on the trail again the most massive mind be apt to forget thing at time the most adroit plotter make they little mistake psmith be no exception to the rule he make the mistake of not tell mike of the afternoon 's happening it be not altogether forgetfulness psmith be one of those people who like to carry through they operation entirely by themselves where there be only one in a secret the secret be more liable to remain unrevealed there be nothing he think to be gain from tell mike he forget what the consequence might be if he do not so psmith keep he own counsel with the result that mike go over to school on the Monday morning in gym shoe edmund summon from the hinterland of the house to give he opinion why only one of mike 's shoe be to be find have no view on the subject he seem to look on it as one of these thing which no fellow can understand ` ere 's one of 'em mr jackson he say as if he hope that mike might be satisfy with a compromise one what be the good of that edmund you chump i can not go over to school in one shoe edmund turn this over in he mind and then say no sir as much as to say i may have lose a shoe but thank goodness i can still understand sound reasoning well what be i to do where _ be _ the other shoe do not know mr jackson reply edmund to both question well i mean oh dash it there be the bell and mike sprint off in the gym shoe he stand in it be only a deviation from those ordinary rule of school life which one observe naturally and without think that enable one to realize how strong public-school prejudice really be at a school for instance where the regulation say that coat only of black or dark blue be to be wear a boy who appear one day in even the most respectable and unostentatious brown find himself look on with a mixture of awe and repulsion which would be excessive if he have sandbag the headmaster so in the case of shoe school rule decree that a boy shall go to he form room in shoe there be no real reason why if the day be fine he should not wear gym shoe should he prefer they but if he do the thing create a perfect sensation boy say great scott what _ have _ you get on master say jone _ what _ be you wear on you foot in the few minute which elapse between the assemble of the form for call-over and the arrival of the form master some wag be sure either to stamp on the gym shoe accompany the act with some satirical remark or else to pull one of they off and inaugurate a impromptu game of football with it there be once a boy who go to school one morning in elastic-sided boot mike have always be coldly distant in he relation to the rest of he form look on they with a few exception as worm and the form since he inning against down 's on the Friday have regard mike with respect so that he escape the rag he would have have to undergo at wrykyn in similar circumstance it be only mr downing who give trouble there be a sort of instinct which enable some master to tell when a boy in they form be wear gym shoe instead of the more formal kind just as people who dislike cat always know when one be in a room with they they can not see it but they feel it in they bone mr downing be perhaps the most bigoted anti-gym-shoeist in the whole list of english schoolmaster he wage war remorselessly against gym shoe satire abuse line detention -- every weapon be employ by he in deal with they wearer it have be the late dunster 's practice always to go over to school in gym shoe when as he usually do he feel shaky in the morning 's lesson mr down always detect he in the first five minute and that mean a lecture of anything from ten minute to a quarter of a hour on untidy habit and boy who look like loafer -- which break the back of the morning 's work nicely on one occasion when a particularly tricky bit of livy be on the bill of fare dunster have enter the form room in heelless turkish bath slipper of a vivid crimson and the subsequent proceedings include he journey over to the house to change the heelless atrocity have see he through very nearly to the quarter-to-eleven interval mike accordingly have not be in he place for three minute when mr down stiffen like a pointer call he name yes sir say mike _ what _ be you wear on you foot jackson gym shoe sir you be wear gym shoe be you not aware that gym shoe be not the proper thing to come to school in why be you wear gym shoe the form lean back against the next row of desk settle itself comfortably for the address from the throne i have lose one of my shoe sir a kind of gulp escape from mr downing 's lip he stare at mike for a moment in silence then turn to stone he tell he to start translate stone who have be expect at least ten minute ' respite be take unawares when he find the place in he book and begin to construe he flounder hopelessly but to he grow surprise and satisfaction the form master appear to notice nothing wrong he say yes yes mechanically and finally that will do whereupon stone resume he seat with the feeling that the age of miracle have return mr downing 's mind be in a whirl he case be complete mike 's appearance in gym shoe with the explanation that he have lose a shoe complete the chain as columbus must have feel when he ship run into harbor and the first american interviewer jump on board say wal sir and what be you impression of we glorious country so do mr down feel at that moment when the bell ring at a quarter to eleven he gather up he gown and speed to the headmaster 24 the adair method it be during the interval that day that stone and robinson discuss the subject of cricket over a bun and ginger beer at the school shop come to a momentous decision to wit that they be feed up with the adair administration and mean to strike the immediate cause of revolt be early-morning fielding practice that search test of cricket keenness mike himself to whom cricket be the great and serious interest in life have shirk early-morning fielding practice in he first term at wrykyn and stone and robinson have but a lukewarm attachment to the game compare with mike 's as a rule adair have contented himself with practice in the afternoon after school which nobody object to and no strain consequently have be put upon stone 's and robinson 's allegiance in view of the mcc match on the Wednesday however he have now add to this a extra dose to be take before breakfast stone and robinson have leave they comfortable bed that day at six o'clock yawn and heavy-eyed and have catch catch and field drive which in the cool morning air have sting like adder and bitten like serpent until the sun have really get to work it be no joke take a high catch stone 's dislike of the experiment be only equal by robinson 's they be neither of they of the type which like to undergo hardship for the common good they play well enough when on the field but neither care greatly whether the school have a good season or not they play the game entirely for they own sake the result be that they go back to the house for breakfast with a never-again feeling and at the earliest possible moment meet to debate as to what be to be do about it at all cost another experience like today 's must be avoid it be all rot say stone what on earth 's the good of sweating about before breakfast it only make you tired i should not wonder say robinson if it be not bad for the heart rush about on a empty stomach i mean and all that sort of thing personally say stone gnawing he bun i do not intend to stick it nor do i i mean it be such absolute rot if we be not good enough to play for the team without have to get up overnight to catch catch he would better find somebody else yes at this moment adair come into the shop fielding practice again tomorrow he say briskly at six before breakfast say robinson rather you two must buck up you know you be rotten today and he pass on leave the two malcontent speechless stone be the first to recover i be hang if i turn out tomorrow he say as they leave the shop he can do what he like about it besides what can he do after all only kick we out of the team and i do not mind that nor do i i do not think he will kick we out either he can not play the mcc with a scratch team if he do we 'll go and play for that village jackson play for we 'll get jackson to shove we into the team all right say robinson let 's they position be a strong one a cricket captain may seem to be a autocrat of tremendous power but in reality he have only one weapon the keenness of those under he with the majority of course the fear of be exclude or eject from a team be a spur that drive the majority consequently be easily handle but when a cricket captain run up against a boy who do not much care whether he play for the team or not then he find himself in a difficult position and unless he be a man of action practically helpless stone and robinson feel secure take it all around they feel that they would just as soon play for lower borlock as for the school the bowling of the opposition would be weaker in the former case and the chance of make run greater to a certain type of cricketer run be run wherever and however make the result of all this be that adair turn out with the team next morning for field practice find himself two short barne be among those present but of the other two representative of outwood 's house there be no sign barne question on the subject have no information to give beyond the fact that he have not see they about anywhere which be not a great help adair proceed with the fielding practice without further delay at breakfast that morning he be silent and apparently rapt in thought mr downing who sit at the top of the table with adair on he right be accustom at the morning meal to blend nourishment of the body with that of the mind as a rule he have ten minute with the daily paper before the bell ring and it be he practice to hand on the result of he read to adair and the other house prefect who not have see the paper usually form a interested and appreciative audience today however though the house prefect express vary degree of excitement at the news that sheppard have make a century against gloucestershire and that a butter famine be expect in the united state these world-shaking news item seem to leave adair cold he champ he bread and marmalade with a abstracted air he be wonder what to do in the matter of stone and robinson many captain might have pass the thing over to take it for grant that the miss pair have oversleep themselves would have be a safe and convenient way out of the difficulty but adair be not the sort of person who seek for safe and convenient way out of difficulty he never shirk anything physical or moral he resolve to interview the absentee it be not until after school that a opportunity offer itself he go across to outwood 's and find the two nonstarter in the senior day room engage in the intellectual pursuit of kick the wall and mark the height of each kick with chalk adair 's entrance coincide with a record effort by stone which cause the kicker to overbalance and stagger backward against the captain sorry say stone hello adair do not mention it why be not you two at field practice this morning robinson who leave the lead to stone in all matter say nothing stone speak we do not turn up he say i know you do not why not stone have rehearse this scene in he mind and he speak with the coolness which come from rehearsal we decide not to oh yes we come to the conclusion that we have not any use for early-morning fielding adair 's manner become ominously calm you be rather feed up i suppose that be just the word sorry it bore you it do not we do not give it the chance to robinson laugh appreciatively what be the joke robinson ask adair there be no joke say robinson with some haste i be only thinking of something i 'll give you something else to think about soon stone intervene it be no good make a row about it adair you must see that you can not do anything of course you can kick we out of the team if you like but we do not care if you do jackson will get we a game any Wednesday or Saturday for the village he play for so we be all right and the school team be not such a lot of flyer that you can afford to go chuck people out of it whenever you want to see what i mean you and jackson seem to have fix it all up between you what be you go to do kick we out no good i think you would see it be no good make a beastly row we 'll play for the school all right there be no earthly need for we to turn out for field practice before breakfast you do not think there be you may be right all the same you be go to tomorrow morning what six sharp do not be late do not be a ass adair we have tell you we be not go to that be only you opinion i think you be i 'll give you till five past six as you seem to like lie in bed you can turn out if you feel like it you will not find I there that 'll be a disappointment nor robinson no say the junior partner in the firm but he say it without any deep conviction the atmosphere be grow a great deal too tense for he comfort you have quite make up you mind yes say stone right say adair quietly and knock he down he be up again in a moment adair have push the table back and be stand in the middle of the open space you cad say stone i be not ready well you be now shall we go on stone dash in without a word and for a few moment the two might have seem evenly match to a not too intelligent spectator but science tell even in a confine space adair be smaller and lighter than stone but he be cooler and quicker and he know more about the game he blow be always home a fraction of a second sooner than he opponent 's at the end of a minute stone be on the floor again he get up slowly and stand lean with one hand on the table suppose we say ten past six say adair i be not particular to a minute or two stone make no reply will ten past six suit you for field practice tomorrow say adair all right say stone thanks how about you robinson robinson have be a petrified spectator of the captain-kettle-like maneuver of the cricket captain and it do not take he long to make up he mind he be not altogether a coward in different circumstance he might have put up a respectable show but it take a more than ordinarily courageous person to embark on a fight which he know must end in he destruction robinson know that he be nothing like a match even for stone and adair have dispose of stone in a little over one minute it seem to robinson that neither pleasure nor profit be likely to come from a encounter with adair all right he say hastily i 'll turn up good say adair i wonder if either of you chap could tell I which be jackson 's study stone be dab at he mouth with a handkerchief a task which preclude anything in the shape of conversation so robinson reply that mike 's study be the first you come to on the right of the corridor at the top of the stair thanks say adair you do not happen to know if he be in i suppose he go up with smith a quarter of a hour ago i do not know if he be still there i 'll go and see say adair i should like a word with he if he be not busy 25 adair have a word with mike mike all unconscious of the stir proceedings which have be go on below stair be peacefully read a letter he have receive that morning from strachan at wrykyn in which the successor to the cricket captaincy which should have be mike 's have a good deal to say in a lugubrious strain in mike 's absence thing have be go badly with wrykyn a broken arm contract in the course of some rash experiment with a day boy 's motor bicycle have deprive the team of the service of dunstable the only man who have show any sign of be able to bowl a side out since this calamity write strachan everything have go wrong the mcc lead by mike 's brother reggie the least of the three first-class cricketing jackson have smash they by a hundred and fifty run geddington have wipe they off the face of the earth the incog with a team recruit exclusively from the rabbit hutch -- not a well-known man on the side except stacey a veteran who have be play for the club for nearly half a century -- have get home by two wicket in fact it be strachan 's opinion that the wrykyn team that summer be about the most hopeless gang of deadbeat that have ever make exhibition of itself on the school grounds the ripton match fortunately be off owe to a outbreak of mumps at that shrine of learning and athletics -- the second outbreak of the malady in two term which say strachan be hard line on ripton but a bit of jolly good luck for wrykyn as it have save they from what would probably have be a record hammer ripton have eight of they last year 's team leave include dixon the fast bowler against whom mike alone of the wrykyn team have be able to make run in the previous season altogether wrykyn have strike a bad patch mike mourn over he suffer school if only he could have be there to help it might have make all the difference in school cricket one good batsman to go in first and knock the bowler off they length may take a weak team triumphantly through a season in school cricket the importance of a good start for the first wicket be incalculable as he put strachan 's letter away in he pocket all he old bitterness against sedleigh which have be ebb during the past few day return with a rush he be conscious once more of that feeling of personal injury which have make he hate he new school on the first day of term and it be at this point when he resentment be at its height that adair the concrete representative of everything sedleighan enter the room there be moment in life 's placid course when there have get to be the biggest kind of row this be one of they psmith who be lean against the mantelpiece read the serial story in a daily paper which he have abstract from the senior day room make the intruder free of the study with a dignified wave of the hand and go on reading mike remain in the deck chair in which he be sit and contented himself with glare at the newcomer psmith be the first to speak if you ask my candid opinion he say look up from he paper i should say that young lord antony trefusis be in the soup already i seem to see the consommé splash about he ankle he be have a note tell he to be under the oak tree in the park at midnight he be just off there at the end of this installment i bet long jack the poacher be wait there with a sandbag care to see the paper comrade adair or do not you take any interest in contemporary literature thanks say adair i just want to speak to jackson for a minute fate say psmith have lead you footstep to the right place this be comrade jackson the pride of the school sit before you what do you want say mike he suspect that adair have come to ask he once again to play for the school the fact that the mcc match be on the follow day make this a probable solution of the reason for he visit he could think of no other errand that be likely to have set the head of downing 's pay afternoon call i 'll tell you in a minute it will not take long that say psmith approvingly be right speed be the keynote of the present age promptitude dispatch this be no time for loitering we must be strenuous we must hustle we must do it now we -- buck up say mike certainly say adair i have just be talk to stone and robinson a excellent way of pass a idle half hour say psmith we be not exactly idle say adair grimly it do not last long but it be pretty lively while it do stone chuck it after the first round mike get up out of he chair he could not quite follow what all this be about but there be no mistake the truculence of adair 's manner for some reason which might possibly be make clear later adair be look for trouble and mike in he present mood feel that it would be a privilege to see that he get it psmith be regard adair through he eyeglass with pain and surprise surely he say you do not mean we to understand that you have be _ brawl _ with comrade stone this be bad hearing i think that you and he be like brother such a bad example for comrade robinson too leave we adair we would brood ` oh go thee knave i 'll none of thee ' shakespeare psmith turn away and rest he elbow on the mantelpiece gaze at himself mournfully in the look glass i be not the man i be he sigh after a prolonged inspection there be line on my face dark circle beneath my eye the fierce rush of life at sedleigh be waste I away stone and i have a discussion about early-morning fielding practice say adair turn to mike mike say nothing i think he fielding want work up a bit so i tell he to turn out at six tomorrow morning he say he would not so we argue it out he be go to all right so be robinson mike remain silent so be you say adair i get thinner and thinner say psmith from the mantelpiece mike look at adair and adair look at mike after the manner of two dog before they fly at one another there be a electric silence in the study psmith peer with increase earnestness into the glass oh say mike at last what make you think that i do not think i know any special reason for my turn out yes what be that you be go to play for the school against the mcc tomorrow and i want you to get some practice i wonder how you get that idea curious i should have do be not it very you be not build on it much be you say mike politely i be rather reply adair with equal courtesy i be afraid you 'll be disappointed i do not think so my eye say psmith regretfully be a bit close together however he add philosophically it be too late to alter that now mike draw a step closer to adair what make you think i shall play against the mcc he ask curiously i be go to make you mike take another step forward adair move to meet he would you care to try now say mike for just one second the two draw themselves together preparatory to begin the serious business of the interview and in that second psmith turn from the glass step between they get out of the light smith say mike psmith wave he back with a deprecate gesture my dear young friend he say placidly if you _ will _ let you angry passion rise against the direct advice of doctor watt i suppose you must but when you propose to claw each other in my study in the midst of a hundred fragile and priceless ornament i lodge a protest if you really feel that you want to scrap for goodness ' sake do it where there be some room i do not want all the study furniture smash i know a bank whereon the wild thyme grow only a few yard down the road where you can scrap all night if you want to how would it be to move on there any objection none then shift ho and let 's get it over 26 clear the air psmith be one of those people who lend a dignity to everything they touch under he auspices the most unpromising venture become somehow envelop in a atmosphere of measure stateliness on the present occasion what would have be without he guide hand a mere unscientific scramble take on something of the impressive formality of the national sport club the round he say produce a watch as they pass through a gate into a field a couple of hundred yard from the house gate will be of three minute ' duration with a minute rest in between a man who be down will have ten seconds in which to rise be you ready comrade adair and jackson very well then time after which it be a pity that the actual fight do not quite live up to its referee 's introduction dramatically there should have be cautious spar for opening and a number of tensely contest round as if it have be the final of a boxing competition but school fight when they do occur -- which be only once in a decade nowadays unless you count junior school scuffle -- be the outcome of week of suppress bad blood and be consequently brief and furious in a boxing competition however much one may want to win one do not dislike one 's opponent up to the moment when time be call one be probably warmly attach to he and at the end of the last round one expect to resume that attitude of mind in a fight each party as a rule hate the other so it happen that there be nothing formal or cautious about the present battle all adair want be to get at mike and all mike want be to get at adair directly psmith call time they rush together as if they mean to end the thing in half a minute it be this that save mike in a ordinary contest with the glove with he opponent cool and boxing in he true form he could not have last three round against adair the latter be a clever boxer while mike have never have a lesson in he life if adair have keep away and use he head nothing could have prevent he win as it be however he throw away he advantage much as tom brown do at the beginning of he fight with slogger william and the result be the same as on that historic occasion mike have the greater strength and thirty seconds from the start knock he man clean off he foot with a unscientific but powerful righthander this finish adair 's chance he rise full of fight but with all the science knock out of he he go in at mike with both hand the irish blood in he which for the ordinary event of life make he merely energetic and dash now render he reckless he abandon all attempt at guard it be the frontal attack in its most futile form and as unsuccessful as a frontal attack be apt to be there be a swift exchange of blow in the course of which mike 's left elbow come into contact with he opponent 's right fist get a shock which keep it tingle for the rest of the day and then adair go down in a heap he get up slowly and with difficulty for a moment he stand blinking vaguely then he lurch forward at mike in the excitement of a fight -- which be after all about the most exciting thing that ever happen to one in the course of one 's life -- it be difficult for the fighter to see what the spectator see where the spectator see a assault on a already beat man the fighter himself only see a legitimate piece of self-defense against a opponent whose chance be equal to he own psmith see as anybody look on would have see that adair be do mike 's blow have take he within a fraction of a inch of the point of the jaw and he be all but knock out mike could not see this all he understand be that he man be on he foot again and come at he so he hit out with all he strength and this time adair go down and stay down brief say psmith come forward but exciting we may take that i think to be the conclusion of the entertainment i will now have a dash at pick up the slay i should not stop if i be you he 'll be sit up and take notice soon and if he see you he may want to go on with the combat which would do he no earthly good if it be go to be continue in we next there have better be a bit of a interval for alteration and repair first be he hurt much do you think ask mike he have see knockout before in the ring but this be the first time he have ever effect one on he own account and adair look unpleasantly corpselike _ he be _ all right say psmith in a minute or two he 'll be skip about like a little lambkin i 'll look after he you go away and pick flower mike put on he coat and walk back to the house he be conscious of a perplexing whirl of new and strange emotion chief among which be a curious feeling that he rather like adair he find himself think that adair be a good chap that there be something to be say for he point of view and that it be a pity he have knock he about so much at the same time he feel a undeniable thrill of pride at have beat he the feat present that interesting person mike jackson to he in a fresh and please light as one who have have a tough job to face and have carry it through jackson the cricketer he know but jackson the deliverer of knockout blow be strange to he and he find this new acquaintance a man to be respect the fight in fact have the result which most fight have if they be fight fairly and until one side have have enough it revolutionize mike 's view of thing it shake he up and drain the bad blood out of he where before he have seem to himself to be act with massive dignity he now see that he have simply be sulk like some wretched kid there have appear to he something rather fine in he policy of refuse to identify himself in any way with sedleigh a touch of the stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make sort of thing he now see that he attitude be to be sum up in the word sha 'n' t play it come upon mike with painful clearness that he have be make a ass of himself he have come to this conclusion after much earnest thought when psmith enter the study how 's adair ask mike sit up and take nourishment once more we have be chat he be not a bad cove he be all right say mike there be a pause psmith straighten he tie look here he say i seldom interfere in terrestrial strife but it seem to I that there be a opening here for a capable peacemaker not afraid of work and willing to give he service in exchange for a comfortable home comrade adair 's rather a stoutish fellow in he way i be not much on the ` play up for the old school jone ' game but everyone to he taste i should not have think anybody would get overwhelmingly attach to this abode of wrath but comrade adair seem to have do it he be all for give sedleigh a much-needed boost-up it be not a bad idea in its way i do not see why one should not humor he apparently he be be sweating since early childhood to buck the school up and as he be leave at the end of the term it might not be a scaly scheme to give he a bit of a send-off if possible by make the cricket season a bit of a banger as a start why not drop he a line to say that you 'll play against the mcc tomorrow mike do not reply at once he be feel better disposed toward adair and sedleigh then he have feel but he be not sure that he be quite prepared to go as far as a complete climb-down it would not be a bad idea continue psmith there be nothing like give in to a man a bit every now and then it broaden the soul and improve the action of the skin what seem to have feed up comrade adair to a certain extent be that stone apparently lead he to understand that you have offer to give he and robinson place in you village team you do not of course of course not say mike indignantly i tell he he do not know the old _ noblesse oblige _ spirit of the jackson i say that you would scorn to tarnish the jackson escutcheon by not play the game my eloquence convinced he however to return to the point under discussion why not i do not what i mean to say begin mike if you trouble be say psmith that you fear that you may be in unworthy company -- do not be a ass -- dismiss it _ i _ be play mike stare you be _ what you _ i say psmith breathing on a coat button and polish it with he handkerchief can you play cricket you have discover say psmith my secret sorrow you be rot you wrong I comrade jackson then why have not you play why have not you why do not you come and play for lower borlock i mean the last time i play in a village cricket match i be catch at point by a man in brace it would have be madness to risk another such shock to my system my nerve be so exquisitely balanced that a thing of that sort take year off my life no but look here smith bar rot be you really any good at cricket competent judge at eton give I to understand so i be tell that this year i should be a certainty for lord 's but when the cricket season come where be i go go like some beautiful flower that wither in the night but you tell I you do not like cricket you say you only like watch it quite right i do but at school where cricket be compulsory you have to overcome you private prejudice and in time the thing become a habit imagine my feeling when i find that i be degenerate little by little into a slow left-hand bowler with a swerve i fight against it but it be useless and after a while i give up the struggle and drift with the stream last year in a house match -- psmith 's voice take on a deeper tone of melancholy -- i take seven for thirteen in the second inning on a hard wicket i do think when i come here that i have find a haven of rest but it be not to be i turn out tomorrow what comrade outwood will say when he find that he keenest archaeological disciple have desert i hate to think however mike feel as if a young and powerful earthquake have pass the whole face of he world have undergo a quick change here be he the recalcitrant wavering on the point of play for the school and here be psmith the last person whom he would have expect to be a player state calmly that he have be in the run for a place in the eton eleven then in a flash mike understand he be not by nature intuitive but he read psmith 's mind now since the term begin he and psmith have be act on precisely similar motive just as he have be disappoint of the captaincy of cricket at wrykyn so have psmith be disappoint of he place in the eton team at lord 's and they have both work it off each in he own way -- mike sullenly psmith whimsically accord to they respective nature -- on sedleigh if psmith therefore do not consider it too much of a climb-down to renounce he resolution not to play for sedleigh there be nothing to stop mike do so as -- at the bottom of he heart -- he want to do by jove he say if you be play i 'll play i 'll write a note to adair now but i say -- he stop -- i be hang if i be go to turn out and field before breakfast tomorrow that be all right you will not have to adair will not be there himself he be not play against the mcc he be sprain he wrist 27 in which peace be declare sprain he wrist say mike how do he do that during the brawl apparently one of he effort get home on you elbow instead of you expressive countenance and whether it be that you elbow be particularly tough or he wrist particularly fragile i do not know anyhow it go it be nothing bad but it 'll keep he out of the game tomorrow i say what beastly rough luck i would no idea i 'll go around not a bad scheme close the door gently after you and if you see anybody downstairs who look as if he be likely to be go over to the shop ask he to get I a small pot of some rare old jam and tell the man to chalk it up to I the jam comrade outwood supplies to we at tea be all right as a practical joke or as a food for those anxious to commit suicide but useless to anybody who value life on arrive at mr downing 's and go to adair 's study mike find that he late antagonist be out he leave a note inform he of he willingness to play in the morrow 's match the lock-up bell ring as he go out of the house a spot of rain fall on he hand a moment later there be a continuous patter as the storm which have be gather all day break in earnest mike turn up he coat collar and run back to outwood 's at this rate he say to himself there will not be a match at all tomorrow \* \* \* \* \* when the weather decide after behave well for some week to show what it can do in another direction it do the thing thoroughly when mike wake the next morning the world be gray and drip leaden-colored cloud drift over the sky till there be not a trace of blue to be see and then the rain begin again in the gentle determine way rain have when it mean to make a day of it it be one of those bad day when one sit in the pavilion damp and depressed while figure in mackintosh with discolor buckskin boot crawl miserably about the field in couple mike shuffling across to school in a burberry meet adair at downing 's gate these moment be always difficult mike stop -- he could hardly walk on as if nothing have happen -- and look down at he foot come across he say awkwardly right ho say adair they walk on in silence it be only about ten to be not it say mike adair fish out he watch and examine it with a elaborate care bear of nervousness about nine to good we have get plenty of time yes i hate have to hurry over to school so do i i often do cut it rather fine though yes so do i beastly nuisance when one do beastly it be only about a couple of minute from the house to the school i should think should not you not much more might be three yes three if one do not hurry another silence beastly day say adair rotten silence again i say say mike scowl at he toe awfully sorry about you wrist oh that be all right it be my fault do it hurt oh no rather not thanks i would no idea you would crock yourself oh no that be all right it be only right at the end you would have smash I anyhow oh rot i bet you anything you like you would i bet you i should not jolly hard luck just before the match oh no i say thanks awfully for say you would play oh rot do you think we shall get a game adair inspect the sky carefully i do not know it look pretty bad do not it rotten i say how long will you wrist keep you out of cricket be all right in a week less probably good now that you and smith be go to play we ought to have a jolly good season rummy smith turn out to be a cricketer yes i should think he would be a hot bowler with he height he must be jolly good if he be only just out of the eton team last year yes what be the time ask mike adair produce he watch once more five to we have heap of time yes heap let 's stroll on a bit down the road shall we right ho mike clear he throat i say hello i have be talk to smith he be tell I that you think i would promise to give stone and robinson place in the -- oh no that be all right it be only for a bit smith tell I you could not have do and i see that i be a ass to think you could have it be stone seem so dead certain that he could play for lower borlock if i chuck he from the school team that give I the idea he never even ask I to get he a place no i know of course i would not have do it even if he have of course not i do not want to play myself but i be not go to do a rotten trick like get other fellow away from the team no i know it be rotten enough really not play myself oh no beastly rough luck have to leave wrykyn just when you be go to be captain and come to a small school like this the excitement of the past few day must have have a stimulating effect on mike 's mind -- shake it up as it be for now for the second time in two day he display quite a creditable amount of intuition he might have be mislead by adair 's apparently deprecatory attitude toward sedleigh and blunder into a denunciation of the place adair have say a small school like this in the sort of voice which might have lead he hearer to think that he be expect to say yes rotten little hole be not it or word to that effect mike fortunately perceive that the word be use purely from politeness on the chinese principle when a chinese man wish to pay a compliment he do so by belittle himself and he belongings he elude the pitfall what rot he say sedleigh 's one of the most sport school i have ever come across everybody be as keen as blaze so they ought to be after the way you have sweat adair shuffle awkwardly i have always be fairly keen on the place he say but i do not suppose i have do anything much you have loosen one of my front tooth say mike with a grin if that be any comfort to you i could not eat anything except porridge this morning my jaw still ache for the first time during the conversation they eye meet and the humorous side of the thing strike they simultaneously they begin to laugh what fool we must have look say adair _ you _ be all right i must have look rotten i have never have the glove on in my life i be jolly glad no one see we except smith who do not count hello there be the bell we would better be move on what about this match not much chance of it from the look of the sky at present it might clear before eleven you would better get change anyhow at the interval and hang about in case all right it be better than do thucydide with down we have get math till the interval so i do not see anything of he all day which will not hurt I he be not a bad sort of chap when you get to know he say adair i can not have do then i do not know which i would least soon be down or a black beetle except that if one be down one could tread on the black beetle dash this rain i get about half a pint down my neck just then we sha not get a game today or anything like it as you be crock i be not sure that i care much you have be sweating for year to get the match on and it would be rather rot play it without you i do not know that so much i wish we could play because i be certain with you and smith we would walk into they they probably be not send down much of a team and really now that you and smith be turn out we have get a jolly hot lot there be quite decent batting all the way through and the bowling be not so bad if only we could have give this mcc lot a really good hammer it might have be easier to get some good fixture for next season you see it be all right for a school like wrykyn but with a small place like this you simply can not get the best team to give you a match till you have do something to show that you be not absolute rotter at the game as for the school they be worse they would simply laugh at you you be cricket secretary at wrykyn last year what would you have do if you would have a challenge from sedleigh you would either have laugh till you be sick or else have a fit at the mere idea of the thing mike stop by jove you have strike about the brightest scheme on record i never think of it before let 's get a match on with wrykyn what they would not play we yes they would at least i be pretty sure they would i have a letter from strachan the captain yesterday say that the ripton match have have to be scratch owe to illness so they have get a vacant date shall i try they i 'll write to strachan tonight if you like and they be not strong this year we 'll smash they what do you say adair be as one who have see a vision by jove he say at last if we only could 28 mr downing move the rain continue without a break all the morning the two team after hang about dismally and while the time away with stump-cricket in the change room lunch in the pavilion at one o'clock after which the mcc captain approach adair move that this merry meeting be consider off and he and he man permit to catch the next train back to town to which adair see that it be out of the question that there should be any cricket that afternoon regretfully agree and the first sedleigh _ v _ mcc match be accordingly scratch mike and psmith wander back to the house be meet by a damp junior from down 's with a message that mr down wish to see mike as soon as he be change what be he want I for inquire mike the messenger do not know mr down it seem have not confide in he all he know be that the housemaster be in the house and would be glad if mike would step across a nuisance say psmith this incessant demand for you that be the worst of be popular if he want you to stop to tea edge away a meal on rather a sumptuous scale will be prepare in the study against you return mike change quickly and go off leave psmith who be fond of simple pleasure in he spare time earnestly occupy with a puzzle which have be scatter through the land by a weekly paper the prize for a solution be one thousand pound and psmith have already inform mike with some minuteness of he plan for the disposition of this sum meanwhile he work at it both in and out of school generally with abusive comment on its inventor he be still fiddle away at it when mike return mike though psmith be at first too absorb to notice it be agitate i do not wish to be in any way harsh say psmith without look up but the man who invent this thing be a blighter of the worst type you come and have a shot for the moment i be baffle the whisper fly round the club ` psmith be baffle ' the man 's a absolute driveling ass say mike warmly I do you mean what on earth would be the point of my do it you would gather in a thousand of the best give you a nice start in life i be not talk about you rotten puzzle what _ be _ you talk about that ass down i believe he be off he nut then you chat with comrade downing be not of the old-college-chums-meeting-unexpectedly-after-year ' - separation type what have he be do to you he be off he nut i know but what do he do how do the brainstorm burst do he jump at you from behind a door and bite a piece out of you leg or do he say he be a teapot mike sit down you remember that painting-sammy business as if it be yesterday say psmith which it be pretty nearly he think i do it why have you ever show any talent in the painting line the silly ass want I to confess that i would do it he as good as ask I to jaw a lot of rot about my find it to my advantage later on if i behave sensibly then what be you worry about do not you know that when a master want you to do the confess act it simply mean that he have not enough evidence to start in on you with you be all right the thing 's a stand-off evidence say mike my dear man he be get enough evidence to sink a ship he be absolutely sweating evidence at every pore as far as i can see he be be crawl about do the sherlock holme business for all he be worth ever since the thing happen and now he be dead certain that i paint sammy _ do _ you by the way say psmith no say mike shortly i do not but after listen to down i almost begin to wonder if i have not the man 's get stack of evidence to prove that i do such as what it be mostly about my shoe but dash it you know all about that why you be with he when he come and look for they it be true say psmith that comrade downing and i spend a very pleasant half hour together inspect shoe but how do he drag you into it he swear one of the shoe be splash with paint yes he babble to some extent on that point when i be entertaining he but what make he think that the shoe if any be yours he be certain that somebody in this house get one of he shoe splash and be hide it

of nature 's blitherer so that be why he touch we for we hard-earned be it yes of course there be no need for he to have the money at all and the result be that you be in something of a tight place you be _ absolutely _ certain you do not paint that dog do not do it by any chance in a moment of absent-mindedness and forget all about it no no i suppose not i wonder who do it be beastly awkward

if i can not produce this shoe they be bind to guess why what exactly ask psmith be the position of affair between you and comrade downing when you leave he have you definitely part brass rag or do you simply sort of drift apart with mutual courtesy oh he say i be ill advise to continue that attitude or some rot and i say i do not care i have not paint he bally dog and he say very well then he must take step and -- well that be about all sufficient too say psmith quite sufficient i take it then that he be now on the warpath collect a gang so to speak i suppose he be go to the old man about

out of I _ he 'll _ want you to confess too master be all whale on confession the worst of it be you can not prove a alibi because at about the time the foul act be perpetrate you be play round-and-round-the - mulberry-bush with comrade downing this need thought you have better put the case in my hand and go out and watch the dandelion grow i will think over the matter well i hope you 'll be able to think of something i can not possibly you never know there be a tap at the door see how we have train they say psmith they now knock before enter there be a time when they would have try to smash in a panel come in a small boy carry a straw hat adorn with the school house ribbon answer the invitation oh i say jackson he say the headmaster send I over to tell you he want to see you i tell you so say mike to psmith do not go suggest psmith tell he to write mike get up all this be very try say psmith i be see nothing of you today he turn to the small boy tell willie he add that mr jackson will be with he in a moment the emissary depart _ you be _ all right say psmith encouragingly just you keep on say you be all right stout denial be the thing do not go in for any airy explanation simply stick to stout denial you can not beat it with which expert advice he allow mike to go on he way he have not be go two minute when psmith who have lean back in he chair rapt in thought heave himself up again he stand for a moment straighten he tie at the look glass then he pick up he hat and move slowly out of the door and down the passage thence at the same dignified rate of progress out of the house and in at downing 's front gate the postman be at the door when he get there apparently absorb in conversation with the parlor maid psmith stand by politely till the postman who have just be tell it be like he impudence catch sight of he and have hand over the letter in a ultraformal and professional manner pass away be mr downing at home inquire psmith he be it seem psmith be show into the dining room on the left of the hall and request to wait he be examine a portrait of mr downing which hang on the wall when the housemaster come in a excellent likeness sir say psmith with a gesture of the hand toward the painting well smith say mr down shortly what do you wish to see I about it be in connection with the regrettable painting of you dog sir ha say mr downing i do it sir say psmith stop and flick a piece of fluff off he knee 29 the artist claim he work the line of action which psmith have call stout denial be a excellent line to adopt especially if you really be innocent but it do not lead to anything in the shape of a bright and snappy dialogue between accuser and accuse both mike and the headmaster be oppress by a feeling that the situation be difficult the atmosphere be heavy and conversation show a tendency to flag the headmaster have open brightly enough with a summary of the evidence which mr downing have lay before he but after that a massive silence have be the order of the day there be nothing in this world quite so stolid and uncommunicative as a boy who have make up he mind to be stolid and uncommunicative and the headmaster as he sit and look at mike who sit and look past he at the bookshelf feel awkward it be a scene which need either a dramatic interruption or a neat exit speech as it happen what it get be the dramatic interruption the headmaster be just say i do not think you fully realize jackson the extent to which appearance -- which be practically go back to the beginning and start again -- when there be a knock at the door a voice without say mr down to see you sir and the chief witness for the prosecution burst in i would not have interrupt you say mr downing but -- not at all mr downing be there anything i can i have discover i have be inform in short it be not jackson who commit the -- who paint my dog mike and the headmaster both look at the speaker mike with a feeling of relief -- for stout denial unsupported by any weighty evidence be a wear game to play -- the headmaster with astonishment not jackson say the headmaster no it be a boy in the same house smith psmith mike be more than surprised he could not believe it there be nothing which afford so clear a index to a boy 's character as the type of rag which he consider humorous between what be a rag and what be merely a rotten trick there be a very definite line draw master as a rule do not realize this but boy nearly always do mike could not imagine psmith do a rotten thing like cover a housemaster 's dog with red paint any more than he could imagine do it himself they have both be amuse at the sight of sammy after the operation but anybody except possibly the owner of the dog would have think it funny at first after the first surprise they feeling have be that it be a rotten thing to have do and beastly rough luck on the poor brute it be a kid 's trick as for psmith have do it mike simply do not believe it smith say the headmaster what make you think that simply this say mr down with calm triumph that the boy himself come to I a few moment ago and confess mike be conscious of a feeling of acute depression it do not make he in the least degree jubilant or even thankful to know that he himself be clear of the charge all he could think of be that psmith be do for this be bind to mean the sack if psmith have paint sammy it mean that psmith have break out of he house at night and it be not likely that the rule about nocturnal wander be less strict at sedleigh than at any other school in the kingdom mike feel if possible worse than he have feel when wyatt have be catch on a similar occasion it seem as if fate have a special grudge against he best friend he do not make friend very quickly or easily though he have always have score of acquaintance -- and with wyatt and psmith he have find himself at home from the first moment he have meet they he sit there with a curious feeling of have swallow a heavy weight hardly listen to what mr downing be say mr downing be talk rapidly to the headmaster who be nod from time to time mike take advantage of a pause to get up may i go sir he say certainly jackson certainly say the head oh and er -- if you be go back to you house tell smith that i should like to see he yes sir he have reach the door when again there be a knock come in say the headmaster it be adair yes adair adair be breathe rather heavily as if he have be run it be about sammy -- sampson sir he say look at mr downing ah we know well adair what do you wish to say it be not jackson who do it sir no no adair so mr downing -- it be dunster sir terrific sensation the headmaster give a sort of strangle yelp of astonishment mr down leap in he chair mike 's eye open to they fullest extent adair there be almost a wail in the headmaster 's voice the situation have suddenly become too much for he he brain be swim that mike despite the evidence against he should be innocent be curious perhaps but not particularly startling but that adair should inform he two minute after mr downing 's announcement of psmith 's confession that psmith too be guiltless and that the real criminal be dunster -- it be this that make he feel that somebody in the word of a american author have play a mean trick on he and substitute for he brain a side order of cauliflower why dunster of all people dunster who he remember dizzily have leave the school at christmas and why if dunster have really paint the dog have psmith assert that he himself be the culprit why -- why anything he concentrate he mind on adair as the only person who could save he from impend brain fever adair yes sir what -- _ what _ do you mean it _ be _ dunster sir i get a letter from he only five minute ago in which he say that he have paint sammy -- sampson the dog sir for a rag -- for a joke and that as he do not want anyone here to get into a row -- be punish for it i would better tell mr downing at once i try to find mr downing but he be not in the house then i meet smith outside the house and he tell I that mr downing have go over to see you sir smith tell you say mr down yes sir do you say anything to he about you have receive this letter from dunster i give he the letter to read sir and what be he attitude when he have read it he laugh sir _ laugh _ mr downing 's voice be thunderous yes sir he roll about mr downing snort but adair say the headmaster i do not understand how this thing could have be do by dunster he have leave the school he be down here for the old sedleighan ' match sir he stop the night in the village and that be the night the -- it happen yes sir i see well i be glad to find that the blame can not be attach to any boy in the school i be sorry that it be even a old boy it be a foolish discreditable thing to have do but it be not as bad as if any boy still at the school have break out of he house at night to do it the sergeant say mr downing tell I that the boy he see be attempt to enter mr outwood 's house another freak of dunster 's i suppose say the headmaster i shall write to he if it be really dunster who paint my dog say mr downing i can not understand the part play by smith in this affair if he do not do it what possible motive could he have have for come to I of he own accord and deliberately confess to be sure say the headmaster press a bell it be certainly a thing that call for explanation barlow he say as the butler appear kindly go across to mr outwood 's house and inform smith that i should like to see he if you please sir mr smith be wait in the hall in the hall yes sir he arrive soon after mr adair sir say that he would wait as you would probably wish to see he shortly h be ask he to step up barlow yes sir there follow one of the tensest stage wait of mike 's experience it be not long but while it last the silence be quite solid nobody seem to have anything to say and there be not even a clock in the room to break the stillness with its tick a very faint drip-drip of rain could be hear outside the window presently there be a sound of footstep on the stair the door be open mr smith sir the old etonian enter as would the guest of the evening who be a few moment late for dinner he be cheerful but slightly deprecate he give the impression of one who though sure of he welcome feel that some slight apology be expect from he he advance into the room with a gentle half-smile which suggest good will to all man it be still rain he observe you wish to see I sir sit down smith thank you sir he drop into a deep armchair -lrb- which both adair and mike have avoid in favor of less luxurious seat -rrb- with the confidential cosiness of a fashionable physician call on a patient between whom and himself time have break down the barrier of restraint and formality mr down burst out like a reservoir that have break its bank smith psmith turn he gaze politely in the housemaster 's direction smith you come to I a quarter of a hour ago and tell I that it be you who have paint my dog sampson yes sir it be absolutely untrue i be afraid so sir but smith begin the headmaster psmith bent forward encouragingly this be a most extraordinary affair have you no explanation to offer what induce you to do such a thing psmith sigh softly the craze of notoriety sir he reply sadly the curse of the present age what reply the headmaster it be remarkable proceed psmith placidly with the impersonal touch of one lecture on generality how frequently when a murder have be commit one find man confess that they have do it when it be out of the question that they should have commit it it be one of the most interesting problem with which anthropologist be confront human nature -- the headmaster interrupted smith he say i should like to see you alone for a moment mr downing might i trouble adair jackson he make a motion toward the door when he and psmith be alone there be silence psmith lean back comfortably in he chair the headmaster tap nervously with he foot on the floor er smith sir the headmaster seem to have some difficulty in proceed he pause again then he go on er smith i do not for a moment wish to pain you but have you er do you remember ever have have as a child let we say any er severe illness any er _ mental _ illness no sir there be no -- forgive I if i be touch on a sad subject -- there be no none of you near relative have ever suffer in the way i er have describe there be not a lunatic on the list sir say psmith cheerfully of course smith of course say the headmaster hurriedly i do not mean to suggest -- quite so quite so you think then that you confess to a act which you have not commit purely from some sudden impulse which you can not explain strictly between ourselves sir privately the headmaster find psmith 's man-to-man attitude somewhat disconcerting but he say nothing well smith i should not like it to go any further sir i will certainly respect any confidence i do not want anybody to know sir this be strictly between ourselves i think you be sometimes apt to forget smith the proper relation exist between boy and -- well never mind that for the present we can return to it later for the moment let I hear what you wish to say i shall of course tell nobody if you do not wish it well it be like this sir say psmith jackson happen to tell I that you and mr downing seem to think he have paint mr downing 's dog and there seem some danger of he be expel so i think it would not be a unsound scheme if i be to go and say i have do it that be the whole thing of course dunster write create a certain amount of confusion there be a pause it be a very wrong thing to do smith say the headmaster at last but you be a curious boy smith good night he hold out he hand good night sir say psmith not a bad old sort say psmith meditatively to himself as he walk downstairs by no mean a bad old sort i must drop in from time to time and cultivate he mike and adair be wait for he outside the front door well say mike you _ be _ the limit say adair what be he do nothing we have a very pleasant chat and then i tear myself away do you mean to say he be not go to do a thing not a thing well you be a marvel say adair psmith thank he courteously they walk on toward the house by the way adair say mike as the latter start to turn in at downing 's i 'll write to strachan tonight about that match what be that ask psmith jackson 's go to try and get wrykyn to give we a game say adair they have get a vacant date i hope the dickens they 'll do it oh i should think they be certain to say mike good night and give comrade downing when you see he say psmith my very best love it be man like he who make this merrie england of ours what it be \* \* \* \* \* i say psmith say mike suddenly what really make you tell down you would do it the craving for -- oh chuck it you be not talk to the old man now i believe it be simply to get I out of a jolly tight corner psmith 's expression be one of pain my dear comrade jackson say he you wrong I you make I writhe i be surprised at you i never think to hear those word from michael jackson well i believe you do all the same say mike obstinately and it be jolly good of you too psmith moan 30 sedleigh v wrykyn the wrykyn match be three part over and thing be go badly for sedleigh in a way one might have say that the game be over and that sedleigh have lose for it be a one-day match and wrykyn who have lead on the first inning have only to play out time to make the game theirs sedleigh be pay the penalty for allow themselves to be influence by nerve in the early part of the day nerve lose more school match than good play ever win there be a certain type of school batsman who be a gift to any bowler when he once let he imagination run away with he sedleigh with the exception of adair psmith and mike have enter upon this match in a state of the most azure funk ever since mike have receive strachan 's answer and adair have announce on the notice board that on Saturday July the twentieth sedleigh would play wrykyn the team have be all on the jump it be useless for adair to tell they as he do repeatedly on mike 's authority that wrykyn be weak this season and that on they present form sedleigh ought to win easily the team listen but be not comfort wrykyn might be below they usual strength but then wrykyn cricket as a rule reach such a high standard that this probably mean little however weak wrykyn might be -- for they -- there be a very firm impression among the member of the sedleigh first eleven that the other school be quite strong enough to knock the cover off _ they _ experience count enormously in school match sedleigh have never be prove the team they play be the sort of side which the wrykyn second eleven would play whereas wrykyn from time immemorial have be beat ripton team and free forester team and mcc team pack with county man and send man to oxford and cambridge who get they blues as freshman sedleigh have go onto the field that morning a depressed side it be unfortunate that adair have win the toss he have have no choice but to take first inning the weather have be bad for the last week and the wicket be slow and treacherous it be likely to get worse during the day so adair have choose to bat first take into consideration the state of nerve the team be in this in itself be a calamity a school eleven be always at they worst and nerviest before lunch even on they own ground they find the surroundings lonely and unfamiliar the subtlety of the bowler become magnify unless the first pair make a really good start a collapse almost invariably ensue today the start have be gruesome beyond word mike the bulwark of the side the man who have be bring up on wrykyn bowling and from whom whatever might happen to the other at least a fifty be expect -- mike go in first with barne and take first over have play inside one from bruce the wrykyn slow bowler and have be catch at short slip off he second ball that put the finish touch on the panic stone robinson and the other all quite decent punish batsman when they nerve allow they to play they own game crawl to the wicket decline to hit out at anything and be clean bowl several of they play back to half volley adair do not suffer from panic but he batting be not equal to he bowling and he have fall after hit one four seven wicket be down for thirty when psmith go in psmith have always disclaim any pretension to batting skill but he be undoubtedly the right man for a crisis like this he have a enormous reach and he use it three consecutive ball from bruce he turn into full toss and sweep to the leg boundary and assist by barne who have be sit on the splice in he usual manner he raise the total to seventy-one before be york with he score at thirty-five ten minute later the inning be over with barne not out sixteen for seventy-nine wrykyn have then go in lose strachan for twenty before lunch and finally complete they inning at a quarter to four for a hundred and thirty-one this be better than sedleigh have expect at least eight of the team have look forward dismally to a afternoon 's leather hunting but adair and psmith help by the wicket have never be easy especially psmith who have take six wicket he slow play havoc with the tail it would be too much to say that sedleigh have any hope of pull the game out of the fire but it be a comfort they feel at any rate have another knock as be usual at this stage of a match they nervousness have vanish and they feel capable of better thing than in the first inning it be on mike 's suggestion that psmith and he go in first mike know the limitation of the wrykyn bowling and he be convince that if they could knock bruce off it might be possible to rattle up a score sufficient to give they the game always provide wrykyn collapse in the second inning and it seem to mike that the wicket would be so bad then that they easily might so he and psmith have go in at four o'clock to hit and they have hit the deficit have be wipe off all but a dozen run when psmith be bowl and by that time mike be set and in he best vein he treat all the bowler alike and when stone come in restore to he proper frame of mind and lash out stoutly and after he robinson and the rest it look as if sedleigh have a chance again the score be a hundred and twenty when mike who have just reach he fifty ski one to strachan at cover the time be twenty-five past five as mike reach the pavilion adair declare the inning close wrykyn start batting at twenty-five minute to six with sixty-nine to make if they wish to make they and a hour and ten minute during which to keep up they wicket if they prefer to take thing easy and go for a win on the first inning at first it look as if they mean to knock off the run for strachan force the game from the first ball which be psmith 's and which he hit into the pavilion but at fifteen adair bowl he and when two run later psmith get the next man stump and finish up he over with a c-and-b wrykyn decide that it be not good enough seventeen for three with a hour all but five minute to go be get too dangerous so drummond and rigby the next pair proceed to play with caution and the collapse cease this be the state of the game at the point at which this chapter open seventeen for three have become twenty-four for three and the hand of the clock stand at ten minute past six change of bowling have be try but there seem no chance of get past the batsman 's defense they be play all the good ball and refuse to hit at the bad a quarter past six strike and then psmith make a suggestion which alter the game completely why do not you have a shot this end he say to adair as they be cross over there be a spot on the off which might help you a lot you can break like blaze if only you land on it it do not help my leg break a bit because they will not hit at they barne be on the point of begin to bowl when adair take the ball from he the captain of outwood 's retire to short leg with a air that suggest that he be glad to be relieve of he prominent post the next moment drummond 's off stump be lie at a angle of forty-five adair be absolutely accurate as a bowler and he have drop he first ball right on the worn patch two minute later drummond 's successor be retire to the pavilion while the wicket keeper straighten the stump again there be nothing like a couple of unexpected wicket for alter the atmosphere of a game five minute before sedleigh have be lethargic and without hope now there be a stir and buzz all around the ground there be twenty-five minute to go and five wicket be down sedleigh be on top again the next man seem to take a age come out as a matter of fact he walk more rapidly than a batsman usually walk to the crease adair 's third ball drop just short of the spot the batsman hit out be a shade too soon the ball hum through the air a couple of foot from the ground in the direction of mid off and mike diving to the right get to it as he be fall and chuck it up after that the thing be a walk over psmith clean bowl a man in he next over : and the tail demoralize by the sudden change in the game collapse uncompromisingly sedleigh win by thirty-five run with eight minute in hand \* \* \* \* \* psmith and mike sit in they study after lockup discuss thing in general and the game in particular i feel like a beastly renegade playing against wrykyn say mike still i be glad we win adair 's a jolly good sort and it 'll make he happy for week when i last see comrade adair say psmith he be go about in a sort of trance beam vaguely and want to stand people thing at the shop he bowl awfully well yes say psmith i say i do not wish to cast a gloom over this joyful occasion in any way but you say wrykyn be go to give sedleigh a fixture again next year well well have you think of the massacre which will ensue you will have leave adair will have leave incidentally i shall have leave wrykyn will swamp they i suppose they will still the great thing you see be to get the thing start that be what adair be so keen on now sedleigh have beat wrykyn he be satisfied they can get fixture with decent club and work up to play the big school you have get to start somehow so it be all right you see and besides say psmith reflectively in a emergency they can always get comrade down to bowl for they what let we now sally out and see if we can not promote a rag of some sort in this abode of wrath comrade outwood have go over to dinner at the school house and it would be a pity to waste a somewhat golden opportunity shall we stagger they stagger end of the project gutenberg ebook of mike and psmith by p g wodehouse
